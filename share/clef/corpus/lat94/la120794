 PICK PALMDALE: Forget Beverly Hills. If you're going to settle down in the L. 
A. area, Palmdale may be one of the best places.According to PHH Technology 
Services, a Kansas firm specializing in corporate relocation, Palmdale placed 
third out of 156 cities. . . . PHH ranked communities using housing, crime and 
tax rates. Pomona ranked first. 
</P>
<P>
 DANCERS: Diversity may be a dandy idea at CalArts in Valencia . . . but not 
when it turns into tokenism. Cristyne Lawson, dean of the dance school, says 
choosing dancers by their ethnic background is limiting. . . . Lawson's group, 
the CalArts Dance Ensemble, will perform Thursday through Saturday as part of 
the institution's 25th anniversary celebration (F1). 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHS AND LOWS: Many say one town in the Valley is like the next. Many are 
wrong. The Valley, in fact, is a very diverse place, from housing prices to 
crime rates. Today's Valley Briefing (B5) lists a number of highs and lows in 
the Valley. . . . Household density, for instance, varies greatly, above. 
</P>
<P>
 PRUNED: Department of Agriculture office cuts (A33) may lead to consolidations 
in Lancaster. The USDA's two offices there -- the Farm Service Agency and the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service -- could be placed in the same building, 
says the FSA's Marilynn Wells. . . . But she wants growers to know that "we are 
still open and available to them." Highs and Lows

 SLOW AND STEADY: Ventura County has long prided itself on its conservative 
investment approach -- far different, officials say, from the speculative 
strategy that has landed Orange County in deep trouble (B1). . . . An 
independent survey earlier this year ranked Ventura County first in financial 
standing among the state's 14 biggest counties. . . . Then again, such surveys 
are often shortsighted and far from being infallible. Just a few short months 
ago, at least one financial service firm reported that Orange County was in 
very good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 QUICK STUDY: After only one day on the job, the future's looking good for 
state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). . . . Sworn in Monday, O'Connell is 
the new vice chairman of the Democratic caucus and chairman of the Senate 
Toxics and Public Safety Management Committee. . . . He might even pick up the 
baton from retired state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). O'Connell, a 
history teacher like Hart, has asked for a seat on the Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 SCARE TACTICS: It's one tour that isn't plagued by long lines of people 
waiting to get in. . . . But for troubled Ventura County students, just being 
at the California Youth Authority in Camarillo -- and seeing inmates their own 
ages -- is often enough to set them on a straight-and-narrow path (B1). . . . 
About 3,000 students have taken the grand tour of the 54-acre compound -- 
surrounded by a fence topped with barbed wire. Some say it's enough to scare 
them into staying in school and away from gangs. . . . Officials say such tough 
tactics are useful in getting young people to see the light. . . . "If we can 
at least reach one, we're looking good," CYA official Eddie Cue said. 
</P>
<P>
 MOMENT OF SILENCE: Prayer is a vital part of the day for thousands of students 
in Ventura County and across the country (E1). . . . While religious clubs on 
school campuses have been a tradition for years, participation in such groups 
is more popular than ever, some officials say. . . . "It's just a reflection of 
our life," said Norman Walker, a minister who was recently elected to Simi 
Valley's school board. As a student in the 1960s, Walker said he was a member 
of such clubs. "Americans are a religious group of people," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 3 
AFTERSHOCKS OF JAN. 17 QUAKE RATTLE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three aftershocks of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake bumped and rolled 
through the San Fernando Valley within minutes of each other Monday night, 
sending out shock waves felt throughout the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The first quake, a magnitude 3.5, was centered three miles east northeast of 
San Fernando at 7:36 p.m., said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, magnitude 3, struck the same area at 7:48 p.m., followed by a 
magnitude 4.5 seconds later, centered three miles east of San Fernando, Hutton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblors occurred "in a very active part of the Northridge aftershock 
zone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton characterized the temblors as a "sequence within a sequence," meaning 
that while all of them were aftershocks of the Northridge quake, the smaller 
quakes Monday night were "foreshocks," a prelude to the third and biggest one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we have a quake in Southern California, there is a 5% chance that it 
will be followed by a bigger quake," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been a "fairly steady decline" in frequency of aftershocks 
since the initial series ended in January, such aftershocks could continue for 
at least two years, she said. Monday's was the 57th aftershock of magnitude 4 
or greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The quakes were felt from the Santa Clarita Valley to Venice and into 
southeastern Los Angeles County. They also were felt as far west as Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest quake emptied the 600-seat theater of the Television Academy of 
Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood, where several hundred people rushed out 
of a special Disney anniversary screening, said Jerry Ough, who was in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theater patrons returned a few minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reported the strongest quake as sharp; others said it had a rolling, wavy 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma-Ruth Nehus of Granada Hills, a few miles from the epicenter, said the 
second aftershock felt much larger than the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My chandelier was swinging at least eight inches," Nehus said. "We had 
$100,000 worth of damage from the earthquake (last January). I'm 70 years old, 
and I don't want to spend the rest of my life rebuilding the house. . . . "

IS EVERYONE HAVING FUN?; BROWN, HANGING ON, OUTSMARTS EVERYONE, BUT SACRAMENTO 
ONLY OUTSMARTS ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not over till it's over, not in football and not in the California 
Assembly. Assemblyman Willie Brown is the ultimate counterargument to anyone 
who thinks politics is dull. Already he's survived far longer than anyone ever 
thought he would when he won the Assembly Speaker post in 1980. And Monday he 
got some some surprise help -- a surprise to everyone but Brown -- when onetime 
Republican now independent Assemblyman Paul Horcher voted to keep him as 
Assembly Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown well may survive the November electoral swing to the right and remain 
Speaker -- though he might have to cut a power-sharing deal with his rival for 
the job, GOP Assemblyman Jim Brulte. As much fun as political junkies are 
having watching the peerless Brown outthink and outmaneuver everyone, it's time 
to get down to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Little can get done in the California Assembly while Democrats and Republicans 
fight over the top job. The current stalemate over who will be the next Speaker 
creates a gridlock that could hold up the timely running of government. That's 
not why voters send representatives to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage the bipartisanship needed to govern smoothly, a deal will have to 
be made to share power. Democrats dominate the Assembly's staff and its budget; 
there are 600 Democratic staffers with a budget of $20 million versus 250 
Republican staffers with a budget of $7 million. The near-even split of 
Democratic and Republican votes mandates a new arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation may be too much to hope for in Sacramento, but a stalemate won't 
wash with voters who will tire easily of political games. Assembly Republicans 
Tuesday hid out for a while, trying to deny Brown the quorum he needs to 
proceed. Democrats used a similar strategy in Washington more than a century 
ago, according to the late historian Barbara Tuchman. House rules allowed 
members to thwart a quorum by demanding a roll call and then refusing to 
answer. Their silence stilled debate until powerful Republican Speaker Thomas 
Reed ruled them all present. To deny him a quorum, the Democrats slipped out of 
the room, before eventually the doors were locked. The Democrats who remained 
inside hid under desks and behind doors until a couple of Democrats could be 
brought in on sickbeds and a third just happened to show up to make a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republicans announced Tuesday that they would not return until Jan. 
4; Brown and Brulte are likely to meet before then. They should make it sooner 
rather than later. Prolonged paralysis would only make voters more cynical and 
hurt state government.

QUESTION FACING NATO'S EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO was born in the crisis atmosphere of post-World War II Soviet subversion 
and expansionism in Europe and held together for more than four decades by the 
fear of Soviet military aggression. But with the Cold War over, the Soviet 
Union dissolved and a supposed era of cooperation and partnership now dawning 
over the continent, reasonable questions are being raised about NATO's 
continued relevance and future. They deserve careful and credible responses. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's 16 members, led by the United States, insist that they intend to 
maintain the organization. What they seem to have trouble agreeing on -- 
indeed, what they have hardly bothered even to address -- is why. Certainly 
sharp policy differences growing out of the Bosnia debacle point to the urgent 
need for a fundamental rethinking of NATO's purposes, and to the need for 
redefining where and how it should be ready to use military force. Certainly, 
too, the yearlong study that has just been ordered by NATO to set criteria for 
expanding its membership ought to deal not only with the mechanics of 
enlargement. It ought to explain as well why NATO believes it should undertake 
new security commitments in the absence of any clear cross-border threat to 
European security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary all are eager to join NATO. Their 
reasons are obvious. All spent more than 40 years under Moscow's control. All 
at one time or another rebelled against Communist rule and saw thousands suffer 
in consequence. All, Poland especially, which was partitioned by Russia four 
times over two centuries, have understandable historical reasons to fear for 
their future independence. All want the collective security NATO offers. 
</P>
<P>
 But what can't be overlooked or dismissed as empty rhetoric is the unease 
among Russia's leadership that NATO's potential eastward expansion produces, 
and the wrath among Russian ultranationalists that it provokes. If the Cold War 
is over and Russia is no longer the enemy, Russia's top leaders ask, why 
enlarge NATO and so move its eastern boundary closer to the borders of the 
former Soviet Union? The unspoken answer is that Russia's experiment with 
democracy may give way at almost any time to a revived authoritarianism with 
imperial ambitions; in light of this, now well may be the best time to bring 
key and potentially endangered eastern European states under NATO's protection. 
President Boris N. Yeltsin professes to be insulted by such an assessment. He 
accuses NATO, with America in the lead, of seeking to redivide Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course that's not Washington's -- or NATO's -- intention. But at this point 
it's easier to infer what NATO doesn't want than what it does. A compelling 
case for enlargement as something that serves the overall security interests of 
Europe -- and of the United States -- has not yet been made. Without it, it's 
likely that the doubts about NATO's purposes and its future will only grow.

DISHONESTY IN SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial, "Science Must Police Its Ranks" (Nov. 30), contains several 
factual and conceptual errors that should not pass uncorrected. 
</P>
<P>
 First, regarding the Thereza Imanishi-Kari case, Nobelist David Baltimore did 
not indulge in "a questionable practice that is too common, his name was put on 
the paper even though he had nothing directly to do with the study." In fact, 
the publication in Cell in 1986 was a product of a collaboration between the 
laboratories of Baltimore and Imanishi-Kari, and much of the data in the paper 
were generated in Baltimore's laboratory, not in Imanishi-Kari's. Those data 
have not been challenged. Baltimore established a collaboration between his 
laboratory and one with a complementary area of expertise, a practice that is 
virtually universal in biological science and has much to do with our current 
progress in that discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it is a matter of judgment whether Baltimore "resisted making a 
correction" or whether he simply implemented the rule that lies at the basis of 
our legal system: innocent until proven guilty. The scientific community was 
alerted to the allegations and problems with Imanishi-Kari's contribution to 
their joint publication in a timely and responsible fashion (in 1988, 1989 and 
1991; all in letters to the editor of Cell). Your assertion that Baltimore 
indulged in "questionable" practices is simply false. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the expenditure of significant sums of money by Congress on the 
Commission on Research Integrity is assuredly a waste of taxpayers' money. 
Science has a self-correcting mechanism: Any experiment of even the slightest 
interest is likely to be repeated in several other laboratories. There is no 
scientific cartel seeking to disguise falsehood and fraud; it is the nature of 
science itself to expose errors. Published experiments that do not replicate 
usually turn out to be the result of an honest mistake, or slight (but 
significant) differences in the conditions used by different investigators. 
Pick up issues of Science, Nature or other scientific journals, and you will 
see an extensive and healthy correspondence about experiments, their 
interpretation and reproducibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Political hay surrounds the premise -- which will be proven false -- that 
scientific fraud is more than a rare anomaly, that scientists are not to be 
trusted, and therefore that any scientific result can be challenged. The goal 
of those who promote this premise is often painfully obvious. Maybe it is time 
to give scientists a break and to recognize that as a group they have high 
standards of honesty, possibly higher than their accusers.

GOP TAKEOVER OF CONGRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Let's Look at the Real Newt Gingrich," Column Left, Nov. 27: 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scheer's column ignores a very important point. The recent election was 
not about people and personalities, it was about issues and ideas. The 
Republicans won because they promised to enforce the laws, create a more 
cost-effective government and reduce the interference of the federal government 
in the lives of people. The Republicans did not win by focusing on the 
extramarital and financial affairs of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is still a country of independent, self-reliant individuals 
who provide leadership in all walks of life at all levels of society. If the 
leaders in the more visible positions of government prove to lack the integrity 
to do what they have promised to do, in due time they will be replaced. 
</P>

 * Paige Gold's insightful column ("Today's GOP Isn't Looking So Grand to Its 
Women," Commentary, Nov. 25) speaks for millions of mainstream Republicans, 
former Republicans, and would-be/should-be Republicans, especially women, who 
have been ignored and abandoned by party leaders eager to please the radical 
religious right. This Trojan horse, as she so accurately terms these Republican 
Party newcomers, had already been welcomed into the party by leaders who have 
displayed a disturbing tendency to support the right's efforts to mix religion 
and politics with issues such as organized classroom prayer and stringent 
anti-abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
 November's election was a referendum on the size and role of government, and 
not on a particular narrow social agenda. Mainstream Americans, especially 
including women, and basic Republican tenets, such as individual liberty and 
personal freedom, must not be written off for short-term, politically expedient 
purposes if the Republican Party wishes to maintain electoral control for more 
than just the next two years.

 * If taken as directed, Guy Molyneux's prescription for the Democrats 
("12-Step Program for Recovering Democrats," Opinion, Dec. 4) should prove more 
tranquilizer than tonic. Democratic blindness to governmental voraciousness and 
self-interest lost them the recent elections, not badly run campaigns, as he 
imputes.  
</P>
<P>
 If Newt Gingrich talks about orphanages, what better policy initiatives have 
the Democrats to offer that aren't more of the same expensive, broken, 
big-government solutions? While they bash lower capital gains taxes as 
"coddling the rich," don't high capital gains taxes hurt pensioners too? Don't 
paranoiac wetlands regulations excessively burden not only business but small 
landowners? Democrats, cut off from the world outside the beltway, have no way 
of knowing. Molyneux is himself in denial.

 * I suppose Gingrich thinks he's taking a bold stance by recommending 
"toleration" of gays and lesbians to his conservative colleagues (Nov. 24). His 
words, however, demonstrate the roots of the radical right's obsession with gay 
and lesbian people: fear and ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 While "toleration" is certainly better than the annihilation preached by 
Gingrich's party at the 1992 Republican National Convention, it fails to live 
up to the promise of democracy. "Toleration" is no more acceptable to those 
with another sexual orientation than it is to those with another skin color or 
another nationality. If Gingrich merely "tolerates" his lesbian sister, then 
perhaps he needs some lessons on what family values really mean. 
</P>
<P>
 His comparison of homosexuality, an innate orientation, to the disease of 
alcoholism and his belief that gay and lesbian people "practice" homosexuality 
further indicate his complete ignorance of who gay and lesbian people are. 
Until equal rights are granted to all, we will be there to educate Gingrich and 
his colleagues on who we really are.

<P>
 As a Republican, I would like to express my disappointment with Gingrich. 
Gingrich should learn to think before he speaks and before he acts. The 
Republicans have an opportunity for the first time in 40 years to really make a 
difference. With carefully chosen words and actions the Republican Party can 
once again rise to the current challenges facing our great nation. If the party 
is smart, leaders must be thinking about bringing the party back to the center 
so as to pull in the "Reagan Democrats" that the party needs to win the 
upcoming presidential election. However, with big-mouth, non-thinking 
leadership in Congress it could severely undermine the agenda of the Republican 
Party.

METRIC SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our students deserve our elected officials' support of the metric system. U.S. 
students and eventually everyone will be better off as a result of the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Education in this country seems to be continually under fire for a variety of 
reasons.One such reason is the degree of technical literacy achieved by most of 
our students compared with students of other countries. Currently U.S. students 
spend time learning "scientific" units, such as the meter, liter, kilogram and 
degrees Celsius. (If it is of any comfort, U.S. students are not entirely alone 
with this burden. However, the only other students having to learn these units 
as an additional and separate hurdle are from Burma, South Yemen and Tonga. 
Everyone else is on the metric system.) 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. federal agencies (as of Nov. 30, 1992) are using the metric system. The 
metric system is easy to use because it is based on multiples of 10. For 
example, our distance units include miles, yards, feet, inches and various 
fractions of inches, but the metric system uses the meter and its multiples, 
e.g., the kilometer, centimeter and millimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 If you care about American students scientific literacy, then please support 
the switch by asking your officials to support it.

MALPRACTICE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John H. Sullivan of the Assn. for California Tort Reform, an insurance 
industry trade group, attempts to give the credit for lower medical malpractice 
premiums to a 1975 law which limits compensation to victims (letter, Dec. 1). 
He claims that the average annual premium in California in 1991 dropped 61% 
from 1976, while insinuating that rates elsewhere have skyrocketed, by picking 
out two states where premiums happen to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after the enactment of the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, 
malpractice rates rose 191% through 1988. It was only after the passage of 
Proposition 103, the insurance reform measure passed in 1988 and vigorously 
opposed by the insurance industry, that rates began to drop, 20% from 1988 to 
1991.  
</P>
<P>
 The disparity Sullivan claims in malpractice premiums between California and 
other states on average doesn't exist. The average physician nationally in 1990 
paid less than $600 more for malpractice coverage than California doctors, a 
difference of less than 8%. In 1991, the cost of medical malpractice premiums 
per capita in the U.S. and California was $19.28 and $17.26, respectively. What 
does this difference translate to in costs passed on to health care consumers? 
Medical malpractice victims have had their rights limited for about the cost of 
a cup of coffee and a Sunday edition of The Times.

LATINS ARE READY FOR TRUE PARTNERSHIP; SUMMIT: WITH DEMOCRACY TAKING HOLD, 
HEADS OF STATE ARE EAGER TO STRIKE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AGREEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERT ROSENTHAL, Gert Rosenthal, a Guatemalan economist, is executive 
secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in almost 30 years, and at the behest of President Clinton, 
Latin American and Caribbean heads of state (except Fidel Castro of Cuba) will 
meet this weekend in Miami with their North American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Inter-American relations have undergone a sea change in these three decades, 
especially in the post-Cold War years. Thirty years ago, security 
considerations prevailed in the way the United States interacted with its 
southern neighbors. Today, economic considerations top the list. Thirty years 
ago, a highly asymmetrical relationship existed between the United States and 
each Latin American country, punctuated, on the part of the latter, by 
resentments, suspicions and even a measure of animosity. Today, the dialogue is 
more relaxed, mature and balanced. The enhanced presence of Canada in 
hemispheric affairs has also helped to mitigate many confrontational remnants 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Change within Latin America has kept pace with the astounding transformations 
in the world economy and in international relations. Domestic insurrectional 
movements are giving way to consensus-building, and where authoritarian 
military regimes once prevailed, today a democratic culture is gradually taking 
root; virtually all heads of state are civilians, democratically elected.  
</P>
<P>
 The population of the region has grown from under 220 million in 1960 to 480 
million today, although current rates of population growth are declining 
rapidly. Latin Americans are better educated (literacy is up from 66% to 89%; 
middle-school attendance increased from 15% to 56% and university attendance 
increased twelvefold), healthier (life expectancy is up from 56 to 69 years) 
and more urbanized (from less than 50% to more than 70%). And real per-capita 
gross domestic product increased from the U.S. equivalent of $1,200 to $2,100 
(in 1980 prices) in spite of the prolonged and deep recession of the 1980s -- a 
lost decade in terms of growth -- while imports increased from $10 billion to 
$190 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 The content and scope of public policy have also changed markedly. Import 
substitution has given way to international competitiveness; populist 
experiments have been replaced by fiscal and monetary prudence; many public 
enterprises have been privatized, and macroeconomic policy-making has gained in 
coherence and stability. As a result, inflation is down, growth is up and 
exports are increasingly diversified. Intraregional trade grows at spectacular 
rates: In 1993, more than a fifth of total exports were within the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of preferential, non-reciprocal treatment in trade between the 
United States and developing countries of the region is gradually giving way to 
preferential but reciprocal arrangements; these offer more stability in the 
long run than unilateral concessions, which can be withdrawn as easily as they 
are bestowed. In this respect, the North American Free Trade Agreement between 
Canada, Mexico and the United States, open to extension to other countries of 
the region, is a pioneering innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, many problems remain. With important differences between 
countries, marked contrasts exist between world-class opulence and lacerating 
privation. Unemployment and poverty are widespread. Human rights are still 
violated in some countries. Many institutions, including judicial systems and 
political parties, tend to be weak. Public administrations remain debilitated 
by the financial crunch of the 1980s. Investment ratios are insufficient to 
boost growth rates to truly satisfactory levels. Environmental degradation is 
affecting the region's natural capital endowment and urban sprawl adversely 
affects the quality of life of millions. Physical infrastructure is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 These problems have national, regional and international implications. They 
also affect hemispheric relations in such vital areas as trade and financial 
flows, migration (legal and illegal), the exchange of technologies and the 
illicit traffic in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The heads of state meeting in Miami will have a chance to put inter-American 
relations on a new footing. In this spirit of more balanced and mature 
relations, Latin American and Caribbean leaders will arrive, not with a list of 
petitions, but rather with an agenda of mutually beneficial proposals for 
tapping the enormous potential of working together to seize joint opportunities 
and to solve common problems. Moreover, strengthening links between the 
countries of this hemisphere is not a zero-sum proposition that will somehow 
weaken the ties between those countries and the rest of the world. On the 
contrary, it should be viewed as a steppingstone toward a more open and 
integrated international economy.

PERSPECTIVE ON BOSNIA; HAVE WE FORGOTTEN THE LESSON OF GUERNICA?; ONCE BEFORE, 
THE WEST WATCHED A TOWN LIKE BIHAC BEING DESTROYED, WITHOUT CHALLENGING 
FASCISM'S SPREAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEMAL KURSPAHIC, Kemal Kurspahic was editor in chief of the Bosnian daily 
Oslobodjenje for the first two years of the siege of Sarajevo. He is now a 
Nieman fellow at Harvard. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the so-called international community decided to capitulate and abandon 
the U.N.-proclaimed "safe zone" of Bihac to the Serbs' brutal onslaught, there 
is more interest in the press for the unity of the United Nations and NATO, 
which proved to be so impotent in Bosnia's case, than for the fate of 180,000 
civilians in that remote Bosnian town. But in those rare news stories about the 
continuing terror, one element didn't change. Almost seven days after the U.N. 
commander announced with certain relief that the "Serbs can take Bihac at their 
will," the Serbs occupied only 30% of the area and were still "a few hundred 
yards" away from the town's hospital, shelling patients. This means that the 
defenders of Bihac, armed just with light personal weapons against a huge 
military force -- tanks, cannons, rocket launchers, mortars and anti-aircraft 
guns -- managed to keep their lines much longer than did the international 
institutions that were supposed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is strong symbolism in that. The defense of Bihac is not just a fight 
for the survival of 180,000 desperate people "paralyzed by fear" and with no 
place to go. It is also the last line of defense of the most basic rules and 
principles on which the international new order was supposed to rest. It is 
also the testing ground of the forces of ultranationalism, racist "ethnic 
purity" and genocidal "ethnic cleansing" to check if there is anything to 
oppose their quests for greater states, starting with "greater Serbia." But 
they dream, like Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky, about the "orthodox empire from 
Vladivostok in Russia to Knin in Croatia." And then it won't be "just" Bosnia 
or Bihac but many other borders, states and towns that will be disputed, 
contested and targeted because they don't fit in the maps developed by 
Milosevic-Karadzic-Mladic-like conquerors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why in listening to the reports about Bihac I see Picasso's 
"Guernica." That painting depicted the town bombed and terrorized during the 
Spanish Civil War without anyone recognizing that it was fascism marching on 
its way to the most terrible crime in history. Marching unchallenged like the 
Serbian genocidal forces in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only shameful but also frightening for the future of the Balkans and 
the whole of Europe to see the institutions of the new world order powerless, 
humiliated and defeated in Bosnia and even conspiring to make the best out of 
that failure and, instead, producing face-losing formulas. There are more and 
more signs that the abandonment of the Bihac "safe zone" was a deliberate, 
calculated and coordinated decision to speed the "final solution" for Bosnia, 
to force it to surrender, and then to present its capitulation as the peace 
settlement and permanent cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But they miscalculated at one crucial point. Even under the blackmail of 
abandonment, Bosnians can't surrender because they have no place to go and they 
don't have the British and French colonial arrogance of proclaiming someone's 
country someone else's. They will fight for the survival of Bihac, for the 
survival of the country and for high principles, which were so easily 
sacrificed in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 With the experience of Bosnia, which was prevented by the arms embargo from 
protecting itself and was openly told that no one will protect even the "safe 
zones," it is cynical to discuss expansion of NATO or European security. What 
kind of all-European "partnership for peace" can these institutions guarantee 
to the newly born European democracies, when they proved to be so tragically 
impotent in protecting even a small Bosnian town? That's why Bihac might not be 
just an "episode that shouldn't affect the future of the alliance," as 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher put it in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Bihac is the symbolic beginning of the whole post-Cold War history, and now 
that all institutions of the collective security have failed so miserably, 
those who had any power to stop genocide in Bosnia must take care as to which 
side of that history they want to be recorded as being on: the side of marching 
ultranationalism and genocidal "ethnic cleansing," or the side of international 
law and order defended now only by the heroic defenders of Bihac?

WHAT'S IN A NAME?; A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME WOULD SMELL AS SWEET. BUT PERHAPS 
NAMING OUR DREAMS HELPS THEM TO COME TRUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYDIA A. NAYO, Lydia A. Nayo is an associate professor at Loyola Law School. 
Her last column was written while she awaited results of tests on whether she 
had ovarian cancer. The tests were negative. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was the first and now I am the last remaining Nayo. My daughter, who married 
July 1, is calling herself by her husband's name. 
</P>
<P>
 We used to constitute the entire Nayo clan, having adopted that name in the 
1970s, while living in San Francisco. It was an exploratory period for my 
generation. Women were taking their mothers' maiden names as family names; 
African Americans were assuming names that reflected their sense of what 
ancestors would have been named, but for slavery. Nayo has its origins in the 
Yoruba language of West Africa. It means "we have joy" or "we have happiness." 
We came by that name because I believed that instilling in my child a 
definitive sense of self was paramount -- after hugging. When she was 7, Kelley 
wondered why our last name was the same as that of her maternal grandparents. 
She pointed out that her cousins, my sister's children, had a different last 
name. Well, I told her, we aren't married to anyone, so we don't have somebody 
else's last name. Kelley suggested that we get married. I pointed out that 
marriage would mean she would have to share my attention and time. Never 
anybody's fool, Kelley came up with a solution: We could marry each other, 
bypass that sharing thing and thus acquire a married name. 
</P>
<P>
 Some days later, I was paging through a book of African names that a friend 
had used to name her son, my godson. I discovered "Ayo," a root meaning "joy" 
or "happiness," and all its permutations, including Nayo. I liked the fact that 
the name told Kelley something important about our lives. Whatever may be 
materially lacking, an important element of being a family exists in that name. 
The name could remind us, even at the worst moments, there had been happiness 
before and there could be joy thereafter.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not difficult, in 1975 in California, to change your name. As long as 
you were consistent and did not intend to defraud creditors, I was told, you 
could call yourself Minnie Mouse. Since my objective was to create a sense of 
belonging for a child I cherished, I told both my creditors, changed my 
driver's license and my daughter's school records, got new checks printed and 
went from Lydia Anne Fields to Lydia Anne Nayo. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming Nayo was more than shrugging off a "slave name." Taking a name felt 
more like assuming responsibility for my life. If I could choose a name, I 
could choose a path, a way to live that countered the negative expectations of 
those who saw, when they looked at us, an unwed mother and her 
doomed-to-failure child. Renaming ourselves was an act of affirmation. A kid 
could live up to a name that asserted that her life was a joyous possibility. 
People tend to greet us by our whole names, and I have always thought that 
there was a certain rhythm to a hearty "Hey, LydiaNayo!" It rings, I have been 
told. Lips often curve into a smile when saying it. I am often asked what Nayo 
means and how I came to have the name. I enjoy the telling. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, I am the last Nayo. As disappointed as I may sometimes be, I respect 
my daughter's decision. In Kelley's experience, naming is making family, and 
she is making family in her marriage. And while her inquiry 19 years ago was 
catalyst, I changed our name for me as well. I am a member of a generation that 
believed that by taking names that expressed our sense of ourselves or our 
aspirations, we assumed a measure of personal power. Some of our children 
retained the vestiges of the times in the names we put on their birth 
certificates. My godson, a child of the '70s, became Adikah Cojoe, which means 
"first child of a second husband, born on a Monday." He is a visual artist. 
Could that career choice have something to do with knowing exactly who he is? 
</P>
<P>
 Having been this self for nearly 20 years, I am no more Fields than I am white 
or male. Besides, who knows where Fields came from and what weight it imposed 
upon the ancestors who carried it? Nor will I hyphenate or take my husband's 
last name after all this time. I was pleased to hear him say, early in our 
marriage, that if the choice were having me in his life calling myself Nayo or 
not having me in his life, there was no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 I have not met another person with the surname Nayo. Not in San Francisco or 
Oakland or during law school in Washington or in practice in Baltimore or Los 
Angeles. I check phone books for fellow travelers; I like to imagine that there 
is a clan of Nayos, choosers of a name with positive meaning. I will stay Nayo, 
so that clan members will recognize me.

THEATER REVIEW; 'GOD' NO FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearly playwright Don L. Freeman doesn't want to hide his intentions in "God 
and Other Terrorists," at the Laguna Festival of the Arts Forum Theatre through 
Dec. 17. When you name your central character Emmet Surrey Force, you are 
putting something more than a character on stage: You're creating a presence as 
much as a person. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is all to the good: The best characters are presences who resonate. But 
neither Freeman, actor Julius Noflin as Force nor director Sunil Swaroop does 
what he must in the first full production by the Theatre Group. 
</P>
<P>
 We are set up to encounter one of the world's literary superstars and 
superegos -- a James Baldwin, Gore Vidal and Truman Capote wrapped into one 
awesome package. Adding a curveball to cultural presumptions: He is black. 
Adding tension: He is entering an AIDS hospice to finish his play before he 
dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Force is a man who should be raging, raging, against the dying of the light. 
In Noflin's hands, Force simply is not a force, but a mildly peeved fellow with 
a foul tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Freeman, Force also is not a unique dramatic creation. "The 
Destiny of Me," Larry Kramer's fine follow-up to "The Normal Heart," looks at 
Ned Weeks, a volcanically raging HIV-positive writer in the hospital. Like 
Force, Weeks is a star, knows it and considers his fate to be proof that 
something is distinctly out of whack with the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rage, though, can become pure whining on stage; it's the difference between 
treacly melodrama and tragedy. Freeman walks the tightrope when he brings 
Force's long-forgotten son into the action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this godfather of the international gay literati actually had a son, 
Simon (Thomas Lynam). Force abandoned his family years ago. Simon has dropped 
by, having heard the news and just wanting to say hi. But Force, assuming that 
everyone is as two-faced as himself, senses other motives. He presses Simon 
into admitting that what he really wants is for the father to apologize for 
desertion. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a primal, though not earth-shaking, conflict (nothing, for example, like 
the kind of psychic temblors Kramer crafts in "The Destiny of Me"). But Freeman 
handles the drama clumsily: He starts cranking it up in Act I, halts it as 
Force collapses with illness, then resumes it hesitantly in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
 When things come to a head, there isn't the catharsis of a great conflict, 
partly because Freeman doesn't construct it for maximum effect and partly 
because Noflin and Lynam can't remotely suggest a convincing blood tie 
(Noflin's blackness versus Lynam's pale-white Anglo-ness doesn't help). The 
only other figure of any weight is Force's personal assistant, Digby, played 
with a fine mix of patience and exasperation by Royce Sciortino. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hampered by the Forum's distant, auditorium-like proscenium, Swaroop's 
hesitant direction tends to freeze his actors on a straight line: Everyone 
looks and feels constricted, pent up. This is the kind of material that should 
let the dramatic juices flow. But for this young company, willing to take on 
new plays, there's always next time.

 Glaser Comes Out: Garrett Glaser, the KNBC-TV Channel 4 entertainment reporter 
who had wanted to "come out" to viewers for months, finally got that 
opportunity on Monday, during a report on the death of AIDS activist Elizabeth 
Glaser (no relation). "As a gay man who's lost more than a few friends to the 
virus, I am grateful to Ms. Glaser for helping to heighten awareness of AIDS 
outside the gay and lesbian community," Glaser said on the air. In an interview 
later he said it had "felt great" and expressed hope that "other gay and 
lesbian reporters in this market will see you can be out and still keep your 
job and do good stories." Kenny Boles, acting news director at KNBC, had said 
last week that there was no set date for allowing Glaser to "come out" on the 
air, but on Tuesday he said he'd given Glaser the green light because "it was 
the right thing to do, very much the appropriate thing to do on this story. 
We're very proud of Garrett; we think he's a fine reporter. . . . And now it's 
time to move on."

 Schedule Changes: ABC is the latest network to weigh in with its 1995 schedule 
changes, beginning with a new night for "The Commish." On Feb. 2, the police 
drama will move to Thursdays at 9 p.m., a network source confirmed. Replacing 
"The Commish" on Saturdays at 10 p.m. will be "The Marshal," in which star Jeff 
Fahey will track down fugitives directly opposite Chuck Norris' "Walker, Texas 
Ranger" on CBS starting Feb. 4. Meanwhile, despite critical acclaim and public 
pleas from its producers, "My So-Called Life," will wrap its 19 episodes at the 
end of January and be replaced Thursdays at 8 p.m. by either "Matlock" or 
"Extreme," a new James Brolin rescue series shot in Park City, Utah. ABC is 
expected to introduce either "Marshal" or "Extreme," both male-oriented shows, 
directly after the Super Bowl on Jan. 29. RADIO

 New Format: Big-band station KGRB-AM (900) has switched over to a 
"contemporary standards format," paired with nighttime NBC talk programming. 
Besides playing the music of such artists as Harry Connick Jr., Frank Sinatra, 
Tony Bennett and Barbra Streisand during the day, the station now features a 
live simulcast of Larry King's CNN TV show at 6 p.m., and talk programs hosted 
by Jim Bohannon at 10 p.m. and Bruce Williams at 1 a.m. Big-band music is still 
heard from 7-10 p.m. The station, which since the changeover two weeks ago has 
begun calling itself AM-90 NBC, hopes to change its call letters to KNBC-AM. 
The station has also petitioned the FCC for a power increase. POP/ROCK

Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences Lifetime Achievement Awards. Receiving a 
sister NARAS honor, the Trustees Award, is Atlantic Records co-founder Nesuhi 
Ertegun, who signed and produced such jazz greats as Ornette Coleman, John 
Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. The awards, which honor lifelong artistic 
contributions to the recording medium, will be acknowledged during Grammy Week, 
but will not be part of the March 1 telecast. The awards are separate from the 
annual Grammy Legend Awards, which both Mayfield and Streisand have previously 
received. LEGAL FILE

 In Brief: A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday threw out a wrongful termination 
claim from former "Price Is Right" model Dian Parkinson's sexual harassment 
lawsuit against game show host Bob Barker. However, the crux of Parkinson's 
lawsuit -- alleged sex harassment and emotional distress -- is still intact. . 
. . A New York Judge on Monday postponed Tupac Shakur's Dec. 14 sentencing date 
to allow the rapper to recover from five gunshot wounds he received in a 
robbery last week. Shakur, who was convicted last Thursday of sexually abusing 
a 20-year-old woman he met in a nightclub, could get 2 1/2 to seven years in 
prison. . . . Talk-show host Ricki Lake, who was caught on videotape in a fur 
protest and then chatted with David Letterman about her adventure, pleaded 
innocent in New York Monday to trespassing and criminal mischief in conjunction 
with a Nov. 14 protest at the office of fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. A 
hearing is scheduled for Jan. 5; if convicted, Lake could face up to a year in 
jail. QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; RIP TORN STEERS RIGHT COURSE IN 'RIVERS FLOW NORTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Where the Rivers Flow North" affords Rip Torn with one of the best roles of 
his screen career and Native Canadian actress Tantoo Cardinal an equally fine 
opportunity to shine in this modest, beautiful, deeply felt film about a strong 
man who finally cannot bring himself to accept the inevitability of change. 
</P>
<P>
 In director Jay Craven and his co-writer Don Bredes' skillful adaptation of 
Howard Frank Mosher's novel, Torn plays Noel Lord, a long-haired, aging logger 
living with a hearty, middle-aged Native American called Bangor (Cardinal) in 
the gorgeous Vermont wilderness. Lord has a lifetime lease on this land, where 
his ancestors are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not about to stop a company (headed by a forceful Michael J. Fox) 
already well under way in constructing a $30-million dam that will leave Lord's 
property under 50 feet of water. True to its period, the film wisely steers 
clear of highly contemporary environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam builders may be tough, but they're not presented as truly evil; the 
dam will contribute enormously to the regional economy as a source of 
hydroelectric power. Although Lord is mule-stubborn, "Where the Rivers Flow 
North," which is set in 1927, refreshingly does not evolve into a predictable 
David vs. Goliath struggle. The conflict is instead really within Lord himself. 
</P>
<P>
 More sensible and realistic than Lord, Bangor argues for accepting a buyout, 
for she acknowledges that, even without the prospect of the dam, their way of 
life is becoming increasingly less tenable. But Lord is caught up totally in 
trying to outfox his adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 This film may well represent Torn's best work since the similarly rural 
"Heartland" and "Payday," in which he so unforgettably played a doomed country 
star based on Hank Williams. Torn's specialty is playing colorful, sometimes 
backwoodsy eccentrics, and at times he tends to go over the top. (One wag said 
that the best thing about "The Beans of Egypt, Maine" was that Torn wasn't in 
it!)  
</P>
<P>
 That's what makes his rigorously understated playing of the taciturn Lord all 
the more impressive and gratifying; clearly, Torn respected his role, and it 
shows. Cardinal more than holds her own with Torn, and has such a vibrant 
presence that she easily offsets the tendency toward quaintness in her pidgin 
English dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the Rivers Flow North," which in its concluding sequence could wind up 
a bit faster, is primarily but not exclusively a two-character drama (set off 
with earthy humor). Treat Williams cameos deftly as a carnival fight promoter, 
and Bill Raymond elicits sympathy as the dam company representative who has the 
thankless task of trying to negotiate with Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is an evocative, painstaking period piece enhanced stunningly by a 
spare, pulsating score by the Horse Flies with Ben Wittman. Since "Where the 
Rivers Flow North" so successfully transports us to the past, it is truly 
lamentable that three sequences are marred by the presence of an 
illusion-destroying overhead mike dangling over the actors' heads. To offset 
this, projectionists would have to keep a constant eye on the screen and try to 
adjust the image accordingly. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; NATALIE COLE -- SINGER AND ACTRESS -- DOES DOUBLE DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natalie Cole hits both ends of the glamour spectrum this week, and both with a 
seasonal flourish: Tonight, she's dressing up, with multiple costume changes, 
to carol through her own hourlong Christmas special. Thursday night, she's 
dowdying down, to play a '50s maid, in her first dramatic, non-singing lead 
role in a TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole acquits herself as thespian as well as thrush in this one-woman 
family-entertainment onslaught -- though, in the final rendering, most 
audiences will still prefer her swingin' to sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of "Natalie Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas" is a bit of 
a misnomer: It's hard to find anything the slightest bit untraditional about 
this PBS "Great Performances" installment. 
</P>
<P>
 The sets, the orchestra, the patter, the songs, even the succession of dresses 
and 'dos -- everything here bespeaks '60s in a big way, and that's pretty much 
all for the best, recalling the halcyon days when Dad's calming presence graced 
homes as ubiquitously as mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference is that a Nat (King) Cole special would've featured guest 
stars, while Natalie's underpopulated hour has "Sesame Street's" Elmo as the 
only fellow celebrity. Basically it's a good-enough live video counterpart to 
Cole's class-act new album, "Holly & Ivy," with livening bits of blues ("Merry 
Christmas Baby") and gospel ("Joy to the World") spiking the eggnog best 
represented by -- surprise -- "The Christmas Song." 
</P>
<P>
 From those chestnuts, it's on Thursday to her TV movie-starring debut, the USA 
Network's "Lily in Winter," which gives Cole a chance to expand on the acting 
career she commenced with guest shots on "I'll Fly Away" a couple years back. 
She's been a quick study at how to underplay; only in isolated moments here 
does she become too enthusiastic with the Southern accent she employs as a New 
York maid and nanny venturing back to her Alabama roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The melodrama, though, sustains too many predictable notes to hold the 
attention of any but the very young or very sentimentally inclined. Cole has as 
her charge a neglected-feeling boy (Brian Bonsall), who insists on tagging 
along when she panics during an attempted robbery of her employers' home and 
flees back to her impoverished family. 
</P>
<P>
 Few surprises ensue as the law sets out to solve the would-be kidnaping and 
this on-the-lam lady has to deal with a familial mess she left behind years ago 
along with her new troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the camera loves Cole's soulful eyes, and her surprisingly even emoting 
doesn't pale too much alongside an accomplished supporting turn from Marla 
Gibbs as her Alabama mom. The promise of more acting gigs may be the best 
present Cole gets this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Natalie Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas" airs tonight at 7:30 on 
KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15, at 8 p.m. on KOCE-TV Channel 50 and 
Thursday at 9 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. "Lily in Winter" airs Thursday at 9 
p.m. on the USA cable channel.

 In case you thought "I'm Too Sexy" was the final beat-heavy word on vanity in 
the fashion world, here's an album full of songs that strut like a super-model 
on the catwalk . . . or a superego in the bedroom. That strut is there in a 
wealth of runway-ready beats, from the album-opening dancehall reggae of Ini 
Kamoze's hit "Here Comes the Hotstepper" to the closing techno remix of U2's 
"Lemon." 
</P>
<P>
 Thematically, the songs for Robert Altman's new fashion scene dissection 
provide music to preen by. The selections are split between wry commentary (Sam 
Phillips' new take on the classic fashion-conscious power statement "These 
Boots Are Made for Walkin' ") and sexy self-absorption (the Rolling Stones' 
"Jump on Top of Me," a frisky leftover from the "Voodoo Lounge" sessions). 
Other highlights: Janet Jackson's almost-campy boudoir interlude " '70s Love 
Groove" and Terence Trent D'Arby's self-explanatory "Supermodel Sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one to four stars. STEVE HOCHMAN

THEATER REVIEW; SOMETHING'S MISSING IN THE 'RICHES' RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether the slant is hellish or humorous, there's typically no riper 
theatrical subject than that of the diseased relationship, in which embattled 
partners psychologically, physically and generally torment one another in 
escalating battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Blessing's "Riches" at the Court Theatre takes a stab at the psychological 
slash and splatter of marital warfare, but rather than lacerating, delivers 
only an occasional flesh wound. 
</P>
<P>
 In the development of the play, Blessing worked closely with his director and 
dramaturge, Jeanne Blake, who also happens to be his wife. One would think that 
a husband and wife collaborative team might yield some special insights into 
the married state. However, although Blake's direction is assured, Blessing's 
play is largely a non-event, based on a strained premise and filled with 
reiterative interchanges that strike one as emotionally false. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rich (Mark Benninghofen) and his wife, Carolyn (Bernadette Sullivan), 
are celebrating their anniversary in the posh hotel where they honeymooned 15 
years ago. Affluent, attractive and hitherto amicable, the Riches enjoy an 
enviably yuppified lifestyle in an upper-class Minnesota enclave, where the 
living is easy and crime is largely unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as David is concerned, his marriage is ideal and his love for his wife 
stronger than ever. Carolyn, too, thought she was happy -- until a week ago. 
Now, she drops an anniversary bombshell into David's orderly existence. She 
wants a divorce, and she's not about to reconsider her decision, despite 
David's pleadings. 
</P>
<P>
 And what cataclysmic event precipitated Carolyn's drastic re-evaluation? As 
Blessing conceives it, nothing in particular. A speech consultant, Carolyn 
can't muster the words to define her disenchantment. Carolyn's ironic 
inarticulateness becomes increasingly irritating as the play wends on and 
Carolyn still fails to make any concrete points about why she so suddenly and 
adamantly wants a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 With her loony rationale, Carolyn functions as a sort of straight woman to 
David, whose sarcastic reactions to her nonsensical arguments are initially 
very funny indeed. However, as the stakes grow higher and the fight becomes 
uglier, Carolyn's lack of motivation becomes lethally problematic to the play. 
</P>
<P>
 To Sullivan, whose pained Pieta expression varies not a whit throughout, goes 
the thankless task of delivering such lines as "I can't stay in a relationship 
just because there's nothing wrong with it." Sullivan has taken too much to 
heart that adage about comedy being a serious business. A lighter hand, even a 
touch of dizziness, might have rendered her capricious character more 
sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Benninghofen charms as the sensible, straightforward David, but gets into 
trouble when he has to respond seriously to such complaints from Carolyn as "I 
don't like your nose" -- apparently one of her bitterest gripes about their 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Carolyn's morose randomness could well be the by-product of severe 
depression, but there's no hope of such a conveniently organic cause in 
Blessing's scattered comedy-drama, which stands as sorely in need of intensive 
therapy as the Riches themselves.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; REVAMPED EARTH, WIND & FIRE RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 That wasn't the real Earth, Wind & Fire that showed up for its sold-out show 
on Monday at the Pantages Theatre. On the first of its two nights there, this 
totally revamped outfit did a bare-bones version of EWF's extravagant '70s 
shows, which featured elaborate sets, gaudy costumes and levitation stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, EWF was one of the most popular bands in the business. Now, touring 
for the first time in six years, it's a nostalgia act, serving up such oldies 
as "That's the Way of the World," "Reasons" and "Shining Star" in its unique, 
far-ranging style, which encompasses R&B, jazz, pop, funk and gospel. No group 
has ever mixed lush harmonies and rampaging funk like EWF. 
</P>
<P>
 As oldies shows go, this was a real crowd-pleaser, boasting tight, high-level 
musicianship. Even lead singer Philip Bailey, whose falsetto can be ragged and 
out of control, kept a tight rein on it throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Bailey, bassist Verdine White and percussionist Ralph Johnson remain from 
the good old days. The other eight musicians have joined since the late '80s. 
Conspicuously absent was leader Maurice White (Verdine's brother) and the sound 
of his trademark African thumb piano. He did pop out on stage briefly during 
the encore, to ear-splitting cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the show felt incomplete. The old flash, special-effects wizardry and 
over-the-top gaudiness were as integral to its shows as the pretty harmonies, 
and it was disconcerting to see the great EWF reduced to an oldies act. DENNIS

TV RATINGS; 'GRACE' TAKES OVER 'HOME' FOR SECOND WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second week in a row, "Grace Under Fire"edged out "Home Improvement" 
as the nation's top-rated TV program--although the local preference was for 
something altogether different: "Beverly Hills, 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the two Tuesday night comedies at the top of the national pack, ABC 
also won positions three and four with "NYPD Blue" and "Roseanne," propelling 
the network to a solid victory over its rivals and maintaining its front-runner 
status for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed that the 
highest-rated movielast week was "Someone Else's Child" on ABC Sunday night, 
starring Lisa Hartman Black. It finished 14th among the week's 94 prime-time 
network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite ranking first locally, "Beverly Hills, 90210" finished 37th 
nationally. And Fox's two Sunday night installments of "The Simpsons" ranked in 
the Top 10 locally but ranked 58th and 64th nationally. Nevertheless, Fox 
managed to inch by CBS in competition for the prized demographic group of 
viewers age 18 to 49, with ABC first and NBC second. Southland Ratings

HOT LAKERS TURN TABLES ON WARRIORS; PRO BASKETBALL: VAN EXEL HAS 20 POINTS AND 
14 ASSISTS IN 113-101 VICTORY OVER SLUMPING GOLDEN STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel said he heard that a Golden State Warrior -- he wouldn't say 
which one -- called the Lakers' big victory over Houston last Friday a fluke, 
so what happened Tuesday night was more than a win that put the Lakers about a 
month ahead of their 1993-94 pace. 
</P>
<P>
 This was about credibility. About answering some of the doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel never spoke up to that player, but he did have a loud statement for 
all the opponents: 20 points and a career-high 14 assists that helped the 
Lakers defeat the Warriors, 113-101, before 10,579 at the Forum for their 
seventh victory in eight outings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure if we would have lost, teams would have said, 'Same old Lakers, they 
fell back again,' " Van Exel said. "We're here to let people know we're going 
to stay at this pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Warriors had reason to doubt, having defeated the Lakers by 22 
points in Oakland about three weeks earlier, one game after the Lakers used a 
fourth-quarter comeback to avoid a blowout against Denver and one game before 
they used a fourth-quarter rally to avoid a defeat against the Clippers. Golden 
State hadn't seen the developments of the most recent eight outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Warriors have. The visitors were forced to play catch-up most of the 
night and trailed by 15 points early in the fourth quarter before another rally 
got them within 102-99 after Tim Hardaway's three-point shot with 3:11 left.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's where the final comeback ended, stopped when Vlade Divac, who had 
10 of his 14 rebounds on the offensive end, had three unanswered points and Van 
Exel followed that with a free throw and then a three-point shot with 1:31 to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 That shot put the Warriors out of reach for good, finally. It also gave Van 
Exel four three-pointers, in 10 attempts, as the Lakers set a team record with 
11 three-point baskets. Eddie Jones also had four and Cedric Ceballos had two 
while contributing 28 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't only about Van Exel's shooting, of course. Playing sick because of a 
bad sinus condition, the second-year point guard snubbed his nose at the 
Warriors with the 14 assists, three games after getting 13 assists in 
back-to-back outings. His Golden State counterpart, Tim Hardaway, had a 
team-high 23 points and 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Van Exel said. "It seems like I've been more aggressive and 
have been going to the hole more and looking for the open man. My teammates are 
wide open, so I just kick it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Those kind of numbers are expected from Hardaway. Van Exel? That's another 
matter as he tries to show people he is more than a shooter who plays point 
guard. His recent play should help -- an average of 8.8 assists over the last 
12 games and 10 over the last five. Credibility, remember? 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors limped in having lost two in a row, six of their last seven and 
searching for a permanent starting lineup, with Coach Don Nelson using nine 
combinations in the first 15 games and no final decisions expected until Chris 
Mullin returns from the injured list. In short, this looked nothing like the 
team that crushed the Lakers last month in Oakland, and that has nothing to do 
with the addition of starter Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Laker Coach Del Harris, a former assistant to Nelson with Milwaukee: "I'm 
sure he'll get them back on track very soon. I just hope he waits a couple of 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The first quarter probably seemed that long to Nelson. The Lakers built a 
double-digit lead 4:45 into the game and went up by 19 points, 36-17, with 1:09 
left while shooting 56% in the quarter. The Warriors shot 26.1% and trailed by 
17 after 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Lakers came into the night slightly behind last season's average 
attendance of 13,315 for home games, the winning ways of late have had an 
effect. Steve Chase, the director of sales, said walk-up sales for games are 
about two or three times greater than usual, to about 1,000 per. But good 
showings or not, the Lakers don't expect another season-ticket push until after 
New Year's, when people have recovered from Christmas spending and as the 
football season ends. "I'm hoping we continue to play this well and that we 
take this momentum into January," Chase said. Asked if it helps Laker 
attendance that the Clippers are playing -- and drawing -- so poorly, he added: 
"I don't think that has any bearing. Frankly, they're getting more publicity 
right now because everybody is wondering when they're going to win."

 Vanderbilt ran away from Virginia, but couldn't hide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodores, who had been beaten at Penn State by 22 points in their last 
game, rebounded with a strong first half Tuesday at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 They took an early double-figure lead, fueled by three-point shooting, 
stretched it to 18 points, then went cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt withstood a 22-7 second-half run by the 20th-ranked Cavaliers, 
using free-throw shooting ability at the end in a 70-65 upset victory that 
might help the young Commodores mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a heck of a game together as a team," said sophomore Frank Pride, 
who scored 14 points as a Vanderbilt reserve. "Virginia, a top-20 team, (us) 
coming off a 22-point blowout on the road. . . . I thought to me, myself, we 
had to grow up in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, Vanderbilt (3-1) held a 40-22 lead, but it shot 26% in the second 
half and didn't score from the floor in the final 12:29 in nearly blowing the 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia (3-2) whittled away at the lead, cutting it to 63-59 with 1:27 to go, 
but Vanderbilt made seven of 10 free throws in the final 1:14 to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Arizona 96, Florida State 78 -- Damon Stoudamire scored 25 points and 
the Wildcats made 12 three-point shots in winning their home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (4-1) got eight points from Reggie Geary in a 22-8 run in the first 
6:47 of the second half to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State (3-1) was led by Corey Louis with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Arkansas 121, Centenary 94 -- Clint McDaniel had two steals, five points 
and three assists in a 19-0 run by the Razorbacks (4-1) in the second half of a 
victory over the Gentlemen (1-4) at Fayetteville. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Duke 103, George Washington 73 -- Cherokee Parks scored 19 of his 
career-high 29 points in the first half as the Blue Devils (4-1) put on a 
shooting clinic in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke made 11 of its first 13 shots and made the Colonials (5-2) the 91st 
consecutive non-ACC team to lose in Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Connecticut 74, Boston College 70 -- The Huskies (4-0) escaped a huge 
scare when Doron Sheffer's 15-footer with 34 seconds to play began a 6-2 
game-ending spurt that secured the victory over Boston College (2-2) at Newton, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Wisconsin 69, Valparaiso 51 -- Michael Finley scored 28 points at 
Madison, where the Badgers (4-0) broke open a close game with a 15-1 run 
against Valparaiso (1-3) in the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Syracuse 83, Miami 65 -- John Wallace had 23 points and Lawrence Moten 
20 as the Orangemen won at Coral Gables, Fla., handing Miami (3-1) its 21st 
consecutive loss in the Big East Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Moten's three-point basket ignited a 17-9 run that gave Syracuse (4-1) a 59-44 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas-El Paso 77, No. 22 New Mexico St., 68 -- Mark Ingles scored 18 points, 
including 15 from three-point range, to lead the Miners, who had lost to New 
Mexico State by six points on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Miners finished in double digits as UTEP (2-1) dominated the Aggies from 
start to finish. New Mexico State (5-2) only led once, for about 24 seconds, in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Black scored 27 points at Kalamazoo as Western Michigan (2-2) was a 
90-81 winner over Purdue (3-3) for its first victory over a Big Ten team in 
nine games, since 1986. . . . A Greg Jensen basket followed by his block and a 
Sande Golgart dunk led Colorado (4-0) to a 75-69 victory over Wyoming (1-2) at 
Laramie. . . . Freshman Pete Lisicky scored a game-high 17 points as Penn State 
(4-0) was an 86-55 winner over Maryland-Eastern Shore (1-3) at State College.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC EASES TO IMPRESSIVE FOUL-PLAGUED VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Shooting 53% from the floor and cutting its turnover total in half, the USC 
women's basketball team won an unexpectedly easy 67-55 game at San Diego State 
Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Tina Thompson dominated in the first half and point guard Audrey Gomez took 
over in the second half of a game that slowed to a crawl when the officials 
blew their whistles seemingly non-stop over the last five minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 They called 49 fouls, including eight in the final minute of a game that took 
about two hours to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And free-throw shooting was a sore point with Trojan Coach Cheryl Miller, 
whose team made only 19 of 36. San Diego State (3-2) converted 17 of 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we'd shot from the line like they did, we'd have put them away much 
earlier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Thompson and guard Karleen Shields triggered a run that enabled USC 
to post a seven-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a 6-3 power forward, was five for five from the floor and two for 
two from the line. She finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Shields had a 
game-high 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State never solved USC's zone defense, particularly down the 
stretch. In the last 6:11, the Aztecs made two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, 3-1 going into road games at Houston and Stephen F. Austin beginning 
Friday, got a major effort from Rashida Jeffery, a player who has largely 
watched from the bench for the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffery, a 6-2 sophomore from Tucson, has spent two years trying to rehab 
through chronic knee pain. Tuesday, she came off the bench with no sign of pain 
and had eight points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Rashida is only at about 75%," Miller said. "If she ever gets to around 
90%, I feel sorry for some teams on our schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also praised another backup, Shanika Porter, who contributed key 
rebounds in the first-half surge that lifted the Trojans to a lead they never 
relinquished.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller was most happy that the 35 turnovers her team committed against UC 
Santa Barbara Saturday were cut to 18 Tuesday -- and against a team best known 
for defensive prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State, the defending Western Athletic Conference champion, was 
trying to avenge an 82-62 loss to USC a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs also played without starting guard Olivia DiCamilli, who might be 
out for the season because of an opening-game knee injury.

JINX HOLDS TRUE AS NORTHRIDGE WINS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FOR THE SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE TIME, LONG BEACH STATE IS UPSET BY THE MATADORS, WHO SCORE THEIR 
FIRST VICTORY OF THE SEASON, 64-58. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They higher they are, the harder they fall. That should be Cal State 
Northridge's credo every time Cal State Long Beach visits for a basketball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a three-point basket with four seconds left in overtime gave 
Northridge an upset over Long Beach a couple of games after the 49ers had 
knocked off top-ranked Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 As Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg said Tuesday night, " deja vu ." 
</P>
<P>
 This time the three-point shot came with more than three minutes left in 
regulation. The result was the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously winless Northridge defeated previously unbeaten Long Beach, 64-58, 
in a nonconference game before 759 fans in the Northridge Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The spread was six points, but Robert Hill's three-point basket -- an 
off-balance shot from 30 feet as the shot clock expired -- was unquestionably 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good-luck shot," Hill admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's basket pulled Northridge (1-3) to within a point, 54-53, and swung 
momentum the Matadors' way with 3:19 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any one shot had a major role, it would have to be that one," Northridge 
Coach Pete Cassidy said. "(The 49ers) were playing great defense. That had to 
be discouraging for them, and it was certainly a big lift for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a junior, scored a game-high 16 points, including four in the final 
1:12. His leaning, 10-foot baseline jumper gave Northridge a temporary lead, 
58-56, and his two free throws with 45 seconds remaining gave the Matadors a 
60-58 edge, an advantage they held. 
</P>
<P>
 A slam dunk by Mike Dorsey and two free throws by Ryan Martin in the final 16 
seconds gaveNorthridge its margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey finished with 12 points and Martin 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Atkinson led Long Beach (2-1) with 13 points and eight rebounds. Terrance 
O'Kelley and Jamie Davis each scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting only 35% in each of its first three games, Northridge shot 49%, 
55% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm 0 and forever, it's very big," Cassidy said of the victory. "It's a 
springboard, something that says, 'We can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors led at the half, 30-26, despite 15 turnovers. Long Beach quickly 
erased that deficit by making its first five shots of the second half -- 
including a pair of three-point shots by O'Kelley.

IT'S A GAME OF FIRSTS FOR VICTORIOUS USC; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TROJANS SET TEAM 
AND INDIVIDUAL RECORDS WHILE OVERWHELMING CAL STATE SACRAMENTO, 93-54.

 USC's 93-54 victory over Cal State Sacramento on Tuesday night before 1,443 at 
the Sports Arena was a game filled with Trojan firsts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Interim Coach Charlie Parker gained his first blowout victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freshman Cameron Murray set a school record with seven steals, and also had 
a career-best nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore David Crouse had a career game with 11 points, four rebounds and 
two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Lorenzo Orr scored a game-high 21 points and had a season-high nine 
rebounds and four dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A season-high five players scored in double figures, including junior 
college transfer Ty Reuter's career-high 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game was a lot fun in that we all were able to get into flow on the 
court," said Crouse, whose previous career-highs were six points and four 
rebounds. "It was great to be able to do things you normally wouldn't do in a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 While USC enjoyed its best game of the season to improve to 2-3, Sacramento 
State's woes continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets, who are in their fourth season playing at the Division I level, 
stretched their two-season losing streak to 28 games and their road losing 
streak to 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento State (0-5) shot 37.5% from the field and made only two of 14 
three-point attempts. During a 10-minute stretch covering the end of the first 
half and the start of the second, the Hornets were outscored, 23-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pac-10's talent level is a different level," said Sacramento State Coach 
Don Newman, who has a 4-55 record in three seasons. "We finally have some kids 
who can compete, but winning (against Pac-10 teams) is not going to happen 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Boyd, who played at Gardena High, led the Hornets with 18 points, and 
Damond Edwards scored 10 but had 12 of the team's 25 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which led, 48-25, at halftime, clicked in all areas while shooting a 
season-high 54.7% from the field and outrebounding the Hornets, 41-30. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I liked about the game was that the team stayed focused 
throughout," Parker said. "A lot of times when you get a big lead, games turn 
into a circus. But we didn't do that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan sophomore Jaha Wilson scored 15 points and grabbed five rebounds, and 
junior Brandon Martin scored 12 with five rebounds, three assists and two 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys are getting in shape and playing in the system," Parker said. "I'm 
proud of them, how hard they played and how they stayed focused." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC will now travel to Texas to play at Houston and Lamar this weekend. 
Murray, who also had seven turnovers, broke the single-game steals record that 
previously was held by four players. USC's 37-point victory is the largest 
margin since the Trojans defeated Howard, 107-65, last season. Three Trojans 
had career-highs in scoring -- Crouse, Reuter and walk-on guard Adam Ingersoll, 
who scored two.

PEPPERDINE STRUGGLES, FALLS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Fuller, Pepperdine's first-year basketball coach, didn't want to believe 
the naysayers who insisted that the Waves would probably struggle this season 
with young, inexperienced players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said it, but I was like, no, no, no, we're going to be all right," 
he said. "But I guess the reality is something a little different." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Pepperdine is 1-4 after Tuesday night's 70-63 loss to UC Santa Barbara 
at Firestone Fieldhouse, its worst start since the 1973-74 season, when it lost 
its first five games en route to an 8-18 record. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Waves, who have made 12 postseason appearances in the last 16 seasons, 
have yet to defeat a Division I opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to our team is, we have no superstars or anybody that's any better 
than anyone else," said Fuller, whose team is 0-4 since defeating Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in its opener. "We need a team effort from everybody. We had a 
couple of guys who didn't really give us much tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves made a season-low 35.4% of their shots and never led again after 
center Doug Muse, who scored 10 points to lead a balanced Santa Barbara attack, 
made a baseline jumper to start an 8-0 run that gave the Gauchos a 25-18 
advantage 7 1/2 minutes before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (3-0) built its lead to 43-30 early in the second half before 
Pepperdine rallied behind reserve forward LeRoi O'Brien, who scored all seven 
of his points and took all but one of his eight rebounds after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves cut their deficit to 54-52, but Santa Barbara made 12 of 14 free 
throws in the last 8 1/2 minutes to hold them off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we executed pretty well in the second half," Fuller said of the 
Waves, who made 44.8% of their shots in the second half after making only 27.8% 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we needed to make a big play, needed to make a big shot. And we didn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing pains? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says we've got a young team, but I never want to make an excuse," 
Fuller said. "They've got five guys, just like we've got five. You have to go 
out there and play."

 Fred Couples fired a six-under-par 66 Tuesday to help the PGA Tour break a

NBA ROUNDUP; YOUNG MAVERICKS SHOW SPURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas showed the full impact of its talented young crop of players in a 
124-121 overtime victory Tuesday night at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn scored 34 points and Jimmy Jackson added 28 to key Dallas' 
comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential of this team is very scary," said Maverick center Roy Tarpley, 
who reached season highs with 22 points and 14 rebounds. "We play unbelievably 
well sometimes and terrible sometimes. Tonight, we came up with a good effort 
when we needed to." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory snapped a two-game Dallas losing streak and marked its third 
overtime victory this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's finger-roll with 37.6 seconds left in overtime gave the Mavericks 
the lead for good. He added a free throw, Popeye Jones sank two more free 
throws and Mashburn added another to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio's David Robinson matched his season high with 42 points, but he 
was called for his sixth foul with 54.7 seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the San Antonio scoring came from its five starters. The Spurs were 
outscored by the Dallas reserves, 35-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 106, Utah 97 -- Dell Curry made six of Charlotte's 13 three-point 
shots, including four in the fourth quarter, to lead the Hornets to a victory 
in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte led, 72-71, after three quarters, and Curry made three three-point 
shots when the Hornets opened the fourth quarter with a 15-4 run for an 87-75 
lead and control. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 90, Detroit 83 -- Dale Davis had 19 points and 11 rebounds and Reggie 
Miller made a key three-point shot to stop a late Detroit rally at 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 102, Minnesota 95 -- Dale Ellis scored 14 of his 18 points in the 
second half and rookie Jalen Rose started a fourth-quarter rally that led the 
Nuggets to a victory at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose scored six consecutive points -- his first points of the game -- to turn 
a one-point deficit into an 88-83 lead with 6:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 94, New Jersey 91 -- Craig Ehlo converted a breakaway layup and free 
throw with 0.3 seconds to play in overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., as the 
Hawks won their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 103, Houston 90 -- Gary Payton scored a season-high 30 points to lead 
the SuperSonics at Tacoma, where they beat a Houston team that struggled 
without Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, last season's Most Valuable Player and Houston's scoring and 
rebounding leader, injured his right wrist last Thursday when it collided with 
a camera during a game against Golden State. He might also miss Thursday's game 
at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 104, Boston 90 -- Charles Smith had 20 points and the Knicks opened 
the second half with a 22-8 run at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading by 10 points in the second quarter and trailing by only one at 
halftime, the Celtics were shut down in the second half. They made only 12 of 
36 shots after halftime. Dominique Wilkins scored 20 points but was held to two 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 114, Cleveland 97 -- Anfernee Hardaway scored 10 points and Shaquille 
O'Neal had nine during the Magic's 42-point first quarter at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal and Nick Anderson finished with 26 points each and Hardaway finished 
with 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 108, Milwaukee 95 -- Olden Polynice had 22 points and 16 rebounds 
and Walt Williams scored 20 to power the Kings to a victory at Sacramento.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FOR BOND SELLERS, A DAY WHEN NOBODY WANTED TO BUY; 
SECURITIES: EVEN ROUTINE TRADES FELL THROUGH. IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE COUNTY'S 
FILING WILL AFFECT THE MARKET TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL and HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors nervous over Orange County's growing financial crisis on Tuesday 
tried to unload bonds issued by the county and its municipalities, only to find 
that no one wanted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even routine trades flopped. Orange County Sanitation Districts, for example, 
could not find a buyer for $4 million worth of its notes -- basically 
interest-bearing IOUs -- as it tried to complete a scheduled refinancing of the 
paper, said Steve Kozak, the district's financial manager. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear how the county's decision late Tuesday to file 
for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy would affect the market for Orange County 
muni bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, on Tuesday before the bankruptcy filing, the offering price of 
Orange County munis was down 12% to 15% compared to bonds with comparable 
yields and credit ratings, as would-be sellers offered discounts of an 
additional two to three percentage points from Monday's prices in fruitless 
efforts to make deals. 
</P>
<P>
 While uncertainty about the county's situation kept its bondholders and 
bankers on edge Tuesday, the overall bond market had a strong day as traders 
grew optimistic that the Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates enough 
to flatten inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields fell to continue a weeklong rally in market prices. As yields 
fall, bond prices rise. The market's benchmark, the 30-year Treasury bond, 
gained $5.31 per $1,000 in face value as its yield fell to 7.87% from 7.92% on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is scrambling; we're under pressure to find (Treasury) bonds" to 
satisfy heavy demand, said Rissy Mell, a trader at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 One trader said that conflicting rumors and reports about the Orange County 
situation "continue to foster a misinformed market" for those bonds, however. 
</P>
<P>
 One result, he said, is that "there has been a load of Orange County bonds up 
for bid" and no one interested in buying them. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't only large institutional bondholders that are asking questions that 
so far have no answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean?" bemoaned retiree Jack Brownstone, a Rancho Mirage 
resident who owns about $15,000 worth of Orange County bonds. "What happens to 
the value of my bond? Is it like when New York went bankrupt and the state 
guaranteed the funds?" 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar resident John Anderson, who says he owns a number of Orange County 
bonds through a municipal bond mutual fund, said Tuesday that he's afraid he 
could lose much-needed retirement income and is outraged that "somebody was 
allowed to mismanage funds to this degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Former County Treasurer Robert L. Citron resigned Sunday amid increasing 
criticism of his high-risk investing style, but Anderson wonders if the blame 
should be placed on Citron alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how a person could be given that much authority without anyone 
else knowing about it," Anderson said, suggesting that county supervisors and 
officials of other financial agencies that collectively invested more than $7.5 
billion through Citron should have exercised more oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that government bankruptcies are rare, with the laws that govern them 
different than for other bankruptcies, even some sophisticated money managers 
were clueless Tuesday about the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threatening to file bankruptcy is hysterical behavior unless there is 
something there that we don't know, (perhaps) that liabilities outweigh assets" 
in the county pool, said Fred Prager, a partner with the San Francisco bond 
trading firm of Prager, McCarthy & Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is groundbreaking material here," said W. Peck Ferrin, head municipal 
trader for Bank of America in San Francisco. "None of us has a handle on 
exactly what a Chapter 9 does" or how it would affect bondholders. Bank of 
America is a leading underwriter of county bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the problems facing the county's bondholders is the fact that 
Moody's Investors Service, a respected credit-rating firm, said Tuesday that it 
was starting a review of the ratings it has awarded 58 bond issuers with funds 
in the Orange County pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Larkin, Standard & Poor's managing director, said county officials are 
scheduled to meet Thursday morning in New York with S&P rating analysts. But an 
"information blackout" by the county, he said, has kept him in the dark as to 
whether that meeting will take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was gloomy, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term prospects for Orange County are excellent," said Jeremy Ragus, 
California Tax Free Fund portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in 
Boston. "There is no real general obligation debt" that encumbers the county's 
tax revenue, "and it is a fast-growing, high-energy, wealthy community that is 
going to survive this."

PG&E TO CUT PRICE OF DIABLO ELECTRICITY; ENERGY: THE MOVE TO CUT RATES FROM THE 
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COMES AS THE INDUSTRY PREPARES FOR DEREGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Tuesday that it will cut the price of 
electricity produced by its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant by $2 billion 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which cost $5.5 billion to build, was plagued by cost overruns 
during construction in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was reached in agreement with the California Public Utilities 
Commission's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, the state attorney general and 
several consumer groups, PG&E said. It is subject to approval by the full PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the move would help PG&E compete more effectively with 
lower-priced power companies as the California utility industry is deregulated. 
The PUC has proposed that competition in the state be phased in over several 
years beginning in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that earnings would be lower . . . without this plan," 
said Bob Glynn, PG&E's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Glynn said PG&E hopes to offset the plan's effect on earnings by 
continuing with an aggressive plan to cut costs. PG&E has already cut 3,000 
jobs in the last two years and has said it will cut more. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC's deregulation plan would allow power companies to sell electricity 
over each other's lines. Under the plan, an electric customer in California 
could feasibly buy power from out-of-state utilities. Other states are 
considering similar proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, who had been concerned that Diablo's high rates would make it 
difficult for PG&E to compete with lower-cost, unregulated power companies and 
other utilities, applauded the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "PG&E's competitive position will substantially improve," Charles Benore, a 
PaineWebber analyst, said in a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Benore warned that PG&E's average electric rate of 10.6 cents a kilowatt-hour 
is among the highest in the nation and will remain high even with the price 
reduction at Diablo Canyon. The average electric rate represents the average 
price of residential, industrial, commercial, wholesale and retail power. 
</P>
<P>
 PG&E President Stanley Skinner has pledged to cut costs and bring average 
rates down to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour or less by 1999. But Benore cautioned 
that utilities that charge higher than 9 cents per kilowatt-hour will have 
difficulty competing. 
</P>
<P>
 Diablo Canyon has been a thorn in the utility's side since the cost overruns 
during forced PG&E to write off more than $1 billion in revenue and cut its 
dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility was also forced to devise a separate rate structure for power 
produced at the plant to help pay for the construction. Customers' rates have 
been raised each year on a fixed schedule since the plant began operating in 
1988. Starting next year, rate increases were to be determined by a formula 
based on the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, electricity generated by Diablo Canyon costs 11.89 cents a 
kilowatt-hour; that was scheduled to rise to 12.2 cents in 1995 and to 13.3 
cents in 1999. Under the plan announced Tuesday, PG&E would instead cut prices 
32% in the next five years, resulting in a decrease in prices to 11 cents per 
kilowatt-hour in 1995, 10.5 cents in 1996, 10 cents in 1997, 9.5 cents in 1998 
and 9 cents in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 PG&E shares closed down 12.5 cents at $61.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

DANA PARSONS: WAS TREASURER INVESTING IN VAIN JUST TO JUSTIFY HIS REIGN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wasn't it just two weeks ago that the clouds had parted over Orange County and 
bright sunshine had burst through? Wasn't someone just saying that a local 
economic recovery was in gear and that happy days were here again? 
</P>
<P>
 And now this? Now, we're told that one bookish, bespectacled career county 
treasurer has single-handedly triggered financial chaos? That the man who 
always wanted to be known as "Bob" on the tax bills he mailed out has brought 
us the apocalypse just in time for Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise in this recall-nutty climate that the Board of Supervisors is 
getting the word out pronto that it is not, repeat not responsible for 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's investments. Make that "former" 
treasurer-tax collector, following Citron's resignation this week. But the 
point is that the board never has felt the need to separate itself from Citron 
before. True, the treasurer-tax collector is elected and not beholden to the 
supervisors, but they loved to mention his name during those years when he was 
raking in big money for local municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's "Bob Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Who has done something you wouldn't think possible. He has the country 
talking about rock-ribbed conservative Orange County as the equivalent of a 
municipal casino. County governments all over the country invest their funds, 
but none of them makes the national news. None of them has a normally 
circumspect U.S. congressman like Christopher Cox telling a TV audience that 
the county might declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens who don't know the bond market from a flea market are no doubt 
shocked to learn that one man had this much financial responsibility. At a time 
of public mistrust of government, in general, this story lands with the same 
kind of thud that accompanied the collapse a few years ago of so many of the 
nation's savings and loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's resignation has a weird historical symmetry to it. He was the 
county's tax collector in 1973 when the Board of Supervisors decided to merge 
that office with that of treasurer. Despite the then-treasurer's urging that 
the job be given to his assistant, the supervisors gave it to Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 One demurring supervisor questioned whether Citron had enough investment 
experience to handle the task of managing what then was a nearly $1-billion 
portfolio. Supervisor David Baker noted that "one unwise investment" could have 
disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent elections, however, Democrat Citron became as entrenched as the 
Republican officeholders that surrounded him. His personal quirkiness seemed an 
amusing counterpoint to the serious job he had of minding the store for the 
dozens of public entities who turned over their money to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent out tax bills with poetry attached, such as "Taxes paid on time never 
draw fines." One year, he sponsored a poetry contest for taxpayers and awarded 
$10 to a woman from San Clemente who suggested, "Isn't it worth a little bounty 
to live in Orange County?" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Citron wrote to County Auditor Vic Heim, claiming that Heim's office 
had shortchanged him $12.66 in annual salary. "I do not wish to make a great 
issue over $12.66 a year," Citron wrote, "but knowing your penchant for 
operating your office not only exactly to legal mandates but accepted 
accounting procedures, I know that now that this has been brought to your 
attention, you will wish to rectify this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Heim convinced Citron he hadn't been shortchanged, Citron apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't to suggest Citron was all fluff. Over the years, he was hailed 
for his investment acumen. He also played against form as the quiet bookkeeper, 
occasionally willing to challenge popular causes or officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of overwhelming public support, he vocally opposed Proposition 13 
in 1978 for its potential revenue impact on governments, particularly school 
districts. He said its passage would bring "anarchy" to schools and government. 
His opposition never hurt him at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, he criticized city officials in Anaheim for favoring development 
over the needs of ordinary citizens, saying at one point, "Human beings by 
nature are selfish; some are more selfish than others, particularly in the city 
of Anaheim regarding Project Beta (an urban redevelopment project)." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1987, he took on Sheriff Brad Gates, questioning both his 
budgeting prowess and his managerial skills. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the man who occasionally wrote long letters to the editor at the 
newspaper remains silent. The man who challenged the Republican hierarchy won't 
emerge from his home to explain how his investment calculations went so 
dreadfully wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ultimate irony, the public is left to speculate about Citron's 
speculating. Did he get caught up in the frenzied Wall Street game that has 
proved so alluringly fatal to so many others? Was he trying too hard to find 
revenues for those public entities he felt were strapped for funds? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it pure bad judgment that brought him crashing down? Or, perhaps, foolish 
pride? 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, was he still trying 20 years later to prove he was the right 
man for the job? 
</P>

 NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN: Every Dec. 7, the daily memories of Pearl Harbor become 
even more vivid for Harold Epler of Orange, as he thinks about the thousands 
who died around him 53 years ago. . . . Epler will be among the Pearl Harbor 
Survivors Assn. members at El Toro Memorial Park for special ceremonies today 
at 11 a.m. It's an observance he's never missed in those 53 years. . . . "Most 
of us who survived remember every detail of that day," says Epler. "And all of 
us knew someone who didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 INCHING TO THE TOP: Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) was ecstatic for 
his party about the November election results. He was even happier Tuesday: He 
was easily elected chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, which 
develops legislative packages. It makes Cox the House's fifth-highest-ranking 
Republican, and the highest-ranking Californian. . . . Lofty goals? Says Cox: 
"Our goal will be no less than to change the world."

 GETTING RESULTS: A new local United Way's Health Care Council report shows 
great improvement in prenatal care here. "That's because of Chauncey 
Alexander," says council director Stephanie McElheney. . . . Council founder 
Alexander, now 77 and retired, was the first to recognize in 1987 a major 
health care crisis among the county's poor, particularly in prenatal care. . . 
. Today, the health council says thanks, honoring Alexander at its first annual 
awards luncheon, at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers.

 FOUR LIVES? Despite the TV stereotype, firefighters have a policy against 
going after cats stranded in trees -- it's simply too dangerous. In Santa Ana 
though, they recently made an exception. A blue-eyed Siamese had been stranded 
up a tree for four days before a frantic neighbor asked for help. . . . Fire 
Chief Allen (Bud) Carter said that in his 30-year career, it was the darnedest 
call he'd ever gotten. . . . All is well, the cat is safe, and the City Council 
this week commended the Fire Department.

 Actors without scripts: Miffed over the no smoking regulations in restaurants 
here, actor Liam Neeson describes Los Angeles as "such a fascist place" in the 
December issue of Vanity Fair. You would think that Neeson would be more 
careful with that term, inasmuch as he played the title character in 
"Schindler's List," the story of a real "fascist place."

 He's just trying to clean up L.A.: A day after we mentioned a couple of L.A. 
cop novels by Joe Wambaugh, we heard about a scene that Wambaugh could have 
written. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that a guy with a bucket full of water and some rags and sponges 
blithely walked into the county Beaches and Harbors office in Marina del Rey 
and began washing down the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers assumed he was with maintenance until he indicated he was in business 
for himself. "Much magic! Much magic!" he repeated as he attempted to sell a 
cleaning product. 
</P>
<P>
 He was given the boot -- and promptly walked into the sheriff's substation 
next door. Again, he strolled past the front desk and entered the holding tank 
area. He was busily washing down more walls when he accidentally pressed a 
button. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies sprinted in, their guns drawn.  
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say, it was another no-sale for the mysterious cleaning man.

 Letter imperfect: We mentioned recently the letter addressed to a Whittier 
Drive resident in Beverly Hills -- the problem being that the "W" in Whittier 
had been replaced by another letter that would lower anyone's property values. 
</P>
<P>
 But these things balance out. The mailman brought Cynthia Petrovic, a San 
Fernando Valley resident, a letter that misspelled her hometown as "Funland." 
miscelLAny Mayor Fidel Vargas of Baldwin Park is featured in Time magazine's 
"50 for the Future," its survey of "America's most promising leaders age 40 and 
under." Vargas, who is way under 40 (he's 26), was briefly denied entrance to a 
nightclub two years ago because he had forgotten his ID. Eventually, he was 
allowed to enter, which was fortunate. The event was Vargas' inaugural party.

FISH REPORT: POND FOR POND, TEMECULA HAS A LAKE THAT'S LOADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona Lake is more of a pond than a lake. One can row from one end to another 
without working up a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the advantage because the small reservoir near Temecula is loaded 
with fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it would seem, given the success recently of Jim Payne. The angler from 
Orange, casting mini-jigs near the dam and along the east shore, caught and 
released 30 crappie and 10 largemouth bass and then pulled from the lake his 
five-fish limit of trout.

SKIING / BOB LOCHNER; NO NEED TO HIKE FAR PURSUING GOOD RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Skiers planning their holiday vacations probably should give first 
consideration to sticking close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Colorado has long called itself "Ski Country USA," that title could 
easily be usurped, for the present, by California, which currently offers the 
world's best skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison's sake, take Vail, which has 26 to 33 inches of snow and is 29% 
open, and stack it up against Mammoth Mountain, which boasts 66 to 90 inches 
and virtually all of its terrain available for skiing. Or weigh Snowmass, with 
25 inches and 31% of its slopes adequately covered, against Squaw Valley's 
wide-open 90 to 114-inch base, including five inches of new powder early this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowmass' neighbor, Aspen Mountain, claims to be 82% open, but coverage is 
somewhat thin in spots, topping out at 28 inches. Nearby Aspen Highlands 
doesn't even plan to start its season before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, temperatures have warmed a bit and an expected storm failed to 
provide any additional snow last weekend, but major resorts in both the San 
Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains continue to offer good skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Big Bear, Snow Summit's Bonnie Tregaskis said: "We're 90% open, which is 
pretty good for early December, and we're making snow to add to our 16- to 
36-inch base." 
</P>
<P>
 There's an added bonus for Southland skiers, according to Bear Mountain's 
Julie Grant, who said: "The weather is beautiful -- sunny, blue skies with only 
a few clouds -- and there's almost nobody in the lift lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Also operating daily are Snow Valley, which has nine lifts running, and 
Mountain High, which has five lifts serving the west side and is planning to 
open its east side before the start of the Christmas-New Year's holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski Sunrise, down the road from Mountain High near Wrightwood, missed its 
targeted opening date last Friday, but General Manager Phil Edholm said: "We 
have at least six inches of snow and, with the help of another storm and some 
snowmaking, could begin operating by Dec. 17." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skiers who find far-off places alluring can still choose from among a variety 
of western resorts, including Utah's Park City/Deer Valley and Alta/Snowbird, 
where 50 to 60 inches of snow cover the slopes. Or somewhat closer, there's 
Brian Head, a short drive past Las Vegas, where 100% of its runs are open on a 
50-inch base. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northwest, snow is also plentiful at Mt. Bachelor, Ore., Sun Valley, 
Ida., Jackson Hole, Wyo., Big Sky and The Big Mountain, Mont., and 
Whistler-Blackcomb, Canada. In the Southwest, Taos, N.M., is in midseason form. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Europe, forget it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 World Cup organizers finally found enough snow for a couple of men's races 
last weekend on the 8,500-foot-high glacier at Tignes, France, where Italy's 
Alberto Tomba won Sunday's slalom after finishing fourth behind Liechtenstein's 
Achim Vogt in a giant slalom the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's scheduled events in Italy were moved to Tignes. A decision on a 
Dec. 13 race in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, will be made today. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba leads the standings with 150 points, 25 more than runner-up Michael Von 
Gruenigen of Switzerland, but he faces another test in trying to win the 
overall title because of his reluctance to enter half of the four disciplines, 
the downhill and super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I am in the lead of the World Cup at Christmas, it won't be that 
important," Tomba told the Associated Press. "I want to concentrate on the 
World Championships (Jan. 30-Feb. 12 at Sierra Nevada, Spain)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, who turns 28 on Dec. 19, has said he plans to retire after this season, 
but his sponsors hope he continues racing through the 1997 World Championships 
at Sestriere -- in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup women's schedule is clicking right along, with Heidi 
Zeller-Baehler of Switzerland having won two of the five races and scoring 289 
points to hold a 32-point edge over veteran teammate Vreni Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop is Lake Louise, Canada, for a downhill and super-G this weekend, and 
the U.S. Ski Team is hoping at least to duplicate its performance at Vail, 
where Hilary Lindh won Friday's downhill and Shannon Nobis and Picabo Street 
finished sixth and seventh in Saturday's super-G behind winner Sylvia Eder of 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lindh, 25, of Juneau, Alaska, it was her second World Cup victory -- she 
also won the downhill last January at Sierra Nevada -- and came as something of 
a surprise. After a training run the day before, she had told AP: "Certain 
people have courses they do well on, and this doesn't happen to be one of mine. 
I've always had a bad time on the turns at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 So? 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the (training-run) video yesterday, and I was standing around, so 
I decided to be more aggressive," Lindh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, 23, of Hailey, Ida., with a later starting number, also decided she 
had to be more aggressive because of Lindh's sizzling time, but all it got her 
was a spill that injured a finger on her left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Other World Cup top-15 finishes by Americans last weekend were Eva Twardokens' 
12th behind Switzerland's Heidi Zeller-Baehler in Sunday's giant slalom at Vail 
and Jeremy Nobis' 13th in Saturday's giant slalom at Tignes. . . . Mammoth 
Mountain's children's center, nicknamed "Woollywood," has been doubled in size. 
. . . Kirkwood and Northstar-at-Tahoe also have their Nordic operations up and 
running, with more than 50 kilometers of cross-country trails at each location. 
. . . Mt. Baldy is operating on weekends only at present.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: IS FISHING DISPUTE ECOLOGICAL OR POLITICAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether Mexico's refusal to grant permits to allow San Diego's long-range 
fleet to visit the Revillagigedo Islands -- the world's most prolific fishing 
grounds for giant yellowfin tuna -- stems from political reasons or from a 
genuine attempt to protect the area it recently designated as a marine reserve 
is a matter of conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing is certain: It is not based on the most recent biological data. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Joseph, director of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, 
last year stated that the tuna stocks off southern Mexico are in excellent 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Tedd Dunn of LoPreste-Dunn Sportfishing at Fisherman's Landing, 
Joseph said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies demonstrate that at present and over the last several years the 
abundance of yellowfin tuna is the highest it has been in the history of the 
fishery." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter continued that the resource could easily sustain any pressure put 
on it by the long-range fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 The IATTC, a research and management organization based in La Jolla, has 
studied yellowfin stocks for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boat owners have suggested that the passage of Proposition 187 was a 
factor in Mexico's refusal to grant the permits. Others say the United States' 
embargo on Mexican tuna -- because of the dolphin-killing issue -- is partially 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico maintains that it merely wants the offshore region protected from all 
fishermen, American or otherwise. It has expressed concerns over the poaching 
of small tropical fish such as those sold for use in aquariums, although it has 
not accused the long-rangers of poaching. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, fishermen hoping for the annual monstrous tuna fix remain out of 
luck, and landing operators are feeling the pinch.  
</P>
<P>
 There are six boats that schedule trips to the islands every year. The boats 
carry an average of 28-30 people who pay $4,000-$5,000 apiece for the 17-day 
trips. 
</P>

 Three landings have 45 trips scheduled this year. Some are running now, going 
elsewhere off Mexico. But nowhere else do tuna that weigh from 100 to 400 
pounds thrive as they do at the island chain. The fishermen aren't biting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost four people (because of cancellations) this morning, and that's going 
to cost me $12,000, so yes, it's hurting," said Frank LoPreste, owner of the 
Royal Star and Royal Polaris. 
</P>
<P>
 To LoPreste and his colleagues, Mexico's decision doesn't make sense. After 
each trip, most of the customers are dropped off in Cabo San Lucas, where they 
spend a few days and more than a few dollars before flying home to meet their 
boat -- and their fish -- in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "We introduce people to Mexico, and they fall in love with the place," said 
Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California, which so far 
has been arguing such points to no avail. "I know of people on our boats who 
have bought condominiums in Cabo San Lucas." One problem this year has been the 
change in presidents and administrations in Mexico City. Both the outgoing and 
incoming administrations have had other issues to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fletcher is optimistic that this issue can be resolved before the long 
holiday break. One reason is the announcement Tuesday that fisheries 
undersecretary Carlos Camacho Gaos is being retained by new fisheries secretary 
Julia Carrabias Lillo. Camacho has been receptive to the long-rangers' concerns 
in previous disputes.

 According to the Associated Press, the Amsterdam fisherman lost his false 
teeth when he leaned overboard during a bout of seasickness on a North Sea 
fishing trip last September. 
</P>
<P>
 He got them back last week after another fisherman landed a 19-pound cod -- 
with the teeth inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable but true," tackle shop owner Hugo Slamat said after 
returning the dentures to their owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Slamat was cleaning the cod when he noticed something in its stomach. "I 
turned it over with the tip of my knife -- and then I saw the teeth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed them to a skipper of an Amsterdam sportfisher and the skipper said 
the person who lost the teeth had been fishing on his boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unbelievable coincidence," Slamat said.

 The Orange County sportfishing community is getting behind an effort to make 
Christmas special for about 300 "special-needs" anglers -- mostly handicapped 
and abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Akana and Elsie Maurizi at Davey's Locker in Newport Beach are heading 
the effort and said canned goods, clothing and toys are filling barrels set up 
there and at Gary Hill's Fuel Dock, Bongo's Sportfishing and Newport Landing -- 
all in Newport Beach. Details: (714) 673-1434 or (714) 642-4498; or (714)

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; NO BREAK FOUND IN HOSTETLER'S HAND

 Many quarterbacks don't know if they have had good games until they have seen 
the films. Jeff Hostetler doesn't know if he's had a good game until he's seen 
the X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in four weeks, Hostetler has needed postgame medical tests. 
And for the third time, he has passed them. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays of his injured left hand -- his non-throwing hand -- after Monday 
night's game against the San Diego Chargers were negative. Hostetler's left 
hand was cut when defensive back Darrien Gordon stepped on him as Hostetler 
rolled out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing it wasn't a defensive lineman," Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon weighs 182 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler sat out three plays, then returned. 
</P>
<P>
 His left hand is bandaged, but he is not expected to miss any playing time.

LOS ALAMITOS; AH SIGH IS IN A CLASS BY HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years ago, you could almost always find Frank Nakamura at Los Alamitos, 
sitting in his favorite spot behind the box seats, betting the races. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, you can still find Nakamura at Los Alamitos, but you may have to 
look in a different spot. Try the winner's circle, where he is likely to be 
with Ah Sigh, who recently posted the fastest qualifying time for the $200,000 
Golden State Futurity, to be run Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura, who was a casual horseplayer long before he owned racehorses, has 
one of the top fillies at Los Alamitos this year in Ah Sigh. And although she 
is not the first stakes winner Nakamura has owned -- he also campaigned 1982 La 
Primera Del Ano Derby winner Bugs Royal -- she is the first one he has bred. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah Sigh, named after Nakamura's wife, Asaye, is out of another mare Nakamura 
bred and campaigned, Cindio, and is by First Down Dash. Cindio was named after 
Nakamura's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 By naming Ah Sigh after his wife, Nakamura accomplished what he had been 
unable to do in the previous 20 years, get his wife excited about horse racing. 
But it would be hard not to get excited about Ah Sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Her qualifying for the Golden State Futurity with the top time shouldn't 
surprise anybody who has read her past performance lines or seen Ah Sigh run. 
She has won seven of eight starts, including two major futurities, with the 
kind of ease usually seen only in seasoned veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 When she's right, the filly is almost unbeatable. And she has been right a lot 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah Sigh won her first four races, among them the Grade II Miss Kindergarten 
Futurity, with ease. Her only defeat came in the Governor's Cup Futurity when 
she was third behind Jungle Raised and Dicey Secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's lightly raced and she's a strong filly," Nakamura said after the Miss 
Kindergarten Futurity. "She was up to a good race. She's a nice horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah Sigh soon proved just how nice. After two months off, she easily won her 
trial for the Ed Burke Memorial Futurity and the Grade I final. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by John Creager in the Golden State Futurity trials, Ah Sigh broke with 
her usual speed, racing to the lead in the 400-yard race. She was never 
seriously challenged and never pressured by Creager as she turned in a 
19.88-second clocking and won by 1 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember ever having a 2-year-old that has been as consistent as Ah 
Sigh has been this season," said Charlie Bloomquist, Ah Sigh's trainer who has 
conditioned such outstanding young horses as champion Solvency and Merridoc. "I 
think she's as good as any 2-year-old I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah Sigh might be challenged in the Golden State by two other qualifiers, Joes 
Tol and Meter Me Gone. Both have noteworthy records this year, and were 
impressive in their trial heats. 
</P>
<P>
 Joes Tol, a Tolltac filly owned by Joseph Granone, won the third trial in 
19.90 seconds, the second-fastest qualifying time. A Dash Of Beduino finished 
second in that race and posted the third-fastest time, 19.94. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Connie Hall, Joes Tol has steadily improved since running sixth in 
her debut, having won all four of her subsequent starts. And two of those four 
races were stakes, the Santa Barbara and San Diego handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State will be Joes Tol's first graded stakes appearance, but after 
her solid effort in the trial, she promises to be a top contender in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Vessels Stallion Farm's Meter Me Gone also turned in a stunning performance in 
the trials, winning the second trial as easily as Ah Sigh had won the first. 
Trained by Danny Cardoza, Meter Me Gone has now won his last three races and 
six of 10 lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State Futurity field: Ah Sigh; Joes Tol; A Dash Of Beduino; Meter 
Me Gone; Alibis Assets; Simply Scorching; Honey Who; Mistofelees; Jungle Raised 
and Casual Eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two divisions of the California Futurity for Arabians were run last Friday. 
Running seven furlongs in 1:34 1/5 under the guidance of Guillermo Gutierrez, 
Sam Taire won the $27,000 colts and geldings division for trainer Yancey Carter 
and owners Cheryl and Kinsman Wright. Only six horses entered the fillies' 
division, with the Dean Frey-trained Kawzah Tiki winning the $20,000 stake 
impressively. She finished 16 lengths ahead in 1:37 1/5.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; FARR EXPECTED TO GO ON INJURED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, who suffered a hyper-extended elbow Sunday 
against the New Orleans Saints, is expected to be put on injured reserve today 
and replaced on the roster by defensive end Jay Williams, who has been on the 
Rams' practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams thought the hiring of Wayne Sevier, acknowledged around the league as 
one of the game's premier special teams coaches, was going to make the 
difference in two or three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened is not what they had in mind. Special teams blunders have 
figured prominently in several losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about it," Sevier said. "I fully accept the fact I 
haven't gotten it done on special teams. Our special teams haven't done it, and 
I haven't been able to communicate and motivate in a way that I normally feel I 
can do. And that's my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram special teams have given up four returns for touchdowns, and in the last 
two games, punt returner Todd Kinchen has fumbled the ball away three times.

<P>
 The Matadors (1-3), the kids who couldn't shoot straight, upset previously 
unbeaten Cal State Long Beach, 64-58, before 759 fans in the Northridge gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, that crash you heard simply was Long Beach's ego going splat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not very good right now," Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like the 49ers rarely are when they play at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a three-point basket with four seconds left in overtime gave 
Northridge an upset over Long Beach soon after the 49ers had knocked off 
top-ranked Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg remembers. " Deja vu ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the three-point shot came with more than three minutes left in 
regulation. Similar result. 
</P>
<P>
 The final spread was six points, but Robert Hill's three-point basket -- an 
off-balance shot from 30-feet out as the shot clock expired -- was 
unquestionably the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good-luck shot," Hill admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's basket pulled Northridge to within 54-53, and swung momentum in the 
Matadors' favor with 3:19 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any one shot had a major role, it would have to be that one," Northridge 
Coach Pete Cassidy said.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The 49ers) were playing great defense. That had to be discouraging for them, 
and it was certainly a big lift for us." 
</P>
<P>
 A dunk by Mike Dorsey and two free throws by Ryan Martin in the final 16 
seconds gave Northridge its margin of victory. Dorsey finished with 12 points 
and Martin added 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's game was more than a one-shot deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Matched against ball-hawking Rasul Salahuddin, Hill responded with 16 points, 
including four in the final 1:12.  
</P>
<P>
 His leaning 10-foot baseline jumper gave Northridge a temporary lead, 58-56, 
and his two free throws with 45 seconds remaining gave the Matadors a 60-58 
edge, an advantage they held. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin, a junior from New York by way of Dixie, Utah, met his average of 
five steals, prompting him to cast a few tongue-wagging taunts in Hill's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's play earned him the last word. He outscored Salahuddin by 10 points and 
committed only two turnovers to his opponent's seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a great job," Cassidy said. "He's not a flashy guy who is going to 
blow by people with whirly-dirly things. He's a blue-collar guy. He'll get the 
job done his way." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge got a similar effort from Shane O'Doherty, who scored seven points, 
grabbed six rebounds and drew a couple of charging fouls in 21 minutes as a 
front-court reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Atkinson paced Long Beach (2-1) with 13 points and eight rebounds. 
Terrance O'Kelley and Jamie Davis each added 10 points. After shooting only 35% 
in each of its first three games, Northridge shot 49%, including 55% in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors led at the half, 30-26, despite 15 turnovers. Long Beach quickly 
erased that deficit by making its first five shots of the second half -- 
including a pair of three-point buckets by O'Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, the 49ers went cold. Long Beach made only one basket in the 
final 9:53, a layup by Atkinson with 3:57 to play. Northridge couldn't 
capitalize because it couldn't hit a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 In a six-minute stretch late in the game, the Matadors missed six of seven 
free throws. However, in the last three minutes, Northridge sank its last 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach led by as many as seven points before Northridge closed in on 
Hill's desperation shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, picked third and fourth in two preseason Big West Conference 
polls, has provided Northridge with big boosts in its last two visits to 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm 0-and-forever, it's very big," Cassidy said of the victory. "It's a 
springboard, something that says, we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy seemed to directly respond to Greenberg's comment about Long Beach 
playing poorly when he said, "Our kids played great defense when it counted, 
got rebounds when it counted and hit shots when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this time, on this night, we were the better team."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; ORANGE COUNTY'S WOES BOOST TREASURY PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County financial crisis pushed Treasury bond market interest rates 
sharply lower Tuesday as investors, unnerved by news that the Southern 
California coastal enclave might file for bankruptcy protection, squirreled 
away money in U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The falling interest rates failed to lift spirits on Wall Street, however. 
Stocks struggled and ended the day mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the money flows were concerns that Orange County's investment fund woes 
could send broad ripples through the financial markets and perhaps trim the 
value of municipal bonds and other securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bills, short-term securities considered one of the most secure 
investments, gained strength from the influx of investor money. Yields on the 
securities, which move inversely to price, dropped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are putting cash into the bill market. No one really knows how all 
this will land," said Eric Hamilton, a market analyst at Technical Data in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates also fell. The key 30-year bond closed at 7.87%, down 
from 7.92% on Monday. Its price rose 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty over Orange County's finances had a muted impact on the financial 
market for municipal securities, in part because most of the county's bonds are 
so thinly traded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which was moderately higher at midday, 
veered downward in the afternoon action before computer-guided buy orders 
returned it to a nearly neutral reading. The blue-chip gauge, off more than 25 
points at its worst, ended at 3,745.95, up 4.03 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader measures fell, however, while losers outnumbered gainers on the New 
York Stock Exchange by about 11 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's uninspiring performance was traced to lingering disappointment 
over news Monday that investors in Fidelity's flagship Magellan Fund -- the 
country's largest mutual fund -- won't receive a dividend at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fidelity said the decision reflected an accounting error and 
apparently wasn't due to problems in the stock and bond markets, the news 
"caused a moment of reflection," particularly for bearish investors, said 
Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G. Edwards & Sons in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 Shares of major airlines tumbled after financier Warren Buffet was quoted as 
saying his USAir investment was a mistake, adding that "no airline is going to 
be a substantial business." 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir fell 12.5 cents to $4.375 a share, AMR fell $1.125 to $50.75, UAL 
dropped $1.125 to $91.875 and Delta Air Lines fell 75 cents to $48.75. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consolidated Freightways gained 1/2 to 19 1/4 after announcing it will 
resume paying quarterly dividends. Alex. Brown upgraded its rating on the stock 
to "strong buy" from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer networking products company NetWorth sank 5 1/8 to 9 5/8 after it 
told analysts it expects lower revenue in the second quarter than in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 * BankAmerica dropped 1 1/4 to 40 1/2. Traders cited PaineWebber's downgrading 
of the stock to "neutral" from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Megatest, which makes testing equipment for the semiconductor industry, said 
it expects a loss of as much as $4 million on continuing operations for its 
fiscal first quarter ended Nov 26. The stock plunged 4 1/2 to 5 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intelligent Electronics fell 3 1/8 to 9 3/8 after the company's chairman 
said he has asked an independent committee of the board to review the marketing 
practices of the nation's largest computer reseller. 
</P>
<P>
 * ECI Telecommunications fell 3 1/8 to 14 after two brokerages reduced their 
estimates for the Israeli company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel rose 3/8 to 64 1/2 in heavy trading. News of a flaw in the Pentium 
microprocessor had triggered a selloff. Selling overseas set a somber example 
for U.S. stocks to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Germany's 30-share DAX average fell 24.24 points to 2,046.88. 
London's Financial Times 100-share average declined 17.4 points to 3016.1. In 
Mexico, the Bolsa fell 7.06 points to 2,514.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended at 19,340.47, up 34.81 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar declined in relation to most other major currencies. It 
closed at 100.08 Japanese yen in New York, down from 100.48 on Monday. It fell 
to 1.572 German marks from 1.573.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A TRAVEL DIARY THAT READS LIKE LITERATURE; THE LOST 
HEART OF ASIA BY COLIN THUBRON ; HARPERCOLLINS $23, 374 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The place that Colin Thubron calls "the world's heart" is what used to be 
known as Soviet Central Asia and is now a vast puzzle whose pieces are newly 
minted nations with ancient names: Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "For mile upon mile the only colour was a terrible, famine- breathing 
platinum, less like pure sand than the pulverised clay of the empires which had 
petered out in its dust: Persia, Selucia, Parthia, Macedon," Thubron writes. 
"It was awesome and somehow expected: that the heart of the world was not a 
throbbing organ but a shifting question mark." 
</P>

 Thubron is one of those unconquerably curious and superbly literate travelers 
that the English seem to breed in abundance. His earlier adventures in the 
former Soviet Union, China and the Muslim world are the subject of a series of 
well-regarded novels and travel memoirs, and now he tells us tales of his 
experiences as a stranger in yet another strange land in lush prose that often 
soars into poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Thubron describes exactly what he sees at eye level -- the men and women he 
encounters and the here-and-now of their curious and often desperate lives -- 
but history and politics are never quite out of mind. For example, when he 
introduces us to a beleaguered Russian woman in newly independent Turkmenistan, 
she speaks words that could have been uttered by any number of dispossessed 
European settlers in Africa or Asia over the last century or so: 
</P>
<P>
 "Will these people regret it when we go? The Russians run everything here! 
We're the only people who make things work. When we're gone, what will their 
future be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Thubron is always quick to remind us that the history of these 
lands is measured not merely in decades or even centuries but millennia. And so 
he is more likely to invoke Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan or Tamerlane 
than more recent Russian overlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Thubron expects to find an eruption of Islamic fundamentalism in the Muslim 
communities of Central Asia, but what the Soviets left behind turns out to be 
an odd hybrid of several orthodoxies. He happens upon Jews at prayer in a 
synagogue where Hebrew is now a forgotten language, a gentleman in a homburg 
hat who was among the Germans deported from the Volga by Stalin during World 
War II, and an unlikely congregation of Baptists who were converted by "a rich 
Korean . . . from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Thubron describes a world in the grip of a collective identity crisis. 
At a mosque in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, for example, he encounters Gypsies 
sacrificing a sheep, peasant women making obeisance to an ancient tree believed 
to induce fertility and cure backache, and a few rather befuddled devotees 
praying at the mausoleum of a Sufi saint. 
</P>
<P>
 "He scarcely knew the history of the saint he served," Thubron writes of one 
worshiper, "but lapsed into communist jargon, describing him as a Stakhanovite 
holy man who achieved through work and planted melons." 
</P>
<P>
 As Thubron shows us, the countries of Central Asia -- and the people who live 
there -- have been cruelly severed from their own memories and traditions. In 
Stalin's days, a mosque in Uzbekistan was turned into a Museum of Atheism; 
today, the Lenin Museum in Kyrgyzstan has been made over as a museum where the 
battle maces of Tartar warriors are on display. And so no one quite knows the 
authentic history or destiny of what Thubron calls "the hinterland of God's 
vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's heart seemed numb with lessons and memorials," he writes of the 
Russified city of Tashkent. "People faded to shadows here." 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the emblematic scene in "The Lost Heart of Asia" is a visit to a 
ruined mausoleum in the desert of Turkmenistan, one of dozens of crypts and 
mosques and castles that seem to litter the dreamy landscape across which 
Thubron wanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch out in those ruins," says the driver who escorted Thubron into the 
desert. "They're haunted." 
</P>
<P>
 "By whom?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," the driver answers. "People have been heard crying there." 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with Thubron's book. He invites us to places that are haunted by 
history, and the anguished voices we hear in these pages might belong to the 
ghost of the Veiled Prophet of Khorsan -- or a flesh-and-blood woman keening 
over the burial stones of long-forgotten nomads. 
</P>
<P>
 Thubron cannot be sure, and neither can we.

FAR-RIGHT RUSSIAN POLITICIAN WOUNDED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen shot and wounded the leader of a far-right Russian nationalist party 
and killed his two bodyguards Tuesday as the three men left his home in St. 
Petersburg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuri Belyayev, who also headed a private security firm, is widely known for 
his nationalist views and has sent supporters to Bosnia-Herzegovina to fight 
for that country's Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 A legal official, who declined to be named, linked the shooting to Belyayev's 
business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vladimir Lapin, the head of the party's organizing committee, told the 
Itar-Tass news agency that he believed the attack was connected to Belyayev's 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Itar-Tass said Belyayev became leader of the National Republican Party when it 
merged Sunday with his former party, the People's Social Party, whose symbol 
was a bird with a swastika on its tail.

BINGE DRINKING SATURATES COLLEGE LIFE, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half the college students in America are binge drinkers who cause an 
array of "secondhand" problems on campus ranging from vandalism to rape to 
fatal accidents, says an extensive new study published today. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, culled from a survey of 17,592 students nationwide, present a 
picture of U.S. college campuses awash in beer, where a projected 3 million 
students go on drinking sprees even though most are too young to drink 
legally.On some campuses, the rate of binge drinking soared to 70% of the 
student body, and fraternities and sororities had still higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference on the study, which appears in the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn., researcher Henry Wechsler said 50% of male students and 
39% of female students are binge drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers defined "binge" drinking as the consumption of five or more drinks 
in a row for men and four or more drinks for women. Wechsler said the lower 
figure was adopted for women because other studies indicate that women 
experience the same effects of alcohol at lower levels than men.

HILL IS GIVEN DEATH SENTENCE FOR SLAYINGS AT ABORTION CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Hill, the former preacher who killed a doctor and his unarmed escort with 
a shotgun at an abortion clinic here, was sentenced Tuesday to die in Florida's 
electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing lanky and tall in a green jail jumpsuit, the married father of three 
did not ask the court for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know for a fact that I'm going to go to heaven when I die," Hill, 40, had 
said last week. "I am certainly guilty of no crimes . . . . My actions are 
honorable." 
</P>
<P>
 In court Tuesday, Hill said little before he was given the ultimate penalty by 
Circuit Judge Frank Bell, who sternly concluded: "May God have mercy on your 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the son of the retired Air Force officer who was slain 
alongside the doctor dismissed Hill as "a nut." 
</P>
<P>
 "He shot my father in the head with a shotgun," said James Barrett quietly, 
his eyes red, his lips tight and trembling. "My father was a good man. A good, 
decent, kind man." 
</P>
<P>
 Pending appeals, Hill's execution would complete a circle drawn in blood in 
Pensacola. The city has been the scene of pitched anti-abortion protests, 
including the bombing of clinics and the murder last year of another abortion 
provider, Dr. David Gunn, whose killer was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who defended himself in court but never put on any witnesses and asked 
few questions, contends that he murdered Dr. John Britton, 69, to protect the 
lives of "the unborn." He earlier told the court that his July 29 killing was 
"justifiable homicide," but Judge Bell refused to allow Hill to present such a 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Also slain in the attack at the Ladies Center abortion clinic here was retired 
Air Force Lt. Col. James Barrett, 74. Barrett's wife June was wounded in the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hill's death sentence was pronounced, his wife, Karen, sat almost frozen, 
lips pursed, her head trembling slightly. Karen Hill reportedly left Pensacola 
four days before the shooting, taking her children and $10,000 in cash. Paul 
Hill has said no one knew of his plan to kill the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has said he feels no remorse. Although he may choose not to appeal the 
sentence himself, he is granted an automatic appeal under Florida law, and it 
could be years, if ever, before he is electrocuted.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; STRAIGHT TALK HELPS 
WOMEN IN SELF-DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Issues of women's self-defense may seem like old news to anyone who has been 
reading a newspaper or watching nightly news. Most people have seen dramatic 
pictures of women, frightened to walk alone, learning karate and carrying 
whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a college campus, with young women who in many cases are living on 
their own for the first time, all these messages bear repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the idea behind a program Monday at Cal State Northridge run by 
Tarzana-based Vision Empowerment Inc., or VEI. Invited by the First Strike 
Seminars and Black Family Unity at CSUN, VEI came to campus to give women "a 
checkup, from the neck up," says VEI President Tevis Verrette. 
</P>
<P>
 VEI's program differs from other women's self-defense groups in that 65% of 
its program is psychological, and only 35% physical. Women aware of their 
surroundings and self-worth can avoid being victims, Verrette says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some programs tell women to be sheep, throw up or act like you're having an 
epileptic fit -- in effect you don't have the power, you might as well 
acquiesce because you don't have a choice," Verrette says. "I tell a woman to 
do what is necessary to take care of yourself, then allow yourself choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Verrette says his group was invited on campus after a recent incident in which 
a 19-year-old woman was dragged onto campus by her boyfriend and beaten. She 
declined to press charges and was back with him the next day, Verrette adds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an example of how the first and most important battles for young women 
are about self-esteem. So that's where VEI begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminars begin by talking about domestic violence, then about setting 
boundaries, asking women how much they will put up with before they decide to 
leave a bad relationship. They talk about battered woman's syndrome -- when a 
woman has been abused for so long that she doesn't think she deserves any 
better -- and they talk about how a woman can make herself feel secure. Then 
they talk about where the young women can turn for help. 
</P>
<P>
 At residence halls and other university settings, VEI's audience undoubtedly 
includes men. They have much to learn as well, Verrette says, starting with 
what constitutes demeaning attitudes toward women and what constitutes rape. 
His job with young men is to sensitize them, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For young women learning how to safely walk to night classes and return to 
dorms, buses or cars after late evening study sessions, VEI teaches street 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Verrette talks about the "freeze response," comparing women who become 
paralyzed with fear in frightening situations to deer terrified into immobility 
by oncoming headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 So VEI has them practice. They act out anxiety-filled situations with "pretend 
strangers" in hopes of conditioning the women to react quickly in what might 
otherwise be overwhelming situations. Assertiveness is an important tool, 
Verrette says. 
</P>
<P>
 They also teach the women things their older counterparts probably learned a 
long time ago: checking the back seats of cars before they get in, being aware 
of the people and sounds around them, trusting their instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Verrette tells them not to go to ATM machines at night, and to check the 
bushes around them before they go during the day. He warns them to move away 
from an ATM quickly after using it, counting their money after they get to 
their car or home. 
</P>
<P>
 And they teach women viable self-defense methods, using their best weapons -- 
knees, fingernails and feet against attackers' most vulnerable areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A quickly thrust knee can shatter the ribs of someone who tries to attack from 
the front, Verrette teaches. A woman is powerful enough to rip off an 
attacker's ear or claw at his eyes. If an attacker approaches from behind, 
"Reach back and grab whatever you can," he tells them. Threatened women can do 
great damage to sensitive areas of a man's body with their hands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Verrette doesn't mince words, it's because a straight message is one that 
might get heard, he says. Young women, he knows, need to hear those lessons as 
early as they can.

<P>
 The city's first-ever "business incentives package," an aggressive program to 
expand local business opportunities, will be unveiled at a seminar today at 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 City finance experts will discuss plans to make low-interest loans available 
to small and medium-sized businesses through the sale of "industrial 
development bonds," in addition to a small-business loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to sell the tax-free bonds to finance the proposed loan 
program, which would make from $1 million to $10 million available to 
manufacturing and light industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The city assumes no risk for the loans but will act as an intermediary between 
the applicants and the banks, according to associate city planner Peter Cox. 
The sale of the bonds is authorized by the state. The meeting begins at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we are structuring it, the business incentives package is a first for 
the city," Cox said. "The whole idea is to work with the private sector and the 
banking community to provide financial incentives that the city of Irvine 
cannot provide." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the City Council rejected part of the proposed incentives 
package that would have provided $500,000 in federal funds to small businesses. 
Although the program was endorsed by the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, council 
members said the program would place the city in the awkward position of 
picking "winners and losers" among loan applicants and foreclosing on 
businesses that fail.

 The Police Department has announced that it will conduct a sobriety checkpoint 
starting at 7 p.m. Friday on Valley View Street between Orange and Katella 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint will operate until 2 a.m. Saturday, said Lt. John Schaefer.He 
added that Cypress officers will be assisted by members of Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to checking adult drivers for possible intoxication, officers will 
be checking drivers younger than 21 for use of any alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said that state law empowers officers to seize driver's licenses of 
anyone younger than 21 who registers a blood-alcohol content above .01%. The 
intoxication level for adults is .08% 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said the checkpoint is part of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration's campaign to clamp down on drunk or drugged drivers. BILL

 The Red Cross is seeking potential bone marrow donors to help an 11-year-old 
girl suffering from a rare blood disease, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross will conduct marrow screening from 2:30 to 6 p.m. Thursday at 
the Santa Ana Senior Center, 424 W. 3rd St. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors are needed to aid Alejandra Valencia, who suffers from aplastic anemia, 
a potentially fatal blood disease. Because tissue type is inherited in the same 
manner as eye, hair and skin color, the chances of finding a match are greatest 
when donor and recipient are in the same ethnic group, spokeswoman Judy 
Iannaccone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandra is a Latina, so Latino donors are more likely to match, although 
matches with donors from other ethnic backgrounds are possible. Those who are 
tested will be asked to give a small blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances of finding a suitable donor may run as high as one in 1 million, 
Iannaccone said. 
</P>
<P>

LOCAL NOTES: UC IRVINE GIVES LONGTIME MEN'S SOCCER COACH THE BOOT

<P>
 UC Irvine announced Tuesday it will not renew the contract of men's soccer 
Coach Derek Lawther, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation co-coach of the 
year this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said he couldn't go into specifics about 
why Lawther was let go after his 11th season because it involves a personnel 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at every aspect of a program, not just wins and losses, and we felt 
that now is the appropriate time to make the change that we felt was 
necessary," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawther had a 78-130-7 record, but the Anteaters were 11-8 this season and 
upset then-second-ranked UCLA, 4-3, in September. UCLA has advanced to the NCAA 
Division I final four.

 Lawther, whose part-time contract expires at the end of the month, said he 
doesn't want to go into details about the firing -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really very emotional," said Lawther, who started the school's soccer 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 He did say he disagreed with the policy of requiring players to raise $200 for 
the soccer program to be able to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved with and carried the program for quite a while," Lawther 
said. "I still love UCI -- it's a great university -- but I don't agree with 
the policy of pay to play for student athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawther, who also was named the Big West Conference co-coach of the year in 
1991, shared the MPSF award this season with UC Santa Barbara's Mark Arya. 
Lawther led Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) to the State community 
college title in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Ireland, he also coached University High and the California Surf 
of the North American Soccer League and played in Ireland's First Division.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Armand Boglin: Fullerton, Sophomore Football/Defensive back 
</P>
<P>
 Boglin, from Pomona High, had a solid regular season for the Hornets but 
didn't get the one thing defensive backs dream of -- an interception. But he 
changed that Saturday when he intercepted two passes as Fullerton beat Hancock, 
38-33, in the K-Swiss Bowl.He returned one interception 18 yards for touchdown 
that put Fullerton ahead, 31-21, in the third quarter. Boglin, who was the 
K-Swiss Bowl defensive player of the game, finished the season with 26 solo 
tackles and also was in on two sacks.

in four matches as Golden West won its second consecutive State title Sunday 
with a three-game sweep of Cerritos. Foltz had 17 kills in the championship 
match. Foltz, who was slowed by a pulled stomach muscle earlier this season, 
was selected as most valuable of the tournament for the second consecutive

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; PETERSON'S PERFORMANCE IN FRESNO 
CLASSIC GETS HIM OFF HOT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winston Peterson, Cal State Fullerton's top returning basketball player, 
started the season on the bench, but he's back in Coach Bob Hawking's good 
graces. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially after his strong performance in the Fresno State Classic last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson scored 26 points and had 12 rebounds Friday against Santa Clara, then 
had 23 points and 16 rebounds Saturday against Texas Arlington. He was named to 
the all-tournament team even though the Titans (1-2) lost both games. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the season started, Coach Hawking told me he didn't think I was working 
hard enough," Peterson said. "I thought at the time I was working hard, but I 
know now that he was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has been pleased with Peterson's effort the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played with a real zeal in Fresno, and has really been working hard in 
practice," Hawking said. "I've always been the most demanding on my best 
players. I told Winston that I expected him to be our hardest worker. We really 
do have high expectations for him. And I think he's turned the corner now." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, however, was disappointed his strong play didn't translate into at 
least one victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether it was early-season jitters or what, but we were just 
missing some easy shots," Peterson said. "We could have won either one of those 
games if just a few more things had gone right. If we eliminate some of the 
turnovers and start making some outside shots, we'll do a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans shot 34% against Santa Clara and 29% against Texas Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he doesn't want to become overly concerned about the outside 
shooting based on those two games. "I have confidence in our shooting," he 
said. "We just had one of those weekends that any team can have." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' next game is Saturday night against second-ranked UCLA in Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Coach Al Mistri was disappointed by the Titans' 2-1 loss to Indiana 
in the NCAA soccer quarterfinals, he can look back on the season positively. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year in a row the Titans made the quarterfinals; last year 
they reached the semifinals. Only Virginia, which beat James Madison, 4-1, in 
the quarterfinals, has had a better playoff showing the last two years. The 
Cavaliers are the three-time defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That last loss always leaves a bad taste in your mouth for a while," Mistri 
said. "I guess that's the curse of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans won six of their last eight games and tied another to finish 
14-7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "After two straight years of doing well in the playoffs, I think we've served 
notice that we have a strong program," Mistri said. "We already have one goal 
set for next year: winning the Mountain Pacific Soccer Assn. championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the 19 players on this year's team will be back, including 
redshirt Craig Dean. Another player who will be back is standout defender 
Demian Brown, who missed much of this season with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big loss is senior forward Eddie Soto, who set school records for 
goals and points in a season and a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Matt Bradbury, second to Soto in goals and scoring, will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who will be seniors next year make up a strong group of players," 
Mistri said. "Our group of freshmen also did well this season, and we plan to 
go out and try to recruit some more just like them this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri regretted that Sunday's rematch with top-ranked Indiana wasn't played 
in better conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drizzled just about the whole game and that wasn't in the best interest of 
the style of soccer we play," he said. "But the other team deserved to win the 
way they played." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton baseball team has added two transfers in time for the beginning 
of workouts Jan. 3 but lost a recent community college recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mitchell, a right-handed pitcher from Oxnard Rio Mesa High, has 
transferred from UCLA and Tony Martinez, an infielder who played for Sunny 
Hills High, has transferred from Porterville College. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Kastelic, a transfer from Rancho Santiago who was with the Titans during 
fall practice, will transfer elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was 2-4 last season at UCLA. George Horton, who handles the pitchers 
as the Titans' associate head coach under Coach Augie Garrido, is optimistic 
that Mitchell will help the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mitchell has all the physical attributes you want in a pitcher," Horton said 
of the junior. "He has a strong body and a good arm. We're looking forward to 
working with him. He pitched mainly in relief for UCLA the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton made a big effort in arranging to have Sunday's NCAA soccer game at 
Indiana broadcast on KMNY radio. Most of the second-half broadcast was lost, 
however, because of problems with the telephone equipment at the game site, 
according to Mel Franks, the school's assistant athletic director for media 
relations. The phone hookup was restored for the final five minutes of the 
game.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Curt Bauer (third year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 16-5-3, 7-4-1 in Sea View League; lost in semifinals of the Division 
IV playoffs to Riverside Poly, 2-2, on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Mike Allred, sweeper, Sr.; Matt Blasdel, midfielder, Jr.; Matt 
Eberle, midfielder, Sr.; Seth George, forward, Sr.; Miguel Godoy, forward, Sr.; 
Chon Kantikovit, midfielder, Jr; Ryan Korinke, defender, Sr.; Tim Padayachee, 
defender, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Paul Greco, defender, Sr.; Matt Moses, midfielder, So.; Brian 
Piesner, forward, Jr.; Bryce Popko, defender, Jr.; Shawn Saunders, defender, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Eagles already were going to be formidable, based on their summer 
season -- two league titles and a runner-up. But with the addition of Piesner, 
who was the MVP of his high school team in Texas, they might be the best in the 
county. "He's got great skills," Bauer said of the left-footed Piesner. "He can 
pass, shoot -- a great package." Padayachee returns after missing last season 
with a broken foot, but Saunders will miss much of this season with the same 
injury. George was a Times' All-County first-team selection last season.

 Coach: Eddie Carrillo (seventh year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 9-12-2, 2-6-2 in Century League. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Jerry Arguello, defender, Sr.; Victor Diaz, forward, So.; Steve 
Gonzalez, midfielder, So.; Victor Lopez, sweeper, Sr.; Lalo Rodriguez, 
midfielder, Sr.; Neil Van Zuiden, keeper, So.; Omar Velazquez, forward, Sr.; 
Aldo Zuniga, keeper, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Danny Caliss, forward, Fr.; Samuel Galindez, defender, Jr.; 
Shawn O'Malley, defender, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: After suffering through a tough season, Carrillo's team appears to be 
loaded. Nine starters and 14 lettermen, all of whom started at least one game, 
return, and a talented freshman, Caliss, could be one of the team's best. The 
front line is young but talented. The back appears to be Orange's strength. 
"Defense was our weakness last year," Carrillo said. "We're good up front, but 
we're still trying to get in sync." Goalkeeper is another strength. "We'll 
probably play each of them a half until one of them shows he can't do the job," 
Carrillo said. Rodriguez has been an all-league player the past three seasons, 
and Gonzalez was a second-team pick last season.

 Coach: Bob Chavez (second year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 17-4-5, 6-2-2 in South Coast League; lost in second round of Division 
II playoffs to Esperanza, 4-3, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Tyler Bargiel, defender, Sr.; Wade Fraser, midfielder, So.; Joe 
Kaplan, forward, Sr.; Deiter Segura, forward, Sr.; Brent Stringham, midfielder, 
Jr.; Sean Taeger, keeper, Sr.; Andy Valderrama, midfielder, So.; Jason Viloria, 
defender, Sr.; Jeff Wright, defender, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Ryan Conzelman, midfielder, Jr.; Ryan Kenyon, midfielder, Fr.; 
Patrick O'Brien, defender, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Ricky Le, a Times' All-County first-team midfielder, has graduated, 
but Chavez returns four starters and nine lettermen from a talented 1993 team. 
El Toro, which moves from the South Coast to the Sea View League, might not 
have as much talent as Santa Margarita, but it could have more depth, 
especially on defense. O'Brien, a transfer from Santa Margarita, could be a 
key. "He's a strong player with plenty of speed," Chavez said. Segura and 
Karlan bring scoring punch up front.

<P>
 1993-94: 19-5-1, 9-5 in Sunset League; lost in quarterfinals of Division I 
playoffs to Santa Monica, 1-0, in overtime. 
</P>

 Key returners: Beau Barnhart, midfielder, Sr.; Travis Clutter, forward, Sr.; 
Michael Dena, defender, Sr.; Ryan Fial, defender, Sr.; Chris Shay, keeper, Sr.

 Key newcomers: Jon Ginnaty, midfielder, Sr.; Mark Johnson, defender, Jr.; Todd 
Marcus, forward, Jr.; Jake Roquemore, midfielder, So.; Ed Uliaz, midfielder, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Marcus, who lost only three games in three seasons as Edison's JV 
coach, takes over a talented and experienced group led by Clutter (a first-team 
all-league selection last season), Barnhart, Dena, Marcus and Fial (a 
second-team all-league pick). After making the playoffs as a wild-card team 
last season, Edison upset top-seeded Royal in the playoffs' first round before 
losing to Santa Monica. Uliaz is a transfer from Arcadia High who played in 
Australia last year. If the Chargers can stay healthy -- they weren't able to 
last season -- they should do a lot better than a wild-card berth this season.

 Coach: Kino Oaxaca (seventh year).

<P>
 1993-94: 18-6-5, 8-1-1 in the Empire League; lost in Division II finals to 
Mater Dei, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Shaun Anderson, fullback, Sr.; Ryan Pirski, halfback, Sr.; 
Albert Raya, halfback, Sr.; Marc Rodieck, forward, Jr.; Victor Tiborczszeghy, 
sweeper, Sr.; Jason Wolf, stopper, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Adam DeLuca, forward, Jr.; Tommy LaRochelle, keeper, Sr.; Aaron 
Pugmire, forward, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Oaxaca's teams have reached the Division II playoff finals three of 
the last seven seasons, but they must take a different path this season as they 
move to the powerful Sunset League. Esperanza's strength will be on defense 
with Tiborczszeghy, the team's fastest player, and Anderson, both second-team 
All-Empire League selections. Wolf was also a second-team member, and Rodieck 
returns after missing last season with a broken leg. Esperanza's power was up 
front last season with Mark Alleman, the league's offensive MVP. "The skill 
level and depth is a lot better now," Oaxaca said. "Last year, we concentrated 
on one player (Alleman)."

 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Blunt has gained 1,528 yards in 248 carries (a 6.2-yard 
average) and has scored 22 touchdowns, third best among area City Section 
players. In the Braves' three playoff games, Blunt has rushed for 477 yards and 
six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Blunt was one of the reasons the Braves won their City 3-A 
Division semifinal, rushing for 221 yards and scoring three touchdowns in 25 
carries. Blunt, a 6-foot, 170-pound tailback, had to accomplish most of his 
work without his fullback, Marvin Powell, who left the game in the first half 
because of a neck injury. "He's an exceptional back," Coach Chick Epstein said. 
"He's playing sensationally."

Sr.; Joey Vazquez, forward, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Keith Hedenberg, forward, Jr; Ben Martin, forward, So.; Ryan 
Sutagaki, midfielder, Fr.; Nick Tolman, midfielder, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: How can a team that won only five games last year be considered one 
of the county's best? Easy, it returns nine starters who lost several close 
games and wound up winning the Orange County summer league. Fountain Valley 
starts three sophomores and two freshmen, Tolman and Sutagaki. But Smith said 
his young players are plenty talented. "We're very tough defensively and 
offensively, we go hard to the ball," Smith said. "We finish when we get our 
chances." Vazquez, who Smith thinks can be one of the county's best forwards, 
is Fountain Valley's best finisher. Ritter was an All-Sunset League first-team 
selection last season.

SIDELINES; NORTHRIDGE'S O'LAUGHLIN SHOWS A DEGREE OF LOYALTY TO ILLINOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Cal State Northridge quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin succeeds in his quest for 
a professional career, he will be remembered around these parts as many things. 
</P>
<P>
 The best quarterback in Northridge history . . . member of a national honor 
society . . . stand-up guy with lots of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a scholastic quirk, though, the following won't be included in his 
biography: Cal State Northridge graduate.  
</P>
<P>
 Huh? Even though he spent his junior and senior years at Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, a kinesiology major, attended Illinois for three years before 
transferring to Northridge last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he already had completed many core classes in his major, he will 
graduate with a degree from Illinois next spring -- even though he hasn't been 
there in months. 
</P>
<P>
 Digitized: The Chaminade High girls' basketball team is becoming a skeleton 
crew. Skeletal problems are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Sheila Shalati has rheumatoid arthritis and center Nicole Rossi has a 
recurring shoulder problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her shoulder can dislocate at the snap of a finger," Coach Lisa Magorien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. An unfortunate choice of words. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrie Clavadetscher suffered a broken finger in a tournament game Friday. 
Rossi's shoulder held up, but she too broke a finger the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent-minded: The Nordhoff boys' basketball team was already opening the 
season shorthanded because several players were still on the football team, but 
the Rangers almost began without their starting backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb and Allen Thornton transferred from Ventura in September. The brothers 
practiced with the team but were ineligible to play in games until the family 
moved to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their parents said they were moving sometime during the season," Coach Jim 
Hall said. "I hoped it would be soon -- they had been trying since August." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thorntons found a new house two weeks ago and the brothers set up shop on 
the court immediately thereafter. The pair have led the team in scoring in 
every game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley floor: Count the Valley College gym among the facilities that have 
been restored after suffering heavy damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was able to land Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to pay 
for a new floor and lights in the men's gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Ferrero, Valley's athletic director, said the project cost an estimated 
$400,000, including the labor to remove the old floor and lights and to remove 
then reinstall the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new surface is imported from Denmark and has hand-painted graphics. 
Ferrero said it's the same type of floor used throughout Europe and at several 
U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that stomping up and down the court, the floor already has started to 
take a beating. But not the Monarchs. The Valley men's and women's teams each 
are 2-0 on the floor. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as though the Valley College football record book would remain 
intact for years after what Sean Fitzgerald did in 1993. But along came Jim 
Arellanes to force a reprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a sophomore transfer from Northern Arizona, set career and 
single-season records with 3,908 yards and a 62.3% completion rate. He set 
single-season marks with 246 completions and 30 touchdowns. The latter also 
tied a career record set by Barry Hanks in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes also set a state single-game record with 639 yards against 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes surpassed Fitzgerald's single-season records for yards (3,134), 
completions (234), touchdowns (27) and completion rate (58.8%) set last year. 
Fitzgerald plays at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Best ever: Junior running back Ted Iacenda of Hart High has 40 touchdowns, the 
best single-season performance in area history. Iacenda has scored 29 
touchdowns rushing and 11 receiving. Iacenda passed Russell White, who had 38 
touchdowns for Crespi in 1987. Quotebook 
</P>

 Chatsworth boys' basketball Coach Bill Whiting, after his Chancellors and 
Canoga Park teams had combined for 199 points: "Their offense was faster than 
our defense, and our offense was faster than their defense." Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge setter Kathleen Shannon was named most valuable player of the 
National Invitational Volleyball Championship on Sunday after leading the 
Matadors to a victory over San Jose State in the title match. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, a senior transfer from Illinois, had 248 assists, 40 digs, 16 total 
blocks and 13 kills. Northridge (23-8) posted a 6-0 record in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior outside hitter Missy Clements also was named to the All-NIVC team. 
Clements, Northridge's all-time leader with 1,464 kills, had 92 kills with a 
.330 hitting percentage, 61 digs, 12 total blocks and five service aces. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements set two single-season records in 1994. Her 551 kills broke the mark 
of 546 -- set by Kristy Olson in 1984 -- and her 4.75 kills-per-game average 
shattered the mark of 4.20 set by Aimee Stone in 1993. Things to Do

GIRLS' SOCCER / TEAMS TO WATCH; GRANT, CHATSWORTH VIE IN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Girls' soccer, one of the fastest growing high school sports across the 
nation, is alive and kicking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, Grant High will try to stave off perennial power 
Chatsworth in an attempt to repeat as City champion. The Chancellors still feel 
the sting of having their five-year reign ended last season, and are determined 
to regain the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section bragging rights will be contested by a number of teams, 
including Royal, Quartz Hill and La Reina. 
</P>
<P>
 CHATSWORTH 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Jack Sidwell 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 16-1-1 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: After seeing their dominance of the City end last year, the 
Chancellors are back and again loaded with talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "All good things must come to an end," said Sidwell, whose team fell in the 
City semifinals to San Pedro after winning five consecutive titles. "We took 
(San Pedro) much too lightly, but the players want to crank it up again this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Chatsworth has lost two players to graduation and another pair to knee 
injuries, the cupboard is far from bare. All-City selections Melinda George and 
Kim Pickup lead the way. George, a senior and the team's leading scorer last 
season (30 goals), will patrol the midfield with her sisters Michelle, a 
junior, and Pamela, a sophomore. Pickup, a junior fullback, will team with 
Lindsay Bolita on defense. Senior Krista Ogasawara and sophomore Denise Paul 
are expected give the Chancellors strength at forward. 
</P>
<P>
 GRANT 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Wilber Quintanilla 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 18-3 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Led by standout goaltender Kelly Kiley-Boynton and seven other 
starters, Grant seeks to defend its City Section championship. Kiley-Boynton, a 
senior, has been the bane of City shooters and impressed Quintanilla, her 
first-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can put some of the boys' goalkeepers her age to shame," he said. "She's 
not afraid to do anything in the goal, her positioning is impeccable and she's 
a complete athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling the field in front of Kiley-Boynton will be sweeper Maricca 
Pichaikul and center midfielder Katy Walzey, both seniors. Senior Nicole 
Bucciarelli, returning City player of the year, should take care of the scoring 
from her forward position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have a shot at another championship, but we will play some very 
weak teams along the way and we can't let those results go to our head," 
Quintanilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 BUENA 
</P>
<P>
 COACHES: Ed Daane and Barbara Huskey 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 21-3-5 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Channel League champions last season, the Bulldogs advanced to the 
semifinals of the Division II playoffs, losing to Esperanza on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so close and it was really sad to see it end that way," Huskey said. 
"But a lot of the girls knew they would be back to take another shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight starters return, including Monica Almaraz, the Foothill League's most 
valuable player and an All-Southern Section selection. A senior who splits time 
between midfield and forward, Almaraz had 15 goals and eight assists last 
season. She will team with junior Kristina Quiroz (12 goals, 17 assists), 
another All-Southern Section pick, who also plays forward and midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Key players on the back line are fullbacks Megan Monday, a sophomore, and 
Stacy Hebert, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 CRESCENTA VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Judd Bogust 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 12-6-3 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Depth? Experience? Talent? This is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons didn't lose a single starter off last season's team that tied 
Arcadia for the Pacific League championship. Of 18 players, Bogust suits up 14 
juniors, three sophomores and two seniors. All but four played varsity as 
freshmen, and six players were all-league selections last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we achieved what we thought we should have," said Bogust, whose 
team fell in the second round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs to 
Ontario. "This year we should get to at least the final four. We'll need luck 
but you don't get lucky unless you have preparation and practice behind you, 
and this group is deadly serious in practice. I think I've finally convinced 
them they're running out of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons are strong in the midfield. Junior Michele Cena, co-MVP of the 
Pacific League last season and a second-team All-Southern Section selection, is 
joined by junior Heidi Greco, a third-team all-section pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior goaltender Marla Nelson posted 11 shutouts and a 0.8 goals against 
average last season. Defenders and sisters Danielle and Hope Robertshaw are 
solid, with Danielle, a senior and the team's MVP two years ago, coming back 
from a knee injury that sidelined her last season. 
</P>
<P>
 HART 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Oliver Germond 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 13-5-4 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: A year after leading the Indians to unprecedented success in his 
first season, Germond faces a rebuilding task he hopes to have conquered by the 
time Foothill League play begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new team," said Germond, who guided Hart to a share of the league 
championship with Canyon and to the Division III Southern Section 
quarterfinals. "Last year we had a lot of speed, but now it's going to be quick 
touches (of the ball) and a lot of movement by the players to get open." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way will be midfielders Nancy James and Laura Qualls. James, a 
senior, went from a scoreless sophomore year to scoring 18 goals last season. 
Qualls, a sophomore, was the only freshman to start for the Indians last season 
and joined James as all-league selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior goaltender Kathleen Baldwin also will have an impact in her fourth 
season on the varsity and second as starting goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 LA REINA 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Joe Larenta 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 21-2 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Larenta and La Reina planned on playing for the Division IV title 
last season, so being bumped in the semifinals by Chadwick came as a blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Before feeling sorry for the Regents, however, consider that the team has won 
four consecutive Tri-Valley League titles, hasn't lost a league game in that 
time and has only lost four games in four years to Division IV opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 La Reina lost two players from last season's powerhouse, including 1993-94 
Division IV player of the year Michelle Nuesca, who scored 48 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returnees will be junior center-midfielder Samantha Conroy (32 goals) and 
senior goalie Jennifer LaFemina. LaFemina, Division IV goalie of the year in 
'92-93, was second in voting for the award last season and posted a 
goals-against average of 1.1 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior stopper Katie Russell, a second-team All-Southern Section selection 
last season, will push the ball up the field to sophomore forward Alicia 
Bueschen, who set La Reina's freshman scoring record with 26 goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 MOORPARK 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Jay Greene 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 11-10-1 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Greene took a team loaded with freshmen to second place in the 
Frontier League and the second round of the Division IV Southern Section 
playoffs last season. He is looking to advance farther this winter. "We were 
very young and the year was completely developmental," Greene said. "This year 
we expect to improve on what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, virtually the entire Musketeer lineup returns. Sophomore 
forward Elizabeth Christensen utilizes speed and tenacity on the front line, 
while classmate Amber McKenzie distributes well from the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Cooney, a former goalie, spent last season adjusting to playing in 
the field, but has become a solid fullback with an offensive flair. 
</P>
<P>
 QUARTZ HILL 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Maury Cauchon 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 17-4-1 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: In his first season, Cauchon inherits the defending Golden League 
champion, a team that has nine starters back. Junior midfielder Melissa Montes, 
freshman sweeper Shauna Murray and junior goaltender Veronica Rethi will give 
the Rebels strength up the middle. Junior forward April Smith keys the offense. 
Montes and Reihi, all-league selections last season, led Quartz Hill to a 
season-opening 2-1 victory over Moorpark last week and Cauchon likes what he 
sees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good, positive attitude and play quick, counter-attacking soccer," 
he said. "I'm very optimistic about the season." 
</P>
<P>
 ROYAL 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Andy Silva 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 13-4-4 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: After 13 years as boys' coach at rival Simi Valley, Silva moves 
cross-town to guide the girls' squad at Royal. Expect the Highlanders to send 
eight players on the attack, led by junior midfielder Tiffany Tackett, and, 
once she returns from knee surgery, senior striker Kelly Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackett likely will start at the center-midfield position, where her skill at 
distributing the ball will be a major benefit. Other impact players include 
senior fullback Jessica Crespo and freshman forward Alicia Bartholomew, only 
the fourth freshman to earn a spot on one of Silva's teams in his 22-year 
coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Mark Johnson 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 19-5-5 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: A powerful force in the Marmonte League for more than a decade, 
Johnson's team was well on the road to further glory last winter until the 
Northridge earthquake left its players' lives in disarray. Ranked second in the 
Southern Section and 5-0-1 before the earthquake, Simi Valley managed only a 
third-place finish in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly everyone had damage to their houses and many of the girls' families 
were living out of hotels," Johnson said. "Suddenly playing soccer wasn't that 
important but it helped give them some stability in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Bounced out of last season's Division I playoffs in the second round, Simi 
Valley expects to bounce back behind midfielder Monica Gerardo. Gerardo had 15 
goals and 16 assists last season and followed up the campaign by playing for 
the U.S. under-20 national team.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; FARR EXPECTED TO GO ON INJURED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, who suffered a hyperextended elbow Sunday 
against the Saints, is expected to be placed on injured reserve today and 
replaced on the roster by defensive end Jay Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has been working on the Rams' practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams thought Wayne Sevier, one of the game's premier special teams 
coaches, was going to make the difference in two or three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was not what they had in mind. Special teams blunders have 
played a prominent role in three or four of the team's losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about it, I fully accept the fact I haven't gotten it 
done on special teams," Sevier said. "Our special teams haven't done it and I 
haven't been able to communicate and motivate in a way that I normally feel I 
can do. And that's my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram special teams have allowed four returns for touchdowns, and in the last 
two games punt returner Todd Kinchen has fumbled the ball away three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still like these guys and I think you're going to find out that several of 
these guys are going to become starters at their positions for the Rams in the 
future," Sevier said. "I don't think our problems are the result of a drop-off 
in talent." T.J. SIMERS

RUDE INTRODUCTION; AT-RISK STUDENTS GET AN EARFUL AT JUVENILE PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They already suspected it was a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 And after being frisked by guards, eyeballed by inmates and hustled into a 
cellblock at the juvenile prison to be yelled at by a hard-eyed convicted 
killer, these Oxnard teen-agers were absolutely sure of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining gangs is a really bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent three-hour tour of the California Youth Authority's Ventura School in 
Camarillo convinced 13 Oxnard High School freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, chosen because low grades and poor attendance put them at risk 
of dropping out of school and into gangs, got an intimate lesson on hard time 
in the 54-acre compound rimmed with razor wire that awaits them if they mess 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The first face they saw -- after being scanned with metal detectors and locked 
in -- was Eddie Cue's. 
</P>
<P>
 Cue, a CYA gang information officer, has ushered 3,000 at-risk Ventura County 
teen-agers through the Ventura School. The program began a year ago after he 
finally convinced officials on both sides of its 18-foot-high fence that the 
program could turn kids away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Cue warned the nine boys and four girls: Gang members lose control of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell you what you're going to eat, when you're going to eat, what you can 
wear, what kind of makeup you can wear," said Cue, perched on a cafeteria 
table, his voice barely audible over the crackling chorus of guards' 
walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you step through that door you're no longer in Ventura County, you're no 
longer part of the homeboys or whatever," he said. "You're in the Ventura 
School." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are cocky, he warned, you risk being hurt by other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes about a minute and a half for security to respond to an incident in 
this institution," Cue said. "But when you're the one being pounded on, that 
minute and a half seems like an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 He told them of strip searches, tiny cells and hard beds. He told them about 
inmates wielding sharpened toothbrushes, and he pointed out the high fence 
rigged with concertina wire, cameras and tripwires. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took them all the way inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Marching them double-file, mouths shut, hands in pockets, Cue led them into a 
cellblock and shut the door. 
</P>
<P>
 They faced two murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to jail when I was a teen-ager like you," said Martin Luevano, 24, 
handsome and calm. "I was 16 years old, into the fast life, partying and like 
that. I made a wrong decision when I took someone's life. I took something 
special. That person could have been President, and I took that away." 
</P>
<P>
 Luevano warned them: "This is a reality check for you. You guys don't open up 
your minds and your eyes, this is what's going to happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeboys and home girls will drift away. No one will care but family. Other 
inmates will make your life miserable. And you still have to attend classes and 
do homework, he said, looking each teen-ager in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost tenderly, Luevano added, "When the bullet bites you, it's gonna 
bite you hard, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then up stepped Raul Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in here since I was 15. I'm 23 now. I'm in here for gang banging," 
he said flatly. "I've been in here 7 1/2 years going on eight, waiting to go 
home. Any of you gang banging now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Face-to-face behind bars with a murderer, the visitors were smart enough to 
shut up and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 But one. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen and husky, the buzz-cut boy with a fuzzy mustache raised his hand and 
proudly claimed membership in one of Oxnard's La Colonia gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar's eyes locked onto him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why you gang bangin', man?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cause that's where I'm from," the boy replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, so you gotta be down for the hood. Why you down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cause all my relatives are." 
</P>
<P>
 "You claim Sur?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know about Sur? What you think Sur means?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sur is one of the meanest prison gangs in California, man. Sur means if I 
send you on a mission, you got to do it. What do you wanna be when you grow 
up?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do they call you in your neighborhood?" 
</P>
<P>
 And so went the grilling. Five minutes stretched to 10. Aguilar leaned forward 
intensely, foot on a chair, his voice rising and switching to obscene street 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's your enemy, El Rio?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 " You're . . . claiming Oxnard and you don't even know who your enemy is? You 
want to get killed? You want that for your family?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No."  
</P>
<P>
 "See that's what I'm talking about," Aguilar confided to the others, who sat 
stock still, barely glancing at him now. "You don't even know what you're gang 
banging for. Let me tell you something. I've never been to a high school dance. 
I even forget what it's like to have a girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed further, the boy admitted he is "a follower," seeking revenge for the 
gang-related deaths of his father and brother. That cut no ice with the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was taken out too," Aguilar said. "I'm the only vato left in my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 And the lecture continued, the hardened inmate hammering away at the stubborn 
kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Aguilar threw up his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pffft. You wanna be a follower, then be a follower," he said. "End up in 
here, if you're not dead. . . . You know, you're only 14, man. When you gonna 
get your (act) together?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later," the boy replied, a little less defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cue moved the group on to the school's chapel, where three girls perched on 
the rail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stuff that goes on in here is stuff you wouldn't want to see -- girls get 
gang-raped here," said inmate Leah Whitaker, 21. "There was a 14-year-old girl 
in here, and four girls gang-raped her with a broom. And the guys. . . . They 
treat you like a piece of meat." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no privacy, warned Whitaker, serving time for kidnaping. Your 
cellmate sees just about everything you do, she said, and the guards can peer 
through the glass window in each cell door whenever they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to change?" she said. "They don't care. You're sitting on the toilet, 
they're standing there talking to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Then another inmate told of being locked up since she was 13 -- four years ago 
-- for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little things that you guys get to do, we don't," the inmate said. 
"Getting up and going to the kitchen to get a soda on a commercial, we don't 
get to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who misbehave are locked into their cells on Saturdays for 23 hours, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, again, the 14-year-old boy dared to admit his gang membership, and again 
he was dressed down -- this time by two furious girls. 
</P>
<P>
 After they calmed down, Cue switched on a video -- a montage of prison scenes 
narrated by actors reading actual letters from juvenile inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took them outside and let even more inmates confront the teen-agers in 
groups -- without guards or adults hovering over them. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls clustered with the girls, listening to tales from the inside. Here 
and there, boys paired off with individual inmates. But one group clustered 
around the self-proclaimed gang member, and two of his classmates looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't listen to people out there, you'll come in here and you'll listen 
to cops and you'll listen to us," said Tracy Usry, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the boy's facade was breaking down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you doing here?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm busted for murder. I got 31 to life, homie." 
</P>
<P>
 "How's that feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels (screwed) up. I got two kids," Usry replied.  
</P>
<P>
 "You seem like you're paying attention," he added. "Go home and think about it 
one night." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the kid nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every gang member or potential gang member is swayed from gang life by 
visiting the Ventura School, said Lou Flores, head of security for Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, they listen, "but when they get back to the element of school, they 
slide back into their routine," he said. Three out of a dozen teen-agers, maybe 
a dozen out of every 40, will stay away from gangs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cue said, "If we can at least reach one, we're looking good." 
</P>
<P>
 The day afterward, three of the young visitors said the tour convinced them 
that they were right to resist pressure to join their neighborhood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I do think of joining them . . . I'd think that it's fun joining 
them," said one 14-year-old boy. But he walked away with a lesson: "Think about 
it before you do it. . . . I should listen to my mom, listen to my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the 17-year-old girl who had killed, a 15-year-old Oxnard High 
student said, "I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that scared me the most was going and talking to them face to 
face," he added. "In there, you gotta watch your back. . . . Like they said, 
who'd you rather take orders from -- those guards, those guys or your mom?"

SUPERVISORS REJECT BID BY DISTRICT TO SELL LAND; OXNARD: BOARD CITES VIOLATION 
OF COUNTY'S PLANNING LAWS HAD 27-ACRE LEMON GROVE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deciding that even school districts must obey county planning laws, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday rejected the Oxnard high school 
district's bid to sell a 27-acre lemon orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors voted 4 to 0 against the district's request to sell a citrus grove 
behind the new Oxnard High School on Gonzales Road near Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 By upholding a county Planning Commission decision, supervisors effectively 
killed the district's chance to recoup its $2.1-million purchase price by 
selling the land back to its original owner. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors said they felt torn between the needs of students and 
protecting county agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing the Oxnard Union High School District to sell the orchard would 
violate county planning laws and encourage future development in the 
agricultural area between Oxnard and Ventura, supervisors said. 
</P>
<P>
 By choosing to build a school on the strip of farmland, supervisors said the 
district may have already triggered a "domino effect" that will lead to more 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be one of the most difficult decisions I've had to face because of 
my love for education and my love for agriculture," Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said: "The domino effect has already begun. The domino effect began 
when the school district bought that piece of property. I think it's important 
the board not let the second domino fall." 
</P>
<P>
 County zoning laws forbid landowners from creating lots smaller than 40 acres 
in agricultural areas, a rule that county officials say protects farmland and 
discourages development. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said the county's concern over guarding agricultural 
areas may backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their best option was to let us sell it and keep it in agriculture," Supt. 
Bill Studt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to sell the orchard, school officials said they may build on it. The 
site may become the future home of Oxnard Adult School or a new continuation 
school, Studt said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the district's original plan. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials bought the 26.6-acre orchard in 1992 as part of a larger, 
80-acre plot on the south side of Gonzales Road, midway between Patterson Road 
and Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district needed only 53 acres for a school to replace the 
existing Oxnard High on 5th Street, officials said they had trouble finding 
properties that were larger than 40 acres but smaller than 80. 
</P>
<P>
 The district considered building the school on Patterson Road at the edge of 
the Oxnard city limits, but gave up the idea in the face of community protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure to buy land quickly so they could qualify for state funds to 
build the new campus, school officials entered into a deal with Ag Land 
Services and Maland Enterprises -- then joint owners of the 80-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county planning officials opposed the proposed school from the start, 
state law allows school districts to circumvent local zoning laws by condemning 
property needed for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 So the district signed a condemnation agreement with the landowners that 
obligated Maland to buy back the leftover 26.6 acres at the original selling 
price prior to Dec. 31, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials knew that they could resell the land only if the county 
agreed to bend its 40-acre-minimum rule and designate the grove as a legal lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said Tuesday that school officials were presumptuous to assume 
that they could get such approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district seemed to know what the consequences were, knew they were taking 
a risk and that risk was with the students," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said they believed that the county would grant an 
exception in their case because of the unusual circumstances. The district is 
the only public agency to own property in the area and the only landowner to 
acquire its acres through condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now school officials are wondering what to do with the lemon orchard, which 
costs the district about $175,000 a year in interest on the bonds used to buy 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county officials have suggested that the district hold on to the land as 
an investment property. 
</P>
<P>
 With the city of Oxnard expected to consider annexing the area where the 
school is located, the district may be able to eventually sell the property and 
earn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said Tuesday that they cannot afford either to hold on to 
the property or keep farming it. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of such financial hardship, school board President Nancy Koch said she 
was shocked by the county's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you knew the hours and money and the time that has been spent on getting 
that school built and to be portrayed as being against agriculture. . . ," Koch 
said after the meeting. "It's just very frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more important: kids or lemons?"

SCIENTISTS CITE POSSIBLE TOXIC EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE; MEDFLIES: PANEL MEETING IN 
CAMARILLO SAYS MALATHION MAY CAUSE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN AND 
SENIORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A panel of scientists opposing aerial spraying to control the Medfly 
infestation said one of the state's own scientists warned about the chemical's 
possible toxic effects on humans more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists, speaking at a community meeting in Camarillo Monday night, said 
there is strong evidence that the pesticide causes chronic health problems in 
children and senior citizens and is suspected of damaging human genes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's own expert in 1980 determined that there was a significant danger 
of chronic toxicity and possible genetic damage to children and the elderly who 
were exposed to malathion," said panelist Paul McClain, a Pomona-based 
molecular biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal agriculture officials have conducted four aerial sprayings 
of the 16-square-mile Medfly eradication zone in east Camarillo since the first 
fruit fly was found there Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 That response was excessive and premature, panelists said. A better approach, 
they argued, would have been to fight the infestation by releasing a 
combination of sterile Medflies and beneficial fly-eating insects followed by 
limited ground sprayings of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 While no representatives of the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project 
attended the forum, Peter Kurtz, chief toxicologist and senior medical 
coordinator for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said 
officials stand by their decision to use aerial spraying for preventing the 
spread of the crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the spraying program poses no significant health risks to people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the millions of people that have been exposed to this chemical there 
have only been anecdotal reports and allegations of people becoming sick from 
such exposure," Kurtz said. "To date, however, there hasn't been a single, 
verifiable case of illness being caused by exposure to malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3 1/2-hour meeting in a Camarillo Springs union hall, attended by about 
250 people, was sponsored by the Ventura County Group Against Spraying People, 
or GASP, along with other Southern California-based anti-malathion 
organizations and political figures. 
</P>
<P>
 William Jordan, a University of California, Berkeley entomologist and one of 
Monday's panelists, said state officials' conclusion that aerial spraying of 
malathion was the best method of eradication amounted to poor science and bad 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're engaged in a war with an insect whom we don't know a damned thing 
about," Jordan said. "We knew more about the Soviets during the cold war than 
we do about the Medfly." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Jordan, Ventura entomologist Everett Dietrick said there are healthier 
and safer alternatives to aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrick, president of the Rincon-Vitova insectarium, said the safest and most 
cost-effective option involves beneficial insects and parasites that naturally 
seek out and feed upon Medflies. The release of such insects and parasites 
would be backed up by limited ground-based sprayings of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we know of some 20 parasites that are all natural enemies of 
Medflies," Dietrick said. "I can tell you this, if it wasn't for biological 
controls, the citrus industry as we know it today wouldn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Gaishin, chairwoman of GASP, said the fledgling group will continue to 
push the state to suspend its aerial spraying operations over eastern 
Camarillo. In its place, the group will advocate alternative methods of Medfly 
control raised by the panelists Monday.

BOARD TOLD INVESTMENTS AREN'T HIGH RISK; FINANCES: SUPERVISORS ALSO HEAR THAT 
NO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT INVESTED IN THE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED ORANGE COUNTY 
PORTFOLIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County does not make the same type of high-risk investments that led 
to the $1.5-billion loss in value to Orange County's investment fund, county 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Hal Pittman assured the Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be conservative," Pittman said, "but I sleep better at night knowing 
we're getting a reasonable rate of return." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman also assured the board that none of the county's 20 school districts 
had invested money in the Orange County portfolio. And a survey of Ventura 
County's 10 cities showed none had invested money with financially troubled 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not involved in any way, shape or form," said Anita Bingham, 
Camarillo's finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley said a large chunk of their 
investments were in the California State Treasurer's Local Agency Investment 
Fund and in U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very conservative investment strategy," said Mike Sedell, assistant 
city manager in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman, however, told supervisors that two local school districts had 
consulted with him and the county superintendent of schools office six months 
ago about putting money into Orange County's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pittman declined to name the two school districts, because he and Ventura 
County school officials talked the districts out of making the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always tempting when someone says you can get 2%, 3% or 4% more on your 
interest rate than what you are currently getting," Pittman said. "But when 
something seems too good to be true, it generally is." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron resigned Monday after it was 
disclosed that the investment pool he managed for the county and 180 other 
public agencies across the state had lost $1.5 billion, or 20%, of its value 
this year. Citron's office had borrowed more than $12 billion in complex 
transactions designed to heighten the funds' return if interest rates held firm 
or fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County got into trouble when interest rates began climbing, Pittman 
told the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened is that the debt service on the money borrowed now exceeds 
the income they have coming in, therefore they have a cash-flow problem," 
Pittman said. "In order to get cash, they either have to borrow additional 
money or sell off investments at sizable losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman said Ventura County does not borrow money to make investments, but 
that he could understand how others would have been attracted to Orange 
County's strategy because it was successful for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are difficult times," Pittman said. "I think you can liken this to 
putting a plate of food in front of someone who is extremely hungry or 
starving. The temptation is really there." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., praised 
the county for its conservative investment strategies. He said the first 
priority should always be the protection of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the county is on the right track with its investment philosophy," 
Saliba said. "The key element is maintaining the county's good credit rating." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a survey in May of the state's 14 largest counties singled out Ventura 
County for having the strongest financial standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's low debt level, coupled with a $34-million surplus in last 
year's budget, put the county at the top of the list, according to the San 
Francisco-based banking firm of Prager, McCarthy & Sealy. 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor-Controller Thomas Mahon said that even before the study came 
out the county's bond rating had improved from A to A+, which makes it cheaper 
to borrow money through bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mahon said Orange County has also had high bond ratings, and as a 
result the rating system will probably come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we're still going to have to prove to the rating agencies that there's 
Orange County, and there's Ventura County, and that we're on top because we do 
things the right way," he said.

VENTURA REJECTS CAP ON POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council has issued a resounding "No" to campaign contribution 
limits, defeating by 4 to 2 a proposal to cap political donations at $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of council members have received special interest dollars and have 
voted against those special interest dollars time and again," said Councilman 
Gregory L. Carson, arguing that limits are unnecessary because contributions do 
not buy votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal came from Councilman Steve Bennett, who raised more than $20,000 
for his 1993 council campaign while refusing any donation above $100. 
Councilman Gary Tuttle joined Bennett Monday in voting for the proposal, and 
Councilman Jack Tingstrom was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four council members gave a myriad of reasons for their opposition 
to the idea, including the disadvantage it would give first-time candidates who 
need money to build name recognition. Others said the proposal would 
unnecessarily hamstring the voting process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The electoral process is something we should be very careful about messing 
with because it's a key to our freedom," Mayor Tom Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal garnered considerable support from the audience, with speaker 
after speaker exhorting the council to approve the caps and restore confidence 
in public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are tired of the perception that politicians are selling their votes 
to the highest bidders," said Joy Kobayashi, a Ventura resident, adding that 
with contribution limits "people can once again feel that they make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think campaign contributions bring council members further away from the 
citizens who support them," said Elaina Fletcher, a resident who is 
spearheading a recall effort against Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall petition states, in part, that Measures breached conflict of 
interest rules by vocally supporting a land-swap proposal from builder Ron 
Hertel, who is Measures' friend, former business associate and largest single 
campaign contributor. Measures denies that any of those factors influenced her 
enthusiasm for Hertel's project, which failed this past summer for lack of 
council support. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures and Fletcher have been on less-than-cordial terms since Fletcher 
announced her recall campaign this summer, but the two had never clashed in 
public. Monday, however, Measures took time from the hearing to defend her 
voting record against Fletcher's allegations and to threaten Fletcher with a 
lawsuit if she continues to make such charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are liable, and you may find yourself in court," a grim-faced Measures 
warned from the dais. "I find it appalling that I have been accused of things 
that are absolutely false. . . . Less than one-tenth of my (campaign) money 
came from developers, and if 99% of it came from developers, it would not make 
an ounce of difference." 
</P>
<P>
 As other council members smothered grins of amusement, Measures and Fletcher 
continued a tete-a-tete for about five minutes, until Buford cut them off to 
resume the debate on the contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's proposal would have banned political contributions of more than $100 
by individuals, businesses or political action groups. The contribution limit 
would have extended to any group formed to support or oppose City Council 
candidates.

PANEL STUDIES IMPACT OF ADVENTIST PROJECT; DEVELOPMENT: THOUSAND OAKS PLANNING 
COMMISSION IS HOLDING FOUR SESSIONS ON THE PROPOSED CAMPUS AND SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lengthy Thousand Oaks Planning Commission hearing, centered on the 
environmental hazards of a massive new shopping center and school campus 
proposed for Newbury Park, ended without resolution early Tuesday. So much 
information needed to be digested that commissioners agreed to spread the 
public hearing on the Seventh-day Adventist project over four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first session, which ran for five hours and ended shortly after 
midnight, planning commissioners grilled city experts on how the $100-million 
project might threaten endangered plants, cause traffic snarls and create smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners combed through a lengthy environmental report outlining 
potential impacts of the 179-acre project planned just north of the Ventura 
Freeway near Wendy Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 supporters of the Seventh-day Adventist development signed up to 
speak but most, daunted by the technical discussion, left Monday night's public 
hearing before being called upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they would speak in a language we could understand," said one 
supporter as she walked out of the hearing. "This is just too confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the five-hour hearing, commissioners had questioned city 
planners about half of the 19 areas in which environmental impacts were 
expected. They ranged from seismic hazards, which were considered minimal, to 
the plowing under of several endangered plant species. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, the commission agreed to adjourn and take up the 
remaining issues at a special meeting at 7 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who did speak Monday night, only Sierra Club spokeswoman Cassandra 
Auerbach raised serious concerns about the project's potential threat to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Auerbach criticized the project for its massive scale, saying it conflicted 
with the city's General Plan and could cause "extreme and widespread 
environmental harm." 
</P>
<P>
 "In simple terms," she said, "the project is an environmental disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Spread over the rugged terrain visible from the Ventura Freeway, the 
$100-million shopping complex and school campus project would necessitate 
cutting into steep hillsides and bulldozing 68 acres of sage scrub and 
grassland. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would displace 74 acres of wildlife habitat with restaurants, retail 
shops, a Target store and a 12-screen movie theater. To accommodate the 
thousands of residents coming to the complex every day, developers would need 
to widen roads, erect new traffic signals and rebuild a freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 However, of the Seventh-day Adventist church's 458 acres, 279 would remain 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the project said the finished development would blend nicely 
into the hillside and generate huge amounts of new revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at how this project was designed you would see that we 
intentionally left a vast portion of the land open," said architect Francisco 
Behr. "Some people just want to pick this apart." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the financial impacts of the project, an issue that will be discussed 
in detail Thursday, commissioners had varying viewpoints about the project's 
threat to local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am certainly concerned about how a third major shopping center could impact 
The Oaks mall and Thousand Oaks Boulevard," said Planning Commission Chairman 
Irving Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Commissioner Mervyn Kopp pointed to a report that shows the new center 
would bring added sales to the city and attract more shoppers from nearby 
cities such as Camarillo and Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the competition will end up being beneficial to everyone because 
there will be more shoppers coming into Thousand Oaks," Kopp said. "And I think 
the smaller retailers will be forced to improve service, because service is 
something the big box places don't do." 
</P>
<P>
 If the environmental impact report meets the commission's approval Thursday, 
the panel will take up the project for review next week.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; LIBRARY TAX IS BACKED IN SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura residents overwhelmingly support a library tax to increase operating 
hours at the city's two largest branches, a survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-seven percent of residents questioned said they would be willing to pay 
an annual levy to keep E. P. Foster and Wright libraries open more hours, 
according to a survey conducted by the Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,100 residents filled out the survey at 10 sites throughout the city in 
October, said Trish Cavanaugh, a spokeswoman for the library agency. Although 
the poll is not scientific, it does indicate a clear demand for better library 
service in Ventura, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want libraries to be open more hours and they're even willing to pay 
more tax to get that," she said. "I think it's really encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh said county library officials are now weighing whether to put a 
proposed library levy on the ballot next year so Ventura residents can vote on 
the issue. She said such proposals have passed in other counties where the 
measure required only a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But in areas where the levy needed two-thirds of the vote for approval, it 
usually failed, she said. The survey's results demonstrate high interest for a 
measure in Ventura, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to have a good idea that it would pass before you spend money 
getting it on a ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-three percent of the respondents said the city of Ventura should 
contribute money to add hours to the libraries' schedule. City officials are 
now considering such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of respondents, 57%, said they would be willing to pay $25 a year 
to support the libraries. The Library Services Agency's budget has been cut by 
40% over the past two years, from $10.1 million to $6.7 million, Cavanaugh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency runs 16 branches throughout the county, including those in Ventura.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL VETERAN PLISKY GIVEN A SPIRITED 
GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outgoing Oxnard Councilman Michael A. Plisky received a spirited, emotional 
and often humorous farewell Tuesday as second-term Mayor Manuel Lopez, 
incumbent Councilman Tom Holden and newcomer Dean L. Maulhardt took the oath of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of your quiet demeanor and low-key management style we felt you would 
need this," said Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt, handing Plisky, known for 
his brash demeanor, a nightstick as the crowd of about 150 laughed heartily. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), state Sen. Cathy 
Wright (R-Simi Valley), Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), Supervisor John K. 
Flynn and the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, Greater Oxnard Harbors and Tourism 
Bureau and others commended Plisky for his financial acumen and desire to run 
the city more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the candor with which you made your views known," said Steven 
Kinney of the Oxnard Economic Development Corp., which Plisky successfully 
fought to privatize. "No one has ever said, 'C'mon Mike, tell us what you are 
really thinking.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky did not seek reelection to the council, opting to run instead for the 
Oxnard Harbor District Board of Commissioners. He was elected to the harbor 
board, which governs the deep-water Port of Hueneme, and will begin his new 
position in January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final remarks as councilman, Plisky praised the other council members 
-- including Lopez, with whom he traded countless political barbs over the 
years -- as well as City Manager Tom Frutchey and City Atty. Gary Gillig. 
</P>
<P>
 And after receiving a cigar from Holden and a book from Lopez on the trains of 
North America -- apparently a hobby of his -- Plisky took the opportunity to 
honor his wife, former Oxnard City Clerk Mabi Covarrubias-Plisky, who is now 
deputy clerk for the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had many proud moments in my eight years on the Oxnard City Council," 
Plisky said, his voice cracking, "but meeting Mabi has been my proudest moment. 
I love you, sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky also said that if he had to thank one person it would be longtime 
Oxnard political consultant Don Gunn, who managed some of his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don is kind of a behind-the-scenes person," Plisky said of Gunn, who as usual 
was not present at the council meeting. ". . . He has helped me many times in 
my decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky was first elected to the Oxnard City Council in 1984. He lost a 
campaign for mayor to Takasugi in 1988, returning to the council in 1990. He 
also lost a second bid for mayor in 1992 to Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 After Plisky stepped down, Lopez, Holden and Maulhardt were sworn in as their 
friends, supporters and relatives applauded. Lopez then appointed Councilman 
Andres Herrera as mayor pro tem, replacing Plisky. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS TRIM ELECTION COST $18,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The name of the program is "Count Me In." 
</P>
<P>
 And since its inception in 1993, the Ventura County project has solicited more 
than 500 volunteers and dozens of community groups and business sponsors who 
have helped with election activities, saving the county more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors honored several volunteers and 
organizations with plaques and certificates of appreciation for saving $18,000 
in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 115 election volunteers gave their time to staff polling stations, 
11 business sponsors gave $250 each to cover election expenses and two 
newspapers, including The Times, donated advertising space. Dozens of community 
groups also contributed time or polling sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous statement about the community and about the 
resourcefulness of our managers," Supervisor Susan Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey also noted how 25 county library employees worked for the elections 
office in their spare time and donated $1,400 to the financially troubled 
county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Clerk Richard Dean credited Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar 
of voters, with starting the "Count Me In" program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the November election cost about $800,000, Bradley said he was 
pleased with the show of support from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start," he said. "We'll keep at it, so hopefully we can make it 
better." CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA CRUZ ISLAND; CONTROLLED BURN TO HELP 
REGENERATE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To help regenerate bishop pine trees on Santa Cruz Island, fire officials 
today will continue a two-day controlled burn of 1,200 acres on the northern 
portion of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, flames passed over 800 acres of the island 28 miles off the 
Ventura coast.The remaining 400 acres will be burned today beginning at 9 a.m. 
if weather permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Chaney, a botanist with the National Park Service, said this is the 
first time a controlled burn has been directed at a stand of bishop pines on 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Pines, she said, need a fire or intense heat to force the resin-sealed cones 
open. The seeds then fall to the ground and thrive in the blackened soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a fire is to restore a stand that has a lot of dead or decadent 
wood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire becomes even more important after a period of drought because the older 
trees are weakened and more susceptible to bark beetles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn is being conducted jointly by the National Park Service, California 
Department of Forestry and California Conservation Corps in cooperation with 
the Nature Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy owns 90% of the island. The rest belongs to the National Park 
Service. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; TELEDYNE AGREES TO PAY $500,000 FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teledyne Industries Inc. has agreed to pay a $500,000 fine to settle federal 
civil claims that its Newbury Park plant fraudulently performed tests and 
substituted faulty parts for electronic equipment sold to the Navy, the Justice 
Department announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement wraps up another in a series of defense fraud cases against 
Teledyne's Electronics Systems division in Newbury Park, costing the company a 
total of $16.91 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the Justice Department accused Teledyne of failing to properly 
check out radar test sets used by the Navy to calibrate and maintain electronic 
equipment that warships count on to identify aircraft as friendly or hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification systems, produced by Teledyne and other defense 
contractors, are important because they help ships and aircraft identify 
aircraft and thus avoid casualties from friendly fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, Teledyne informed the Defense Department's inspector 
general of production irregularities in its production of the test kits, 
Justice Department officials said. The company made the disclosure under the 
Defense Department's voluntary disclosure program that can hold the company 
without penalty if such irregularities are disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 But a subsequent investigation by the FBI's Ventura office and various 
military investigators found more problems than Teledyne had disclosed, 
officials said. The investigation concluded that Teledyne substituted faulty 
parts in the equipment and "fraudulently performed burn-in, quality and 
performance tests on the radar test sets," according to a Justice Department 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the results of the investigation, the Justice Department decided to 
pursue a civil fraud allegation against the company, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosanne O'Brien, a Teledyne spokeswoman, said the settlement has been expected 
since last summer, when the company set aside $11.3 million to settle a number 
of cases involving its facilities in Newbury Park and in Los Angeles County.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FALSE ALARMS CITED AT WORM CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A flurry of false fire calls from neighbors of the Worm Concern has sent 
firefighters to the Tierra Rejada Road green-waste recycling facility at least 
three times since the county ordered the company to close its doors last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the smoke and steam coming off decomposing piles of yard 
trimmings prompted the calls, not retribution from irate neighbors who also 
want the facility shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe these are legitimate calls," said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the 
Ventura County Fire Department. "There is smoke regularly coming from these 
piles, but at this point, we don't feel they pose any sort of threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department personnel plan to refer future calls to the county Air 
Pollution Control Department, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, if there's a legitimate danger, we'll send out our crews," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern, which uses worms to recycle yard trimmings into fertilizer, 
was ordered by the county Department of Environmental Health to stop accepting 
material Nov. 30 and vacate the site near Simi Valley by the end of the year. 
The business has continued accepting material, but the county has yet to 
enforce its "cease and desist" order. For 18 months, the company has operated 
on the 20-acre site without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's neighbors have complained bitterly about odors, dust and noise 
since it started accepting the material.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have also threatened a class-action suit and are trying to close the 
operation by pressuring the owners of the land to evict the Worm Concern. SCOTT

 With Thanksgiving and Hanukkah out of the way and Christmas not yet here, Cal 
Lutheran University students will celebrate another holiday Saturday -- 
Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lectures, singing and dancing performances in honor of the African American 
holiday will take place from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the Preus-Brandt Forum on 
the university's Thousand Oaks campus.The events are free and open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the celebration will be led by David Fulton, professor of 
Pan-African studies at Cal State Northridge. Organized jointly with the Ventura 
County chapter of the NAACP, the event will also feature a traditional African 
feast known as a Karamu.  
</P>
<P>
 The holiday is usually observed for seven days, Dec. 26 to Jan. 1, and 
stresses the principles of unity, self-determination, collective work and 
responsibility, purpose, creativity, cooperative economics and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's celebration is held earlier in December to avoid conflicts 
with final exams and winter vacation, Director of Multicultural Services Rosa 
Moreno said. IRA E. STOLL

 Newly elected Councilman Paul Miller appointed Kunz, who served as Miller's 
campaign manager, to the commission Monday night to replace Sherida 
Simmons.Simmons was appointed by Judy Mikels and served four years on the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The new commission will be seated Jan. 4, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunz, 34, said he viewed service on the commission as a challenge because of 
the ever-present conflict between development and land preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the critical thing I will need to do is balance steady, healthy 
growth against the need to preserve the quality of life we enjoy in Simi 
Valley," Kunz said. "That will be difficult, but I feel I'm up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he appointed Kunz because they tend to agree on development issues 
and because of Kunz's previous experience in municipal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming a lawyer, Kunz worked for the city of Simi Valley as an aide 
handling several land use and planning issues. He has also served as a 
legislative deputy and then as a field deputy for two Los Angeles City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Richard's experience will serve him well," Miller said. "He is a 
logical thinker and I believe he'll always have the best interests of the 
citizens at heart." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Kunz's appointment Monday, Mayor Greg Stratton reappointed 
Commissioner Michael Piper to a two-year term and Councilwoman Sandi Webb 
reappointed Commissioner Dave McCormick to a four-year term. MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 Defeated in his bid for a seat on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, 
Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery is considering resigning his city 
office and moving out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, who has two more years to serve on his four-year term, said he has 
received several job offers from securities firms that specialize in municipal 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is considering offers from companies in Nevada, Alabama and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd really like to stay here if we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he closed his own financial consulting business because of 
campaign demands and worked nights delivering newspapers to pay his bills. He 
has also been left with a $15,000 debt from his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to decide within a few weeks whether he will move or take a job in 
the area. SCOTT HADLY

THORNTON UPSET OVER THE ABSENCE OF HIS MOTHER AT TRIAL, DEFENSE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks murder defendant Mark Scott Thornton is upset that his mother 
has made only one brief appearance at his death-penalty trial and has now moved 
from the state, his lawyers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, charged with the murder of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, feels 
abandoned by his mother as he fights for his life, the defense attorneys said 
outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of good reason could there be for leaving?" railed Deputy Public 
Defender Susan R. Olson. "What kind of reason for her to leave her son in this 
situation right now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, concerned that the defense was trying to build sympathy for 
Thornton, sought to clarify in court the reasons for the mother's sudden 
departure, but the judge would not allow such questioning. Prosecutors declined 
to discuss the matter outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements about Thornton's mother, Markita Sarrazin, came as the defense 
neared the end of its case by calling a witness who testified to seeing a woman 
who resembled O'Sullivan driving alone about the same time prosecutors say 
Thornton had already abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancy Briscoe of Thousand Oaks said the woman seemed deeply upset as she 
drove down Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not a happy camper," Briscoe recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview is near the route that prosecutors say Thornton took with O'Sullivan 
before shooting her three times in the chest and back at a remote area of the 
Santa Monica Mountains on Sept. 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Sullivan's body was found 12 days later, Thornton told his grandmother 
in an audiotaped jailhouse visit that he feared being deserted by his mother 
and other loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just scared that everyone's gonna leave me in jail to rot," he told Lois 
Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 For defense attorneys, Markita Sarrazin's performance as a parent has been a 
major theme during the trial. His biological father is dead, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's attorneys first touched upon the subject of the mother moving to 
Nevada while Lois Thornton was on the witness stand Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandmother told jurors that she helped her daughter pack up before 
leaving. Prosecutors wanted to know what prompted the mother to leave, but 
Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath stopped the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, the 68-year-old grandmother said Markita Sarrazin moved Oct. 6, 
as lawyers were still selecting a jury in the case. She said her daughter and 
stepson were forced to move from their rented home in Thousand Oaks because it 
had been put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why they went to Nevada, Lois Thornton threw her hands in the air: "You 
better ask her." 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony and court records, Markita Sarrazin constantly 
belittled her son, kicked him out of her home when he was 17 or 18 and allowed 
him to go homeless for more than a year without providing any assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Markita Sarrazin appeared at several of her son's pretrial court hearings, 
including his arraignment. But she has been absent throughout most of the 
trial, attending for only half a day a week after it started. 
</P>
<P>
 Briscoe testified Tuesday to seeing a woman who looked like O'Sullivan driving 
on Fairview Road in the hours after the nurse first disappeared. The woman 
appeared to be alone in a black truck and was visibly upset, according to 
Briscoe. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness said she made a report with authorities about a week later, after 
seeing a television news story on the missing nurse. "The picture I saw on the 
TV was similar to the woman I had seen," Briscoe testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview Road is close to Hampshire Road, the place another witness testified 
to seeing a couple resembling Thornton and O'Sullivan tussling in a truck. That 
witness, however, testified that the man was driving and fended off the woman, 
who was reaching for an object in his lap.

COLLEGE PRESIDENT NAMED TEMPORARY CHANCELLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District late Tuesday named 
Moorpark College President James Walker as temporary replacement for Thomas G. 
Lakin, the chancellor who died Nov. 27 from a fast-moving infection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appointment will only last until the governing board can make a formal 
choice for interim chancellor, who will then serve for the months it takes to 
recruit and hire a permanent selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees will meet in special session Saturday to continue discussions about 
replacing Lakin over the long term. The search for an interim chancellor could 
ultimately extend outside the district, where the experience of a retired 
administrator would be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Less likely is the possibility of appointing one of two vice chancellors -- 
Jeff Marsee, who is in charge of the budget, or Jerry Pauley, who oversees the 
district's employees, trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any interim appointee is expected to serve only as long as it takes a search 
committee to recruit and hire a new chancellor. The temporary chief would be 
responsible for implementing policies dictated by the board, and overseeing the 
day-to-day operations of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources said Tuesday, however, that it might be difficult to hire a 
permanent replacement before June 30, the end of the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Timothy D. Hirschberg, who was sworn in as the new board 
leader earlier Tuesday night, said he favored naming someone from within the 
three-campus district to assume Lakin's responsibilities for the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows our district better than the people who work here now," 
Hirschberg said in an interview prior to the board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got confidence in the team we've already assembled and I'd like to draw 
on their talent," he said. "I want to do what's best for the district, but we 
are in a financial pinch." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of Hirschberg's colleagues, however, favored a slower approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Pete E. Tafoya recommended the board form a committee to study the 
process that should be employed in selecting both an interim chancellor and a 
permanent successor to Lakin. 
</P>
<P>
 "A chancellor really sets the tone for the district," Tafoya said. "You want 
to make sure the individual is right for the district, and the district is 
right for the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya said he already has been in contact with a group called the California 
Community College Trustee Assn., which catalogues potential leaders for 
community college districts in need of interim replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hirschberg disagreed, saying the district has a pesky habit of putting off 
crucial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college district is always too quick to rush to committees and task 
forces, and over-discuss issues," he said. "The board needs to take the bull by 
the horns and make a decision. It's what the public has us there to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The presidents of the three academic senates, faculty panels on each campus 
that make recommendations to the governing board, asked that trustees choose an 
interim chancellor who has experience in the district and as a teacher on a 
college campus.

THOUSAND OAKS' NEW MAYOR AND COUNCILMAN ASSUME OFFICE; TRANSITION: ZUKOWSKI 
GIVES INAUGURAL SPEECH; FOX IS SWORN IN. MEMBERS BID ADIEU TO SCHILLO AND 
FIORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With bouquets of flowers, hugs, kisses and only the barest indication that 
trouble might be brewing, the Thousand Oaks City Council seated a new 
councilman, elected a new mayor and bid a fond farewell to two longtime council 
members Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Andy Fox, the top vote-getter in the Nov. 8 election, was sworn 
into office and took a seat behind the polished dais for the first time as 
Councilman Frank Schillo and Mayor Alex Fiore stepped down after a combined 40 
years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two veterans departed office to standing ovations from the crowd of 
more than 200, the question of who will fill the lone empty high-backed chair 
at the dais hung over the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years on the council, Schillo is leaving to join the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors in January. He announced last week that he would resign 
his council seat a month early to speed the transition between old and new 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
 His early resignation was seen by some as the ideal opportunity to appoint 
Police Detective Mike Markey, the fourth-place finisher in November's election, 
to complete the two years left in Schillo's term. Councilwoman Judy Lazar had 
even proposed last week that Markey be picked during Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But frequent allies Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski rallied against Lazar's 
suggestion, and the discussion was not included on Tuesday's agenda. Both have 
since hinted they may oppose Markey's appointment in favor of a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the four-member council splits on how to fill the seat, a special election 
will be held. Zeanah's opponents suggest that she is resisting Markey's 
appointment out of fear that he will provide a crucial third vote against her 
on controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While the council conspicuously avoided the topic of Markey's possible 
appointment Tuesday night, there was little question that it will be the first 
issue to test the accord of the new council when it comes up next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In her inaugural speech as mayor, Jaime Zukowski said she hopes to bring new 
harmony to city government, particularly to the council's various committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "As mayor I will attempt to prevent the sometimes divisive nature of the 
council committee system," Zukowski said in a prepared text. "We as a council 
all share in our successes and mistakes as a city. No achievement should be 
considered the token of any mayor or council member, but the sum of our efforts 
as a body of representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing public safety is her primary goal, she said. Although Thousand Oaks 
is the nation's second-safest city among those with more than 100,000 residents 
-- according to FBI statistics released last week -- Zukowski said residents 
should set their sights on being second to none. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Thousand Oaks' standards, gang and crime activity has become too 
frequent," Zukowski said. "We are a young city. We should have less crime than 
older cities of 100,000. Maintaining a safe city is the greatest contributor to 
economic vitality and, of course, our quality of life. It has be put first." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she will push for a storefront police station on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard during her one-year term as mayor. She also hopes to establish a 
monthly or twice-monthly health, safety and environment forum for residents to 
learn more about upcoming issues before council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski assumed mayoral duties just as suspicions were aroused that she might 
be leaving the area. Her husband, Mark, is director of the inflammation 
research division at Amgen Inc., which is negotiating to purchase another 
biotechnology firm in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 But an Amgen spokesman said Tuesday it is likely only a dozen employees might 
be relocated to Boulder and there are no definite plans to move Mark Zukowski. 
And new Mayor Zukowski said she has no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have certain responsibilities here in Thousand Oaks and wish to concentrate 
on them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two hours of the meeting were filled with remembrances of Fiore and 
Schillo, as government officials from every city in the county rose to praise 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, who has been on the council as long as Thousand Oaks has been a city, 
received the key to the city, in recognition of his 30 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex, it's hard for me to believe that you're sitting out there," Lazar said 
to Fiore in the audience. "For me, Alex Fiore typifies what real community 
service is." 
</P>
<P>
 Even frequent foe Zeanah had kind words for Fiore. "I'm a Fiore fan," she 
said, unfurling a fan covered with photographs of Fiore that she had made as a 
gift for him. "I'm going to miss him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the gifts and plaques piling up at the feet of Fiore and Schillo were 
state Senate resolutions read by state Sen. Kathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), 
framed copies of the Congressional Record honoring the two councilmen, and 
formal congratulations from former President Ronald Reagan, U. S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein and Gov. Pete Wilson.

MIKE PENNER: NAVIGATORS' ERRORS SINK CLIPPER SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Clipper and his monthly planner: 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Dec. 7 -- "Lose to Bucks at Sports Arena. Drop to 0-17. Tie NBA 
record for worst start to a season." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Dec. 9 -- "Lose to Lakers at Forum. 0-18. New NBA record." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Dec. 14 -- "Lose to Blazers in Portland. 0-20. Tie NBA record for 
longest losing streak within a single season." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Dec. 15 -- "Lose to Warriors at Pond. 0-21. New NBA record." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Dec. 20 -- "Lose to Sonics in Seattle. 0-23. Tie '61 Phillies for 
longest single-season losing streak by major professional sports team." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Dec. 21 -- "Lose to Magic at Sports Arena. 0-24. Tie longest losing 
streak in professional sports history, held by Cavaliers, who lost last 19 
games of '81-'82 season and first five of '82-'83." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Dec. 23 -- "Lose to Bullets at Sports Arena. 0-25. We're all alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Merry Christmas, Clipper fans, from Donald T. (Ebenezer) Sterling and all the 
great minds in the basketball operations department. 
</P>
<P>
 Who'd have thought it -- the Clippers, the hottest story in the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
 They said it would never happen in Sterling's lifetime, but there they are, 
leading off the nightly sports news shows, as they did Monday night following 
their 32-point loss to Charlotte. After 16 games and 16 defeats, the national 
Clipper watch has officially begun, with camera crews and general-assignment 
reporters hitching on for the record-breaking ride for as long as it may run. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could go a ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule, as you might have guessed, doesn't favor the Clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Clippers have blown their BCTWTM for December. Best Chance To Win 
This Month -- it's a new statistic kept by writers assigned to the Clipper 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, it was the Nov. 25 game against New Jersey at the Sports Arena. 
Home game, struggling opponent with a bench full of head cases, Bill Fitch's 
last place of employment -- BCTWTM, by unanimous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clips lost by a point, 98-97. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the nod went to last Saturday's game against Minnesota. The 
T-Wolves were 2-11, the game was at home. For the Clips, it had all the makings 
of A Fighting Chance. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost by eight, 103-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Now where will Fitch's 846th career victory come from? (The old coach has been 
stuck on 845 since April, 1992, before he and the Nets went their separate ways 
and Fitch embarked upon what was supposed to be a long and enjoyable 
retirement. You know the rest of the sad story.) 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, tonight's game against Milwaukee has possibilities; the Bucks have 
been flopping around lately and could be tired after going four quarters with 
the Kings Tuesday night in Sacramento. But who's going to stop Glenn Robinson? 
Matt Fish? Tony Massenburg? The Sports Arena security force? 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the Bucks have contracted Clipper Dread, a severe emotional disorder 
that began afflicting Clipper opponents a half-dozen games ago. Symptoms: 
sweaty palms, accelerated heart beat, intense fear of humiliation through being 
known as the first team to drop one to the hapless Clips. 
</P>
<P>
 At 0-5 and 0-6, the Clippers were just another team off to a slow start. Lose 
to them then and it's no disgrace. Just an off night. Happens to everybody. At 
0-6, the Clippers still could "sneak up" on an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. The Clips' 0-16 has become the NBA's scarlet letter. What looked like 
a breather on a team's schedule two months ago has now become a must-win test 
of one's manhood. Now, teams brace themselves for games against the Clippers 
the same way they did against the Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls. We cannot be 
the first, players tell each other in the locker room before tipoff, psyching 
themselves up. 
</P>
<P>
 From now until (if?) the streak is snapped, all Clipper games carry this 
assurance: Opponents will approach the game as if it was Game 7 of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because in this case, if you lose, there is a tomorrow -- and you will be 
featured in that day's Letterman monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 The men from Fitch's motley crew deserve better. Half of them, maybe, deserve 
to be on an NBA roster, but is that their fault? Who put them in this no-win 
predicament? Who set them up to fail, night after night after night? 
</P>
<P>
 The culprits here are Sterling and his bumbling lieutenants, not Terry Dehere 
and Malik Sealy. As Fitch and other coaches have testified, the Clippers play 
hard. They hustle, they dive, they pound, they bleed. They just can't pass or 
shoot very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of the Clippers' starting lineup was not in the league last 
season. Twenty percent was not even in the country; forward Massenburg played 
in Spain last season. Fish, the starting center, was, and remains, a CBA 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 40% rode the bench last season -- Pooh Richardson in Indiana, Terry 
Dehere in Clipsville. That leaves Loy Vaught as the team's lone legitimate NBA 
starter. Most nights, that's one on five. Even Minnesota, the second-worst team 
in the league, has Christian Laettner, Isaiah Rider and Donyell Marshall. 
Dallas, which lost 20 in a row last season, has Jim Jackson, Jamal Mashburn and 
Jason Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Clippers lack the manpower to match up with even the bottom of the 
NBA barrel, the problem is not what's on the floor, it's what's sitting in the 
soft leather chairs upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 So after the Clippers lose tonight, let the Thursday morning headlines read: 
"Sterling Falls To 0-17." Or: "Elgin & Staff Blow Another One." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get the reporting accurate.

ANALYSIS; REAL DISCIPLINE STILL IS MISSING FROM RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders finally got the message. It took two years of self-destructive 
behavior at a near-record pace, months of whistle-blowing, weeks of 
self-examination, days of practice, hours of lectures and threats and 30 
minutes of horrendous football. 
</P>
<P>
 But they finally got the message. At least for one crucial half. 
</P>
<P>
 After committing nine penalties in the first quarter of Monday night's game 
against the San Diego Chargers and 14 in the first half, the Raiders trudged 
into their locker room to listen to Coach Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 They knew what they were going to hear. They have heard it for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were playing their tails off. They were," said Shell of his players. "We 
just couldn't afford the penalties. Those were the things that were hurting us 
more than anything else. Against a good football team, you just can't do those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, a half in which the Raiders broke a 14-14 tie to pull out 
a 24-17 victory that kept them in the race for a playoff berth, the Raiders 
cleaned up their act and committed only three penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still entirely too many," Shell said. "We've just got to keep addressing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Raiders were guilty of 148 penalties, one short of the league 
record held by the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's total of 17 tied a club record set against Houston in 1963 and 
equaled in 1987 in another matchup with the Chargers. The single-game league 
record is 22, set by the Brooklyn Tigers in 1944 and tied that same season half 
a century ago by the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Monday night performance increased their season penalty total to 
128 with three games remaining, leaving them 21 shy of the league mark they so 
narrowly missed a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell has lectured his team all year about its lack of discipline and has 
levied fines for personal fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 As the coach, he must take responsibility for any lack of control, any mental 
lapses by his players. 
</P>
<P>
 But he must also guard against inhibiting their aggressiveness, against 
causing them to become too conservative in the interest of reducing mental 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the primary problem. It's not as if the Raiders are mainly 
guilty of roughing the passer, late hits and personal fouls delivered to 
respond to cheap shots by the opposition, real or imagined. It's not as if they 
are trying to deliver a message. 
</P>
<P>
 The only message they are sending is that they are an undisciplined team. Of 
Monday's 17 penalties, eight were committed by the defense, six by the offense 
and three by special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding and pass interference can sometimes be explained away as preferable to 
allowing your quarterback to get hurt or your team to give up a sure six 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 But there can be no explanation for delay of game calls (two Monday night), 
false starts by the offense (two), offside by the defense (four), or the 
blatant hit on San Diego punt returner Darrien Gordon by Dan Land before Gordon 
caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 One sequence in particular shows the futility of the Raiders' way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers had just given up the first score of the night, a dramatic 
76-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff Hostetler to Alexander Wright on 
the Raiders' first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers got the ball back and: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Stan Humphries threw a pass for no gain, but Chester McGlockton 
was offside. Five yards for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Natrone Means was held for no gain, but Jerry Ball was offside. Five yards 
for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Humphries threw incomplete, but Ball was again offside. Five yards for San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two plays later, Means was thrown for a yard loss, but Nolan Harrison was 
called for unnecessary roughness. Sixteen yards for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the help, the Chargers were able to successfully complete the drive 
with a 29-yard touchdown pass from Humphries to Shawn Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Raiders, there has to be a better way.

HOCKEY TALKS SILENCED; FATE OF SEASON GRIM; LABOR: REINTRODUCTION OF A LUXURY 
TAX PLAN BY OWNERS LEADS TO ABRUPT END OF DISCUSSIONS BUT DOESN'T KILL ALL 
SETTLEMENT HOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Any progress that the NHL and its players' union made in recent days was 
derailed on Tuesday by the reintroduction of a controversial luxury tax, a 
development that both sides said further jeopardizes the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor talks in Chicago abruptly ceased with no further sessions scheduled 
after NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman unveiled a watered-down version of the 
previously proposed tax. Under the new plan, a 25% tax on the entire payroll 
would be levied against clubs that have total salaries exceeding $18 million in 
the first year of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's board of governors will gather Monday at New York in what is 
expected to be a critical meeting, limited to one representative per team. 
There, the governors could issue a firm deadline or tell Bettman to continue 
negotiations. Or the league could become the first to cancel an entire season 
because of a labor impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some management and union sources cautioned that there is still 
adequate time to forge an agreement, saying that one final blowup was almost 
expected before a resolution. There is still believed to be a window of three 
or four weeks before the season would have to be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they felt that by throwing the tax on, they could get more 
concessions," said the Washington Capitals' Kelly Miller, a member of the 
players' negotiating team. "The way I look at it, I've already given them my 
keys, I've given them my wallet, I've given them my car. At some point you've 
got to say, 'Hey, no, you can't have my kids and you can't have my wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
 NHLPA President Mike Gartner of the Toronto Maple Leafs said, "I can't see us 
going any further than we've gone. We've given them everything they wanted. 
We've made a tremendous amount of concessions along the way, and right now the 
owners are being gluttons about it. They've been gobbling up everything that 
we've been giving and now they're saying we want more, more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given everything so far . . . and then a tax on top of that, I don't 
think so. And that's why I say that I think the chances of a season happening 
if they stick to their tax plan are close to none." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman had consistently said media reports that the tax had disappeared were 
erroneous. Union chief Bob Goodenow called the tax proposal "counterproductive" 
and said it "seriously endangers the prospects of a deal and the prospects of a 
season."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, one NHL executive disputed the union's contention that the latest 
proposal could be called a luxury tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial reaction is this is far from a luxury tax," said Tony Tavares, the 
Mighty Ducks' president. "If the numbers I'm hearing are correct, that amount 
is not going to keep anyone from signing anybody. It's more of a nuisance tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't put it in the category that (it) would cause a major drag (on 
salaries)." 
</P>
<P>
 As of September, six teams had payrolls of $18 million or more this season, 
led by the St. Louis Blues' estimated total of $23.5 million. The Kings ranked 
second, at $23.42 million, followed by the Pittsburgh Penguins ($20.13 
million), Detroit Red Wings ($19.16 million), the Buffalo Sabres ($18.95 
million) and the New York Rangers ($18.037 million). The Chicago Blackhawks 
were close to the cutoff, at $17.84 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other clubs likely would have been affected by the proposed tax 
because payrolls rise during the season through contract renegotiations and 
trades. The Vancouver Canucks' payroll was also more than $17 million, and the 
Toronto Maple Leafs' and New Jersey Devils' surpassed $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto General Manager Cliff Fletcher called Tuesday probably the most 
disappointing day of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ends up that I was part of the process that results in hockey not being 
played for an entire season, it would be a tremendous black mark," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone on both sides hinted after the meeting that the chances of 
saving the season were bleak. The lockout began on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A source from the players' side, who had said the reintroduction of the 
payroll tax would be a deal-breaker, was pessimistic the season could be saved, 
saying: "For the league to do this after they've gotten nothing but givebacks 
from the players is incredible. That's exactly what it takes to blow the talks 
to hell. I would walk for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The different tax proposals have always brought forth emotional responses. 
While players unanimously oppose the tax, owners do not unanimously support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Blues tried to persuade other team executives to urge Bettman 
to start the season without a tax and without an agreement, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, owners asked for a levy of 200% on clubs that exceeded a 
predetermined level and dropped the peak figure to 122% on Oct. 11 before 
Tuesday's proposal. Progress had been slow in coming until two weeks ago, when 
the league shelved the tax and began to focus on other key issues such as 
salary arbitration, entry-level salaries and the rookie salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, Mighty Duck forward Stu Grimson said the union had operated under 
the assumption that the tax would not be part of the proposal. Grimson, the 
Ducks' assistant player representative, felt more optimistic than the members 
of the union's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still optimistic in one sense," he said. "I almost get the sense the 
owners are feeling us out. They may be in a position where they may not know 
what the best possible deal is unless they bring the tax back to the table. 
Knowing our response today, let's hope they understand our response to a tax at 
any time is that it is inappropriate, and abhorrent knowing what we've 
conceded. . . . If they're asking for a risk-free investment they've come to 
the wrong table." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman, who said the sides were "too far apart on substance" regarding 
arbitration, free agency and the rookie salary cap, contended that the 
negotiations concluded even before owners introduced the luxury tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "With or without the contribution plan, there was no basis for a deal," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg owner Barry Shenkarow suggested that the NHL should unilaterally 
impose its system should the impasse continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball can do it because of their U.S. antitrust law exemption," Shenkarow 
told the Winnipeg Free Press. "But football has already done it. They imposed 
their system, and the jury in Minneapolis upheld their position and said the 
NFL could impose the cap. The players then came back and said maybe we should 
talk. If we have to do it, I believe we're in a position to do it."

MEDIATOR PUTS BASEBALL ONUS ON THE OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery came down on the side of the striking 
baseball players Tuesday, urging owners to give up their revised plans to 
implement the salary cap on Dec. 15 and saying it's basically up to the owners 
to create a new relationship based on trust and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do we need to get a new collective bargaining agreement, we need to 
get a new relationship," Usery said after talking to more than 80 players at 
the union's executive board meeting in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get some faith and confidence restored. I mean, more than what the 
two sides are trying to achieve in bargaining, I'm trying to promote some 
mutual respect and trust, but it's not easy. It has to be a lot on the owners' 
side, if you know what I mean, but there's a lot of history and stubbornness 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The general perception has been that the owners believe they have a chance to 
break the union and have intended to implement the cap from the start of the 
sporadic negotiations. Bowing to Usery's pressure, the owners agreed to 
postpone a Dec. 5 meeting, at which they had intended to implement the cap, 
until Dec. 15, giving the players a chance to organize a counterproposal to the 
tax plan submitted by the owners on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 What appears to be the final attempt to reach a negotiated settlement begins 
Friday or Saturday in Rye Brook, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners ultimately implement, the union will seek relief from the 
National Labor Relations Board, creating a legal quagmire certain to prolong 
the strike next spring when owners try to open camps with replacement players. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perception, implementation would be very, very unfortunate," Usery 
said. "I've told the owners and everyone concerned that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not in the best interests of collective bargaining, the best 
interests of my trying to mediate. We were fortunate enough to use all of our 
influence and stop it the last time, but I don't know whether we can do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an appointee of President Clinton, Usery lacks binding authority and 
his view on implementation is likely to be ignored by the owners. Said acting 
Commissioner Bud Selig, when reached in Milwaukee: 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with Bill that mediation is the only hope for a constructive, 
long-term settlement, but we've got to begin to make some progress. We'll know 
more Friday. The players have promised us they'll come back with a 
counterproposal. As I've said many times, this has to be resolved at the table. 
Implementation isn't the answer, but we're at a point on the calendar when we 
have to consider alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the clubs were unhappy that I put it off and I doubt they would let 
me do it again unless the (negotiating) committee tells us they're making 
progress and there's a framework for a settlement. We have explained to Mr. 
Usery that ours is a seasonal business and we can't remain in limbo as the 
result of stalemated negotiations. We have to know what system is in place so 
clubs can determine rosters." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress might also be ready to rejoin the fray. Two U.S. senators and a 
senator-elect threatened government intervention if the conflict isn't solved 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this dispute is not resolved in a timely manner, we will have no choice 
but to move forward with the consideration of an appropriate legislative 
remedy, in addition to reserving our right to address the (sport's) antitrust 
exemption -- a benefit that was predicated on baseball's unique standing and 
the good will and accountability of its stewards," said a Dec. 2 letter sent to 
both factions and signed by Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.), Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), and Jon Kyl, (R-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
 They represent the states where spring training games are played. Arizona also 
is seeking an expansion team for 1997 or 1998, and baseball officials have said 
the work stoppage might delay that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 29, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill partially stripping 
baseball of its antitrust exemption, but it was never voted on by the full 
House or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although owners and players are on the same playing field with their "tax" 
concepts, little has changed since the players went on strike on Aug. 12. They 
are miles apart. The complex owners' plan -- labeled a cap in disguise by the 
union -- calls for a payroll ceiling and a tax escalating to more than 100%. A 
plan offered by the players in September did not include a ceiling and called 
for a 1.6% tax on the 16 clubs with the highest revenues and the 16 with the 
highest payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be no surprise that it is our feeling that their proposal is 
unlikely to form the framework of an agreement," union leader Donald Fehr said 
Tuesday after he and his staff had worked with the players on developing a new 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal is almost certain to be short of the owners' acknowledged quest 
for a system that will blunt salary growth and provide cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a union attorney, "I expect that we will definitely make a 
counterproposal, but it is too early to say what it will be. The players 
discussed various approaches to a framework, different ways to break the 
destructive (negotiating) cycle of the last 30 years without giving up any of 
the rights they have won in that time. They don't want this confrontation to 
continue but they are resolute about protecting those rights. It remains a very 
difficult proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Does it matter what the players propose? Shortstop Jeff Blauser of the Atlanta 
Braves said he didn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the owners have shown) they have in mind to implement the salary cap 
no matter what we propose or what influence the mediator exerts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the union appreciated Usery's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Said union counsel Eugene Orza, "My suspicion is that it's a function of his 
realization that in this particular dispute -- unlike all the others he has 
been involved in -- the employment group intends to implement what in any other 
industry would be illegal."

JIM MURRAY: COBB TRIUMPHED ON FIELD BUT WAS STUMPED IN END 
</P>

<P>
 Tyrus Raymond Cobb might have been the greatest baseball player who ever 
lived. No worse than second greatest, surely.  
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't get him out. The greatest pitchers in the game tried. Walter 
Johnson, Ed Walsh, Chief Bender, they all fell short. Twelve times he won the 
batting championship, three times he batted better than .400 and .370 was a bad 
year for him. The leagues, the commissioners, even the law agencies couldn't 
set him down. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ty Cobb struck out swinging when he came up against a junk-throwing, 
mild-looking non-pitcher from a newspaper city room.  
</P>
<P>
 You might say Ty Cobb got caught looking by Al Stump.  
</P>
<P>
 Al wasn't really trying to fan the great Cobb. He was just trying to get him 
to hit the ball someplace. Al was doing Cobb's biography at the time. It was 
only a paycheck for Al. He had no thought of striking out the great Cobb, 
ruining his reputation for all time.  
</P>
<P>
 Like all casual sports fans, Al knew Cobb had the reputation of being a 
spiteful, intensely competitive individual who would spike his grandmother to 
score a run and who had a tempestuous career in the grand old game. He didn't 
play a game, he waged it.  
</P>
<P>
 But the romance of baseball being what it was, these were considered quaint, 
even mildly amusing traits on the part of Cobb, part of his mystique. No one 
ever reported that Cobb was just this side of a homicidal maniac. No one seemed 
to notice his teams seldom got into a World Series or questioned why.  
</P>
<P>
 Stump, who was to spend 11 months with the dying, raging, almost psychopathic 
Cobb, found out why. This was no beloved, aging athletic hero. This was a 
monster. Stump felt like a guy who has blundered into Dracula's castle under a 
full moon before it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Al Stump -- and Ty Cobb -- is the subject of a remarkable 
movie on the subject, "Cobb," which opened last week with Tommy Lee Jones 
starring as the storied Georgia Peach. It is an Academy Award performance in a 
very disturbing picture of what fame can do to a person ill-equipped to handle 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 Cobb was the way he was for a very depressing reason: In his youth, his mother 
shot his father through a window of the family home, mistaking him for a 
prowler. Revenge is probably the most ignoble -- but powerful -- of human 
motives. And Cobb's whole career was, very likely, one long attempt to get even 
with society for the fact that his mother slew his father. The movie makes the 
point that the mother's lover did the killing, but movies are notorious for 
reinventing history from a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the truth, Cobb set out to make the world pay. Pitchers, fielders, 
fans, owners, managers, waiters, croupiers -- even his own family and what few 
friends he had were to feel his vengeful wrath. It probably made him the 
transcendent baseball player he was (lifetime batting average, .367). He fought 
with teammates as enthusiastically as with adversaries. Cobb, quite clearly, 
hated the world and everyone in it.  
</P>
<P>
 He was a rich man. He got in on the ground floor of the Coca-Cola Company 
formed by adoring fellow Georgians, so he could indulge his sociopathic 
attitudes to the fullest. He treated people as if they were curveballs inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Stump looked to him to be someone he could go five for six against. But he 
went 0 for eternity. We never would have known about this unholy demonic light 
that glowed in Cobb if it weren't for Stump. The pen was mightier than the 
curveball.  
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, sports journalists pretty much restricted their coverage to 
runs, hits and errors. The coverage stayed pretty much between the foul lines. 
The writers had to know what kind of out-of-control human Cobb really was, but 
they spared the public. They let Cobb bask in a prism of his own 
accomplishments. Athletes were our new royalty. Cobb should have been in 
therapy. Or in prison. Instead, he was in the Hall of Fame. The first one 
there, in fact.  
</P>
<P>
 Stump wrote his obligatory fawning biography as contracted. But then, he 
dashed off a magazine piece that brought the real Ty Cobb into focus, a man a 
long way from the idol of the basepaths usually chronicled in the journals of 
his day. Cobb got thrown out at home by Al Stump.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, baseball men always knew with whom they were dealing. Only three 
baseball personages showed up at his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after Al Stump, the world knew. In his 11 months at the side of the 
legend, Stump got a look inside. And recoiled at what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cobb" is only the latest manifestation of the fact that Al fanned Cobb with 
the bases loaded and the game on the line, stamped him indelibly for the 
future. In "Field of Dreams" a few years ago, a scene showed a passel of 
deceased legends of the game coming back from the afterlife to play ball again 
and, to a man, they refuse to bring that Cobb with them. They are portrayed as 
despising him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb was a strange man, a violent man. You remember his eyes. Even in old age, 
they bespoke a fury within, the eyes of someone you dealt with only at your 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 He belongs to the ages as a misbegotten hero, like a statue of Stalin torn 
from its pedestal and lying in the rain, despised, vilified. But was he as 
unrelievedly megalomaniacal and deranged as Tommy Lee Jones portrays him? 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb always said he was misunderstood. He was misunderstood, all right. Until 
a trained journalist got a look behind the headlines. Cobb finally found a 
pitch -- and a pitcher -- he couldn't hit. Stump popped him up.

 It's a Big Dog's life . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another town, another snippy headline of the "Big Dog, Big Bucks, Big Bust" 
variety. Glenn Robinson, the puppy in question, has begun putting up big 
numbers nightly, but the world loves its little jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere he goes, the opposition double-teams him as if he were already the 
second coming of Larry Bird, instead of a rookie who doesn't even know all the 
Milwaukee Bucks' plays yet. The press wants to ask him all the same questions 
again: What about that holdout for a $100-million contract? Can you beat out 
Grant Hill for rookie of the year? How's the adjustment going? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hard," he says in his usual half-whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's asking me how I'm adjusting, like I'm playing very badly. Is that 
what's going on? I think I'm playing good. I think I'm adjusting well." 
</P>
<P>
 For Robinson, a large canine on a basketball floor but a deer in the 
headlights of fame, this is a rare moment in which he actually betrays 
something of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he never reads the papers, he's aware of the buzz: He's a 
disappointment, they should have drafted Hill, this is the 
Portland-passes-Michael-Jordan-for-Sam-Bowie thing all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, the Detroit Pistons' practically perfect young forward, might be the 
front-runner for rookie of the year, with a game so sound and so spectacular 
and a personality so appealing as to make him uncatchable, but the Big Dog, who 
makes his first trip to Los Angeles as a pro to face the 0-16 Clippers tonight, 
has joined the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has put together four consecutive 20-point games. He scored 31 on 
Tuesday night at Sacramento. Before that, he had scored 21 against Cleveland, 
24 against Seattle and 25 against Portland and was the Bucks' second-leading 
scorer at 16.9 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's only warming up. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not even in shape yet. In games at Seattle and Portland over the weekend, 
his point totals were 18-17 in the first halves, 6-8 in the second. Coach Mike 
Dunleavy says Robinson is about where he would have been halfway through 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches say it, everybody nods their head, but people don't really know what 
you mean," Portland Coach P.J. Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Veteran players, when they miss training camp or segments of the preseason, 
it affects them. For a rookie to miss that and then just to be thrown in -- I 
don't think he's really ever going to catch up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying he's not going to play great, but you can't go back and put 
that in, the daily routine and the explaining. To learn on the fly -- they're 
doing it right, they're letting him play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad he's not going to catch up. It's unbelievable to miss all that and 
just to be thrust into it and to be playing as well as he's playing at such an 
early date. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gonna be a very special player, there's no question about that. He's 
already special." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He made himself special. 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid in poverty-wracked Gary, Ind., murder capital of the nation, Robinson 
was anything but a natural. As a seventh-grader, he was too afraid to go out 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had two fat little managers, a pair of twins, who used to outplay him when 
he was in the fourth or fifth grade," Robinson's high school coach, Ron Heflin, 
told Sports Illustrated's Bruce Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't very good. People don't understand how hard that kid worked. He 
hasn't always been a polished ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
 The work Robinson put in shows in his assortment of moves and feints, a 
repertoire worthy of a 10-year pro: up-fakes, step-throughs, step-backs, 
jump-stops. 
</P>
<P>
 He had it all as a sophomore at Purdue, after low test scores forced him to 
sit out his freshman season. Players who sit out their freshman seasons 
customarily struggle, but Robinson was so far ahead of the field it couldn't 
touch him. The students at archrival Indiana might chant "S-A-T!" but Robinson 
torched all of Bobby Knight's Hoosiers, forcing the high priest of man-to-man 
into a hated zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 After one season at Purdue, Robinson had blown away the pros. Jerry West said 
if he came out, he'd go No. 1 -- ahead of Chris Webber, Penny Hardaway and 
Shawn Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite yet, guys. 
</P>
<P>
 An urban version of Bird, the self-described "hick from French Lick," Robinson 
chose Purdue because it was close to home, not even bothering to take a 
recruiting trip to see the IU campus in faraway (200 miles) Bloomington. In two 
years, he had just grown accustomed to West Lafayette and wasn't ready for the 
fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Purdue, became college player of the year, rolled through the 
NCAA tournament with the kind of numbers it hadn't seen since Bird and, 
finally, turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame and riches awaited. The riches would come in handy, but the fame? Well, 
he'd deal with it as best he could. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now to pick up his $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for top picks had been zooming out of sight, from Larry Johnson's 
$20-million deal in 1991 to Shaquille O'Neal's $49 million in 1992 to Chris 
Webber's $75 million in 1993. There was speculation that Robinson could be the 
first $100-million man. 
</P>
<P>
 This was nonsense, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State Warriors, limited by the salary cap to paying Webber $1.8 
million his first season, had given him a 15-year deal, intending to rewrite it 
this season. Webber's $5-million average was less than Shaq's $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's agent, Charles Tucker, went for $100 million, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker had represented Magic Johnson but lost his marquee client when Johnson 
noticed Michael Jordan reaping endorsement bonanzas he hadn't even sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to show his new marquee client he could deliver, Tucker stuck to his 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time camp opened, the Bucks were up to $68 million but vowing to go no 
higher. Sen. Herb Kohl, the team owner, made his famous statement: He'd take 
the $100-million contract and give Robinson the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker kept his client out until the start of the season and then caved in, 
taking the $68 million they could have had a month before. 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, Tucker threw in a suggestion that criticism of their 
bargaining posture was racially motivated, even if no other player in any other 
U.S. sport -- rookie or veteran, black or white -- had a $100-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Big Dog joined the NBA with a little bad press, on legs that weren't in 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was something I had to do," Robinson says. "I would have liked to have 
been in training camp, but I'm happy with the outcome. I think I'm going to do 
well. I think I can catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press -- I mean, the press is going to be the press. Everybody put it on 
me to be bad. They didn't look at the other side. I think it was a two-way 
thing. That's the way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't even read the press. I really don't worry about that. I mean, 
I've been out playing. I just play ball. I treat playing ball just like I've 
been doing since I was a little kid. I didn't read the papers then, so why read 
them now?" 
</P>
<P>
 If someone declares war on the United States, they'll break into ESPN to 
mention it. What else does one need to know? 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is shy in private too, but likable. Buck players say he's looser 
around them and has a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That part of it has been -- thank God -- good," Dunleavy says. "He's a quiet 
kid. He works hard. He wants to learn. He wants to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing to me that was most amazing, the way he came in with our players, 
he could have been with a P.R. firm or with Magic Johnson for two months. He 
couldn't have come in and handled it any better. Our guys truly love him. He's 
impossible not to like. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes in, does all the things rookies are supposed to do. I mean, the way 
rookies come in now, you hear the stories -- 'Here's my check' -- that is a 
major, major plus for us, that he wants to learn, he works hard. To me, it's 
just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that much time, either. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing shy about Robinson on a basketball court. Out there, he's a 
hungry Dog and everyone else is the mailman.

SMITH DEAL COULD MEAN ANGELS LOSE CURTIS OR FINLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, moving closer to signing free-agent closer Lee Smith, will have to 
trade either center fielder Chad Curtis or left-handed starter Chuck Finley to 
stay within their budget constraints, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have offered Smith a two-year guaranteed contract worth nearly $4.5 
million, which is the highest bid received by agent Brian David. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Orioles, originally considered the front-runners to retain 
Smith, also are conceding that Smith could be headed to the Angels. They, in 
fact, are pursuing free-agent closer Jeff Russell, according to an Oriole 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith saved a major league-leading 33 games for the Orioles last 
season, the Orioles are apprehensive about his effectiveness over a full 
season. Smith was 0-4 with a 5.59 earned-run average after May 30 last season, 
blowing five of 18 save opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels are successful in signing Smith, they'll be committing about $23 
million of their $24.5 million budget to only 12 players for the 1995 season. 
It would leave Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi only $1.5 million to pay the 
remaining 13 players. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the Angels are shopping Curtis, and may have no choice but to 
consider trading Finley. Considered among the top left-handed starters in 
baseball, Finley has won at least 16 games in four of the last five full 
seasons, averaging 224 innings a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, 32, who has the longest tenure of any active Angel player, is 
scheduled to earn $4.5 million in the final year of his contract. If the Angels 
don't sign him to a contract extension, he's eligible for free agency at the 
end of the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of speculating where Chuck Finley might go in a trade," agent Alan 
Hendricks said, "I'd rather see talk about Chuck Finley finishing his career in 
an Angel uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley has a partial no-trade clause in his contract that prohibits him from 
being traded to 15 teams, including the two New York teams. Several teams 
expressed interest in trading for Finley during the general manager meetings, 
particularly the St. Louis Cardinals.

AT SEA WITH THE CODGERS; AGE OF AQUARIUS AND ITS ANGLERS IS UNIMPORTANT AS 
'CODFATHER' AND FRIENDS GO DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy La Sane turned the handle on his reel slowly, methodically. He cranked, 
and cranked and cranked . . . Finally, when the sun was a little higher in the 
sky, when everyone was a little older, La Sane's catch came into view -- an 
orangish-pink blimp of a fish called a cow cod, which until Monday had been 
living in the deep, dark depths off Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Codfather" had struck again. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what La Sane calls himself, anyway. The 63-year-old retired 
actor-musician from Long Beach spends nearly every Monday rocking and reeling 
on the Aquarius, Malibu Sportfishing's lone vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aquarius is an old wooden craft that isn't very fast and doesn't go very 
far, but it has plenty of character. Especially on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when La Sane, Sam Charles, Edwin Hicks and several others board, as 
they have been doing every week now for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people are like grandfathers to me because I've known them 
longer than I've known my grandfather," said Phil Campanella, 46, owner of the 
landing at the end of the Malibu Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 With them aboard the Aquarius, owner-skipper Jon Christensen leaves the bass 
and halibut behind and travels four or five miles offshore, where the ocean's 
bottom drops off and an entirely different world is available to his customers 
-- the world of the cow cod, the chilipepper and chucklehead, the vermilion and 
the salmon grouper, and numerous other rockfish that thrive in the cold, deep 
water off the coast.  
</P>
<P>
 None are true cods, but the term rock cod is generally applied to many of 
them, and "rock cod trips" have become a fall and wintertime mainstay of fleets 
along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monday trip aboard the Aquarius has become a little bit more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Monday rock cod trip is kind of like a men's club -- everybody knows each 
other," said Charles, 66, a retired salesman and a fixture at the starboard bow 
on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Cod, it could be called. Its members, though they come from all walks of 
life, all come equipped with the same tools of the trade -- 100-pound Dacron 
line spooled on a giant reel with an oversized crank.  
</P>
<P>
 And although it was impossible to tell on the most recent outing, during which 
a cool wind kept the codders in long sleeves, all of them probably share a 
similar physical characteristic -- having one arm bigger than the other. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, each of the anglers spends the better part of every Monday cranking 
up a lead sinker the size of a sash weight attached to a line bearing anywhere 
from five to 15 hooks from depths of 500-1,000 feet. And more often than not, 
there are large fish caught on those hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most I've taken in one haul was nine," said Charles, having just brought 
in a small haul of two salmon grouper, an orangish bass-shaped fish known to 
swim as deep as 1,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 If rockfish put up any kind of a fight, such feats would be next to 
impossible.  
</P>
<P>
 They attack their prey -- squid, shrimp, crabs and small fish -- with a 
vengeance. But they give up not long after their death rides to the boat begin, 
managing a few shakes until the change in pressure causes their air bladders to 
fill and their eyes to bulge. Then they come up like balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is fine for the Monday bunch on the Aquarius. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all rock-codders, they don't much care for sizzling runs and burning 
drags, or for the intensity associated with a "hot" surface bite of, say, 
yellowtail or tuna.  
</P>
<P>
 Rock-codders are a breed apart. They prefer the slower pace associated with 
their sport and the sure thing. And rock-codding is as close to a sure thing as 
it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You catch a lot of fish, man," said Dan Lula, 24, one of the youngest 
regulars on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it is not difficult to load up on some of the finest-tasting fish the 
ocean has to offer.  
</P>
<P>
 Cow cod, rarely caught in water less than 300 feet deep, is one of the most 
prized of the rockfish. It is also one of the largest, measuring up to three 
feet long and nearly as round. Its flesh is considered excellent in taste and 
texture, and some processors market the fish as sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingcod are rarely taken on the Aquarius, but when one comes over the rail, 
news spreads from stern to bow. One of the ugliest creatures in the sea, the 
sharp-toothed lingcod is also one of the most popular, despite its green flesh, 
which comes out of the oven snowy white. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilipeppers and chuckleheads are much smaller than cow cod and lingcod, but 
more prevalent and nearly as tasty.  
</P>
<P>
 So are boccacio, or salmon grouper, the most commonly caught fish aboard the 
Aquarius. Salmon grouper are considered as delectable as the rest, but have a 
reputation for being "wormy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wormy or not, salmon grouper fillets are packed off the Aquarius by the 
hundreds every Monday afternoon. Christensen's best day in his 15 years at the 
helm was years ago when all 65 people -- he carries fewer people these days -- 
sacked their 15-fish limits. "They caught almost 1,000 fish in only a few 
hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, limits are harder to come by but for some the catch is only a 
bonus to being out in the fresh air on the water with friends, engaging in 
friendly competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come out here to relax," said La Sane, spitting the shell of a sunflower 
seed into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, 56, is a retired Compton policeman who now operates a facility that 
counsels abused and troubled youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of my jobs have been somewhat stressful and this is relaxing," he said. 
"Even if I don't catch anything, I consider fishing a good day." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles does too. But he never likes to go home empty-handed. His cats would 
never forgive him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them is an alley cat that weighs 23 pounds," Charles said. "And I'm 
not kidding, he eats well over a pound of fish a day." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the lack of fight by the targeted species, and the fact that 
rock-codders use fishing rods that are practically unbendable, there is some 
sport involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Christensen, watching his meter for signs of life on the bottom. "(The 
fishermen) know when they're getting fish; they can feel 'em. They don't do it 
just for the fish because they don't need 'em. I mean how many fish can you 
eat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen found what looked to be a good place to start a drift and 
instructed the anglers to drop -- and it immediately became apparent that it 
pays to be quick but careful when tossing a five-pound weight and a string full 
of hooks over the rail. 
</P>
<P>
 One angler snagged a hook on the eye of his rod and minutes passed before he 
got the mess untangled. By the time he got to the bottom, the boat had drifted 
past the fish. Another angler a week earlier caught a hook in his finger and 
spent several painful minutes trying to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The experienced anglers knew the difference between bites and rocks. Others 
had no clue, getting hung up on the rocks and losing their weights, which cost 
nearly $5 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Charles and La Sane, were "scoping," or keeping their reels in 
free-spool and letting out line as the boat drifted to keep their baits near 
the fish. Others chose to keep their reels in gear, covering more of the bottom 
but getting fewer takers. The scopers out-fished the non-scopers, three to one. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first drift, Hicks, on the starboard rail, caught an eight-pound 
lingcod, which he was sure would win him the cash jackpot awarded by the group 
for the top catch of the day. At the stern, Darolynne Aird reeled in a huge 
salmon grouper, one of the largest taken on the Aquarius this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hung up on the bottom, but I felt this thing shaking," she said. "I 
knew I had a big fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a crew member, she wasn't eligible for the jackpot, a fact many pointed 
out as they cranked on their strings. Many of the hooks bore only the squid 
that had been sent down to attract the fish. Others had only one or two fish 
and some had as many as four. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen had no explanation for what he called an extremely slow day, other 
than that there were lots of baitfish in the area, meaning the rockfish had 
probably had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, more than 60 fish -- mostly salmon grouper -- were brought aboard 
before it was time to quit. And as the Aquarius turned and headed to the pier, 
a small crowd gathered for the weigh-in at the stern.  
</P>
<P>
 Hicks' lingcod didn't stand a chance. It was nearly flung from the scale when 
deckhand Victor Waser hung a hefty cow cod on the other end. A cow cod caught 
by none other than the Codfather.

BOYS SOCCER 1994-1995: SOCCER PREVIEW; GEORGE LEARNS CONTROL; OPPONENTS SUFFER 
CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The season hadn't even started yet and Santa Margarita forward Seth George was 
already giving his teammates grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought some guys weren't giving it their all in practice and I kind of had 
a blowup," George said. "But I was wrong. Sometimes I think winning is more 
important than everything else. Sometimes I say whatever is in my head and I 
don't think before I talk. It gets me in trouble sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, George insists he's toned down his act this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I've gotten a lot better from what I was," he said. "I'm two or three 
times better. I'm not even close to what I was." 
</P>
<P>
 But while George works to control his temper, Santa Margarita's opponents will 
work even harder to control George, the county's leading goal scorer last 
season and only one of two juniors to be a Times' All-County first-team 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 If defenders found it difficult to stop George last season, this season could 
be a nightmare. George scored 24 goals last season almost by himself; he was 
often double-teamed and constantly shadowed by at least one player. The 
defensive-oriented Eagles gave George little help; their next highest scorer 
had just eight goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But George has a playmate this season -- junior forward Brian Piesner, a 
transfer from Houston. And with only a week of practice, the two are already 
clicking like they've been together for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a team player," George said. "He really wants to win. He's not a selfish 
forward. We play a lot alike. We play real good together." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Coach Curt Bauer said he can already see how much Piesner has 
helped George's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seth will be even more spectacular this year because he has a guy who can 
help take some of the pressure off him," Bauer said. "People won't be able to 
double-team him as much and that will give him more freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the team went 16-5-3 and reached the Southern Section Division IV 
semifinals, George acknowledges that last season was frustrating at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, there wasn't any other weapons," he said. "If I didn't step up, 
not too many other people would." 
</P>
<P>
 But if George ever started becoming too selfish or big-headed, he had his two 
older brothers, Sam and Steve, waiting to bring him back down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They helped me out a ton," he said. "Sometimes, I have a hard time getting 
along with my teammates. (Sam) will come home and tell me why and it will make 
a lot of sense. They humble me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Having two professional soccer players in the family can be a humbling 
experience. Sam was the Division I player of the year at Mater Dei and he went 
on to win an NCAA title at UCLA and serve as an alternate on the 1992 U.S. 
Olympic team. He plays indoor soccer for the Anaheim Splash. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve also played at Mater Dei and was an All-American at Cal State Fullerton. 
He now plays for the Wichita Wings of the Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug George said his youngest son hasn't done anything to tarnish the family 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably been a lot of pressure," Doug George said. "We didn't put 
any on him, but he puts a lot on himself. However, Seth has accomplished as 
much as they did at this level, and at this point he's a far better player than 
they were. All of the younger kids are becoming better than their older 
brothers because they get so much help at an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 Seth George doesn't think he's necessarily better than his brothers were. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all different players," he said. "Sam was more of a role player. He did 
the dirty work. I play more like my brother Steve. I'm more of a scorer, lazy 
and laid-back at times. Some games where I'm not involved at all, I'll come out 
of nowhere to score." 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters, however, are not finding George hard to locate. He is 
being wooed by many of the big-time soccer schools, including UCLA, Fullerton, 
Fresno State and Notre Dame. A 1,070 score on his Scholastic Aptitude Test has 
kept George's options open, but he is leaning toward UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to go pretty local," he said. "I wouldn't mind following in my 
brother's footsteps." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug George said those footsteps should give Seth instant credibility with any 
college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "His brothers are two proven four-year starters at the college level and both 
of them think he's as good as they were," he said. "That's a pretty good thing 
to go on." Boys' Soccer at a Glance

RUSTY HINGE; SOCCER STANDOUT ADAMSON PLANS TO PLAY FOR ROYAL AFTER KNEE INJURY 
COST HER A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Adamson laughs occasionally while discussing the longest year of her 
life, chuckling wryly when describing the knee injury that wouldn't go away. 
And she's upbeat as she talks about the 1994-95 high school soccer season at 
Royal High. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether she should be playing soccer at all this winter is an issue 
Adamson and her coach have both discussed. A senior co-captain for the 
Highlanders, Adamson last suited up with them two years ago as a sophomore 
striker. She missed last season because of aninjury to the anterior cruciate 
ligament in her left knee while at a five-day camp for prospective members of 
the U.S. under-19 national team in Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injury, which occurred on Nov. 25 of last year, Adamson is still 
considered one of California's top female players and will play at Stanford 
next fall. Had there been a quick and accurate diagnosis of the injury, Adamson 
would likely be terrorizing Marmonte League goaltenders by now, but a series of 
problems in her medical care has kept her out of action even as Royal begins 
its season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a nightmare," Adamson said about the initial injury. "I was 
pretty much at a full sprint and went to cut and change direction. I went one 
way and my knee went the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The popping sensation and searing pain knocked Adamson to the turf, where she 
immediately feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't move," Adamson said. "I knew something major had happened . . . but 
the trainers there misdiagnosed it and said it was a strained ligament." 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson received a similar misdiagnosis after she returned to California. She 
underwent two months of rehabilitation and then, in January, attempted to 
return to practice with her team at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 During the warm-up period for that first practice back, the knee gave out 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time a noted orthopedic doctor took a magnetic resonance imaging test of 
Adamson's injured joint and told her the anterior cruciate ligament was torn 
and folded over. Immediate surgery was prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right when I found out I cried and cried and cried," Adamson said. "Soccer is 
my life and I'd been out of it for two months and now it was possibly going to 
be a year. I wanted to get (the surgery) done right away and get it over with, 
but I wondered 'Am I ever going to come back to normal?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Full reconstructive surgery was performed at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center in March of this year, but Adamson turned out to be allergic to the 
stitches used to close the incision in her knee. Many of them popped loose and 
in June a less severe but separate procedure was needed to clean up what had 
turned into a less-than-perfect operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time wasted and a constant battle," Adamson said curtly. 
</P>
<P>
 But it appears that most of the struggles are coming to an end. Adamson 
endured three physical therapy sessions a week from April to July and has 
labored to add muscle, strength and flexibility to a leg that lost an inch and 
a half in circumference after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 She will not be cleared for full participation in practice until her knee 
returns to 95% of its former strength. It graded out at 75% in October after 
mustering only 35% in July, and Adamson hopes to reach the required strength 
level by January.  
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing I want to do is rush it. I don't want to have constant knee 
problems for the rest of my life," said Adamson, who wears a massive knee brace 
and practices many drills with her teammates, though avoiding ones involving 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Nelson, who captains the Highlanders along with Adamson, knows 
exactly how she feels. Nelson tore an anterior cruciate ligament in June of 
1992 and had reconstructive surgery, then returned to play 10 games for Royal 
last season before suffering another injury to the joint. She missed the 
remainder of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our injuries have brought us closer together because we understand 
what we can and can't do," Nelson said. "I think it would be harder for either 
of us if the other wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Adamson returns to action, her concerns will shift from increasing her 
strength to avoiding further injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you're always going to have bruisers on teams who will do anything 
and everything to stop you," she said. "I'm also afraid of going out there and 
stepping on (her leg) wrong or something stupid like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Which raises the thorny question of whether Adamson should play soccer at all 
this season. With a scholarship secured and the knee still tender, what does 
she have to gain? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what a lot of people have told me, including my parents," Adamson 
said. "But there's a national team camp over spring break and I don't want to 
go into it without any games under my belt. High school soccer is a chance for 
me to get my touch back." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of Adamson re-injuring herself also has crossed the mind of 
Andy Silva, who is in his first year of guiding the Royal girls' team after 13 
seasons with the Simi Valley boys' program.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there's that little thing in the back of your mind where you don't want 
to see a player like that lose everything she's worked for, especially in 
Kelly's case," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see her play because she's got a lot of things to contribute 
to the team and it would help bring her back into the game mentally," he said. 
"I wouldn't put her in positions where she would get hammered and I wouldn't 
want to jeopardize (the knee) to the extent where she gets injured again." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Adamson admits she is likely to be hesitant in her first full-speed 
practices and then again in her first matches, those are the events she looks 
forward to the most. "The day I'm dreaming of is the one where my brace is off 
and I'm back to normal," she said. "I know when I come back I'll be really 
hesitant at first but I can't wait for when I don't have fear of doing anything 
with my knee."

2 FIGHTS FOR TITLES IN VALLEY; BOXING: LAWLOR-SMITH, GOOSSEN-LOPEZ BOUTS ON 
UPCOMING CARDS IN WOODLAND HILLS.

 Professional boxing has found a permanent home in the suburbs of the West 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warner Center Marriott Hotel will play host to monthly boxing shows 
throughout 1995, promoter Peter Broudy said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The next fight night, Jan. 18, will feature a bout between Irish Pat Lawlor 
(20-6, six knockouts) and Randy (Big Man) Smith (13-1-2, four knockouts) for 
the vacant state middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for the second card, Feb. 22, is a bout between Palmdale's P.J. 
Goossen (13-0, 11 knockouts) and Kenny Lopez, the state junior middleweight 
champion. Dates of the other shows are March 8, April 12, May 10, June 14, July 
12, Aug. 9, Sept. 20, Oct. 25, Nov. 15 and Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a popular fixture at the Country Club in Reseda, professional boxing had 
dried up in the San Fernando Valley before Broudy's first card last month 
brought an upscale clientele to the hotel's Grand Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Broudy has signed a 12-show contract with the hotel -- "A good deal for 
everybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing's resurgence hasn't come without controversy. Broudy's first show at 
the Marriott, on Nov. 2, was marred by mass confusion when the fire marshal 
ordered event organizers to change venue's seating arrangement only hours 
before the scheduled first bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds for more than 300 tickets were drawn that night, but on a second try, 
Nov. 23, the show ran smoothly and profitably. 
</P>
<P>
 Broudy, who grew up in Van Nuys, was instrumental in boxing's decade-long stay 
at the Country Club. He likes his new venue even better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good site and it has a good clientele," Broudy said. "People like 
going to a place that's safe."

 Soon thereafter, another customer comes in, pays his fee and gets the same

 From the opening wassail to the final "Silent Night," the spirit of the 
holiday season rang out loud and clear at the Charles Dickens dinner Friday. 
The USC Friends of Music host the annual event to raise funds for scholarships 
at the university's School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crystal Ballroom at the Biltmore was trimmed with traditional Christmas 
decor -- pine, poinsettias, fairy lights, red ribbons, carriage lanterns. There 
was a ceiling-high tree, and the USC Chamber Singers and winds and percussion 
musicians performed from the balcony as guests made their way to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Scampering around for added atmosphere were the children of Friends members 
decked out as Dickens characters. Matthew Reale was the Artful Dodger and Cassa 
Kaminski a street urchin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 400 guests in modern evening wear were Joyce Spraska, 
Flora Thornton, Ruth and Walter McBee, and Joern Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The dean of the School of Music, Larry Livingston, included the admonition, 
"Leave your diet," in his welcoming toast. Each course of the "sumptuous feast" 
was introduced with musical accompaniment, and the "roast beef of olde England" 
was paraded around the tables, although the meat on the plate was continental 
style filet mignon with portelaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the carolers brought their music downstairs to the stage and a 
scholarship presentation was made in the name of the evening's honoree, Michael 
Feinstein. The recipient was Robert Thies, who is studying for his master's 
degree in piano performance.  
</P>
<P>
 As a tribute to Feinstein, Thies played Gershwin's Prelude No. 1, which 
prompted Feinstein to tease: "That was a flawless performance and I never want 
to speak to you again." 
</P>
<P>
 More seriously, the Gershwin scholar, composer and performer talked about "the 
sense of continuum" he felt as guest of honor at an evening that keeps music 
traditions alive.  
</P>
<P>
 Lauding Feinstein for his friendship and talent were Nancy Olson Livingston 
and Armen Guzelimian. Benefit chairwoman Kathryn Fauble said: "What really 
knocks me out about Michael is that when you are done hearing him, you just 
wish he was a terrific friend and you could call him up any time." 
</P>
<P>
 "My number is 213 . . . " responded Feinstein, after he had received the 
Dickens Award presented by his friend Liza Minelli.  
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was happy to perform a Gershwin melody, and the crowd was even 
happier when Minelli joined him, impromptu, for a duet of her godmother Kaye 
Thompson's "Am I in Love With You or the Violin?"

R S V P; THE FOOD WAS FINE -- THE CAUSE, DIVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What photographer Herb Ritts called "a swap meet with class" ended with an 
equally classy dinner Sunday night when Divine Design '94 came to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day fund-raiser at the Pacific Design Center brought in $1.5 million 
for the AIDS charities Project Angel Food and DIFFA/LA (Design Institute 
Foundation for AIDS). It featured a marketplace of heavily discounted designer 
clothes (Barbra Streisand was one of the thousands looking for bargains), an 
interior-design showcase, a "flea market" of upscale merchandise and the 
extravagant tented dinner for 1,200 catered by Rex, Louise's Trattoria and Alto 
Palato where five leaders in the fashion/design field were honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing really made me proud," said Joie Davidow, founding editor of 
the now-defunct L.A. Style. "When I walked through those rooms, it gave me a 
renewed sense of what Los Angeles has to offer as a design community." 
</P>
<P>
 One eye-catching example of what L.A. has to offer was on Kelly Lynch. The 
actress wore a form-fitting, blue satin and lace Richard Tyler 1930s-style gown 
that turned heads. "When I put this on," she said, "I feel like a movie star." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay activist Barry Krost caught a glimpse of Lynch in the gown and said, "Even 
I had a vague heterosexual thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch arrived with Tyler as the dinner began at what fashion designer James 
Galanos called "the very accessible" hour of 5 o'clock. "This is very modern," 
Galanos said. "It makes for a very relaxed evening. If it had started at 9, 
people would be out of here in an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The early start left plenty of time for a three-course dinner of lasagna, 
filet of beef and an apple strudel dessert, plus the presentations of the 
awards. Honored were Tyler for his fashion work, CNN's Elsa Klensch for 
broadcast journalism, Tiffany's Elsa Peretti for jewelry, Rose Tarlow (for whom 
Faye Dunaway accepted) for interior design and Tim Burton (whose award was 
accepted by Martin Landau) for film direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the awards was a "fantasy auction," presented by Kathy Najimy, Teri 
Garr, Margaret Cho and Judy Tenuta that included everything from a round of 
golf with Clint Eastwood to a week in Bali. The high bid was for a half-hour 
ride with Tom Cruise piloting his two-seater plane. At $25,000 this might be 
the most anyone has ever paid to get out of Santa Monica airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those on hand were co-chairs Mel Lowrance, Michael Smith and Stephen 
Stoner; emcee Harvey Fierstein; plus Liza Minnelli, Joel Schumacher, Bob 
Mackie, Karen Eways, Lester Persky, David Dart, Fred and Rikki Rosen, Suzanne 
Marx and designer Mossimo Giannulli, who arrived with 10 staffers dressed a la 
Bugsy Siegel in ascots and wide-lapeled suits. 
</P>
<P>
 If the early start had a flaw, it was that it left too much time for the 
awards (and for everyone under the sun to be thanked). Still the evening was, 
as Tyler said, "a great example of people in Los Angeles really pulling 
together. We've been through riots, fires and earthquakes. This is a community 
that's really getting stronger."

O.C. MUSIC; NEW ROUTE TO CHANGED 'MOUNTAIN' 
</P>

 One of the images I took away from the Disney film "Fantasia" as a kid was 
that of a huge, bat-winged devil perched at the top of a mountain. To the 
exciting music of Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain," the devil drew ghosts 
and skeletons out of swamps and jails and graveyards for a big nasty party. It 
was Halloween in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the music wasn't really what Mussorgsky wrote, claims Daniel Lochrie, 
whose new version of the score will be heard for the first time at the Pacific 
Symphony concert in Costa Mesa today (the program, which also includes works by 
Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Stravinsky, repeats Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Mussorgsky's music became known through editions by others. His 
colleagues had considered some of his innovations too crude or bold and toned 
them down. Other works were left in such fragmentary form that they could not 
be performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantasia" incorporates an edition by Rimsky-Korsakov (who similarly had 
revised the opera "Boris Gudonov"). The edition was further arranged for the 
film by conductor Leopold Stokowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rimsky changed notes and whole key areas," Lochrie, 32, said during a recent 
phone interview from his home in Nashville, Tenn., where he plays clarinet with 
the Nashville Symphony. "He omitted two themes -- the devil's and also the 
church choir (at the end). He replaced development sections with added 
repetition. He toned down the orchestration in general. He toned down the 
harmonic language so there is less dissonance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lochrie discovered all this when he was working on the piece for his doctoral 
dissertation at Ohio State University in 1992. "I hadn't planned to finish my 
doctorate, to tell the truth. The last thing the clarinet world needs is 
another paper on mouthpiece literature. I was buying time until I could get an 
orchestra job." 
</P>
<P>
 But as he began writing a paper on "Bald Mountain," he discovered its complex 
history, "which created questions in my mind. I got interested in this topic, 
and that gave me a reason to finish the degree." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It all began around 1867 when Mussorgsky wrote an orchestral tone poem called 
"St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain." The work -- which disappeared until 
the score was published in 1968 -- had not been performed, "a real sore spot" 
for Mussorgsky, Lochrie said. "He spoke highly of his own work in this case, 
which he rarely did. He completed the score on St. John's Eve (the Russian 
Halloween, when the annual witches' Sabbath would occur). He saw that as 
inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
 Failing to get the work performed, he revised it in 1874 for an opera project 
with other composers, "Mlada," but the project was abandoned. So he revised it 
again in 1880 as an insert to what would be his final opera, "Sorochinsky 
Fair". But he only got as far as writing a version for piano four-hands and 
chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 He died a year later. Rimsky-Korsakov orchestrated "Night," while other 
composers completed the opera from the sketches Mussorgsky left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tended to take Rimsky-Korsakov's version of things, which was not 
always correct," Lochrie said. He noted that the difference between the first 
version and the "Fair" version "is extensive," and that Rimsky didn't have the 
benefit of hearing the first version, which didn't surface until the late 
1960s. Lochrie did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to orchestrate the last version, using the first version as a 
model. To me, that seems the most obvious part of the whole thing. I'm just 
amazed it didn't happen earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't Mussorgsky's ideas about orchestration have changed during the 
13-year span? "That's something that can't be known," Lochrie answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think his general approach or philosophy toward orchestration ever 
changed. When he wrote (the first) 'Bald Mountain,' he bragged about the 
orchestration. He was concerned with the true representation of folk fantasy, 
what historians call 'Russian Realism.' Rimsky was far less concerned with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there were places in the revision so different that Lochrie couldn't 
rely on the earlier version. "In cases like that, I took similar passages from 
'Boris,' from the orchestral passages in 'Sorochinsky Fair' and some similar 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two issues here, really. One is that this version of Mussorgsky's 
notes -- the actual notes -- is never heard. It deserves a hearing. Before it's 
rejected, it deserves to be heard. It's hardly had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondly, as to which one you are going to like better in the end: As far as 
the notes are concerned, you're going to like the notes of the Mussorgsky 
better. Rimsky should have left the notes intact. It would have been less of an 
affront." 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, Lochrie's version is not that different in length from Rimsky's. 
"Rimsky has a lot more repetition in it,," Lochrie said, "but he cut a couple 
of themes. (Mine) has more themes and less repetition. They end up being about 
the same length. The first 72 measures are the closest. After that, (mine) 
really gets to be quite different." 
</P>
<P>
 * Carl St.Clair will conduct the Pacific Symphony in the premiere performances 
of Daniel Lochrie's edition of Modest Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain" 
today and Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. Works by Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Stravinsky also will be 
on the program. Robert McDuffie will be violin soloist. 8 p.m. $14 to $63.

'LAW & ORDER' STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS; TELEVISION: DESPITE ITS POPULARITY, THE 
LOW-KEY SERIES HASN'T GRABBED THE HEADLINES. BUT NOW IT FACES 'NORTHERN 
EXPOSURE.' WILL THE AUDIENCE STAY? 
</P>

<P>
 There is finally justice for "Law & Order." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like the NBC crime series has ever had any trouble arresting viewers 
or critics. "Law & Order" has consistently drawn high praise and significant 
ratings since its debut in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show has frequently been in the shadow of other crime dramas, seldom 
generating blaring headlines or magazine cover-grabbing controversies earned by 
that other New York police show "NYPD Blue," or by "L.A. Law" or even the less 
popular "Homicide: Life on the Street." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime-fighting force of "Law & Order" is quietly demonstrating this 
season, however, that it is indeed a force to be reckoned with -- and without 
the notorious trappings of raw language, nudity, violence or an Academy 
Award-winning producer. In its fifth season, the drama is getting its best 
ratings ever, is up more than 10% in viewership and key demographics, and for 
the first time in its history ranks among the top 20 most popular shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives and industry observers attribute the show's increased 
popularity to a variety of factors: a furor last season when actor Michael 
Moriarty, who played Assistant Dist. Atty. Ben Stone, left the series in a 
dispute with executive producer Dick Wolf; the addition of Sam Waterston as a 
charismatic district attorney; story lines that appeal more to the female 
audience, and viewers who are checking out the drama for the first time after 
being intrigued by syndicated reruns on cable's Arts & Entertainment channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has it hurt being scheduled against two newsmagazines: ABC's "Turning 
Point" and CBS' "48 Hours," leaving "Law & Order" as the only network 
entertainment series in the time slot. That situation will change in January, 
however, when CBS moves "Northern Exposure" over from Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly like being up against two newsmagazines better," Wolf said. "I 
haven't a clue on how this will affect us, but I don't think our audiences 
overlap that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wolf said "Law & Order" has triumphed not because of weak competition 
but because of its topical stories and ensemble cast. He said he is especially 
grateful to a loyal core of viewers who don't mind that the drama stays focused 
on the case at hand and does not get involved in the personal lives of the 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television has a strange way of assuring that quality will out," Wolf said 
recently at his Universal City office. "Everyone is really excited about the 
added attention we're getting, but we've always felt that we were well thought 
of. Plus, in five seasons, our look has not changed and our style has not 
changed. Fans who tune us in know what they're getting." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jerry Orbach, who plays Detective Lennie Briscoe in the "Law" portion 
of the one-hour series, said he has often felt slighted because the series did 
not get as much attention as other crime dramas. He attributed it to the show's 
"all work and very little play" approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little frustrating," said Orbach. "The purity of the show is the way 
that it's structured, that it's so case-oriented. There's very little about us 
as characters. We're all proud of that, but sometimes I get jealous of other 
people getting to roll around -- not that I want to show my ass, mind you." 
</P>
<P>
 He quipped, "I mean, I like Dennis (Franz of "NYPD Blue"), but I really didn't 
need to see his ass." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf now wishes the same fire that has caught "Law & Order" would catch his 
other police series, "New York Undercover," which has been struggling in its 
freshman season on Fox. He said the show, which has a hip-hop motif and 
revolves around two young minority detectives, is among the most popular with 
teens and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show so far is a huge hit that nobody knows is a huge hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has faith that the series will eventually find its audience just as 
"Law & Order" has. 
</P>
<P>
 The format of "Law & Order" has remained the same throughout its five seasons 
-- a "two-shows-in-one" formula, as Wolf calls it. In the first half hour, 
Briscoe and detective Mike Logan (Chris Noth) solve crimes and arrest suspects. 
In the second half, the case is turned over to "Order" -- the district 
attorney's office. Attorneys Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) and Claire Kincaid 
(Jill Hennessy) team up for the cases under the watchful supervision of their 
boss, Dist. Atty. Adam Schiff (Steven Hill). 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf said he has often grappled with network executives about changing that 
format, bringing more of the characters' personal lives into the mix and 
perhaps following them home. But he has resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a great deal of discussion about warming up the show," he 
said. "But I've got to do this the way I think it will work. It's about the 
work life. The play is the thing. Each half hour has the amount of story that 
is contained in an average hour. It's a philosophical decision I made." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield said he instructed 
Wolf to add more "female appeal" to the show this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him to have more stories that would be more inviting to women," 
Littlefield said. "I said, 'How can we take the stories on a very strong issue, 
and see how that reflects and touches our characters?' We wanted to get a 
broader-based audience. I don't think they've made any radical adjustments. It 
is a more personal show than it has been in the past, and we're extremely happy 
with the path it's taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield and Wolf said much of the added appeal is due to Waterston, whose 
character has an undefined but possibly romantic relationship with Kincaid. But 
don't hold your breath for the pair to have a steamy bedroom scene any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's what the viewers want," Wolf said. "Subtext and 
imagination is always better than text. Attitudes and a glance and a tone of 
voice can speak volumes. They'll be no concrete evidence, no underwear lying 
around the office. The day they showed Dave and Maddie in bed on 'Moonlighting' 
was the day it was over. The mystery was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Law & Order" airs at 10 p.m. Wednesdays on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). 
"New York Undercover" airs at 9 p.m. Thursdays on Fox (Channels 11 and 6).

A DIFFERENT DANCE OF DIVERSITY; MULTICULTURALISM: CALARTS' CRISTYNE LAWSON 
REFUSES TO CHOOSE DANCERS ON THE BASIS OF RACE. 'WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 
DIVERSIFIED. AND WE DIDN'T DO IT FOR REASONS OF MIXING CULTURES. . . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 CalArts, the respected institution founded by Walt Disney, has long been a 
haven for the experimental arts. It's produced famous and influential graduates 
in a variety of disciplines and been at the forefront of a number of trends. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the school hopped aboard the interculturalism bandwagon back in the 
1980s, when mixing it up culturally was just coming in vogue. And since 
President Steven Lavine took office in 1988, the banner of diversity has been 
flown even higher. But that doesn't mean everybody here toes the multicultural 
party line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is totally out of hand, silly," says dance school dean 
Cristyne Lawson of the art world's preoccupation with racial and ethnic 
categorization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I know there's been a necessity to do it in some areas," 
she continues, "but in the world of art you start getting into trouble, because 
I don't think that you can define yourself only by your color." 
</P>
<P>
 Such identity politics, says the outspoken former Martha Graham and Alvin 
Ailey dancer, are limiting, not liberating. "You have to pick yourself out from 
under that if you go into defining yourself only in terms of your culture," 
Lawson says. "Your culture is only one part of who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone who doubts that this dancer-choreographer walks the walk as well as 
talks the talk need only look at the CalArts Dance Ensemble. Founded by Lawson 
in 1979, the group includes artists working in modern and traditional styles, 
both Western and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we all had different techniques and styles, we had to find a way 
to work together," says Lawson of her ecumenical troupe. "It made us create 
work that was highly unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual CalArts Dance Ensemble Concert presents "The 25th Year Alumni 
Celebration" Thursday though Saturday in the Walt Disney Modular Theater on the 
CalArts campus. Dedicated to the five alumni the dance school has lost to AIDS, 
the concert will feature two premieres and two repertory works -- including 
dances by such CalArts veterans as Susan Rose, Phyllis Gomer, Jacques Heim, 
Tomas Tamayo, Nanik Wenten and others. Also on the bill will be guest alums 
performing in dances created by Ensemble members Lawson, Tina Yuan, Lyndon 
Branaugh and Liz Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The professional troupe is, of course, no different from the dance program out 
of which it originated. "We've always had a diversified group of students in 
the dance school -- lots of foreign, minority students," Lawson says. "At 
CalArts, compared with other departments, I would say (the level of diversity) 
is unusual, but it has been the norm for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the students have never been chosen on the basis of demographics. "It has 
never applied to us," Lawson says. "We have always been diversified. And we 
didn't do it for reasons of mixing cultures or anything remotely like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the variety has simply proven artistically fertile. "The students who 
come here with their different backgrounds have made it richer for us without 
having to do anything but be themselves," says Lawson. "The minute you start 
narrowing yourself down to Korean or Chinese or black or whatever choreography, 
you're . . . making your world narrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Which also explains Lawson's disdain for the practice of presenting 
choreographers grouped together by virtue of their ethnic backgrounds rather 
than their work. "I don't think there are any particular guidelines for black 
choreographers to follow that are any different from anybody else," Lawson 
says. "Why don't you call it 'white choreographers'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson prefers the color-blind approach. Like the school, her ensemble is an 
international rainbow coalition of artists from an array of backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally made up only of faculty members, the group has expanded to include 
students, alumni and other guest artists. "It was started so that I could keep 
quality faculty here and growing while they were teaching," says Lawson, who, 
with 17 years in her post, is the senior dean at CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 What began so pragmatically, though, has grown into a company with a style all 
its own. "You see it in the concert," Lawson says. "No one is coming from any 
particular technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, says Lawson, purists would do well to remember that American modern 
dance is itself an eclectic genre. "Almost all of modern dance came out of 
ethnic dance, in the sense that it has used movement ideas that came out of 
American Indian styles, yoga and Eastern philosophies," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an indigenous American modern tradition here, it doesn't have its 
roots in European culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The precedent notwithstanding, that's not to say that there aren't cultural 
differences left to be negotiated. "The biggest differences come in how people 
conceptualize in different cultures and in hearing sound," Lawson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, hearing has been harder than the dancing," Lawson continues. "When 
you start working with electronic music, it becomes culturally difficult for 
someone who has only heard Chinese music to understand what is being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no matter how much extra work may be required, Lawson feels it's better to 
buck the current trend. "If you can use those headings to your advantage, 
good," she says. "But most people get stuck in them. You have to be able to see 
beyond the latest words."

PROGRESSIVE PARTY; THESE ARE GOOD TIMES FOR DREAM THEATRE, WHOSE RAPID SUCCESS 
IS A SURPRISE EVEN TO THE BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The progressive rock sound of sheer, showy chops amid a sea of 
pseudo-classical white noise was killed off in the late '70s by the 
do-it-yourself tenets of punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's what conventional rock-history wisdom says. So what's the 
explanation for the popularity of Dream Theatre, which takes over for the likes 
of Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and other great dinosaurs of the 
progressive era? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this supposed to be the age of the simplistic amateurism of grunge? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, yet Dream Theatre's 1992 debut album has been certified gold, a 
video of its single "Pull Me Under" has been in steady rotation on MTV and the 
group is promoting its new album, "Awake," with a national tour that includes a 
show Thursday to open the new Galaxy Concert Theatre in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 It all adds up to a level of success that seems to have taken aback even the 
band members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're totally shocked," said Dream Theatre drummer Mike Portnoy in a recent 
phone interview. "We always expected that the band would have to work really, 
really hard, and it would be a slow, building process. We thought it would take 
a few years to get to the level we had on the first album. We never counted on 
MTV or radio or anything like that, so we're really grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Theatre -- consisting of Portnoy, guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John 
Myung, vocalist James LaBrie and touring keyboardist Derek Sherinian -- parlays 
technical virtuosity into long compositions with extended instrumental breaks 
that showcase the members' respective soloing talents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of band often featured in musicians' magazines. In fact, the 
nucleus of the group met at Boston's prestigious Berklee School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Berklee) was very jazz-oriented while we were there," remembered Portnoy. 
"We were like these long-haired, metal kids playing Iron Maiden covers and Rush 
covers. We were kind of outcasts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The metal edge to Dream Theatre's music is perhaps what sets it apart from 
such ancestors as Yes and makes the group's sound more accessible to modern 
audiences. The attitude is more rebel than quasi-spiritual, even as they 
display chops that took years of devoted practice to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up listening to real progressive stuff, like Yes, Genesis and the 
Dregs," said Portnoy, 27. "But at the same time, we were also listening to Deep 
Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and so on. When the group got together, we 
wanted to combine both of those worlds. We try to incorporate everything. We're 
all very open-minded listeners, and that comes out in our style. We let all of 
our influences become part of the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portnoy makes no apologies for the group's displays of instrumental skill and 
believes that its "look-at-me-shred" approach is what sets it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that the trend right now is to be as simple as possible, whereas 
what we're doing is the total opposite of that," he said. "We've been called 
the 'alternative to the alternative.' A lot of people thought that was 
something that would kill us, but I think it actually worked more to our 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing isn't flavor-of-the-month. There's a void of music like this 
out there, and there's an audience that definitely wants it, wants music that 
requires a little more thought than the younger grunge and the alternative 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 No musical reactionary, Portnoy is quick to note that he likes a lot of 
current rock and believes that many of today's top groups deserve their 
success. If he bears any animosity about the current scene, it's directed 
toward the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think once a certain sound or style starts doing well, the media tend to 
take off with it and ignore everything else," he said. "So that's why I think 
(the scene has) become a little too one-dimensional." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Dream Theatre is a record that will break even more rules. Portnoy 
said the group plans to record a single 20-minute composition to be released as 
an EP next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only rule we have when we're writing is to have no rules at all," he 
said. "We take the clock off the wall, and everything takes a back seat to 
whatever pops up." 
</P>

JOFFREY BALLET CANCELS TOUR CITING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS; DANCE: THE FIVE-WEEK 
SCHEDULE WOULD HAVE INCLUDED A SIX-DAY ENGAGEMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY IN APRIL. 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to cut costs, the financially troubled Joffrey Ballet has 
canceled a tour scheduled for April that was to have included a six-day 
engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, company 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour, which would also have stopped in Houston and Austin, would have 
included 14 performances stretched over a 5-week period, numbers no longer 
considered financially feasible due to dancers' per diem and other expenses, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these financially strained times," David A. Kipper, the Joffrey's board 
president, said in a prepared statement, "it is incumbent upon the company to 
operate in a prudent, conservative manner now to ensure the future fiscal 
viability of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Rima Corben said that the troupe "would like to" reschedule the 
canceled tour, which was to include performances of its successful "Billboards" 
ballet with music by Prince; "Billboards" has already been performed in 
Southern California on two separate engagements at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion at the Music Center in Los Angeles and once at OCPAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the company will perform "The Nutcracker" on Dec. 21-30 at the 
Music Center as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corben added that the April tour cancellation is "not specifically" related to 
the American Guild of Musical Artists' recent move against the Joffrey. In 
October the AGMA filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration 
Assn., citing non-payment of Joffrey dancer salaries for two weeks this year 
and in two past seasons, as well as unpaid medical reimbursements, severance 
pay and pension contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision from the Arbitration Assn. is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing financial difficulties, American Ballet Theatre recently canceled a 
Jan. 4-6 engagement at the San Diego Civic Theatre and its Dec. 12-24 
"Nutcracker" engagement in Purchase, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 OCPAC Director Tom Tomlinson said no money had exchanged hands for the 
engagement. A spokesman for the Orange County center said it plans to fill the 
Joffrey's April 4-9 engagement with another dance company.

NEWPORT HARBOR SHIFTS OFFICE HOURS TO CUT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Newport Harbor Art Museum has rearranged its office hours in an effort 
save money on utilities and security. As of this week, the offices are closed 
on Mondays, the day the galleries routinely are closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices will be staffed every other Saturday and an extra hour on 
weekdays. The total number of hours that the office staff will work is 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are the latest in a series of cost-cutting moves. Nine employees 
were laid off in 1992 to help reduce an accumulated deficit of more than 
$160,000. The layoffs were part of a 10% cut in the budget, which was $1.3 
million in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana instituted a 
four-day, 36-hour work week for its employees in addition to a 5% pay cut. 
Museum officials said that cutback -- which also involved closing offices on 
Mondays -- would reduce the Bowers' $3.6 million budget by $500,000. Comparable 
numbers for Newport Harbor were not available.

BOWERS TO SPONSOR LAS POSADAS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art will hold the annual Las Posadas traditional 
Mexican Christmas festival at the museum on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's three-hour free event will feature folkloric dancers, live music 
and pinatas as well as traditional Las Posadas foods, including sweet tamales 
and sugar candies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, Las Posadas began in 1587, when an Augustan friar, Diego de Soria, 
was given permission by Pope Sixtus V to celebrate special masses outdoors in 
the days before Christmas. It evolved into the public processions that are 
commonplace today. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers' Las Posadas celebration will run from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. at the museum, 
2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. Information: (714) 567-3600.

RARE GEMS FROM A SHY 'MASTER OF PRECIOUS METALS'; ART: GIANMARIA BUCCELLATI 
SHOWS WORKS THAT HAVE BEEN LOCKED AWAY FOR YEARS. LARGE GEMSTONE AND JEWELRY 
PIECES CAN BE SEEN AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. 
</P>

 What are arguably the finest contemporary goldsmith and lapidary works in the 
world have for years been locked in the private vaults of the House of 
Buccellati in Milan. But now Gianmaria Buccellati, heir to the family tradition 
of jewelry making, has brought his private collection to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first stop is the Los Angeles Natural History Museum. The exhibition, 
which runs through Jan. 8, captures the essence of the Italian Renaissance and 
French Rococo styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now all that could be seen of the Buccellati works was his jewelry, 
which is sold at a handful of shops all over the world. But Buccellati never 
thought there would be any interest in his private collection, which consists 
of much bigger and more valuable pieces, until the idea was suggested by Larry 
French, who runs the Buccellati Beverly Hills store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony R. Kampf, curator of gems and minerals at the museum and of this 
exhibition, said that it was a shame to let the collection remain hidden from 
the public in a vault, so the decision was made to bring it to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most impressive to me is the craftsmanship," Kampf said. "Every piece has 
been made by hand using techniques employed for hundreds of years. There are no 
shortcuts; it's painstaking work." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the exhibit is new works by Buccellati, 14 large gemstone and 
jewelry masterworks that he designed for himself during the past 25 years. But 
the exhibit also contains items made by the family as long as 75 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the older pieces have been sold to private parties over the years. So 
Gianmaria Buccellati created the new pieces to preserve his ancestors' legacy. 
He began his own goldsmith career when he was a 14-year-old apprentice in his 
family's shop and laboratories. When his father, Mario, died in 1965, Gianmaria 
continued the heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the pieces created by the House of Buccellati were made for famous 
international clients. One, the late poet, dramatist and novelist Gabriele 
D'Annunzio, referred to Mario as the "maestro paragon coppella" (master of 
precious metals). 
</P>
<P>
 Today more than 200 craftsmen help Buccellati make the distinctive pieces of 
jewelry. His sons Gino and Andrea, wife Rosa Maria and nephew Mario work with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Buccellati describes himself as a perfectionist. It is not uncommon for a work 
of his to remain unfinished for years until he feels inspired to complete it 
just the right way. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights of this exhibition is a stunning brooch known as the 
"Phoenix." The centerpiece of the mythological bird is a baroque pearl of more 
than 135 carats. The pearl, a mauvescent color, is from the Red Sea. Buccellati 
said someone brought the pearl to him because they knew that he collects 
strange and unusual things. He was inspired to build around the pearl, 
combining it with hundreds of white and canary diamonds, a white baroque South 
Sea pearl and three colors of gold using the classic engraving style that is 
the hallmark of Buccellati. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cratere Delle Muse" (the Trophy of the Muses) takes its inspiration and name 
from Greco-Roman traditions -- "I found this beautiful piece of jade, carved it 
and combined it with gold, silver and blue sapphires." That's 2,027 Cabochon 
sapphires. Buccellati engraved the names of the nine muses along the inside of 
the gold border. 
</P>
<P>
 A triumph of goldsmithing and lapidary work is the "Cup of Pleasure," a 
chalice created from three pieces of carved rock crystal (quartz) joined by 
yellow-, white- and rose-colored gold. It is embellished with 55 emeralds and 
31 rubies. The design borrows elements from the Italian Renaissance and Louis 
XV period. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Coppa Dell Oblio" (the Cup of Euphoric Bliss) embodies complete romanticism, 
which is typically characteristic of the swan. The swan, an antique piece of 
carved moss jasper, was found by Buccellati, who then built around the 
beautiful stone: "The swan is happy and always dreaming." The chest and wings 
of the swan are gold, and it gazes upon itself through its diamond eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty and elegance of feminine forms have always inspired the highest 
image of the spirit of love. "Coppa Dell'Amore" (the Cup of the Spirit of Love) 
is made out of an antique piece of red jasper. The borders and decorations are 
in yellow gold. Set on a Rococo motif, the gold "Venus and the Three Cupids" 
represents the idealized theme of water, air and wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coppa Medicean" (the Medicean Cup) is inspired by the Renaissance. The cup is 
made of sodalite, and gold borders of 15th-Century style leaves alternated with 
silver engravings add contrast. A faceted ruby is set in the center of each 
yellow gold rosette, which is chased in a "modellato" pattern. Special tools 
must be used to create this particularly exquisite pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Museum of Natural History, 900 Exposition Blvd., L.A., is open 
Tues.-Sun., 10 a.m.-4:45 p.m. Admission, which includes entrance to the 
Buccellati exhibition, is $6 for adults, $4 for seniors and students and $2 for 
children. (213) 744-3466.

SACRAMENTO FILE: 5 MEASURES CALL FOR A PANEL TO REGULATE GAMBLING INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new state commission to regulate California's rapidly growing gambling 
industry would be established under five separate measures introduced on the 
opening day of the 1995-96 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of one of the bills, SB 5, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), said 
gambling interests have spent $5.3 million on campaign contributions and 
lobbying activities in Sacramento since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Hayden said his proposal includes fund-raising prohibitions, 
limits on initiative contributions, and other conflict-of-interest provisions 
to guarantee that the commission can remain independent of the gambling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five commissioners would be appointed by the governor, and one 
each by the Speaker of the Assembly and the Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gambling regulatory measures were introduced by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San 
Francisco), Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento) and Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood). ASSEMBLY 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Introductions 
</P>
<P>
 * None of the Above: AB 17 by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) would 
add a "none of the above" category on the general election ballot for statewide 
and legislative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paddling: AB 7 by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) calls for paddling as 
a punishment for minors who are convicted of graffiti crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Affirmative Action: ACA 2 by Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico) would 
prohibit the state and its political subdivisions from using race, sex, color, 
ethnicity or national origin as criteria for discriminating against or granting 
preferential treatment to any individual or group in public in the areas of 
public employment, education or contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 * English Only: AB 24 by Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) would 
require the state and its political subdivisions to take steps to preserve, 
protect and enhance the role of the English language as the official language 
of the state. SENATE 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Introductions 
</P>
<P>
 * Parliamentary Government: SCA 1 by Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-Santa Clara) would 
create a parliamentary form of state government with a 120-member, single-house 
legislature that would elect the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Term Limits: SB 2 by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), upon approval by 
voters, would impose term limits on local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drive-by Shootings: SB 9 by Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino) would make those 
convicted of first-degree murder committed in a drive-by shooting subject to 
the death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Budget: SCA 2 by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) would require a 
simple majority vote instead of a two-thirds majority vote to pass the state 
budget, and forfeiture of legislative pay for each day the budget is not 
adopted after the June 15 constitutional deadline.

'HE GROANED, HIS KNEES BUCKLED . . . HE COLLAPSED'; POLITICS: A FIRSTHAND 
ACCOUNT OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S SHOOTING SHOWS THE TENSION -- AND HUMOR -- 
OF HIS MEDICAL CARE. IT ALSO REIGNITES QUESTIONS ABOUT RELIEVING A LEADER OF 
POWER.

<P>
 Ben Aaron was watching the blood pour out of Ronald Reagan's chest, more than 
a cup of it every 15 minutes. Unlike the bright hue of freshly oxygenated 
blood, this blood was a dark ruby color -- "ominously dark," Aaron thought. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a rainy afternoon on March 30, 1981, and Dr. Benjamin Aaron, chief of 
cardiothoracic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, was 
"concentrating mightily" on the medical problem -- not the person -- in front 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was no denying that the patient on the gurney was in fact the 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my head, this little voice kept saying, 'Don't screw up on 
this one!' That went through my mind a lot," Aaron recalls now. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn., Aaron and his 
hospital colleague, Dr. S. David Rockoff, offer "the only authoritative, 
firsthand account" of Reagan's medical care after the 1981 assassination 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The account varies little from many previous reports, but it does provide new 
details about Reagan's irrepressible humor (even while on a ventilator), his 
brush with hepatitis from possibly contaminated blood, and his surgeon's 
concern about public reaction to the idea of leaving a bullet in a President's 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 While Aaron and Rockoff do not mention the controversy that developed later 
over their famous patient's ability to govern, their report also reignites the 
debate over how and when a disabled leader should be relieved of power. 
</P>
<P>
 As testimony to the growing urgency of such questions, JAMA editors frame the 
medical report on Reagan's gunshot wound with an extraordinary set of 
commentaries and editorials on the vulnerability of U.S. Presidents and the 
national need for better ways to deal with an incapacitated President. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is not simply hypothetical," writes former President Jimmy Carter 
in a special essay for the medical journal. "We must find a better way." 
</P>
<P>
 For Carter and other contributors to the JAMA debate, one way might be to 
create an independent panel of medical experts to decide when a President is 
not fit to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Carter, who once fainted in office from exhaustion, the 
possibility of a U.S. President becoming disabled -- particularly by a 
neurological illness -- presents a "continuing danger to our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 10 minutes after Reagan; his press secretary, Jim Brady, and two 
others were ambushed outside the Washington Hilton, the President walked 
through the triple glass doors of the George Washington University Hospital 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 No one -- including the President -- believed that he had been shot, only that 
he had been injured during the getaway from the chaotic scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I can't catch my breath," he told the nurses rushing toward him. His 
teeth were stained with blood and he was gasping for air.  
</P>
<P>
 "He groaned, his knees buckled, and he began to fall. . . . He dropped to one 
knee. He then collapsed and was carried to the trauma room," according to the 
doctors' report. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came in, his blood pressure was nonexistent," Aaron said in an 
interview this week. At first, doctors and nurses believed Reagan was having a 
heart attack. Not until his expensive blue suit and monogrammed shirt were cut 
away did it become clear that he had been shot. Beneath his left armpit was a 
buttonhole-like slit in the skin -- the entry wound of the bullet.  
</P>
<P>
 The emergency room team began giving Reagan oxygen, intravenous fluids and 
type O Rh-negative blood from the hospital's blood bank. Before the day was 
over, the President would receive almost four quarts of blood -- more than half 
his body's supply. It was not until April 4 that a federal laboratory reported 
that some of the blood Reagan received was "suspicious" for hepatitis B 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The screens we were running in the hospital in those days showed none of 
that," Aaron told The Times. "Of course, until late 1984 or early 1985, there 
was no test for HIV either. All our blood was Red Cross-certified, and nobody 
seemed especially surprised that these extraordinary (additional) tests turned 
up some suspicions." 
</P>
<P>
 To head off the hepatitis, Aaron injected the President with gamma globulin 
and hyperimmune beta globulin. 
</P>
<P>
 The more immediate concern for doctors was their inability to explain and 
control the bleeding inside Reagan's chest at least twice during his hospital 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the President's injured lung had been re-expanded in the ER, the 
bleeding continued. X-rays taken by Rockoff, the hospital's radiology chief, 
showed the bullet had lodged near the heart. "A decision had to be made about 
whether to operate," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to perform exploratory surgery on a 70-year-old gunshot victim is 
never easy. When the patient is the leader of the Free World, it can be 
excruciating.  
</P>
<P>
 "I explained the reasons for going to the OR to Mrs. Reagan and to the 
President," Aaron said, "and they agreed." Although obviously worried and still 
unable to breathe easily, Reagan issued the most memorable of the many 
one-liners he would utter after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking up at one of his surgeons, Reagan said: "Please tell me you're a 
Republican." The surgeon -- an avowed Democrat, according to Aaron and Rockoff, 
answered: "Today, Mr. President, we're all Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 (Later in the recovery room, Reagan would entertain his nurses with notes 
scribbled on a clip pad of pink paper. Despite his disorientation and the 
ventilator tube in his throat, Reagan quoted W.C. Fields, Winston Churchill and 
even some of his own lines as an actor.) 
</P>
<P>
 But as surgery entered its second, and then its third hour, with the bullet 
still somewhere in the President's chest, the mood in the operating room was 
heavy. "With bleeding slowed and mounting anesthetic time, some consideration 
was given to closing the chest with the bullet in place," Aaron and Rockoff 
report in JAMA. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual to leave bullets behind, especially when the victim is 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in favor of leaving the bullet in Reagan's chest -- at least initially 
-- included Reagan's then-personal physician, Dr. Daniel Ruge. "I was in the OR 
at the time, and we did discuss this, but I felt I did not want to push (Aaron) 
into anything because he was the surgeon in charge," Ruge told The Times in an 
interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aaron, who argued for removal, says he was concerned that the bullet might 
migrate into an artery or the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly for a physician, say some ethicists, Aaron also was motivated by 
"the obvious importance of obtaining the bullet for ballistics tests and as 
evidence in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the "public perception" problem. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Aaron and Rockoff, "A less important and non-medical 
consideration for continuing (the surgery) was the perception that to leave a 
would-be assassin's bullet in the chest of the President of the United States 
might be poorly accepted by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, the bullet was found a short time later." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the world knows, Reagan went on to enjoy a full recovery. Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that neurological disorders can be traced back to other 
medical problems," Ruge said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he does not dispute the recent revelation that Reagan has Alzheimer's 
disease, Ruge said failing memory can be attributed to other factors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that Reagan's fall from a horse and resulting subdural hematoma, and 
the anesthetics he had for prostate and colon surgeries all could have been 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think something that happened a long time ago can have an effect later 
on. The loss of blood after the shooting, the period when his blood pressure 
fell to dangerous levels, certainly that may have contributed to his symptoms 
now," said Ruge, now a retired neurosurgeon who was tapped for presidential 
duty after a long association with Nancy Reagan's stepfather, Dr. Loyal Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Ruge, Aaron nor Rockoff believe that Reagan's mental health showed 
any impairment immediately after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to concede that he was not in a position to lead the country 
while he was under anesthesia during and immediately after the surgery," Aaron 
said. "But if he was intellectually unstable at any other times, I know we 
would have heard about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Herbert Abrams, a Stanford University scholar and author on presidential 
disability, disagrees.  
</P>
<P>
 He notes that Reagan's doctors never formally evaluated his mental capacity, 
relying instead on routine doctor-patient conversation to assess his 
competence.  
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot assess cognitive capability by asking a person if he's feeling 
well and if his bowels are moving," Abrams said. "As for the humor, I do 
believe that Ronald Reagan could tell a joke in his sleep. That doesn't have 
much to do with how a President makes the complex decisions of state."

INMATES DISCOVER PRISON SELLS; THINK ALL PRISONERS MAKE LICENSE PLATES? NOT 
ANYMORE. NOW IT'S CRAFTS -- AND JEANS. 
</P>

 Inside the hand-cut blue-granite walls of Folsom Prison, artistically inclined 
murderers and robbers create purses, jewelry and sketches of Elvis to sell to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 San Quentin's aesthetic elite churns out cable-car music boxes that play "I 
Left My Heart in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in Oregon, incarcerated Calvin Kleins produce a line of jeans and 
T-shirts called Prison Blues, which are marketed to stores around the globe. 
The slogan: "Made on the inside to be worn on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind bars everywhere, it seems, prisoners are branching out from license 
plates and roadside trash cleanup to the finer arts of ballet, needlepoint and 
manufacturing hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, jail officials say, are a boost both to inmate morale and state 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison products have also gained cachet with consumers.  
</P>
<P>
 At Folsom, for example, a few visitors reportedly do all their Christmas 
shopping at the inmate gift shop. The merchandise includes wallets, bolo ties, 
belts, children's moccasins, sterling silver rings with snake heads, paintings 
by prisoner Picassos, holsters and such jailhouse schlock as miniature-beer-can 
key chains. 
</P>
<P>
 For more refined tastes, there's the "Folsom Prison Weather Rock." Put it 
outdoors and become an instant meteorologist, the instructions advise: If the 
rock gets wet, it's raining; if it turns white, it's snowing, and if it 
disappears, you've been ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from sales -- minus a 9% cut for administrative costs -- goes to the 
artist who created the work. The prisoners generally use the income to buy more 
supplies, stock up on canteen goods or support children and spouses on the 
outside, jail officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise varies from prison to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 San Quentin, for instance, is known for its scale-model cable cars, crafted 
out of walnut and rigged with miniature lights, clocks or music boxes. Death 
Row inmates at the penitentiary contribute afghans, acrylic paintings and 
handmade greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
 At the women's jail in Frontera, on the other hand, the focus is on crocheted 
baby booties, infant clothing, cross-stitchery and beaded jewelry.  
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners elsewhere in the state find creative expression in juggling, ballet 
and painting classes taught by outside artists hired by the Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real positive outlet for inmates," says Blanche Batiz, hobby-craft 
manager at Frontera, one of the few Southern California clinks that sells 
cellmate artwork. "It gives them something to do with their time . . . (and) 
that keeps them out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly for that reason, most prisons also have industrial programs to keep 
their "guests" occupied. In Nevada, inmate entrepreneurs make stained-glass 
windows, build limousines and restore classic cars for a Las Vegas hotel. 
Illinois convicts reportedly manufacture everything from hot dogs to cleaning 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the captive labor pool -- working for less than $1 an hour -- 
grinds eyeglasses for Medi-Cal patients, milks cows for inmate cafeterias, 
assembles furniture for government offices and helps extinguish wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, such ventures brought in $136 million, all of which was plowed back 
into the prison industrial program. Corrections officials hope to increase that 
figure by selling blue jeans made at the California Men's Colony prison in San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California law forbids penitentiary products from being sold 
commercially in the United States -- for fear that inmates might take work from 
law-abiding citizens -- foreign distribution is fair game. So state officials 
have begun test-marketing the jail jeans in Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, however, Oregon has the lock on penitentiary fashion. Inmate 
sweat shirts, shorts, denim jackets and logger jeans -- stone-washed in prison 
laundries -- are carried by small retail outlets nationwide and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also promotes a prisoner-built line of bedroom furniture under the 
Mill Creek label. Oregon, which has no law against selling inmate goods in this 
country and requires prisoners to work or study 40 hours per week, pays its 
jail laborers $5 to $8 per hour, but keeps most of the salaries for room and 
board, a victim assistance fund and income taxes, says Fred Nichols, 
administrator of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 At Folsom, directly across from the prisoner gift shop is a museum and store 
run by retired corrections officers. Items for sale include "Folsom Bed and 
Breakfast" T-shirts, ball-and-chain key rings, mugs, hats, bumper stickers and 
-- just in time for the holidays -- shirts depicting an overfed, red-suited 
gentleman scaling the prison walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The caption: "Santa Knows Who's Been Naughty or Nice."

FIRST PERSON: '90S FAMILY; TRADING IN TIES TO THE PAST FOR A CITIZEN'S VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We were sitting around the dinner table, pushing great savory chunks of 
cochinita pibil onto our forks with corn tortillas, when Marlene remarked 
offhandedly that she was studying hard. 
</P>
<P>
 All those Presidents, she sighed in Spanish. How a bill becomes law. The names 
of our California senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Wow, that's right, said my sister-in-law Angelica. When's the big day, Mami ? 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 9, she replied, her eyes glancing away from ours to take in the plush 
drapes, the expansive sofa, the Augustin Lara CD crooning about unrequited love 
on the fancy stereo -- all the trappings of a middle-class American life. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother-in-law was about to become a United States citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny, but I always pictured my gracious mother-in-law as more Mexican 
than American. She maintained an elegant, slightly reserved manner, even as she 
presided over lavish back-yard barbecues. She read Isabel Allende en espanol. 
She watched telenovelas beamed in from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 When my husband and I traveled to the Yucatan on our honeymoon, I looked 
around the Spanish colonial streets and envisioned Marlene as a girl growing up 
in a faded pastel villa, a fan raised languorously to her face in the humid 
Merida heat, a cool drink at her elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that my Yucatecan mother-in-law dropped out of school after sixth 
grade to help support her family, going to work in a shoe factory. When an 
employment agency ran an ad in the Merida paper seeking young women to come 
north to work as maids, Marlene seized the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency provided her with documents and a plane ticket. Marlene landed in 
Houston, where she went to work for a family with two little girls, making $10 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 She was already bilingual, speaking Spanish and Mayan, like her mother, 
Agripina, before her. But the susurrated clicking sounds of the Mayan dialect 
didn't help her in Texas. When she met another young Yucatecan woman named 
Lilia, they decided to try their fortune in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once here, she met a rambunctious northern Mexican named Rene who was always 
cracking jokes and telling stories but who also worked hard, more than 12 hours 
a day, to make ends meet. They married. 
</P>
<P>
 She was now 25, considered old by Mexican standards. But this was the New 
World. They settled in El Sereno and had David, who would become my husband, 
followed by three girls. Rene opened the first in a series of small restaurants 
and Marlene worked alongside him. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best places they had was in MacArthur Park, in the halcyon days 
before it was destroyed by crack and crime. Then there was the restaurant on 
3rd and Main streets in Downtown Los Angeles, back when an evening walk was not 
foolhardy for Marlene and the children. Whenever musicians and actors from 
Mexico came up to Los Angeles to perform at the Million Dollar Theater on 
Broadway, they would end up at Rene's restaurant after the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the good years. Scallop-edged photos show Rene and Marlene on the 
closely mowed lawn of their suburban home, he looking big and handsome in a 
T-shirt and Fernando Llamas mustache, she looking demure in a Jackie Kennedy 
flip. A young woman with steady eyes, overwhelmed by three toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Much later, they divorced and Rene moved less than a mile away so both parents 
could still share in raising the kids. In all those years, Marlene never became 
a citizen. She had other things to think about. Besides, she wasn't ready to 
cut those ties to the Yucatan. 
</P>
<P>
 The family managed a pilgrimage south each year or so, once driving from Los 
Angeles in the summer, a hot and endless road trip that my husband remembers 
with some horror. At a restaurant in Texas, the waitress refused to give them 
menus, although she promptly served families in other booths. Hungry and 
chafing with humiliation, Marlene collected her family and they walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Time passed. In her high-ceilinged, azure-blue apartment in Merida, Agripina 
passed away last year at 86, and with her went Marlene's strongest blood tie to 
her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she realized you can't go home again. That America had become home in 
the intervening 33 years. That her children had become Americans. That she 
enjoyed the comforts here more than she had cared to admit. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other reasons. Things have gotten ugly in our Golden State the 
past year. The anti-illegal immigrant hysteria whipped up by Proposition 187 
made her feel uneasy. She wanted the security of knowing that people wouldn't 
accuse her of stealing their jobs or welfare benefits if they heard her 
speaking Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted a stamped document that testified that she had the right to live 
here, she who had worked and paid taxes for three decades. Lastly, she wanted a 
say in government, even though her citizenship came a paltry 12 hours too late 
to vote "No" on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way for Latinos to ensure their rights is to become citizens," she 
announced one night at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 So collecting her green card, her proof of residency and her courage, Marlene 
took the plunge. Don't think for a minute it wasn't hard. Perhaps some 
native-born Americans can't imagine that anyone would hesitate to become a U.S. 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I thought so too until I talked to my mother, who emigrated from France 
after the horrors of World War II. I was shocked to learn that she hadn't 
become a citizen until 1965, almost 20 years and three kids after landing on 
our shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 She liked being French. She identified very strongly with France and didn't 
want to give that up. Marlene said the same about Mexico. It was ineluctably 
wrapped up with who she was. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with bittersweet poignancy that Marlene made her way to the Los 
Angeles Convention Center with 3,500 other immigrants, lining up before a 
federal judge and the INS to renounce their homelands forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a plastic American flag, Marlene recited the oath, pledged her 
allegiance to the United States and became a citizen. When the next election 
rolls around, you can bet that my mother-in-law will be the first in line at 
the polls.

'90S FAMILY; WHY ASK WHY?; WE'RE ALL NATURALLY HARD-WIRED TO BE CURIOUS, 
ESPECIALLY KIDS. IT HELPS US LEARN, WHICH LETS US SURVIVE. WHERE WOULD WE BE IF 
EINSTEIN HADN'T BEEN CURIOUS? ON THE OTHER HAND, CURIOSITY DID KILL THE CAT.

 "Why are there rainbows?" My 4-year-old is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because when sun shines through rain, it makes dif ferent colors," I say, hop 
ing a trace of high school physics can serve the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is there a sun?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun is a star. There are many suns in the universe." 
</P>
<P>
 He puzzles. "Mom," he says finally, "why is there a universe?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We call it the Why of the Why. In a few seconds, a tiny kid can toddle his own 
path of inquiry back to the most basic questions of time, space and existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does the ground end?  
</P>
<P>
 Why can't you go to the middle of the middle?  
</P>
<P>
 Why is forever the last number?  
</P>
<P>
 In a flash of parental hope (or maybe delusion), you think, "Hey, Einstein 
wondered the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you know your children aren't really entertaining the Big Bang 
theory. Or are they? Treat your kids' questions seriously, and the impulse to 
know why corn chips curl could lead to a cure for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But brush them off because you're too busy faxing or stirring macaroni and 
their spirit of inquiry could wither. Or run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't you catch lightning?  
</P>
<P>
 The kid may figure the only way to find out is to connect an Erector set to 
the electrical plug. Enter the age-old dichotomy: On the one hand, curiosity 
has sparked the greatest advancements of human knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, it killed the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why? The question pricks the heart of the curious nature of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Behaviorists say curiosity is hard-wired from infancy to make learning and, 
thus, survival, possible. It's the "constant tension between the satisfaction 
of a search ended and the seductive lure of the unknown . . . (that) keeps the 
explorer exploring," says Dr. Linda C. Mayes of Yale Child Study Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Why does growing take time?  
</P>
<P>
 Why do some plants grow into trees?  
</P>
<P>
 Why do people live longer than flowers?  
</P>
<P>
 When it clicks, it's like tasting chocolate for the first time. It's 
delicious. You want more. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it in a 12-month-old who pulls to stand up, which is the motoric 
version of curiosity," Mayes says. "You see it in the look on their faces: 'Oh 
wow! That did it!' The same is true for a 4-year-old who has discovered one 
tiny bit of an answer about the universe -- or an 80-year-old scientist 
discovering a new star." 
</P>
<P>
 But just on the far side of curiosity, the explorer can get lost in space. 
There are cautionary tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden because they asked too many 
questions. Galileo was branded a heretic for the same reason. Why?  
</P>
<P>
 "Asking questions is often seen as rebellious -- a violation of the 
established order of things," says Ruth Formanek, professor of education at 
Hofstra University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are rules. When can you ask? Of whom can you ask? It's a power issue. 
Kids pick this up along the way -- they become hesitant about asking questions. 
It lasts them their whole lives. I see it in the graduate students I teach. 
They don't feel comfortable asking why." 
</P>
<P>
 Why should that be, if, as Robert Penn Warren put it, "The end of man is to 
know"? 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of mini-Einsteins often blame the child's schooling. (And it may be a 
rare teacher, indeed, who seriously entertains the apparent mystery of why ice 
cream doesn't have bones.) But does that explain everything?  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talk about the 'insatiable curiosity of the human species.' 
But in truth, humans tend to be curious about an amazingly small set of 
domains," says Don Symons, professor of anthropology at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the information about the physical world that's available to us 
now -- an overwhelming amount. It's as if the modern world is providing an 
experiment to find out what people are curious about. And what are they curious 
about? They're curious about O.J. and Anita Hill. These are the things that 
grip them -- not geology and plant physiology."  
</P>
<P>
 Why? It probably started when nature endowed the higher creatures with 
curiosity in the first place. The animal behaviorist Konrad Lorenz says 
curiosity is "how an organism asks questions of (its) environment." 
</P>
<P>
 What's that strange thing by the tree?  
</P>
<P>
 Something I can eat? Mate with? Something that can hurt me?  
</P>
<P>
 Those that found out and acted accordingly survived. Says Formanek: "On a 
simplistic level, it's like listening to the weather report. Why do we do it? 
So we know whether to wear a raincoat or carry an umbrella. So we can 
understand the environment and adapt to it." 
</P>
<P>
 You see it in chimps, among the most curious creatures, who investigate a new 
object. They poke it, roll it, maybe try to smash it with a stone, as others 
watch to see what their braver friends can find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their way of categorizing the information in their universe," says Nancy 
Harvey, an animal behaviorist at San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Add the human ability of language, and you might come up with: 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't rocks grow?  
</P>
<P>
 Where does the sky go when it rains?  
</P>
<P>
 Why does time go by?  
</P>
<P>
 "Young children have constructed a very elaborate universe of their own," says 
David Elkind, Tufts University child psychologist and author. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in the world is new and mysterious. They believe that everything 
has a purpose. They're trying to fit the incongruities of the world around them 
into that picture. When they ask, 'Why is the grass green?' they don't want to 
know about photosynthesis or chlorophyll. They may want to know that green 
grass is helpful to green caterpillars who need a place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they also ask questions to have the pleasure of the interaction. 
They may want answers, but they also want you to know what they think. We're 
far too ready to give them long-winded explanations. Too often, our answers 
just bore them." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? That's how curiosity works, experts say. Too little or no stimulation and 
you can literally bore an animal to death. Add something new and different to 
the environment and it evokes interest and curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 But something extremely different evokes fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "An old shoe is boring. An interesting box will cause a child to go and 
investigate. But a big scary box -- a box with strange sounds coming out of it 
-- that would be frightening," says Raymond Bixler, psychology professor 
emeritus at the University of Louisville. "Organisms evolve to avoid things 
that are too strange." 
</P>
<P>
 The genetically encoded message: Keep searching to keep going, but avoid 
things that are too far out. You could get eaten by a predator. 
</P>
<P>
 Or lost in space. Stephen E. Glickman, a UC Berkeley psychologist who has 
studied curiosity in zoo animals, found that creatures richest in curiosity 
have three things in common: varied diets or complex hunting behaviors, good 
manipulative capabilities and big brains. Humans to a T. 
</P>
<P>
 Add language and abstract reasoning to the mix, and you get questions about 
how to build an airplane, split an atom or beat Bobby Fischer. Of course, as 
some evolutionary thinkers point out, it's possible that nature never intended 
our excess brain capacity to be used for sorting out plate tectonics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curiosity about the physical laws of the world is an acquired taste," says 
anthropologist Symons. "The massive amounts of information available to us now 
just didn't exist in human evolutionary history. The things that have been 
important to humans in the evolutionary history of the world were things like 
sex, power, kinship and coalitions. There was no Einstein, no Mozart, in the 
Pleistocene." 
</P>
<P>
 Which could explain why more people tend to be riveted to O.J., Roseanne and 
the tabloids than they are to, say, photovoltaic cells. But then come those 
rare people with the most curious quirk of all -- the insatiable mind. For 
them, as Yale behaviorist Mayes points out, curiosity is "the inevitable fate 
that at least a few individuals must accept in order to advance knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Who knows? British physicist Stephen Hawking believes the answers to the 
biggest whys could lie in a unified field theory of the universe, as yet 
unearthed by the most inquisitive minds alive. When such a theory is found, 
Hawking writes, "then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary 
people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is 
that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the 
ultimate triumph of human reason -- for then we should know the mind of God." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's bedtime at our house and my son looks perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, why can't you own a star?" The 4-year-old germ of scientific genius no 
doubt, or maybe a creative way to start a bedtime conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you think?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if you owned a star, you wouldn't be able to keep it in your room." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're right." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, why can't you keep stars in your room?"

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; AS QUESTIONS GO, 'IS SANTA REAL?' RANKS NEAR THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Land of Ideal Families, parents are always prepared for the question, 
"Is there really a Santa Claus?" They know just how to answer so as to tell the 
truth without forever shattering their children's illusion that there is 
someone, somewhere who knows your name, pays attention and will bring you 
exactly what you want in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the question often takes us by surprise because we dread it 
almost as much as, "Where do babies come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the very worst, they hear the truth before they can handle it. One mother 
recalls thinking that her 7-year-old daughter really wanted to know. But when 
confronted with the truth, the girl replied: "You're lying!" Six years later, 
the girl is still complaining, "How could you do that? Haven't you seen 
'Miracle on 34th Street'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting the truth about Santa is a bittersweet rite of passage for anyone 
who has grown up with the traditional story of the North Pole workshop, the 
flying reindeer, the chimney entrance and exit, the milk and cookies. But it's 
complicated because -- similar to the tooth fairy, the Easter Bunny and, yes, 
even sex -- adults really don't want to help children figure it out.  
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Scheibe, a psychology researcher from Ithaca College in New York who 
has studied how children learn about Santa, said that before age 7 or 8, 
children have no problem accepting the story. Four- and 5-year-olds don't even 
notice that there are different Santas in different stores. At 6 or 7, they 
might notice discrepancies but explain them away. "They say, 'That was his 
helper. He's got work to do! He's busy! He's got toys to make!' " Scheibe said. 
One girl said she knew how he could get to all the houses in one night -- he 
simply started in the eastern time zone and worked his way west. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 7 or 8, Scheibe said, children begin to see that there are holes in 
the story. "No matter how you explain it, he can't get to all the houses in one 
night. A big fat Santa can't get down the chimney. The magic doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids pretend they still believe in Santa so they won't hurt their 
parents' feelings, she said. Others in the transition stage might profess Santa 
isn't real, but then change when the holiday rolls around. Then they start 
playing scientist, gathering facts such as samples of Santa's handwriting to 
see if it matches their parents'. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they figure it out, she said, "the majority are quite delighted in 
joining this rite with this group of people who all know the truth. Especially 
those with younger brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 Children don't hold it against parents for lying about Santa, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A true psychologist, Scheibe subscribes to the school of thought that prefers 
a noncommittal answer to kids' questions. " 'Why do you bring that up?' is 
always a good starter," she said, followed maybe by, "What do you think is 
going on?" and then, "I wonder if that's right." 
</P>
<P>
 But the award for best answer, the one that gently straddles the line between 
truth and fantasy, goes to this Los Angeles mother of two whose 8-year-old 
announced this year that he "really, really" wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
 She waited until bedtime, so her 6-year-old daughter would be out of hearing 
range, then asked him to remember a time when he had given someone a secret 
gift and how it had made him feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said it felt good. I said, 'That means you have a little bit of Santa in 
you,' " she said. "That's what Santa is all about, a magical feeling. The real 
Santa got that joy and wanted to pass that on, so he put the magic into all 
parents who came later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I explained it doesn't have to be parents and told him how I once got food 
and gifts for a poor family and put them on the porch. And how that felt better 
than giving them a gift so they knew who it was from. 
</P>
<P>
 "His eyes got wide and he said, 'I know what you mean! I've had that feeling 
before!' " Over the next few days, she said she found him leaving presents at 
his sister's door. "He would tell her, 'You know, I heard something in the 
hallway. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 The mother asked him to keep the secret in mind on Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought for a minute. Then he announced, "On Christmas morning, I want to 
believe it's Santa." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Absolutely.' We haven't talked about it any more."

RESIDENTS GREET THE NEWS WITH DISMAY AND DISBELIEF 
</P>

<P>
 For at least a generation now, it has been Southern California's bastion of 
stability -- well-groomed, bountiful in creature comforts, master-planned down 
to the smallest cul-de-sac. And so in Orange County it was tough at first for 
people to think the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 But gradually Tuesday -- as grogginess gave way to shock, and shock segued to 
alarm -- the municipality that the BBC once crowned "the culmination of the 
American Dream" began slowly to absorb its predicament. Orange County -- one of 
the richest counties in America, the county whose local economy had grown 90% 
during the Reagan years, the optimistic hotbed of clean-cut high-rollers -- had 
landed itself in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought of Orange County as the last bastion of wealth and the 
American way. I'm shocked," said 32-year-old Cameron Pylant, who manages a 
men's clothing store in the glitzy sprawl of the county's fabled South Coast 
Plaza mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Herbert Adler, 61, felt personally slighted: "What happened to all 
the taxes I've been paying all these years?" he demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the county's public officials were initially flummoxed when the gravity 
of the situation began to sink in. One county supervisor and her husband didn't 
even pick up the phone when the pre-dawn call to report to county headquarters 
came over their answering machine because -- well, in Orange County, financial 
disaster doesn't come along every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was either somebody who was drunk or playing a prank," said 
Supervisor Harriet Wieder's husband, Irv. "I don't think I recall anything of 
that kind happening before." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the summons was relayed by a posse of sheriff's deputies, who were 
dispatched to Wieder's Huntington Beach home to rouse her from bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William Steiner was jolted from his sleep at 2:55 a.m., as was the 
board chairman, Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. Their instructions were to come 
immediately to the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana, and the tone of the 
call reminded them of every other calamity that had crossed their paths in this 
tumultuous land. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was woken up for the Laguna fires," shrugged Elaine Vasquez, wife 
of Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "So we've been through these things before." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, as they pulled up to the maze of high-rise government offices at the 
county seat, their initial thought was that they were there to shore up the 
county's defenses for another day of financial uncertainty. For days, the 
county had been grappling with a dramatic $1.5-billion loss in the value of its 
investment portfolio, and the East Coast financial markets were due to open at 
6 a.m. Pacific time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours passed. The supervisors could not be all in one room at one time because 
doing so would violate the Brown Act, the state open-meetings law that 
prohibits more than two supervisors from gathering at any time when the public 
has not been notified in advance. The place assumed the aura of a war room, as 
staffers shuttled bad news from room to room. One hour passed, then two, then 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the afternoon, and word began to seep out -- in leaks, in calls to 
and from the governor, in calls to and from the state's U.S. senators. 
</P>
<P>
 And gradually, there it was, like a free-floating cloud looming over the 
Southern California sky. At the lunch counters and in the malls, Orange County 
residents were dazed and befuddled. The county took on the air of a giant high 
school math class, with the deepening financial crisis marking the start of a 
dreaded calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a joke," said Debbie Fields, a 42-year-old meeting planner 
from Irvine, when told that her notoriously prosperous county had just filed 
for bankruptcy protection. "I'm pretty amazed. I feel speechless. I don't know 
what to think." 
</P>
<P>
 And neither did most of her fellow taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those people that doesn't have a clue," said Laura Conkey, 28, a 
waitress at Pop's Cafe in Santa Ana, where $2.99 gets you a chili dog with 
fries and the only percentage people care about is 15, as in the tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost, what, $3 billion, $3 million?" Conkey said. "I know it was up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the public kitty may be $1.5 billion lighter was more difficult 
to digest than a heavy lunch, and it made people even sleepier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like usual," Conkey said, reprising a familiar refrain around Pop's crowded 
counter, "the bureaucrats were spending our money and not thinking about where 
it was going." 
</P>
<P>
 Many felt the quintessential Orange County distrust of big government rising 
in their hearts. Even the vocabulary sounded slick and fishy -- "derivatives" 
and "reverse repurchase agreements" and other jargon that signaled that a fast 
one might have been pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that people who seem to be in positions of power are abusing 
it," said Lesley Renvoize, a nanny from Laguna Beach who was feeding her 
8-month-old charge in the food court of Newport Beach's Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't understand the intricacies of the crisis, but she had a bad taste 
in her mouth all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it seems like there is some big club of people who are in power, and it 
seems very hard for people like me to find out what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 At an Orange County lunch counter, electrician Jim Berkey struggled to explain 
the situation to his friends. His assessment, although disillusioned, was 
basically upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all on paper," said Berkey, whose bushy mustache seemed to go with his 
bristly oratory style. "Ain't no money lost. Yet. All right? But from what I 
understand, the budget is based on what's on paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, the county's investment practices had been ironically 
flamboyant in light of the area's bedrock fiscal conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends looked at him, amazed. Then, as he paused for a meditative sip of 
iced tea, Ray Scrivner of Placentia gestured with his head and said: "He don't 
talk like that around us." 
</P>
<P>
 Their mood was amused. And less than despondent. Which in a place like Orange 
County is true to form. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer James D. Daily, for example, represents an 8-year-old child who was 
mauled by a dog, and whose trust fund was invested in the county pool as part 
of a liability settlement. Daily said that despite the crisis, he still has 
faith the government will take good care of his small client. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the children are concerned, I have a feeling that the county will 
step up to the plate and take care of these matters," he said. "Municipalities, 
they can lose money and whatnot, but children . . . the whole state and our 
community take special interest in the lives of children." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Laguna Hills City Manager Tim Casey, whose city has $916,934 in the 
pool, noted that, big as it is, Orange County's is not the only pocketbook to 
hit the skids in recent years in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bankruptcy doesn't mean close up shop," Casey said, "and the county can't do 
that. So if it's a maneuver to buy time and evaluate options for handling the 
portfolio, then it might not be bad. I just don't know."

ORANGE COUNTY FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS CREDITOR SEEKS PAYMENT; 
FINANCE: UNPRECEDENTED MOVE FOLLOWS SEIZURE OF $2 BILLION IN COLLATERAL,

<P>
 Orange County on Tuesday became the largest municipality in U.S. history to 
file for federal bankruptcy protection, after an all-day standoff with Wall 
Street bankers who insisted that the county repay $1.2 billion in loans to its 
troubled investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning news that one of the nation's largest, wealthiest and most 
politically conservative counties was seeking protection from its creditors 
capped a day of turmoil that shook not just Orange County but the country's 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Somber county officials insisted that the filing -- made at 5:01 p.m. Tuesday, 
an hour after the Santa Ana federal bankruptcy court's normal closing time -- 
would have no effect on the county's ability to maintain police protection and 
other basic services. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move raised questions about the funding of dozens of major projects in 
the county, from toll roads to a Disneyland expansion to a possible new stadium 
for the Los Angeles Rams and California Angels sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could cost the county its stellar bond rating, meaning that it could 
become more expensive to borrow for public needs -- if the county and other 
local government agencies are allowed to issue debt at all. One rating agency 
said it would drop Orange County's rating today from double-A to triple-C -- 
meaning they are viewed as in danger of default. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly is a difficult pill to swallow right now," said state Sen. 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who will assume a seat on the County Board 
of Supervisors in January. "It's a shocking occurrence. We're going to have to 
look to Sacramento, to Washington and obviously we're going to have to look to 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Board of Supervisors, roused from their beds at 3 a.m. with 
news of an impending financial catastrophe, spent virtually all day behind 
closed doors. They met for hours with their advisers and attorneys to sort 
through the dilemma, made more drastic by one investment bank's demand that the 
county come up with $1.2 billion in cash or securities that had come due 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy filing became inevitable after Orange County, through a private 
firm it had hired, approached leading Wall Street firms Monday and began to try 
to liquidate its huge holdings of derivatives, according to a senior executive 
at one of the four biggest Wall Street firms, who declined to be identified. 
Derivatives are the complex financial instruments that magnified the fund's 
exposure to rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The source said all of the firms turned the county down -- partly because they 
found that the county fund's losses on the derivatives were much larger than 
the $1.5 billion that has been publicly reported. His firm, he said, concluded 
that the lost value is "hundreds of millions" more than that, although not 
double the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "They approached a number of people on the street, including us, to liquidate 
the portfolio for them," the executive said. "But no one wanted to trade with 
them. The people who looked at it (the portfolio) were frightened by it." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, county supervisors and administrators were more nervous, placing 
calls to myriad state and federal officials in search of financial help, such 
as low-interest loans to help resolve the cash crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, CS First Boston Corp. -- one of several large brokerages that has 
loaned the county money to purchase securities -- demanded additional 
collateral for $1.2 billion in loans it had made, which permitted the county to 
enlarge its fund with additional purchases of securities. 
</P>
<P>
 When the county was unable to put up the cash demanded, CS First Boston seized 
$2 billion in securities that had been held as collateral for the loans, 
according to Wall Street traders familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage firm then placed those securities, mostly U.S. government agency 
bonds, on the bond market near the close of trading Tuesday, a move that 
stunned traders, dealers said. The county presumably lost money on the sale, 
but the extent of the loss could not be determined Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 CS First Boston officials would not comment on their relationship with the 
county or on any actions the brokerage might have taken on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they saw no alternative by late in the day but to file 
for bankruptcy protection, despite the embarrassment and financial stigma it 
would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no alternative given to us," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
"We were concerned with the fact that we are here to protect the public and to 
protect the investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner expressed bitterness over the conduct of both 
Wall Street and former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned 
Sunday after 24 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a steady parade of hotshots in blue shirts representing the 
investment bankers pitching these sophisticated investment strategies," he 
said, "and the treasurer obviously went down that path." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he had two conversations with Gov. Pete Wilson to discuss the 
"magnitude" of the county's financial crisis and to ask for help -- including a 
request that the state make an advance on funds due the county to help provide 
liquidity to the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to dealing with dysfunction," said Steiner, former director of the 
county's Orangewood Home for abused and neglected children in Orange. "But 
never anything of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code is a desperate last step 
for any public entity, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare, it's quite rare . . . for any government to take that step -- and 
unprecedented for a county of that size," said Bennett Murphy, a bankruptcy 
expert and partner in the law firm of Latham & Watkins. "It's seldom used, and 
I'd say that it's quite unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Chapter 9 functions much like Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
does for businesses: It provides a government with protection from its 
creditors while it attempts to work out a plan for rehabilitating its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drastic financial distress -- it's there for that purpose," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with criticism from federal regulators that state officials have failed 
to step in swiftly to help, Wilson issued a terse, one-sentence statement 
through his press office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will assist Orange County in analyzing the situation to identify the 
alternatives necessary so that Orange County can bring its finances back into 
solvency," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office had lawyers "looking all day at the 
situation," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Dave Puglia said the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which is investigating the Orange County financial crisis, "has made contact 
with us," adding, "we're working with them in any way that can be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 But Puglia also said the office was rebuffed by the SEC earlier Tuesday after 
state attorneys requested access to all information on the ongoing financial 
crisis. The two sides agreed to discuss the dispute further on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials, meanwhile, said the debacle was the state's responsibility 
to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are watching the situation carefully but don't see the likelihood of a 
ripple impact in financial markets," a Clinton Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors of a bankruptcy filing -- an almost unthinkable turn of events for 
the affluent, conservative county -- spread from Wall Street to Washington, 
D.C., to California throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) had been the first to appear on 
television hinting at a bankruptcy filing. Cox, a former securities lawyer, 
said he had been in contact with county officials as the financial crisis 
exploded and will hold hearings to sort out what happened and find ways to 
prevent such catastrophes in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, county supervisors were roused from bed and called to the Hall of 
Administration in Santa Ana for a 4 a.m. briefing. But because of potential 
violations of the state's open meeting laws, the supervisors had to be 
sequestered in different parts of the building, with information shuttled among 
them from the county's financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District -- which had threatened 
to pull its remaining $300 million investment out of the pool -- learned of the 
county's worsening troubles early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is high-stakes poker," Swan said. "I can understand from an investment 
firm's perspective that this is a bad situation and they have shareholders who 
are very concerned. However, investment firms also have to realize that if they 
pull the plug, that's it. And that's a hard pill to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
plans to take any major action in the near future concerning the Orange County 
situation, except to continue their very active investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC had considered the possibility of going into court to seek an 
injunction that would have placed the fund into receivership. But federal 
regulators ruled that out, concluding such a step might cause more, rather than 
less, disruption to the securities markets, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worry was that a receiver might forbid securities firms from selling any 
of the collateral they hold, which could cause serious disruption in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same ill effects, however, might happen amid bankruptcy 
proceedings, in which a bankruptcy judge could issue orders about the handling 
of securities and collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, federal regulators were said to be concerned that there might be 
a political backlash if Washington stepped in to seize control of the Orange 
County fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Major investors in the fund said the bankruptcy filing could have a serious 
effect on their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, chief executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
said his agency would be stuck financially if its $1 billion in the county's 
fund was frozen for a long period of time. "We've taken steps today to make 
sure we're OK until the end of the year," Oftelie said. "But after that, I 
don't know how long we could last." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Lee Romney, David Haldane, Len Hall, Susan Marquez Owen, 
Jodi Wilgoren and Rebecca Trounson in Orange County, Robert A. Rosenblatt in 
Washington, D.C. and Shawn Hubler and Tom Petruno in Los Angeles contributed to 
this story. Looking for Protection 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT IS CHAPTER 9? 
</P>
<P>
 Only a municipality, such as Orange County, may file for this type of 
bankruptcy. Chapter 9 buys time for cities, school districts or other 
governmental agencies to work out ways to pay their debts. 
</P>
<P>
 WHY ORANGE COUNTY FILED 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no alternative given to us. We were concerned with the fact that we 
are here to protect the public and to protect the investors. And, of course, 
the county itself is 37% of this fund. Then, everybody walked. The bond dealers 
-- they walked." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harriett M. Wieder, county supervisor 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT IT MEANS 
</P>
<P>
 The filing could affect about 180 cities, school districts and other 
governmental entities that have invested billions of dollars in the county 
portfolio. All of them use their investments to raise money to meet their 
obligations, such as new construction, day-to-day services or loan payments. 
They also might not be able to borrow more money. County Fund Investors 
</P>
<P>
 About 180 government agencies--schools, cities and special districts--have 
money in the county investment fund. Money designated as being in the "bond 
pool" is kept separate because it is governed by specific rules regarding a 
trading practice known as arbitrage, an effort to profit by borrowing at one 
interest rate and investing at a higher one. Here is a partial list of 
investments as of Nov. 30. It does not include about $550 million that was 
borrowed by school districts and individual investors: 03,36,19,19 AGENCY

HUBBELL ADMITS TO FRAUDULENTLY BILLING CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. Hubbell, one of President Clinton's 
closest friends, agreed Tuesday to cooperate with the Whitewater independent 
counsel and entered a guilty plea to charges that he had billed his legal 
clients fraudulently for at least $394,000 in personal expenditures between 
1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the nation's third-ranking law enforcement officer, Hubbell, 46, admitted 
to committing two felonies -- mail fraud and tax evasion -- each of which 
carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. He almost certainly will go to 
prison, even though his sentence could be reduced in exchange for supplying 
information to Whitewater counsel Kenneth W. Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hubbell's crimes have virtually nothing to do with the central 
Whitewater allegations against the President, lawyers familiar with the case 
said that his testimony could be helpful to Starr in determining whether 
Clinton appointees made any effort to interfere with the government's early 
investigation of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr told reporters outside the courthouse that he is "looking forward" to 
Hubbell's cooperation with the inquiry, which so far has centered primarily on 
allegations that federally guaranteed savings and loan money may have been 
funneled improperly to Clinton through his investment in the Whitewater real 
estate development in the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell's courtroom confession also caused obvious personal and political 
embarrassment for the President, a frequent golf partner who once described 
Hubbell as "my best friend," and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was 
Hubbell's partner at the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he resigned from the Justice Department last March 14, Hubbell was a 
close legal adviser to the White House and one of the most visible Arkansans in 
the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, David Kendall, the President's lawyer, sought to distance 
the Clintons from Hubbell's crimes. "This matter does not concern the 
President, the First Lady or Whitewater Development Corp. in any way," Kendall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a contrite statement to the court at the close of the one-hour hearing in 
which he entered his plea, Hubbell indicated that he was painfully aware of the 
embarrassment he had caused the Clintons, the Rose Law Firm and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deeply regret that my actions have reflected on my family, friends and 
those who have placed me in positions of trust," Hubbell told Judge William R. 
Wilson. "If the consequences of my actions were only mine, this would be a lot 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Once widely admired in this town as a former college football star, former 
state Supreme Court chief justice and a former mayor, Hubbell was clearly 
shaken by the experience of publicly confessing to private acts of greed that 
will tarnish his reputation and cause him to lose his license to practice law. 
His voice cracked, as if choking back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 In detailing the evidence that had been gathered against Hubbell, W. Hickman 
Ewing Jr., an assistant to the independent counsel, told a remarkable tale of a 
highly successful, well-paid attorney who on at least 400 occasions charged his 
law firm and its clients for his own family's extravagant expenditures at a 
variety of fancy shops in Little Rock and Dallas, including a fur salon and 
Victoria's Secret. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ewing, Hubbell frequently used checks drawn on the Rose Law 
Firm's partnership banking account to pay off personal credit card bills. He 
then would add these charges to the bills sent to a wide variety of the firm's 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the clients who were bilked in this manner were the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp., both of whom had hired the Rose 
Law Firm to assist in the cleanup of several savings and loan failures in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution cited one bill that Hubbell submitted to the FDIC on March 7, 
1990, for work that the Rose Law Firm did in pursuing the government's case 
against Frost & Co., an accounting firm, for negligence in auditing the 
accounts of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. Madison was owned by James B. 
McDougal, Clinton's partner in the Whitewater investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill asked the FDIC to reimburse the Rose Law Firm $612 for so-called 
"publications costs" and $694.29 for "deposition costs." But Ewing said that 
the FBI traced both of those expenditures back to personal credit card 
purchases by Hubbell and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell did not charge his clients for all of the personal bills that he paid 
from the law firm checking account, however. In some cases, Ewing said, Hubbell 
simply "wrote off" the charge -- meaning that the law firm itself shouldered 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the extraordinary number of these so-called "write-offs" by Hubbell 
that first caught the attention of his law partners after he went to Washington 
to join the Administration in January, 1993. When they questioned him, he 
promised to provide the firm with documentation to support the write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Ewing told the judge, "it never came." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Hubbell filed tax returns for the years 1989 through 1992 that did 
not reflect any of the income he received from his fraudulent billing 
practices, according to the government. In 1992, for example, he received 
income of $309,168, but reported only $194,966. Overall, it is estimated that 
he failed to pay the government $130,291 in taxes owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, plea-bargains such as the one between Hubbell and Starr are used as 
a way for the prosecution to obtain information from the defendant and for the 
defendant to limit his legal liability. 
</P>
<P>
 To lawyers familiar with Hubbell's case, the charges to which he pleaded 
guilty appear to be unusually stiff for such a plea-bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known what other evidence Starr might have had against him, 
although some investigators had questioned whether Hubbell's work for the FDIC 
and the RTC represented a conflict of interest, since his firm also had 
represented Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 As associate attorney general, Hubbell also may have been privy to internal 
government discussions about a so-called "criminal referral" from the RTC to 
the Justice Department regarding Madison that mentioned involvement by the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the referral, Paula Casey, the U.S. attorney in Little Rock and 
a Clinton appointee, resisted passing it along to her superiors at the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William R. Wilson agreed to release Hubbell on his own 
recognizance, pending sentencing. No date was set for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, who still lives in Washington, was accompanied into court by his 
wife, Suzanne, and his attorney, former Iran-Contra committee counsel John W. 
Nields Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Suzanne Hubbell's shopping habits clearly contributed to her 
husband's downfall, he was clearly sensitive to her feelings during the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you OK?" he whispered to her as Judge Wilson read the charges. She 
nodded.

CHAPTER 9 MOVE A LAST RESORT, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's filing for bankruptcy court protection is viewed by legal 
experts as a move of last resort that can send shock waves through every level 
of government and trigger severe economic consequences that might take years to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Governmental agencies seeking protection under Chapter 9 of the U. S. 
Bankruptcy Code risk a host of fiscal woes, including the loss of hard-won 
credit ratings, the inability to sell bonds to raise money for capital 
projects, deteriorating relations with employees and creditors, as well as the 
prospect of raising fees or taxes to help pay the debts that triggered the 
bankruptcy petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal fees are enormous, and rounds of cost-cutting measures might become 
necessary, resulting in layoffs and reduced services. Cities such as 
Bridgeport, Conn., have spent years trying to rebuild their credit rating and 
overcoming the stigma of Chapter 9, leaving municipal officials wondering if it 
was all worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is often better to work out your problems with financial engineering 
rather than to crash and burn," said James E. Spiotto, a Chicago attorney and 
one of the nation's top experts on governmental bankruptcy. "Chapter 9 is the 
most extreme remedy, the last resort, if you can even call it a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 But Spiotto and other bankruptcy lawyers say Chapter 9 could provide Orange 
County with a powerful shield to fend off a potentially devastating "run on the 
bank" by participants in the beleaguered investment pool that was managed by 
former County Treasurer Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial crisis developed for Orange County last week when it was reported 
that the $20-billion investment pool had lost $1.5 billion -- about 20% of the 
investors' actual stake -- because an investment strategy that Citron had used 
successfully for many years had turned sour as interest rates began to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Citron had pledged his investors' securities as collateral to 
borrow more than $12 billion in short-term loans to buy long-term bonds that at 
the time were paying higher rates of interest. As the Federal Reserve began 
raising interest rates this year, however, the short-term loans could only be 
renewed at ever-increasing interest rates, while the value of the long-term 
bonds he bought tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron resigned in the wake of disclosures about the pool's losses. A federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You file Chapter 9 when the pressure is greater than your ability to handle 
it," said Richard Levin, a bankruptcy attorney for 20 years in Los Angeles. 
"Like a classic bank failure, you could prevent the race of the swift." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 is a backwater of federal bankruptcy law, which grants governmental 
agencies time to reorganize their finances and make arrangements with creditors 
to pay off their debts. The action is filed voluntarily, meaning that no 
creditor can force the governmental entity into bankruptcy, as they can with a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 A government agency such as Orange County must meet several tests to declare a 
Chapter 9 bankruptcy, said attorney Marc Beilinson of Pachulski, Stang & Ziehl 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It must meet the legal definition of a municipality. State law must authorize 
it, which California law does. The governmental entity must be insolvent and 
willing to develop a plan to pay its debts. It must obtain the approval of 
creditors holding a majority of its claims or it must have negotiated with 
investors in good faith and failed to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipalities have a great deal more freedom under Chapter 9 than 
corporations do under somewhat comparable Chapter 11 bankruptcies, Beilinson 
said. Municipalities get protection from their creditors but, unlike bankrupt 
corporations, they do not have to seek a judge's permission to borrow new funds 
or spend them as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlike a regular bankruptcy in other ways, attorneys say, because as 
long as the entity has the power to tax or raise fees to help pay the debt, it 
cannot go out of existence, as is possible for a failed business or 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was developed during the Great 
Depression, when many municipalities began losing their ability to raise taxes 
and had trouble paying debts. Since then, 475 Chapter 9 petitions are known to 
have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those cases involved small, special-purpose districts for schools, 
utilities, water or sewer services and hospitals. No large or medium-size 
cities ever have filed a Chapter 9 proceeding and pursued it to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is there, but the hope is no one will use it," said Lawrence P. King, 
a professor and bankruptcy specialist at the New York University School of Law. 
"When you file it, people want to stop dealing with you. The state starts 
breathing down your throat. Politicians get some mileage out of it. If there is 
one thing I would emphasize, it's the last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Orange County's filing, Bridgeport, a city of 145,000 people with a debt 
of $200 million, represented the largest entity in the country to seek Chapter 
9 protection. After taking the action in 1991, the city lost its credit rating 
and could not sell municipal bonds to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad cost-cutting measures were instituted and employee morale plummeted 
along with the credit rating. There were even doubts that local banks would 
honor city paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut attorney general challenged Bridgeport's action in court, and 
a judge threw out the Chapter 9 petition, ruling that the city was solvent and 
could pay its bills. The city appealed, but Mayor Joseph P. Ganim, who was 
elected during the crisis, eventually withdrew the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fiscal, political and moral aspect to it all. The whole impact on 
municipal government is enormous," Ganim said. "Wall Street is skeptical, and 
it was been an uphill battle to regain our credibility. It affects all levels 
of government. There is a freeze on hiring, a freeze on wages. If I were mayor 
when this started, I would not have filed a Chapter 9." 
</P>
<P>
 New York City considered filing a Chapter 9 petition during its fiscal crisis 
in the mid-1970s and federal law was changed to accommodate such a move. But 
city leaders decided against the action, fearing that a bankruptcy filing would 
deliver a devastating blow to the municipal bond market. At the time, New York 
City bonds represented about 27% of the market, and Wall Street leaders stepped 
in to help restore the city's credit worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 New York appealed to President Gerald R. Ford for federal help, but Ford 
initially refused, prompting the memorable New York Daily News headline: "Ford 
to City: Drop Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ford later relented and approved a $2.3-billion emergency financing after 
the Municipal Finance Corp. was formed to handle the city's troubled finances. 
Investment banker Felix Rohatyn led the agency, which secured the cooperation 
of the city's union and business leaders and special investments from union and 
other pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Cleveland never went through bankruptcy court for protection after 
it defaulted on bond payments to investors in 1978. More recently, Philadelphia 
officials considered a Chapter 9 filing, but never proceeded with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the San Jose School District, facing labor problems and the 
effects of Proposition 13, sought protection under Chapter 9 and managed to pay 
its debts on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the amount of indebtedness, bankruptcy lawyers say, Orange County 
could face some of the same problems as the troubled cities. If bond and credit 
ratings plunge, the county would have trouble getting loans or selling bonds to 
raise money for a new stadium in Anaheim, a new county jail or a road. 
</P>
<P>
 A bankruptcy would harm Orange County's credit standing -- not just its rating 
by agencies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, but its long-term reputation 
among investors. It would immediately become more expensive for the county to 
borrow funds because investors would demand higher interest rates to compensate 
for the increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as airline mogul Frank Lorenzo used the bankruptcy laws to break 
contracts with his unionized employees, Orange County could, if it chose, 
renegotiate collective bargaining agreements with its employees or seek to 
unilaterally change their pay or benefits, with the judge's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies to the county's dealings with trash haulers, for example, or 
other private contractors. It could press a judge to reject existing contracts, 
or use that threat to pressure contractors into providing more favorable terms, 
Beilinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, bankruptcy lawyers say that investors holding bonds sold by 
Orange County might not be able to earn interest because interest ceases to 
accrue when a Chapter 9 is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is the stigma of the bankruptcy. Eventually, you have to 
go back to the bond market. Your credit ratings are ruined. Someone always gets 
hurt," Spiotto said. "This creates a tremendous strain on governmental 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond county government, the Chapter 9 filing could affect about 180 
municipalities, school districts and other governmental entities that had 
entrusted billions of dollars to Orange County to invest. All of them use their 
investments to raise money to meet their obligations, such as new construction 
or to make loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be surprised if a number of other municipalities (that invested 
in the Orange County fund) were themselves forced to file for bankruptcy 
because they won't be able to meet their own obligations," Beilinson said.

GOP PLANS TO CUT FUNDS FOR BLACK CAUCUS, OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing their House cleaning, Republican leaders announced plans Tuesday to 
end public funding for the Congressional Black Caucus and more than two dozen 
other research and policy groups that they said are a waste of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision -- which must be approved in January by the House Oversight 
Committee, formerly the House Administration Committee -- would effectively 
eliminate 28 congressional support organizations, including the Hispanic 
Caucus, the Women's Issues Caucus and the Democratic Study Group. For many 
years the Democratic Study Group was the main research and policy arm of the 
Democratic majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing the plans, approved at a meeting of House Republicans, incoming 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said that eliminating public funding for 
Capitol Hill's legislative service organizations, as the support groups are 
known, will save the taxpayers more than $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sweeping and extraordinary change . . . (that) begins the process 
of voting to shrink the size of Congress," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The service organizations were paid for by members who reallocated a portion 
of the public money they receive to run their congressional offices. The 
Republicans plan to end that practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless they also announce plans to curtail the funds for running 
congressional offices, a step they have not taken, the money that in past years 
had been spent for the service organizations will still be available to 
Congress for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats immediately cried foul. They portrayed the move as another in a 
series of efforts by the incoming GOP leadership to control the flow of 
information in the new Congress and to concentrate power in the House in 
Gingrich's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the inherent strengths of this place has been the ability of members 
to share their resources for the purposes of research . . . and this is clearly 
just another attempt to preempt dissent by centralizing all information under 
the leadership," said Rep. Martin Olav Sabo (D-Minn.), a former chairman of the 
Democratic Study Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), who heads the women's caucus, added that 
the GOP leaders are trying to enact "a new gag rule for American women by 
seeking to silence the members of Congress who work in their behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, I think, wise enough and capable of raising the money that is 
necessary to keep this organization (the Black Caucus) going and I think that's 
what we're going to have to do," Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and other Republicans countered by noting that the proposal would 
affect their party's research groups as well. And they cited a long list of 
financial irregularities suggesting that some of the caucuses were being run 
without the oversight and auditing safeguards that apply to members' offices, 
committees and other congressional institutions funded by taxpayer monies. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 10 years, $35 million in taxpayer funding has been used to 
support the service organizations, but a recent review of their spending showed 
that there had been no accounting for $7.7 million, according to Rep. Pat 
Roberts (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 The questionable spending included thousands of dollars for entertainment and 
gifts, $981.96 for a New Year's holiday trip to the Virgin Islands by the staff 
of the Territorial Caucus and what Roberts said was more than $20,000 in "tips" 
by the California Democratic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the GOP resolution, adopted with heavy support from incoming Republican 
freshmen, the service organizations technically could continue to exist, but 
only if they are funded directly by their members and not by a reallocation of 
money from congressional office operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, however, said that such reallocations represented a cost-savings 
measure that permitted members to hire fewer staff researchers by pooling their 
funds and sharing the costs of policy research and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans "are trying to silence the voices of people who already have 
limited representation," said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), a 
member of the Hispanic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, a longtime critic of the service organizations, denied a partisan 
motive in the move, which he and other Republicans characterized as part of the 
GOP effort to downsize Congress. The House Republicans already have promised to 
cut the size of committee staffs by one-third and Senate Republicans said 
Tuesday that they plan to reduce the size of their committee staffs by at least 
20% next year.

ASSEMBLY IN DISARRAY OVER SPEAKERSHIP; POLITICS: BROWN DECLARES HIMSELF 
'PRESIDING OFFICER.' REPUBLICANS BOYCOTT SESSION, SAY THEY WILL STAY AWAY UNTIL 
JAN. 4. 
</P>

 The struggle for control of the Assembly took bizarre new twists Tuesday when 
Democratic Assemblyman Willie Brown seized temporary control of the lower 
house, while Republicans declared that they were leaving the Capitol until 
January without resolving the bitter speakership battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumphant after the November elections, Republican legislators arrived here 
Monday with an apparent 41-vote majority and the conviction that they would be 
ruling the Assembly for the first time in a quarter of a century. But they 
could not muster enough votes to elect a Speaker after Assemblyman Paul Horcher 
of Diamond Bar bolted GOP ranks and voted for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Republican Leader Jim Brulte probably will meet between now and 
January in an effort to end the impasse, though it remains unclear if they can 
break the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, with the divided Assembly in disarray, Brown proclaimed 
himself the Assembly's "presiding officer" by virtue of his having served 
longer -- 31 years -- than any other member. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claimed the title in the absence of the Assembly chief clerk, who was 
taken to the hospital for a stress-related ailment after presiding over 
Monday's raucous and deadlocked opening session. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the San Francisco Democrat stood at the Speaker's dais, presiding over 
39 Democrats and newly independent Horcher, the 40 Republican Assembly members 
stymied Brown by meeting privately at a hotel across the street from the 
Capitol building. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown ordered sergeants-at-arms to round up the Republicans, sending them to 
the offices of each one. But the GOP delegation stayed at the hotel. Failing to 
obtain a quorum, Brown and his loyalists could perform no business, not even 
formally adjourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown pressed his call for a bipartisan agreement on organizing the house, 
even as he acknowledged that the speakership fight may only fuel voter anger at 
politicians. But he also vowed to continue his fight to remain Speaker, a post 
he has held for 14 years, longer than anyone in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start 30 years ago to suddenly decide in the 31st year of my career 
that with all this time, talent and energy, I am somehow going to disqualify 
myself from the top job," Brown said after the Assembly floor session recessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats emerged from the Nov. 8 election apparently having lost their hold 
on the Assembly, retaining 39 seats to the Republicans' 41. But while the GOP 
was poised to claim the speakership, Brown stunned the Assembly by convincing 
Republican Horcher to renounce his party affiliation and vote for Brown on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly remained split Tuesday with 40 members supporting Brown for 
Speaker and 40 backing Brulte. Brulte's spokesman, Phil Perry, acknowledged 
that the GOP may temporarily lose the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Democrats decide to basically steal an election and retain power, I 
guess there's not a whole lot we can do to stop it at this time, and we wait," 
Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also summed up what is evident to everyone involved: "This could drag on 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many twists Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although lawmakers often meet privately in caucus, it was unusual for 
Republicans to depart the building for such a meeting. But Republican lawmakers 
left knowing that if they stayed in the building, a sergeant-at-arms might find 
one of them and force them to attend the Assembly session. If that happened, 
Brown would have had a quorum and the GOP might have lost the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 On their return from the hotel after lunch, tight-lipped GOP lawmakers 
explained that they skipped the floor session because they needed to develop a 
new strategy. By telling his members to return to their districts, Brulte is 
hoping that public pressure will build to force a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people get out of touch with their constituents over the years," Brulte 
said. "Some people get out of touch between the time they're elected in 
November and the time they are sworn in." 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown claimed the title of presiding officer when chief Assembly Clerk E. 
Dotson Wilson took ill after being thrust into the position of presiding 
officer Monday in one of the most contentious sessions in recent memory. Wilson 
was suffering from an undetermined stress-related ailment, Brown said, and 
Wilson issued a note from a physician saying he was to perform no work for two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown denied telling Wilson to take the medical leave, and said he did not 
speak to Wilson after Monday's session. But Brown was incensed at Wilson for 
ruling against the Democrats on key parliamentary issues governing the 
unprecedented situation in which the Assembly finds itself. With Wilson gone, 
however, Brown can reverse those decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * In his key ruling, Wilson decided Monday that Republican Richard Mountjoy of 
Arcadia could remain in the Assembly, even though in addition to winning the 
Assembly seat Nov. 8 he was elected to the state Senate in a special election. 
Mountjoy was among the 40 Republicans who supported Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown intended to reverse Wilson's decision on Mountjoy and attempt to oust 
him from the Assembly, reducing Brulte's support to 39 votes in what would then 
be a 79-member house. Brown expected to remain as Speaker with a 40-vote 
majority, retaining votes from all 39 Democrats, plus Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, Perry said Mountjoy was considering not taking his Senate 
seat, remaining in the Assembly and backing a Republican for Speaker. If 
Mountjoy decides not to join the Senate, that seat would be declared vacant, 
another special election would be held, and Mountjoy could run for the seat 
again in the spring. Mountjoy could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a brief interview Tuesday, Gov. Pete Wilson urged the Assembly to resolve 
the power struggle. "There is a lot to do, and I think the people are 
impatient," Wilson said. "They are far more interested in seeing the job done, 
and I don't think they've got a whole lot of time or patience for these kind of 
squabbles." 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum said he is pushing a 
recall of Horcher, calling him a "bad man who has been taking care of No. 1, 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Central Committee in Horcher's district intended to serve 
Horcher with a recall notice by today. Horcher, who was elected as a Republican 
on Nov. 8 but renounced the GOP on Monday, said he is now an independent and 
voted for Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 To mount a recall, Horcher's political enemies would have up to four months to 
gather about 19,000 signatures. Then an election would be held, asking whether 
Horcher should be recalled. Schabarum said he might run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * While Horcher may have a recall to defend, one of Brulte's Republican 
backers may have to deal with a recall. State Democratic Party official Bob 
Mulholland said Tuesday that Democrats in Long Beach were seriously considering 
a recall of freshman Assemblyman Steve Kuykendall (R-Rancho Palos Verdes). 
Kuykendall narrowly defeated an incumbent Democrat after receiving a $125,000 
donation from tobacco giant Philip Morris on the weekend before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Democrats maintain that Mountjoy cannot legally sit in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mountjoy has made it clear he intends to be a state Senator," Brown said. 
"He only wishes to participate in the Forest Lawn ceremony for Willie Brown. 
Once he has done the Forest Lawn ceremony . . . he will dust his hands of that 
dirt and move over to the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans say Brown and the Democrats are trying to steal the election. 
"We are the majority party and the Democrats ought to be ashamed," Assemblyman 
Trice Harvey (R-Bakersfield) said.

CLINTON NAMES RUBIN TO LEAD TREASURY; CABINET: THE WALL STREET VETERAN IS 
CHOSEN TO SUCCEED SECRETARY BENTSEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, hoping to plug a gap in one of the most successful sectors 
of his Administration, turned to Wall Street veteran Robert E. Rubin Tuesday to 
replace Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton announced Bentsen's resignation, effective Dec. 22, and the selection 
of Rubin at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Clinton praised the 
"economic wisdom, common sense and common decency" of the 56-year-old nominee, 
who served as secretary of the White House National Economic Council, which 
Clinton created to coordinate economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's departure is unlikely to shift the Administration's approach on the 
economy. He and Rubin share a close relationship with Wall Street and generally 
have anchored the White House economic policy to more traditional approaches 
during storms of debate with some of the younger Democrats who filled out the 
President's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Rubin will be hard-pressed to match Bentsen's Washington savvy, 
acquired during more than two decades in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "As secretary of the Treasury, his work has touched nearly every field of 
accomplishment of this Administration, making our economy work again for 
ordinary Americans," Clinton said of Bentsen, 73, who plans to return to his 
home in Houston. "By any stead he ranks as one of the outstanding economic 
policy-makers in this country since World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really going to miss you," he said to Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the midpoint of his term, Clinton finds himself juggling a series of 
vacancies or likely vacancies and searching for replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace Rubin, Clinton will name Erskine Bowles, deputy chief of the White 
House staff and former administrator of the Small Business Administration, 
several Administration sources said. Laura d'Andrea Tyson, the former UC 
Berkeley economics professor who chairs the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers, was said to have wanted the post. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Administration sources said, Rubin's deputy, W. Bowman 
Cutter, is nearing a decision to resign after a series of unsuccessful turf 
battles with colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has yet to nominate a replacement for Agriculture Secretary Mike 
Espy, who has announced his resignation in the wake of criticism that he 
accepted gifts from firms he regulates. In addition, Clinton is searching for a 
replacement of his staff secretary, John Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Rubin is confirmed by the Senate, Clinton said, Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Frank Newman will be acting secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors had circulated for months that Bentsen was planning to resign. He said 
Tuesday that he told Clinton of his plans in September. But throughout the 
autumn, as discontent within the Administration has arisen over the operation 
of the President's national security team, speculation has been rampant that 
Clinton would ask Bentsen to replace Warren Christopher as secretary of state. 
Eventually, Bentsen said, he told Clinton and then Christopher that he was not 
interested in the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, who left the Senate two years ago to take the Treasury post, said 
that he had made up his mind to leave government service this year -- at what 
would have been the end of his fourth Senate term. 
</P>
<P>
 While one aide said that Bentsen appeared to be enjoying his job "more than he 
ever has," he decided that, if he was to return to the private sector, either 
as an investor or as the owner of a company, he should move soon because the 
transition would only get more difficult the longer he waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, former head of the Goldman Sachs & Co. investment firm, developed close 
ties to Clinton in the 1992 presidential campaign when he matched the 
then-fledgling presidential candidate with wealthy potential campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin is a graduate of Harvard who did postgraduate study at the London School 
of Economics and received a law degree from Yale. At Goldman Sachs he rose to 
the rank of co-senior partner and co-chairman. He has a personal fortune 
estimated at between $100 million and $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From his office in the West Wing of the White House, just upstairs from the 
Oval Office, Rubin has often melded disparate approaches and demands of various 
government officials -- ranging from members of Congress reluctant to increase 
spending to the more liberal members of the President's economic team, among 
them Tyson and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who press for a greater federal 
government role. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen began his Washington career when he was elected to Congress in 1948 
after flying bombing missions over Europe during World War II. He left 
Washington after four terms, becoming president of a Texas insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the Senate in 1970, defeating George Bush. He ran his own, 
quickly aborted presidential campaign in 1976 and was vice-presidential running 
mate to unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. When chosen by Clinton to become Treasury secretary, Bentsen was chairman 
of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Rose Garden ceremony, Bentsen, flanked by his wife, Clinton and Rubin 
and his wife, assessed the state of the economy after his two years at 
Treasury: "You couldn't see the economic flag flying any higher. We've got the 
best numbers that we've seen in 30 years."

EUROPE SECURITY SUMMIT FAILS TO AGREE ON BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders from Europe and North America meeting here to discuss European 
security in the aftermath of the Cold War failed to agree Tuesday on a common 
approach to the war in Bosnia, the Continent's bloodiest conflict in half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest in a series of humiliating setbacks for the United States and 
its allies over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia blocked approval of a declaration 
that would have condemned the Bosnian Serbs for their recent assault on the 
U.N. "safe area" of Bihac as well as their policies of "continuing warfare and 
ethnic cleansing" throughout Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongly worded statement, worked out over two months of talks leading to 
the summit, would also have condemned the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting an 
international peace plan for the region and demanded that "the aggressors" 
accept a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are forced to conclude that the international community is capitulating to 
the aggressors and accepting the breakup of my country," said Bosnian 
negotiator Mahir Hadziahmetovic, bitter and deeply disappointed as the two-day 
summit ended. "The people of Bosnia-Herzegovina have been betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian move meant that the meeting of top leaders from more than 50 
countries ended without any official statement on the most serious threat to 
European security since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Both President 
Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin attended the summit but left 
before the final session Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very difficult meeting," said Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi, whose country was among the summit's organizers. "I found myself in 
a situation that left me embittered, disillusioned and full of anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders were in the Hungarian capital of Budapest to give new authority to 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Continent's only 
security organization with members on both sides of the former East-West 
divide. The organization was born in the mid-1970s as a bridge between Western 
countries and the Soviet Bloc, and is intent upon becoming the primary 
mechanism for resolving conflicts in the region into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 But the achievements of the summit -- including agreement to send a 
multinational peacekeeping force to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region of 
Azerbaijan -- came against the gloomy backdrop of fighting several hundred 
miles away in Bosnia and the extraordinarily public display of international 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cold War has ended, but the peace that has followed looks somewhat 
frightening to humankind," said Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet 
foreign minister who now is Georgia's leader. "We are living through such a 
frightening peace because the termination of the Cold War has not yet rid us of 
its legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Czech President Vaclav Havel, a former Communist-era dissident, said creating 
a stable European order was taking much longer than most people expected. He 
warned that the delay could give "nationalists, chauvinists, populists and 
extremists" the opportunity to dictate the Continent's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The many demons we thought had been driven forever from the minds of people 
and nations are dangerously rousing themselves again and are surreptitiously 
but systematically undoing the principles upon which we began to build the 
peaceful future of Europe," Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisiveness over Bosnia demonstrated in an unusually open manner that the 
struggle for influence in Europe between the United States and Russia, a staple 
of the Cold War, is still very much alive despite pronouncements from both 
sides that a new era of cooperation had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened tension between the two Cold War adversaries was also evident 
at the summit's opening Monday, when Yeltsin issued a stern warning about 
American efforts to single-handedly dictate the new world order. For his part, 
Clinton insisted that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance 
should be allowed to expand into Central Europe despite Russian objections. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Russian television Tuesday, Yeltsin sounded a more 
conciliatory note: "We should look for ways to get closer with the United 
States," he said. "With the Americans, we will look for such a compromise and 
we will find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, asked by Russian reporters whether the United States was the 
unchallenged master of the CSCE, Yeltsin said, "The fate of the world must not 
be decided in one capital. I hope you all understand which capital I meant." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Clinton "did not leave (Budapest) triumphant." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Russian maneuvering Tuesday over the Bosnia declaration, U.S. 
officials were left in the embarrassing position of pushing for a weak 
alternative statement on Bosnia put forward by the host government, Hungary. 
The substitute declaration was intended as a face-saving measure after marathon 
efforts to persuade the Russians to back down collapsed about 3 a.m. Tuesday. 
Under conference rules, official declarations must be endorsed by all members. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators said the Russians' primary objection was to the obvious laying of 
blame on the Bosnian Serbs. Russia is a longtime ally of Serbia and has been 
accused of supplying arms to the Bosnian Serbs in defiance of the U.N. weapons 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nikita Matkovsky 
denied those reports, blaming them on unspecified parties wanting to make 
Russia look responsible for the escalation in the Bosnian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia has not and is not undertaking any moves to sidestep the embargo," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the weaker, last-minute statement, which called for safe passage of 
humanitarian relief and a stop to the fighting, was approved only over the 
emotional objections of the Bosnian delegation and then as an unofficial 
adjunct to the summit's formal agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crisis we face . . . is one that also calls on our conscience and does 
not allow us to leave here without saying strongly to the world that we 
identify with it, we share the suffering of the people, and we commit ourselves 
to take additional action to respond," said U.S. delegate Samuel W. Brown in 
supporting the Hungarian proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such pleas and a public arm-twisting session by German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, the Bosnians refused to endorse the makeshift declaration. Bosnian 
officials said it made a mockery of the crisis in their country and the tough 
negotiations that went into preparing the rejected declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 "My country is not facing a natural disaster. We are facing aggression," 
Hadziahmetovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The messy handling of Bosnia provided an inauspicious setting for one of the 
summit's most visible decisions: the renaming of the CSCE as the Organization 
of Cooperation and Security in Europe. Although the new designation carries no 
new legal meaning, officials said it signified an upgrading of the group's 
international standing and would ensure continued high-level participation by 
its members.

ON CALIFORNIA: THESE ARE THE TIMES . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In times like this it is important to step back and remind ourselves of one of 
the greatest contributions the state Legislature makes to society: 
entertainment. Yes, yes, there are budgets and bills to pass and all that, but 
these adventures in civics usually are tedious undertakings. The heavy lifting 
is done by drones or back-room dealers. None of us knows quite what is going on 
and, more to the point, none cares -- in large measure because the results 
never come close to matching the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often, though, Capitol business can turn weird, melodramatic and 
wickedly fun. This is one of those times. Willie Brown, declared null and void 
last week by almost every pundit in town, has spent the last two days defying 
simple math and dazzling parliamentarians everywhere as he endeavors to extend 
his 14-year reign as Speaker of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The action has been fast, unpredictable and outlandish, a purple drama of 
switched votes, death threats, Machiavellian maneuvers and bitter wit. At 
present, Brown has secured a 40-40 stalemate with Jim Brulte, the Republican 
who began the week believing he had 41 votes in his pocket. "It will be fast," 
Brulte's press officer had boasted of the pending GOP takeover, "and it will be 
painless." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, so much for that prognostication. In contrast, the hopeful prediction 
here is that the battle will be slow and full of torture -- that it will last 
months, obscure all the rest of the Statehouse baloney that typically passes 
for Important News and, in the end, will mean nothing much to anybody, except 
the participants. Around such dynamics are great dramas formed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This forecast, by the way, is not wholly uninformed. There is a person up here 
who has operated in and around the Capitol for many years, who has stood beside 
Brown in similar crises, who is standing by him in this one. And sometimes, to 
my great fortune, this person will pick up the telephone and, with a promise of 
anonymity, attempt to fill my empty cup of Sacramento knowledge with a nip or 
two of the real, inside stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, this person had warned me away from any premature burial of 
Speaker Brown. "Old age and treachery," he suggested with an arresting 
confidence, "will win out every time over youth and skill." On Tuesday my 
source graciously admitted that he had told me so, and then told me some more. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Paul Horcher, the Republican who had surprised his party-mates by 
voting for Brown instead of Brulte? 
</P>
<P>
 "Horcher is the kid in school who had his milk money stolen everyday. And 
then, 20 years later, the guys who always messed with him are big shots driving 
around drunk in a limo and a cop pulls them over. And the cop is Horcher. And 
they say, 'Hey, Paul, how you doin'? Remember us?' And he says, 'Yeah. I 
remember. Get out of the car and spread 'em.' The Republicans treated Horcher 
like dirt. They created Horcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Brown and his people know they had Horcher's vote going in? "We knew." So 
have the events unfolded by accident, or design? "Design. It is all by design." 
Even the bit about the clerk calling in sick? "Wouldn't you call in sick, too?" 
And what happens next? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here the source went into a long description of a scenario, a stalling game, 
that extends well into next year. It likely will begin with the departure -- 
forced or otherwise -- of Assemblyman Dick Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), who somehow 
has managed to become elected simultaneously to the state Senate and Assembly. 
With Mountjoy gone, Brown would be elected Speaker by a majority 40-39 vote. 
Once elected, it will take, by law, 41 votes to unseat Brown -- whether 
Mountjoy's seat has been filled or not. From that point forward, an anticipated 
series of recall attempts, special elections and so forth will keep the 
Republicans always close to the needed 41 votes but never over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 This surely would frustrate Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican with ambitions, no? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty lightweight thinking," my teacher scolded. "Wilson needs Willie 
Brown. Not to bash, but to make sure the government runs. What Wilson doesn't 
need now is more IOUs and chaos. It takes 54 votes to pass a budget. The 
Republicans will never be able to deliver their 40 votes. Maybe they can 
deliver 30. That means Wilson then has got to find 24 Democrats. If Willie 
Brown is Speaker, then, once there is a deal, Wilson can count on 40 Democrat 
votes and he only needs to go out and get 14 Republicans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point," he concluded, "it will sink in on the Republicans that they 
don't have the votes. And at some point, they will decide enough. The 
Legislature will have to get back to business. There will be budgets to pass, 
bills to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 For entertainment's sake, let's hope that day doesn't come any time soon.

YOUTHS' PRISON TOUR PUTS GANGS' ALLURE IN PERSPECTIVE; JUVENILES: A FIRSTHAND 
LOOK AT LIFE BEHIND BARS IS INTENDED TO HELP PERSUADE TEEN-AGERS TO STAY IN 
SCHOOL AND OUT OF TROUBLE.

<P>
 They already suspected it was a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But after being frisked by guards, eyeballed by inmates and hustled into a 
cellblock at the Ventura School to be yelled at by a hard-eyed killer, these 13 
Oxnard High freshmen were absolutely sure of it: 
</P>
<P>
 Joining gangs is a really bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-hour tour of the California Youth Authority's juvenile prison in 
Camarillo was enough to convince them. 
</P>
<P>
 Chosen because low grades and poor attendance put them at risk of falling out 
of school and into gangs, the teen-agers got an intimate tour of the 54-acre, 
razor wire-rimmed compound that awaits them if they mess up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell you what you're going to eat, when you're going to eat, what you can 
wear, what kind of makeup you can wear," warned California Youth Authority gang 
officer Eddie Cue, who has shown the prison life to 3,000 at-risk Ventura 
County teen-agers since launching the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you step through that door, you're no longer in Ventura County, you're 
no longer part of the homeboys or whatever," Cue said. "You're in the Ventura 
School." 
</P>
<P>
 He told them of strip searches, tiny cells and hard beds. He told them about 
inmates wielding sharpened toothbrushes. He pointed out the high fence rigged 
with concertina wire, cameras and tripwires. 
</P>
<P>
 Get cocky here, and you will get hurt, he warned. Guards take a minute and a 
half to jump on a fight, he said. "But when you're the one being pounded on, 
that minute and a half seems like an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he marched them off, double file, mouths shut, hands in pockets to a 
locked cellblock to meet two murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to jail when I was a teen-ager like you," said Martin Luevano, 24, 
calmly. "I was 16 years old, into the fast life, partying and like that. I made 
a wrong decision when I took someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he learned about prison life. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeboys and homegirls will drift away, he told them. No one will care but 
family. Other inmates will make your life miserable. And, he said, looking each 
teen-ager in the eye, you still must attend classes and do homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Luevano added, almost tenderly, "When the bullet bites you, it's gonna bite 
you hard, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then up stepped Raul Aguilar, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in here 7 1/2 years going on eight, and I'm still waiting to go 
home," he said flatly. "Any of you gangbanging now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Face to face behind bars with a murderer, all the visitors were smart enough 
to shut up and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 But one. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen and husky, the buzz-cut boy with a fuzzy mustache raised his hand and 
proudly claimed membership in an Oxnard gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar's eyes locked onto him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why you gangbangin', man?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cause that's where I'm from," the boy replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, so you gotta be down for the 'hood. Why you down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cause all my relatives are." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you wanna be when you grow up?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-minute grilling stretched to 10. Aguilar leaned forward intensely, 
foot on a chair, obscenities creeping into his rising voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to get killed? You want that for your family?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "See, that's what I'm talking about," Aguilar said to the others, who sat 
stock-still now, barely glancing at him. "You don't even know what you're 
gangbanging for. Let me tell you something. I've never been to a high school 
dance. I even forget what it's like to have a girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed further, the boy admitted that he is "a follower," seeking revenge for 
the gang-related deaths of his father and brother. That cut no ice with the 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was taken out too," Aguilar said. "I'm the only vato left in my 
family. . . . You wanna be a follower, then be a follower. End up in here, if 
you're not dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Cue moved the group on to the school's chapel, where three girls perched on 
the rail. The Ventura School is the only Youth Authority prison for females. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stuff that goes on in here is stuff you wouldn't want to see," said 
inmate Leah Whitaker, 21, serving time for kidnaping. "There was a 14-year-old 
girl in here, and four girls gang-raped her. And the guys . . . they treat you 
like a piece of meat." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no privacy, she said. Your cellmate sees just about everything you 
do, and guards peer through the cell door window whenever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the 14-year-old boy dared to claim gang membership, and again he was 
dressed down -- this time by two furious girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Cue took them outside so even more inmates could confront the teen-agers 
-- without adults hovering over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls clustered with the girls, listening to tales from the inside. Boys 
paired off with individual inmates. But one group crowded around the 
self-proclaimed gang member while two of his classmates looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't listen to people out there, you'll come in here and you'll listen 
to cops and you'll listen to us, " said Tracy Usry, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the boy's facade was breaking down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you doing here?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm busted for murder. I got 31 to life, homie." 
</P>
<P>
 "How's that feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels (screwed) up. I got two kids," Usry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You seem like you're paying attention," he added. "Go home and think about it 
one night." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the youth nodded.

EXPERTS TOUT PREDICTIONS OF ERUPTIONS; VOLCANOES: SATELLITES AND GROUND-BASED 
INSTRUMENTS MAKE FORECASTS MORE RELIABLE, SCIENTISTS SAY. MORE SUCH MONITORING 
IS URGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Measurements by satellites and ground-based instruments are giving experts 
increasingly reliable predictions of volcanic eruptions, scientists said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on encouraging new measurements, researchers at the meeting of the 
American Geophysical Union called for much more pervasive monitoring of the 
world's 600 volcanoes that could erupt at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Dvorak of the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascade Volcano Observatory in 
Vancouver, Wash., said that only about 50 volcanoes in the world are regularly 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 The new instruments can measure ground deformation -- a key component in 
forecasting many eruptions -- down to mere millimeters of movement, Dvorak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes in the periods leading up to an eruption the deformation is so 
dramatic that it is apparent to the naked eye. At the city of Rabaul in Papua 
New Guinea, for example, residents waking up the morning of Sept. 19 could see 
that beaches next to two volcanic cones had risen six feet above the sea 
overnight. Eruptions began within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Rabaul too, instruments played a significant role, showing less visible 
deformation the night before, which -- combined with 27 hours of an unusual 
number of earthquakes -- persuaded authorities to begin an evacuation of the 
first of 50,000 residents, which they did successfully, with six hours to 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Dvorak said that at volcanoes such as Kilauea and Mauna Loa in Hawaii, and 
others in Indonesia and Japan, it has proved possible to make reliable 
calculations of minute-by-minute pressure increases within shallow reservoirs 
of magma, or molten rock, as the material begins a quick rise to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Dixon of the University of Miami said the Global Positioning System 
operated by Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has proved invaluable in 
showing gradual horizontal movements in volcanic domes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, for precise measurements on a continuous basis, and 
particularly measurements of vertical movement, instruments on the ground are 
important as well. When a volcano is about to erupt, strain may be accumulating 
so rapidly that it is vital to have instruments on site ready to transmit data 
instantaneously, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the most comprehensive monitoring is taking place in the Long 
Valley Caldera near Mammoth Lakes. Measurements there indicate no pending 
eruptions, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments installed near Mammoth Lakes showed an immediate increase in 
strain there after the 1992 Landers earthquake hundreds of miles away in the 
Southern California desert, he noted. But that had no perceptible volcanic 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists cautioned that before a fully reliable picture of deformation 
and strain at Mammoth is obtained, additional instruments, spaced out from 
various vantage points, are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan T. Linde of the Carnegie Institution in Washington said strain meters in 
Iceland not only indicated to scientists when the Hekla volcano there was about 
to erupt in 1991, but also when eruptions were about to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a clear sign of an impending eruption 15 to 20 minutes before it 
occurred," he said. "And there were indications how powerful it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage of using the Mammoth area for extensive monitoring is that it 
can serve as a model for measuring activity at other, more distant volcanoes 
with instruments, California scientists said, even though the last volcanic 
activity at Mammoth was about 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 New monitoring methods are not perfect, the scientists said. Experience in 
various parts of the world suggests that in some cases measuring instruments 
may provide only hours or minutes of warning before an eruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a few minutes warning, however, can provide a big advantage over no 
warning at all to those who may be victimized, they said.

THE NAVY'S NOISY INVASION FORCE; MILITARY: DEFINITELY NOT STEALTH CLASS, THE 
HOVERCRAFT NONETHELESS HAS PROVED ITS WORTH IN DIFFICULT BEACH LANDINGS. TWENTY 
OF THEM TRAIN TOGETHER AT CAMP PENDLETON. 
</P>

<P>
 Navy Capt. Hank Howe labeled it "Hovercraft central." 
</P>
<P>
 This was no ordinary exercise. The noise was deafening, the dust clouds 
immense. These 20 Hovercraft, or LCAC (landing craft, air cushion) were the 
largest number to fly in formation at one time anywhere in the world. Tuesday's 
maneuvers were practice, Howe said, but "important practice" for any future 
military crises similar to those in Somalia and the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old Hovercraft -- 35 of them at Camp Pendleton, with 35 more in 
Little Creek, Va. -- were deployed in Somalia and the Persian Gulf and, in 
Howe's view, played indispensable roles in both places. 
</P>
<P>
 Their primary contribution: giving the United States an "over the horizon" 
invasion force in which each Hovercraft can deliver 75 tons of personnel and 
materiel from a minimum of 35 miles offshore and reach a beach within minutes 
at a speed of 35 knots. Their maximum range is 200 miles offshore, and the huge 
vehicles can travel over hilly terrain at 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell," Howe said, "they expand the number of beaches we can hit, 
allowing us to go farther and deeper inland from the cushion of an 
over-the-horizon offshore location." 
</P>
<P>
 Each vessel is 47 feet wide and 87 feet long, a flat, rectangular, amphibious 
assault vehicle that, in Howe's words, is akin to flying "a bar of soap." The 
craft is powered by six gas turbine engines that stretch the decibel level to 
an eardrum's limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members wore earplugs Tuesday, and those with contact lenses strapped on 
goggles to fight off the dust clouds created by an armada of LCACs from ACU-5, 
otherwise known as Assault Craft Unit headquarters at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love acronyms," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe also loves Hovercraft, which arms experts say can cover 70% of the 
world's coastal areas, compared to the 17% its predecessors could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The units cost $22 million each and are manufactured by two New Orleans firms, 
Textron Marine Systems and Avondale Golf Marine. While at sea, they are stored, 
not on aircraft carriers, but on amphibious vessels that carry what is known as 
a "wet well." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say no Hovercraft have been damaged so far, but then none has 
encountered an open conflict, even during Operation Desert Storm. The United 
States uses them primarily to move massive amounts of military equipment from 
sea to land, although each can carry 23 combat-ready Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the weapons capabilities other countries have, the over-the-horizon 
factor is the strongest attribute," Howe said. "By launching 35 miles offshore, 
that's an enormous arc for anyone to defend against." 
</P>
<P>
 No other country has a craft quite like the U.S.-made LCAC, Howe said. But 
Japan is about to purchase two from the United States with delivery scheduled 
for 1997. North Korea and Russia have similar craft, but in his words, they 
"don't compare." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Pendleton-based LCACs are now deployed, with four due to return 
Thursday. Two are in Sasebo, Japan, near the North Korean coast, four are in 
the Indian Ocean and one is in Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Lt. Scott Davies, 28, is a veteran of Hovercraft deployments, having used 
them in Somalia from October, 1993, to February, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to six different landing sites," Davies said. "Most displacement 
vessels were incapable of landing because of low tides and sandbars. The LCAC 
were able to land in Somalia, cross through sand -- it's extremely soft there 
-- and move up to a hard, packed road within minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The sensation of riding one, Davies said, is akin to flying, "especially when 
you're over land, since no part of the craft ever touches ground. The bottom of 
the skirt is two to three inches off the ground, while the bottom of the hull 
is four feet off the ground. The skirt entraps the air, which gives you the 
lift."

AFTER FAILURE TO OUST CHECHEN LEADER, RUSSIA SEEKS RELEASE OF PRISONERS; 
NEGOTIATIONS: PRESIDENT OF BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC AGREES TO FREE SOLDIERS, MOSCOW'S 
DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Foiled in its attempts to oust the rebel leader of the breakaway republic of 
Chechnya, Russia dispatched two key ministers Tuesday to negotiate the release 
of its prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev announced on Russian television late Tuesday 
that President Dzhokar Dudayev of Chechnya had agreed to release Russian POWs 
captured 11 days ago during an attempt to storm Dudayev's presidential palace 
in Grozny, the Chechen capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to avert an all-out war with the oil-rich Muslim region, Grachev and 
Interior Minister Viktor F. Yerin had flown to the southern Russian republic of 
Ingushetia to meet with Dudayev in the remote village of Ordzhonikidzevskaya. 
Grachev and Dudayev both declared themselves "satisfied" with the meeting. 
Terms of the POW release, if any, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither Chechnya nor anybody else in the North Caucasus is going to war with 
Moscow," Dudayev declared, defusing fears of an imminent Russian attack on the 
defiant Caucasian republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev said the Russian Security Council will meet Thursday to decide how to 
resolve the Chechen conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chechnya declared independence in 1991, Russia has never recognized 
it as a sovereign nation. Russian officials have accused Dudayev of sponsoring 
terrorism and providing haven to mobsters, hijackers and bandits. Still, Moscow 
was obliged to try to negotiate a settlement after a covert campaign to oust 
Dudayev turned into a fiasco last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian bombing attacks in which civilians, some of them children, perished 
appear only to have intensified the Chechens' historic hostility toward Russia 
and boosted Dudayev's failing popularity, according to reports from Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin flip-flopped by first ordering Chechens to 
lay down their arms and then, when his deadline passed and nothing happened, 
allowing aides to claim the order had been "misunderstood." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 people, including at least 16 Russian service personnel, remain 
prisoners in Grozny, where they have given damaging interviews contradicting 
Moscow's official version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev has released four other prisoners as a "gesture of goodwill" to two 
different visiting delegations of Russian lawmakers, who in return have asked 
Yeltsin to halt the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a third delegation headed by liberal economist and lawmaker 
Grigory A. Yavlinsky flew to Chechnya and its members offered themselves as 
hostages in exchange for the Russian POWs. Chechen Foreign Minister Shamsedin 
Yusef politely rejected the swap. 
</P>
<P>
 As the conflict drags on, the Russian Parliament, press and public are voicing 
strident opposition to armed intervention in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chechnya is an inseparable part of Russia, but we are against establishing 
law and order there with fire and sword," said Yegor T. Gaidar, head of 
Russia's Democratic Choice political party and a Yeltsin loyalist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist newspaper Pravda and the Russian Orthodox Church concurred with 
the liberal Gaidar, a situation as rare as fresh strawberries in a Moscow 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian Islamic leader, Mufti Hazrat Ravil Gainutdin, warned that military 
escalation of the Chechnya conflict would "inevitably" draw in other Russian 
minority groups -- including Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Valeriya I. Novodvorskaya, a former Soviet dissident, compared the mood in the 
Kremlin to that of August, 1968, the eve of the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia. "The same threats to introduce troops if the Chechens do not 
give up their freedom and independence, the same tension, the same massing of 
troops on the border," she said. "We shouldn't allow Russian democracy to slide 
into bloody fascism." 
</P>
<P>
 Izvestia newspaper reported in today's editions that Dudayev commands 11,000 
to 12,000 soldiers armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery and 
antiaircraft and antitank guns. Russia has massed "a tremendous number of 
troops" in the border region of Mozdok, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The covert operation to oust Dudayev was kept so secret that even a senior 
Russian army commander was unaware that his officers were being recruited by 
the counterintelligence service to fight in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Boris Polyakov resigned last weekend in protest when he learned that 
his elite officers were serving in Chechnya without his knowledge, a unit 
spokesman confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Russian journalists blasted their government for shameless 
mendacity about the near-civil war in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 After insisting for months that Russia was not backing anti-Dudayev rebels, 
then maintaining that fighters captured in Grozny were not Russian and that 
Russia had nothing to do with warplanes bombing Chechnya last week, Grachev on 
Monday admitted Russian involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper responded by running a photograph of Grachev 
under the banner headline: "Unidentified Lying Object."

QUEEN OPENS YARD TO OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II has given a Canadian oilman the go-ahead to drill on the 
grounds of Windsor Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 The monarch, plagued by family splits and income-tax demands from the 
government, will not earn a penny from the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Oilman Desmond Oswald has promised not to turn her back garden into a 
1920s-style oil field studded with derricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswald, managing director of Canuk Exploration Ltd., said, "We will be about 
half a kilometer (0.3 mile) from the castle in the grounds. We hope to start 
drilling next summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Oswald said the drilling to a depth of 984 feet is purely exploratory and will 
not affect the parkland around the castle. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Tuesday that up to 100 million barrels of oil could be found. But some 
oil analysts described the estimate as optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Windsor Mayor Dennis Outwin, fearful of what could happen to one of Britain's 
most enduring symbols, said, "It's bound to lead to Windsor Great Park being 
turned almost into a second Dallas. I feel the queen, whom I greatly admire and 
who has never put a foot wrong since she ascended to the throne, has for the 
first time made a bad mistake, or she's been badly advised." 
</P>
<P>
 Windsor Castle was ravaged by a fire two years ago. Repairs will cost up to 
$93.57 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Any royalties from the oil field will go to the Treasury.

 After hearing testimony linking the state of Iran to a worldwide terror 
network, a French court Tuesday convicted two Iranians of murder in the 1991 
assassination of Shahpour Bakhtiar, one of the Tehran regime's political 
opponents. 
</P>

 Ali Vakili Rad, 35, one of three men directly involved in the stabbing death 
of Bakhtiar and an aide in his Paris apartment, was sentenced to life in 
prison. Prosecutors said he was a secret agent of VEVAK, the intelligence and 
security agency that monitors the Iranian government's opponents worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other alleged assassins, along with other accomplices, are still at large. 
French investigators say some of the suspects may be in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A second defendant, Massoud Hendi, 47, a relative of the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini and former Paris bureau chief of Iran's broadcasting network, 
was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for helping the killers 
obtain false documents to enter France. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man, a diplomat in Tehran's embassy in Switzerland and nephew of 
Iran's current president, was acquitted of helping the killers escape through 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-week trial, presided over by a special terrorism court of seven 
magistrates, had created a political dilemma for the French government, which 
has buckled to pressure from the Iranian government in previous terrorism 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 While it wanted to show that terrorist acts would be punished, the French did 
not want a political trial that would increase tensions between their nation 
and Iran and touch off renewed terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the French government, ignoring an extradition request from the 
Swiss government, expelled to Tehran two Iranians wanted for terrorist acts in 
Switzerland. And in 1990, the French government pardoned an Iranian sentenced 
to life in prison for attempting to kill Bakhtiar. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest trial focused on the crime itself. Much of French investigators' 
evidence of a vast terrorist network, which stretched from Istanbul to Los 
Angeles, was not presented in court. Since the Islamic Republic was founded in 
1979, 63 exiles have been killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the French prosecutor, Jacques Mouton, contended in court that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran was "at the heart" of the criminal organization that ordered 
the killing of Bakhtiar and his aide. And Mouton called the plot "a perfect 
murder in perfect cold blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Chakeri, who replaced Bakhtiar as head of the Iranian exile group, said 
the trial and verdict amounted to a conviction of Iran for state-sponsored 
terrorism. But he and other Bakhtiar associates said they were disappointed 
that French concerns had kept the case from becoming a political trial of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 No official from the Iranian government was called to testify, and Iran denied 
involvement in the assassination, contending that Bakhtiar was killed by his 
own associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar, 76, a longtime champion of democratic rule in Iran, was imprisoned 
by the shah of Iran. When the shah's hold on power began to slip, he made 
Bakhtiar prime minister, but that government lasted barely a month before the 
Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In exile, Bakhtiar was declared a target of Islamic punishment. He was slain 
Aug. 6, 1991.

ITALIAN JUDGE SPEARHEADING ANTI-GRAFT DRIVE RESIGNS; CORRUPTION: JURIST 
COMPLAINS OF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE. PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI IS A TARGET OF HIS 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET STOBART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge who has become the leader and symbol of Italy's biggest 
anti-corruption drive against the highest echelons of political and economic 
power resigned Tuesday, complaining that he could no longer carry out his 
duties because of outside interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Antonio Di Pietro's resignation, although rumored for days, was the 
latest bombshell in the contentious struggle between a right-wing government 
and the team of hard-nosed investigating magistrates whom critics accuse of 
pursuing a left-wing agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page letter to his superior, Di Pietro, who began investigating 
bribery and corruption between Italian business and political figures 2 1/2 
years ago, alluded to the growing public and political attention as damaging to 
his investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe, known as Mani Pulite (Clean Hands), triggered the downfall this 
year of Italy's political Establishment parties that had governed for half a 
century. Now, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire media magnate and 
political rookie who improbably rose to power, is one of the judge's targets. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Francesco Saverio Borrelli, chief prosecutor of Milan, Di 
Pietro wrote: "Especially recently, my duties as a magistrate are interpreted 
increasingly as a personal accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 He said events such as street demonstrations, both for and against the work of 
his team of investigating magistrates, were an impediment to what he called "a 
balanced judicial solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro, 44, also alleged that his decisions were being taken "as political 
side-taking" that lately had tended to transform the work of the magistrates 
into "a sort of judicial metaphor for the division of political spoils." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel used," wrote the judge who has been hailed as a hero in Italy's 
so-called era of a new republic. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the press of plastering him on the front page, his exploits put 
there "either by anyone who wants to put me against his enemies or by anyone 
who wants to accredit a nonexistent political end to my normal judicial 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Di Pietro's investigations into what became an entrenched system of 
payoffs to political figures and parties in return for public contracts have 
involved about 3,000 politicians and business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the investigations began, there have been government attempts to curtail 
or short-circuit them with decrees and legislation. One such attempt recently 
sought to abolish preventive detention for suspects in corruption cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation announcement came while Di Pietro was being televised in a 
Milan court conducting one of Italy's biggest bribery and corruption trials. It 
caused immediate consternation, a chorus of lamentation and cries of horror 
from public and political circles. The stock market fell and the lira suffered 
an immediate decline against international currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting Di Pietro's resignation, Chief Prosecutor Borrelli denied rumors of 
his own resignation. He praised Di Pietro's work and alluded to "a climate of 
growing injurious hostility" that surrounded that work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement from Budapest, Hungary, where he is attending a meeting of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Berlusconi expressed regret 
over the resignation, saying Di Pietro "had won the respect of Italians." 
</P>
<P>
 "His decision to quit the magistracy leaves a bitter taste," the prime 
minister said, "even for those who considered some aspects of his inquiries 
somewhat debatable."

PUBLIC HEALTH; HAWAIIANS FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO EAT HOMESPUN SPAM SNACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ESSOYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawaii has its share of McDonald's and Burger Kings. But for local residents, 
there's more to fast food than burgers and fries. There is Spam musubi. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as some regulators are finding out, its devotees would rather fight than 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
 A quintessential sample of the "East meets West" flavor of the Hawaiian 
Islands, Spam musubi is a slab of lightly fried Spam -- courtesy of that 
bastion of Americanism, Geo. A. Hormel & Co. -- placed atop a Japanese-style 
rice ball and neatly tied with a belt of seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, the hearty combination has satisfied the snack craving of 
Hawaii's people. Mom-and-pop stores offered Spam musubi wrapped in cellophane, 
stacked at room temperature near their cash registers. Kids picked them up 
after school. Secretaries made lunch of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a meal in one," explains Dot Fujinaga, one of those secretaries. "It's a 
great combination and it's easy to carry around. It's part of the lifestyle 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this summer. Concerned about cases of food poisoning, state inspectors 
stopped winking at the local custom in June and began enforcing longstanding 
regulations forbidding the sale of perishable foods at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't counting on the passionate response. Musubi lovers and shop 
owners, led by the Hawaii Ethnic Foods Assn., rose up in indignation. To 
refrigerate a rice ball, they pointed out, is to ruin it. No one will buy the 
resulting cluster of hardened grains. The rules were decried as an assault on 
the local way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been doing this for generations," argued Ken Iong, association 
president. "It's not a health threat to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The state agreed to negotiate. After months of bargaining, the Health 
Department recently announced revised draft rules allowing local favorites like 
Spam musubi to be kept at room temperature for as long as four hours. After 
that, the food must be discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid the four-hour rule, perishables must be refrigerated at less than 45 
degrees Fahrenheit, or kept hotter than 140 degrees. The regulations apply to 
all ready-to-eat items that are apt to spoil, including meat, fish, dairy and 
egg products. In addition to Spam musubi, that includes the popular bentos 
(Japanese-style box lunches), and even the trademark roast ducks hanging in 
Chinatown grocers' windows. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 83 complaints of food-borne illnesses in the last five years 
linked to ethnic foods in Hawaii, and many others go unreported, said Ellen 
Blomquist, a Health Department spokeswoman. She said there has been no upward 
trend, but the agency is concerned that mass production and distribution to 
retailers is delaying consumption and increasing risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, these items were primarily prepared by small stores, who only 
did them in small quantities and sold them in a very short period of time," 
Blomquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disease-causing bacteria, like salmonella and staphylococcus, multiply rapidly 
at room temperature, especially after a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have zero tolerance for any incident of food-borne illness," said Bruce S. 
Anderson, state deputy director for environmental health. "These are serious, 
sometimes fatal, illnesses. It would be utterly irresponsible for us to wait 
until there is a serious outbreak or a death to begin enforcing regulations 
when we know there is a serious potential problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The revised regulations will not take effect until after public hearings, 
which have yet to be scheduled. Food brokers may also seek a variance if they 
can prove that their foods can be held safely. In the meantime, Spam musubi and 
bentos are back on the counters. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop owners, however, aren't happy. The time limit, they say, is 
impractical for large-scale production, and lab tests are expensive and 
unnecessary. They argue that vinegar in the rice and salt and preservatives in 
the meat give it a longer shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes fatal? Bentos? Musubi? Roast duck? It just isn't happening in 
Hawaii," scoffed Iong, whose company, Sushi Chef, is a major wholesaler and 
retailer. "Let's make room in these regulations for some common sense."

BOSNIAN SERBS RENEGE ON HOSTAGE DEAL, SEIZE 2 MORE PEACEKEEPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the U.N. Protection Force bowed to Bosnian Serb demands for a substitute 
hostage as the price for freeing a gravely ill Jordanian peacekeeper, mission 
officials sacrificed principle for what they described Tuesday as overriding 
humanitarian aims. 
</P>
<P>
 But as has increasingly been the case when the U.N. forces here have tried to 
appease gunmen who bargain with human lives, humiliating capitulation 
backfired, bringing more humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs grabbed a Spanish captain delivered to Banja Luka on Monday as a 
substitute hostage for the sick officer, as well as a Czech major assigned to 
handle the hostage trade. The bedridden Jordanian army major with a congenital 
heart disease would not be released, the U.N. hierarchy here was informed, 
unless senior U.N. officers negotiated directly with the Banja Luka Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely outrageous," U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said of the botched 
exchange, which left five U.N. officers imprisoned at the airfield in Banja 
Luka, instead of the original three. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolute protests from the U.N. force commander were fired off through fax 
machines to Bosnian Serb headquarters in the Sarajevo mountain suburb of Pale, 
condemning in "the strongest possible terms this blatant, inhumane act of 
imprisoning and denying medical attention to an unarmed military observer," 
said the mission's chief of communications, Michael Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb Gen. Milan Gvero, chief of staff in the rebel army, responded 
that there was nothing headquarters could do. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanian took a turn for the worse late Tuesday, U.N. spokesman Alex 
Ivanko reported, expressing fears that the officer would not long survive 
captivity in which he was being denied food and needed assistance to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest act of Serbian defiance underscored the thorough collapse of U.N. 
authority in the Balkan conflict and added momentum to the groundswell of 
pressures for an end to the disastrous peacekeeping mission in which hundreds 
of other U.N. troops are in Serbian captivity, thousands are blocked and cut 
off from supplies, aid deliveries have been routinely thwarted and the only 
course more dangerous than staying in Bosnia-Herzegovina might be that of 
trying to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials concede privately that their position has become untenable in 
Bosnia, where 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers are prevented from carrying out any of 
the humanitarian and security work for which they were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,200 Bangladeshi soldiers are trapped in the embattled Bihac pocket 
in northwest Bosnia. They are confined to quarters with no heat, suffering 
shortages of food and winter coats, sharing scarce sleeping bags and having to 
defend themselves with only one gun for every four soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty Canadian soldiers who had been guarding weapons collection sites have 
been jailed by their Serbian captors in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilijas, where 
they have been denied regular food and communication with their commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, in the purportedly U.N.-protected "safe area" of Gorazde, Bosnian 
Serb gunmen subjected a U.N. patrol to a three-hour artillery barrage inside an 
area that had been proclaimed a weapons-exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian commanders also denied permission for all 32 supply convoys requested 
Tuesday for U.N. troops scattered throughout Bosnia, although the first 
delivery of relief goods to starving Muslims in the besieged Srebrenica safe 
area was allowed through a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrival of the desperately needed food cache set off fierce fighting among the 
40,000 residents and refugees of Srebrenica, said Peter Kessler, spokesman for 
the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent outbreak of provocations against the lightly armed peacekeeping 
force has whipped up a frenzied debate in countries that contribute troops over 
whether the stymied and vulnerable U.N. forces, known as UNPROFOR, should be 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "UNPROFOR is at the end of its tether," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
told European ministers at a security conference in Budapest, Hungary, warning 
that France is likely to withdraw its troops unless there is significant 
progress toward a negotiated solution to the conflict within the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Juppe also cautioned the newly hawkish U.S. Congress against resuming talk of 
breaching a U.N. arms embargo that has been hampering the defenses of the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government. He said France is positioning itself to withdraw 
in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 British officials likewise appeared to be laying the groundwork for a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to look at the overall picture and recognize there are major problems 
of delivering aid," British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind said after 
discussions here with top officials at U.N. headquarters. "If that continues, 
it would render UNPROFOR's task impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkind declined to say whether he would recommend a British retreat, noting 
that he needed to discuss the situation with government leaders in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb attacks on the Bihac enclave continued Tuesday, according to U.N. 
spokesmen.

MEXICO'S ZEDILLO OFFERS TO SHARE POWER; POLITICS: FIVE DAYS IN OFFICE, THE 
PRESIDENT REACHES OUT TO CONGRESS IN SHARP BREAK WITH TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breaking with seven decades of authoritarian rule, President Ernesto Zedillo 
formally dined with 500 elected members of Congress on Tuesday and offered what 
no Mexican president before him ever has: to share the monolithic power of 
Mexico's chief of state. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's unprecedented luncheon at Mexico's Chamber of Deputies, billed by 
independent analysts as a cornerstone of Zedillo's proposed new era of 
democracy, the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist dramatically and decisively 
shed the traditional arrogance and aloofness of the Mexican presidency just 
five days after taking office. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo was criticized, questioned, challenged and praised as he sat, riveted 
at his lunch table, through eight consecutive speeches -- six of them stern 
lectures from opposition lawmakers -- in what historians said was the first 
direct dialogue between the country's president and its congress in 65 years of 
continuous rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than an hour, legislators blasted Zedillo's party, known as the PRI, 
for abusing and monopolizing power and widening the gap between Mexico's rich 
and poor. They appealed to the reformist new president to formulate solutions 
to an array of national crises -- from endemic illiteracy, poverty, injustice 
and crime to a threatened insurgency in the southernmost state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crisis continued to build in Chiapas, and thousands of Indians and 
peasants arrived in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez for massive 
demonstrations for and against the inauguration of a PRI governor scheduled for 
Thursday, legislators from the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party 
charged that the smoldering rebellion in Chiapas is the result of years of rule 
by the privileged over the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommander Marcos, a rebel spokesman, said late Tuesday that his group will 
consider a cease-fire with the government broken if the PRI candidate is sworn 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels and the opposition party say the PRI stole the governor's race in 
August through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 To the applause of all 500 deputies, many standing and shouting approval, 
Zedillo brought a clear end to the tradition of his 11 PRI predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 They had shunned a succession of legislatures and ruled with unchallenged 
authority, reporting only once a year in state-of-the-nation speeches to 
deputies whose power rested only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zedillo declared firmly: "I have decided that the power of the presidency 
cannot and should not be an omnipotent power, an omniscient power, nor an 
omnipresent power." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo stressed the historic importance of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this act," he said of the luncheon, "we start a new, different 
relationship between the legislative and executive powers of this country. . . 
. I have the conviction that we all share the commitment to forge a new balance 
of powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo then challenged the deputies to assert their constitutional 
legislative authority as never before, inviting them to stand watch over his 
presidency, reform the nation's electoral system and help solve conflicts such 
as the one in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 He also used the occasion to appeal for the legislators -- 300 representatives 
of the PRI and 200 from three major opposition parties -- to approve a 
revolutionary judicial reform package that he unveiled in a nationally 
televised speech late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The judicial reforms, rooted in constitutional amendments that must be 
approved by both houses of Congress, are aimed at rooting out the official 
corruption and inefficiency that saturate the nation's police and lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo said his proposals for a major overhaul of the police, independent 
vetting of judges and a powerful special prosecutor's office to respond to 
citizens' complaints of corruption are critical building blocks for a "new rule 
of law" at a time of national insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the reform plan and Zedillo's historic meeting with the legislature met 
with rave reviews from intellectual and opposition circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernesto Zedillo is a man in a hurry," declared prominent Mexico City 
columnist Sergio Sarmiento under a quotation from Aristotle -- "The man 
separated from law and justice is the poorest of animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in the often irreverent daily newspaper Reforma, Sarmiento praised the 
president for presenting urgent, concrete proposals on so complex and 
fundamental a problem as the judicial system before meeting Congress, because 
"the reform is seeking to give congress major responsibility in this process."

U.S. PUSHES U.N. FOR FASTER HANDOFF IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has begun pressuring the United Nations to allow 
U.S. forces in Haiti to turn over their peacekeeping responsibilities to U.N. 
troops in January or February, rather than after Haitian elections later next 
year, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. strategists met privately in Washington with senior U.N. officials 
earlier this week to begin mapping plans for transferring the peacekeeping 
mission to a 6,000-soldier multinational force, as provided for in the 
long-range U.S.-U.N. plan for the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a team of three senior U.S. policy-makers, headed by Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, spent the day in Port-au-Prince reviewing 
the security situation with U.S. military commanders and conferring with 
Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensified U.S. push comes in the face of growing congressional pressure 
-- particularly from House and Senate Republicans, who will be in control of 
Congress starting in January -- for a more rapid U.S. withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the incoming Senate majority leader, has called for a 
faster withdrawal of American troops, and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who is 
likely to chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has issued similar 
demands. Some officials are fearful that lawmakers may balk at keeping U.S. 
troops in Haiti very long. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of elections had been regarded as critical to any transfer of power 
to the United Nations. Those elections were originally planned for this month, 
but Aristide pushed them into next year -- possibly as late as midsummer. U.N. 
officials subsequently asked for a similar delay in the troop turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been pressing the Aristide government to conduct the 
elections in February or March and pushing the United Nations to take over the 
peacekeeping operation before the elections. Security in Haiti is good enough 
now that the transfer can take place ahead of the balloting, in the 
Administration's view. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides already have begun a gradual transfer of power. U.S. officials 
said that an advance party of the U.N. peacekeeping force, about 500 
multinational troops, is scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Pentagon announced Tuesday that it will begin rotating units of the 
10th Mountain Division from Haiti later this month, replacing them with 3,500 
soldiers of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, who are to become part of 
the new U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States now has 6,852 ground troops in Haiti, down from a peak of 
more than 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and United Nations have agreed to assemble a multinational 
force of about 6,000 troops to replace the current U.S.-run mission. The United 
Nations wants about half the troops to be Americans, while the United States 
has been trying to limit its share to one-third. A U.S. Army officer, Gen. Hugh 
Shelton, has been designated commander of the U.N. force.

 The guerrillas who steadfastly held together through 12 years of civil war 
against powerful U.S.-backed forces, then in peace became this country's 
leading opposition politicians, formally split Tuesday, leaving the 
once-formidable left here in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Riven by bitter differences over direction and philosophy, the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front (FMLN) divided into at least two groups with the 
withdrawal of one of its principal factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FMLN was an instrument created to make war," said Joaquin Villalobos, 
leader of the faction that abandoned the FMLN. "In the current conditions, the 
Front no longer has political viability as an electoral instrument and should 
pass into national history." 
</P>
<P>
 The split, announced by Villalobos, follows months of acrimonious debate over 
the role of the FMLN as an opposition party in the post-Cold War era. It echoes 
a crisis experienced by the left throughout Latin America, where onetime 
guerrilla armies are struggling to come to terms with the demise of their 
Soviet Bloc sponsors and the challenge of operating under the democratic rules 
of civilian politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The fracturing of the Salvadoran left drastically weakens any political 
opposition to the conservative government of President Armando Calderon Sol, 
giving it free rein as its own extreme right wing battles for more power. 
</P>
<P>
 It also leaves unprotected the U.N.-brokered peace accords that ended the war 
two years ago and promised wide-ranging political and judicial reforms, many of 
which are still incomplete. With the opposition largely impotent, and the 
international community losing interest -- the U.N. mission closes in four 
months -- there is no one to see that the accords are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN was formed in the late 1970s at the behest of Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro, who recommended that the five leftist guerrilla factions fighting the 
right-wing, army-dominated Salvadoran government join forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the factions maintained its own identity throughout the war and 
controlled distinct territory. But they presented a united front in military 
strategy, bedeviling the better-equipped, better-financed Salvadoran government 
forces, who had the backing of billions of American dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN fought the U.S.-trained forces to a standstill by 1991, a situation 
that forced the two sides into U.N.-sponsored negotiations that ended the war. 
The FMLN agreed to disarm and become a legal political party in exchange for 
broad reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The faction that announced its withdrawal from the FMLN on Tuesday was not the 
largest but was considered the strongest militarily. Its leader, Villalobos, 
was credited with devising the FMLN's most successful military strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the war's end, Villalobos has moved most swiftly toward the center, 
reanointing his faction as a social democratic party and often entering into 
political compromises with the right. He argues that he is modernizing his 
party and making it a workable organization in light of the reality now. 
</P>
<P>
 Other FMLN factions, however, say Villalobos is a sellout and an opportunist. 
They argue that they are fighting for many of the original goals of the 
guerrilla movement, such as better conditions for the poor, that Villalobos and 
his associates have long abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 El Salvador's left was further forced into self-analysis after its 
overwhelming loss in presidential and legislative elections earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections marked the first participation of the left, and, while the right 
scored major victories, FMLN candidates won several seats in the legislative 
assembly and in city halls. 
</P>
<P>
 With the formal rupture of the FMLN, however, it seems doubtful that the left 
can act as a unified bloc in the legislature.

U.S. WON'T PRESSURE ISRAEL TO PULL OUT OF WEST BANK; MIDEAST: JEWISH STATE IS 
BALKING AT TROOP WITHDRAWAL AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS. CHRISTOPHER'S COMMENTS ARE 
SEEN AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF RABIN.

<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, giving Israeli negotiators maximum room 
to maneuver, said Tuesday that Israel cannot be required to keep its commitment 
to withdraw its West Bank occupation force until a spate of terrorist incidents 
is brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The security pledges are absolutely fundamental to the process going 
forward," he said as he arrived in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is security, it is clear that the other commitments cannot be 
met," Christopher said. ". . . The fundamental bedrock of these agreements . . 
. is security for the parties, and without that security, it's clear to me that 
the agreements cannot properly go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In the peace agreement signed in May by Rabin and Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, Israel pledged to pull its troops from 
Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank before elections are held to 
choose members of the Palestinian self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the elections, but Israeli officials have begun to 
hint that Israel might not keep its agreement to redeploy its army because of 
growing security concerns resulting from a suicide bus bombing in Tel Aviv; a 
bloody battle between the PLO-sponsored Palestinian police and radical Islamic 
fundamentalists in Gaza, and other terrorist incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's comments seemed to be intended as an endorsement of whatever 
course the Israelis might choose. Washington has exhorted Israel and the PLO to 
adhere to the agreements signed on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher made it clear that the United States will not attempt to 
pressure Israel to withdraw its troops until it is ready to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, Israeli and PLO negotiators began a new round of talks on details 
for the election and for Israeli troop redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials argued that Israel must pull out its troops on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, PLO chief negotiator, said any change in Israeli withdrawal 
plans will constitute a violation of the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that stops the peace process worries me very much, and this peace 
process is very clear. It has a time schedule, and anybody who wants to change 
that will be violating the agreement," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin told reporters Monday that Israel intends to negotiate separately on 
each phase of the peace plan and will go ahead only when its security concerns 
are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Israel will apply lessons learned in the Gaza Strip to the West Bank. 
The Gaza Strip has been under Palestinian control for almost a year, and Israel 
claims that the Palestinian Authority has been unable to keep order there. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher flew to Israel after meeting for 4 1/2 hours in Damascus with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad. Christopher described the talks as "serious and 
detailed," and other U.S. officials said they produced tiny but perceptible 
progress toward an Israel-Syria peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials in both Syria and Israel have complained recently that their 
talks, conducted through U.S. mediators, are near a dead end. Each side accused 
the other of making unreasonable demands. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official dismissed the comments as "public posturing" but said 
each side was trying to send a clear signal that it was unable to agree to the 
demands of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint news conference with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over the 
weekend, Assad said Syria prefers the status quo to the peace that Israel has 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently reacting to that comment, Christopher said: "We must continue to 
move forward. There is no going back. To accept the status quo would . . . miss 
a historic opportunity to achieve peace with security -- an opportunity that is 
not likely to come again." 
</P>
<P>
 One senior U.S. official said Christopher decided to visit the Middle East 
this week because he was nearby attending a European security conference in 
Budapest, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 The official indicated that the talks with Assad and Rabin were intended to 
keep the negotiations going but that no breakthroughs were expected -- or 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The original schedule called for Christopher to return to Damascus on Thursday 
to report on his talks in Israel. But that stop has been canceled, allowing him 
to return to the United States on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher meets with Rabin this morning, then heads to Gaza for talks with 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials hope the visit will bolster Arafat's sagging authority in the 
Palestinian-controlled territory, although one senior official conceded that 
most Palestinians who have soured on Arafat's leadership are unlikely to be 
persuaded by anything the Americans do.

 Iran tried to intervene in the selection of the supreme head of the world's 
100 million Shiite Muslims by naming its own spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei, 55, to the post. The announcement was a break with the tradition of 
letting theologians choose the Shiite leader and an attempt by Iran's 
theocratic government to promote its militant version of Islam abroad.

 Ireland headed for early general elections when the Labor Party broke off 
talks on rebuilding a coalition with Fianna Fail in a fresh dispute over a 
child-abuse case that toppled their government. Labor leader Dick Spring told 
Parliament that his party is ready to fight in elections if attempts to form an 
alternative coalition fail. Spring, who holds the balance of power in the 
165-seat lower house, said he was pulling out because Fianna Fail misled him 
about the bungled government handling of extradition warrants for a pedophile 
priest.

THE SPEAKERSHIP BATTLE; BOTH PARTIES LOOK AT WAYS TO END IMPASSE; LEGISLATURE: 
SHUTTING DOWN THE ASSEMBLY WOULD BE ONE OPTION, BUT UNLIKELY. MORE PROBABLE IS

PARTY DEFECTIONS.

 Here's a scenario to warm the coldest anti-government heart: 
</P>
<P>
 The California Assembly, tied in a partisan knot pulled tighter every day, 
shuts down for much of 1995 while Republicans and Democrats struggle to find 
the 41st vote needed to take control in the 80-member house. 
</P>
<P>
 No Speaker. No committees. No business. Across the Capitol, the Senate drones 
on in its ornate, crimson-draped chamber. But any bill the Senate passes 
disappears into a legislative abyss because the lower house has sunk so low it 
cannot even gavel itself into operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may just be without a Legislature," said Tony Quinn, a former Assembly 
Republican staff member and something of a legislative historian. "That 
probably wouldn't bother the people that much." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the Assembly grinding to a halt -- while perhaps devilishly 
delicious -- probably is the most unlikely of a handful of outcomes. But the 
fact that such a scenario is even possible shows just how nutty the scene in 
Sacramento has become this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans thought the 41-seat majority they won on Election Day would hand 
them control of the Assembly for the first time in a quarter of a century. But 
one of their own -- Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar -- bolted across the aisle 
Monday to support Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. Now both sides have 
40 votes and are hunkered down in a political staring match. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have vowed to push for a recall of Horcher, replace him with a 
loyalist and regain their narrow partisan margin. That could take months, 
however, leaving the Assembly paralyzed all the while because state law 
requires that the house elect a Speaker before moving on to any other business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, several other scenarios could unfold, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats secure another Republican dissident, take a 41-39 advantage and 
elect Brown to his eighth term as Assembly Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans persuade one or more conservative Democrats to leave their party 
and elect GOP Leader Jim Brulte to lead the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * The two sides remain deadlocked until Republican Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia 
-- who was elected simultaneously Nov. 8 to the Assembly and Senate -- resigns 
to join the upper house, leaving Democrats with a 40-39 majority. 
</P>
<P>
 * A compromise candidate emerges from one party or the other to lead a 
bipartisan coalition -- the way Brown did when he was elected Speaker in 1980 
despite being opposed by a majority of the members of his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, who wins the top job may be less important than how he or she does 
so, because the road to victory will tell much about the way the Assembly will 
operate during the 1995-96 session. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing seems certain: The eventual winner, even if it is Brown, will not 
wield anywhere near the same kind of power that Brown has enjoyed for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever is elected Speaker is going to have to develop some allies in the 
other party," said Bruce Cain, a professor of government at UC Berkeley. 
"That's not a bad thing for California." 
</P>
<P>
 While both sides continued to search for the elusive convert who could break 
the deadlock, Democrats -- facing minority party status for the first time 
since 1969 -- seemed more eager than Republicans to talk about a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has 41 votes," said Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg, a Sacramento 
Democrat. "Neither side can control the house, and it's obvious if we cared 
about the public's business we ought to sit down and have a conversation about 
what should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to have some kind of power-sharing arrangement, some 
understanding that neither side is going to control the house in the 
old-fashioned way." 
</P>
<P>
 The old-fashioned way means the Speaker -- by dominating the Assembly Rules 
Committee -- decides who sits on which policy committees and which bills go 
where for hearings. He can send a bill he does not like to an unfriendly 
committee or even change the composition of a panel on a whim to affect the 
outcome of a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker also distributes staff and money to the members, assigns office 
space and makes a handful of juicy patronage appointments to high-paying state 
boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg, who is close to Brown but remains a bit of a maverick, suggested yet 
another scenario: splitting the spoils down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a virtually equal division of staff, money, responsibility, 
chairs, positions, everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, reply the Republicans. They still have designs on taking over, 
thank you, and are not about to start giving away the power they worked so hard 
to win, even as they acknowledge that they lack the muscle to duplicate Brown's 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question things are going to have to change," said Assemblyman 
Curt Pringle of Garden Grove, a member of the Republican leadership circle and 
a potential future Speaker himself. "I don't believe any Speaker will have the 
powers Willie held. We are certainly going to have to ensure that there are 
Republicans and Democrats working together." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pringle said Republicans are still confident of taking control of the 
lower house -- presumably by winning a recall election to oust Horcher. He said 
his colleagues are not interested in a power-sharing arrangement of the kind 
recently brokered in Michigan, where the House elected co-speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle said he would not trust Brown, the Assembly's senior member, to share 
power equitably. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, the former Assembly aide, worked for the last Republican Speaker -- 
Robert Monagan -- who ran the house with a 41-39 majority. He said Republicans 
would be foolish to agree to share power with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a bipartisan speakership, Willie would end up picking the Republicans' 
pockets," Quinn said. "If this thing goes as a train with a co-speaker, it will 
not have two engines. It will have one engine and a caboose. (Brown) will be in 
the engine and the Republicans will be in the caboose."

THE SPEAKERSHIP BATTLE; HORCHER'S GOP CONSTITUENTS OUTRAGED AT HIS VOTE FOR 
BROWN

 Benedict Arnold, Judas and Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Betrayal was the operative sentiment Tuesday around Horcher's 60th District in 
the East San Gabriel Valley, especially among Republicans. They called it 
treachery for the man they reelected in November to renounce the party and back 
longtime Democratic Speaker Willie Brown, a political Antichrist for many 
voters here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horcher is a traitor," said Joe Edwards, a former supporter who took a break 
from shopping at The Plaza at West Covina to vent his anger. "I wanted Willie 
Brown out of there and then he votes for him. I feel very much betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy J. Vrieling, chairman of the local Republican Central Committee, said 
he has begun organizing a recall drive against Horcher, who declared himself an 
independent Monday after casting a decisive vote to block the seating of a 
Republican Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major slap in the face to Republicans," Vrieling said. "The Republican 
Party is what put him in office." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, a 43-year-old lawyer, has cast himself as a maverick for several 
years, but his dramatic switch on the first day of the Assembly session in 
Sacramento marked a new role. Despite winning reelection Nov. 8 with 61% of the 
vote, his political future in the conservative district -- including the 
communities of Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, West Covina and portions of 
Pomona and Whittier -- now seems virtually comatose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horcher seems to have done it in a way that definitely burns his bridges with 
his Republican Party," said political scientist Alan Heslop, a professor at 
Claremont McKenna College. "And he has no roots in the Democratic Party 
locally. Mr. Horcher has put an end to any political future that he might have 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 While Horcher cited the rightward tilt of the Assembly Republicans for his 
jump, his suburban district is comfortable in its conservatism. Voters there 
sided strongly with Republican Mike Huffington over Sen. Dianne Feinstein last 
month, and endorsed the reelection of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 the voters bucked the Democratic tide and went for George Bush over 
Bill Clinton, while showing a strong independent streak -- 20% cast votes for 
maverick Ross Perot. Ronald Reagan did well there. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, authorities in Horcher's hometown of Diamond Bar say they are on alert 
after the assemblyman reportedly received death threats at his Sacramento 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is trustworthy -- nothing is from the heart in politics anymore," 
said Sam Longoria, a West Covina resident who voted for Perot in the last 
presidential election. "They'll tell you one thing one moment and do another 
the next. Politicians like Horcher aren't responsive to the people who elected 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Kramer, a Republican from West Covina, said he felt the betrayal deeply. 
"I am depressed and very upset," he said. "I think he's done a very immoral 
thing and I hope he gets what's coming to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democrats were far from unanimous in their reaction to Horcher's 
renunciation of his GOP roots. "I say good for him. I'm sure he did what he 
thought was right for his constituents," said Mary Albeen, a Democrat from 
Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet supporters of Democrat Andrew Ramirez, who ran against Horcher in the Nov. 
8 election, said they feel their own betrayal because their candidate was 
spurned by Brown. Ramirez appealed in vain for financial help from the 
Assembly's Democratic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie ignored him and paid attention to Paul (Horcher)," said Rickie 
Santell, a state Democratic Party board member. "I'm sickened by the process 
that allowed this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, a moderate who favors abortion rights and has aligned himself with 
the traditionally Democratic California Trial Lawyers Assn., is a 
battle-scarred veteran of political infighting in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the City Council in Diamond Bar in 1989, the year the city 
incorporated. Within months, council members voted to strip Horcher of his 
largely ceremonial title of mayor pro tem after he accused a councilman of 
conflict of interest. Horcher spent more than $300,000 of his own money to win 
a narrow victory in the 1990 primary over seven Republican rivals for the 
Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September he mounted a challenge in a special election for an open seat 
in the state Senate, running with the aid of Democratic groups. Despite the 
assistance, Horcher finished a distant third behind Assemblyman Richard 
Mountjoy of Arcadia and Diamond Bar Councilman Gary G. Miller, a wealthy 
Republican businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 During that campaign, Horcher sent out a mailer that chided the conservative 
Mountjoy for voting to make Brown the Speaker in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Horcher has never voted to make Willie Brown speaker," the mailer 
bragged. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should resign," Miller said Tuesday. "He misrepresented himself to the 
people. The man has flat smashed a Republican dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Daniels-Meade, spokeswoman for the secretary of state, said recall 
elections aimed at state officeholders have been held only four times in 
California history and have succeeded only twice. The last recall election was 
in April, when proponents failed to oust state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys).

 Horcher, in a statement read Monday, said his new status as an independent 
would benefit his district, but local leaders did not all see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fearful this would happen," said Dr. Forest Tennant, a prominent 
Republican and former mayor of West Covina. "Paul Horcher will no longer be 
able to represent his district adequately because any bill he carries or takes 
a lead on will be despised by people of both parties. I'm saddened, because 
this is not going to help the San Gabriel Valley."

 Assemblyman Paul Horcher's district in the San Gabriel Valley is evenly split 
between Republicans and Democrats, but it votes conservatively and 
independently -- not the kind of place where his support for longtime Speaker 
Willie Brown will win him friends. The district favored George Bush over Bill 
Clinton in 1992, but 20% voted for Ross Perot.

THE SPEAKERSHIP BATTLE; ASSEMBLY BATTLE PUTS CHIEF CLERK IN TOUGH SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday, with all eyes on him as he ruled from the podium on arcane points 
of parliamentary procedure, obscure legislative aide E. Dotson Wilson commanded 
center stage in the dramatic speakership fight unfolding on the state Assembly 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wilson was home recuperating from his unaccustomed fame, after a 
detour to a hospital where he was admitted reportedly suffering from the stress 
of his day in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief Assembly clerk, the well-paid but seldom noticed Wilson, 42, was 
supposed to have presided over a purely ceremonial moment, the one day in any 
normal legislative year when the lower house chamber is briefly without a 
Speaker while the membership meets to elect one. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the selection process blew up into a fierce, unresolved partisan 
battle, Wilson's moment turned into a long, bruising day of verbal blasts from 
Democrats and Republicans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly trying to do no more than keep the riled up Assembly members on the 
parliamentary straight and narrow, Wilson appeared nervous as he absorbed 
relentless criticism, including a stinging attack from the man he owes he job 
to -- former Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Brown was unhappy with 
some of Wilson's procedural rulings because they worked in favor of the 
Republicans, who were trying to prevent Brown from forming the majority he 
needed for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Tuesday news conference, Brown declared that Wilson made "horrible 
rulings that ruined my day" and "frankly made no sense at all." At another 
point, however, when asked if he still supported Wilson as chief clerk, Brown 
replied, "Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was Brown's hand-picked choice for the $105,840-a-year chief clerk job, 
which Wilson assumed in 1992, becoming one of the five most highly paid 
legislative staffers in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon Brown's nomination, Wilson was elected chief clerk by the full Assembly 
on a 43-15 party-line vote with Republicans voting no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lobbied my membership, got the votes and got Mr. Wilson installed, over the 
objections of the Republican caucus, who yesterday received the benefits of Mr. 
Wilson's rulings," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he has not spoken to Wilson personally and said he did not ask 
him to remain at home on Tuesday -- which some suspected was a ploy to allow 
Brown to preside over Tuesday's Assembly session. 
</P>
<P>
 A press spokesman for the Republicans, Phil Perry, said Wilson performed 
admirably. "He made fair rulings," Perry said, "but he didn't follow the script 
that Willie and the Democrats wrote for him."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; TROUBLED ORANGE COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL INCLUDES 
PUBLIC FUNDS FROM THROUGHOUT STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problems with Orange County's investment fund are being closely watched 
far beyond the county's borders -- in Claremont, Montebello, Santa Barbara and 
even some cities in Northern California that have invested money in the 
troubled fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good investment a year ago," Santa Barbara finance director John 
Paul said Tuesday of the fund, whose $1.5 billion in paper losses this year 
have triggered a financial and political crisis."Everybody was killing to get 
into it. Now it's let's string 'em up by the thumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bulk of investors are cities and other government agencies in 
Orange County, others with public money in the pool include Atascadero, 
Mountain View and Milpitas. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts in Los Angeles County invested $45 million in self-insurance 
funds in the pool. Montebello has about $46 million invested -- the majority of 
its investment portfolio. Santa Barbara has about $26 million, or about 25% of 
its portfolio, in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can work it out to where everybody stays in and we just suck it up 
for a couple of years, we're probably fine," said Paul, expressing the attitude 
that Orange County officials have hoped will prevail among investors. Indeed, 
several municipal finance officers said what they feared most was a "run on the 
bank" -- a development that should be averted by the county's filing for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stark, treasurer of Claremont, said Orange County officials acted 
"prudently" by hiring investment specialists to deal with the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul said Santa Barbara has the reserves to cover any losses from its 
investment. "If we had to take major losses, we wouldn't have any cuts in 
services," he said. "But, of course, any loss is a loss. So it would require us 
to eat into our reserves."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY: Q & A; RAMIFICATIONS OF A CHAPTER 9 BANKRUPTCY 
FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's bankruptcy filing raises questions about what effect it will 
have on basic government services such as police and fire protection, on county 
employees' paychecks and on whether property owners should pay their property 
taxes due Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago lawyer James E. Spiotto, a partner in the firm of Chapman & Cutler, 
has handled several municipal bankruptcy filings and has testified before 
Congress regarding this type of bankruptcy. In an interview Tuesday, he 
explained the ramifications of the move: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is Chapter 9? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Chapter 9 lets a municipal government adjust and rearrange its debt, 
not eliminate it. It recognizes its inability with its current revenues to 
repay its debts over a reasonable period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will it affect the average Orange County resident or government 
employee? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For the average employee or creditor, any past-due wages or money owed 
would not be paid until after the filing of the bankruptcy reorganization plan, 
unless the court specifically orders otherwise. In addition, the only bond debt 
paid during the bankruptcy would be special revenue bonds, which are 
specifically defined in the bankruptcy code as special taxes dedicated to 
payment of revenue bonds. It would not include any bonds payable from general 
sales taxes, property taxes or income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do people who depend on their bonds for income have any recourse? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Any municipal debt has some market. The price of those bonds may 
significantly drop to the point they would be considered unattractive to sell. 
It's always important, not only for Orange County but for all municipalities, 
that people carefully assess the situation and find a quick and effective 
situation that maximizes value to all and provides the least amount of pain to 
the county, its citizens and its creditors. (Most California bond mutual funds 
are diversified, with potentially troubled Orange County bonds a small 
percentage of assets. Also, many of the bonds are insured.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will companies that do business with the county be paid? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Those who supply services to the county, for any obligation owed to them 
prior to the date of filing, that claim would be part of the bankruptcy. From 
the date of the petition and thereafter, those companies would be paid on a 
regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will police, fire or other emergency services be affected? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The county should be able to provide the same services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should I pay my property taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Even though a county files for bankruptcy protection, it still has the 
right to receive payment of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many cities, counties or districts have filed for Chapter 9? 
</P>
<P>
 A: From 1937 to 1993, there have been 475. By and large, these have been small 
special tax districts or small municipalities. For example, between 1937 and 
1972, there were 362 municipalities involving $217 million worth of debt. They 
paid back over $140 million of that debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the largest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The largest since the Great Depression was the city of Bridgeport, Conn., 
in 1991, which was dismissed by the Bankruptcy Court because it was found not 
to be insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So Orange County becomes the largest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Bridgeport had over $200 million in bond debt and 150,000 population. 
Orange County is obviously larger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can the court deny Orange County's bankruptcy petition? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There may be motions to dismiss filed for a number of reasons. They may 
question whether the municipality is insolvent. They may question, like in the 
Bridgeport case, whether the county has specific authority under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will county employees be paid on time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Going forward from the time the county filed, they will be paid. But any 
wages owed prior to the date of filing would remain unpaid until the Plan of 
Adjustment (as the bankruptcy reorganization plan is known). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long does it usually take for filing of the Plan of Adjustment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is subject to negotiation between the government and its creditors. It 
is usually measured by months, instead of days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do the largest creditors receive priority? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The largest priority claims will be paid during the course of the 
bankruptcy. The government reserves control over its revenue, property and 
political affairs and operations. The largest creditors will be paid based on 
priority, same as the people in their class. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of ill effects are caused by a bankruptcy filing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The biggest problem is the stigma of bankruptcy in the bond market, either 
because a municipality has to pay higher interest rates or because it cannot 
obtain any credit in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long does that stigma last? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It depends on how people perceive the problem. If people are afraid that 
this could be a serious problem, they may ask for higher interest rates or not 
participate in a future debt offering, making it so it can't proceed. That's 
why in many troubled municipal situations, you have a refinancing authority or 
an oversight committee or state agency which may guarantee or provide an 
additional source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do those oversight boards work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Usually by state legislation to provide additional credit reporting and 
guidance to a municipality in a (debt) work-out situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why have so few local governments ever filed for bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The market still looks to the credit-worthiness and believability of that 
issuer. And municipalities have been always worried about the stigma of 
bankruptcy, the cost of bankruptcy in the future, high interest-rate charges or 
the lack of ability to borrow.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BANKRUPTCY FLING; BRIDGEPORT TRIED FOR CHAPTER 9 
HELP, BUT JUDGE DIDN'T BUY IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest U.S. city to enter federal bankruptcy court in recent years is 
Bridgeport, Conn., which tried to declare bankruptcy in June, 1991. But the 
petition was thrown out by a judge, who said the city was not really insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 The severe inner-city problems that led to the Bridgeport filing have few 
similarities to the sudden fiscal mess in Orange County, which is one of 
California's wealthiest regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridgeport's then-mayor, Mary Moran, faced with a $12-million budget deficit, 
crumbling infrastructure and a declining tax base, tried to have the city 
declared bankrupt over the strong objections of a Connecticut state panel 
appointed to oversee the city's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was viewed as a desperate attempt to publicize the woes of a decaying 
city in the midst of a prosperous, heavily suburban state. 
</P>
<P>
 The state strongly opposed Bridgeport's bankruptcy filing in court. A 
bankruptcy judge dismissed the petition, ruling that the city had enough cash 
on hand to meet its obligations. Bridgeport appealed, but the matter was 
dropped in January, 1992, after Moran lost a bid for reelection and the new 
mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, withdrew the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the brief fling with bankruptcy had consequences for the city. 
Ratings agencies such as Moody's Investors Service immediately suspended 
ratings of the city's bonds, which had had very poor ratings to begin with. 
Ratings soon were reinstated, but were upgraded only slightly after the city 
withdrew its attempts to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 From the standpoint of ratings, and the respect of the nation's financial 
community, Orange County -- and the state -- have far more to lose. The county 
has long enjoyed very high investment-grade ratings on its debt. Municipal 
finance experts say a successful bankruptcy filing, on top of the unexpected 
crisis involving the county's investment fund, could leave investors with a 
sense of mistrust that might linger for years. Other California cities, 
counties and the state could be harmed as investors conclude that the state is 
not prepared to bail out cities and counties that run into financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy experts say that, ironically, a petition by Orange County would 
have a much greater chance of being upheld than the one by much poorer 
Bridgeport. That is because Orange County's problems stem from disastrous 
investments that have threatened a run on county funds and threaten the 
financial well-being of cities and agencies that invested in the funds. In 
addition, there is no indication so far that California state officials would 
oppose such a filing.

DANA PARSONS: ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FROM FISCAL WHIZ TO BOB WHO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wasn't it just two weeks ago that the clouds had parted over Orange County and 
bright sunshine had burst through? Wasn't someone just saying that a local 
economic recovery was in gear and that happy days were here again? 
</P>
<P>
 And now this? Now, we're told that one bookish, bespectacled career county 
treasurer has single-handedly triggered financial chaos? That the man who 
always wanted to be known as "Bob" on the tax bills he mailed out has brought 
us the apocalypse just in time for Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise in this recall-nutty climate that the Board of Supervisors is 
getting the word out pronto that it is not, repeat not , responsible for 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's investments. Make that "former" 
treasurer-tax collector, after Citron's resignation this week. But the point is 
that the board never has felt the need to separate itself from Citron before. 
True, the treasurer-tax collector is elected and not beholden to the 
supervisors, but they loved to mention his name during those years when he was 
raking in big money for local municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's "Bob Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Who has done something you wouldn't think possible. He has the country 
talking about rock-ribbed conservative Orange County as the equivalent of a 
municipal casino. County governments all over the country invest their funds, 
but none of them makes the national news. None of them has a normally 
circumspect U.S. congressman like Christopher Cox telling a TV audience that 
the county might declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you be recovering and bankrupt at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens who don't know the bond market from a flea market are no doubt 
shocked to learn that one man had this much financial responsibility. At a time 
of public mistrust of government, in general, this story lands with the same 
kind of thud that accompanied the collapse a few years ago of so many of the 
nation's savings and loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's resignation has a weird historical symmetry to it. He was the 
county's tax collector in 1973 when the Board of Supervisors decided to merge 
that office with that of treasurer. Despite the then-treasurer's urging that 
the job be given to his assistant, the supervisors gave it to Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 One demurring supervisor questioned whether Citron had enough investment 
experience to handle the task of managing what then was a nearly $1-billion 
portfolio. Supervisor David Baker noted that "one unwise investment" could have 
disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent elections, however, Democrat Citron became as entrenched as the 
Republican officeholders who surrounded him. His personal quirkiness seemed an 
amusing counterpoint to the serious job he had of minding the store for the 
dozens of public entities who turned over their money to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent out tax bills with poetry attached, such as "Taxes paid on time never 
draw fines." One year, he sponsored a poetry contest for taxpayers and awarded 
$10 to a woman from San Clemente who suggested, "Isn't it worth a little bounty 
to live in Orange County?" 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't to suggest Citron was all fluff. Over the years, he was hailed 
for his investment acumen. He also played against form as the quiet bookkeeper, 
occasionally willing to challenge popular causes or officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of overwhelming public support, he vocally opposed Proposition 13 
in 1978 for its potential revenue impact on governments, particularly school 
districts. He said its passage would bring "anarchy" to schools and government. 
His opposition never hurt him at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the man who occasionally wrote long letters to the editor at the 
newspaper remains silent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ultimate irony, the public is left to speculate about Citron's 
speculating. Did he get caught up in the frenzied Wall Street game that has 
proved so alluringly fatal to so many others? Was he trying too hard to find 
revenues for those public entities he felt were strapped for funds? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it pure bad judgment that brought him crashing down? Or, perhaps, foolish 
pride? 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, was he still trying 20 years later to prove he was the right 
man for the job?

CHRISTMAS ARRIVES EARLY FOR 3 DESTITUTE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Claus, aided by an outpouring of community support, made Tuesday a 
Christmas to remember for three excited youngsters who police had found dirty 
and hungry when they responded to a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers on Sunday found the destitute family of five living in a squalid 
house without electricity as the three children, ages 4, 3 and 23 months, 
shared a single taco, the only food in the house, said police spokesman Mike 
Halphen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at a room full of more than a hundred toys and clothes and candy, 
and it all started when the 4-year-old asked (an officer) if Santa would find 
them this year because last year he didn't," Halphen said. " . . . I wish 
everyone could have seen those little faces."

ROBERTI NAMED TO STATE JOBLESS INSURANCE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently retired state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) has been appointed 
by the Senate Rules Committee to a four-year term on the state Unemployment 
Insurance Appeals Board at an annual salary of $97,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee met in private Monday to make the appointment of the veteran 
lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who succeeded Roberti as Senate leader this 
year, said the vote was 4 to 0. Newly appointed committee member Sen. John 
Lewis (R-Orange) said he abstained because he did not have time to discuss the 
Roberti appointment with fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 It became known last week that Roberti was in line for appointment to the 
insurance panel, which hears appeals from workers who maintain that they were 
wrongfully denied unemployment benefits.

2 RADICAL FUGITIVES WANTED BY FBI SURRENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN and JOHN BECKHAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two radical fugitives accused of buying plastic explosives in a plot to help a 
Puerto Rican separatist leader escape from federal prison surrendered to FBI 
agents in Chicago on Tuesday after spending nine years living under disguised 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailed by lawyers and family members, Claude Daniel Marks, 45, and Donna Jean 
Willmott, 44, gave themselves up to FBI agents at federal offices in Chicago. 
They were handcuffed and taken to the Illinois Metro Correctional Center and 
later ordered held without bail by U.S. District Judge James D. Moran. 
</P>
<P>
 Once linked to the Weather Underground and other domestic terrorist groups, 
Marks and Willmott eked out uneventful lives in Pittsburgh, showing none of the 
outward trappings of their old militancy, according to their lawyers. They 
raised families and worked under assumed names. Marks, once described as an 
expert in martial arts and weapons, even coached a Little League baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "After nearly a decade, we have chosen to come forward in order to resolve our 
legal situation," Marks and Willmott said in a statement released by their 
lawyers. "First challenged to activism by the movements of the Sixties, both of 
us have spent all our adult lives working to change the injustices that are a 
part of the very fabric of society." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors and defense lawyers said the pair, who remained on the 
FBI's Ten Most-Wanted list for years after disappearing in Los Angeles in 1985, 
came forward under a tentative plea bargain worked out with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the pair would plead guilty to charges stemming from the 
aborted escape attempt, resulting in a maximum of 10 years in prison for Marks 
and a five-year term for Willmott, if approved in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks smiled and waved at family members as he entered a federal courtroom 
before the start of an afternoon bail hearing. A clean-shaven man in dark 
trousers and casual shoes, he had shed the furtive, bearded image that long 
adorned his wanted poster. Willmott, a short woman wearing white running shoes 
and a sweater, sat nearby, puffing on an inhaler to ease breathing difficulties 
caused by a lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks' lawyer, Michael Deutsch, said the fugitives decided to come forward 
because they had grown weary of living "this type of life that has a great 
uncertainty to it. You're always wondering if you're going to be arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Government lawyers and defense attorneys had been negotiating since last 
winter in a laborious process hampered by the fugitives' reluctance to deal 
directly with authorities who continued searching for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks and Willmott were indicted along with five other radicals in 1986 in an 
alleged conspiracy to free Oscar Lopez, a leader of the Puerto Rican separatist 
group FALN (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional) from the federal 
penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., where he is serving a 55-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks and Willmott were accused of conspiring to transport plastic explosives 
after buying 37 pounds of what they believed to be C-4 explosive material in 
Louisiana in 1985. But the explosives were inert and the salesman turned out to 
be an undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair drove to Los Angeles but fled in June, 1985, after discovering a 
listening device in their car, hidden there by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks and Willmott were married to others when they fled Los Angeles. Marks 
has a 9-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter; Willmott has a 4-year-old 
daughter. Their families became the key obstacle in talks leading to their 
surrender.

TONS OF PLUTONIUM ARE STORED UNSAFELY, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Energy Department is storing tons of plutonium in unsafe plastic 
containers and other packages, some of which are bulging from pressurized 
hydrogen gas that has accumulated as radioactive plutonium deteriorates, a 
senior department official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The containers, located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San 
Francisco and other sites across the nation, are at risk of bursting and 
contaminating workers with cancer-causing plutonium, Assistant Energy Secretary 
Tara O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy officials said Tuesday the agency has begun an immediate program to 
replace all of the suspect plastic containers within 12 months. Newly designed 
containers would be good for an estimated 50 years, by which time the agency 
hopes to find a permanent way to dispose of the plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 The containers -- which include ordinary food cans -- are part of a broad 
safety and environmental problem posed by the nation's inventory of 26 metric 
tons of plutonium, left from four decades of nuclear bomb production. 
</P>
<P>
 Although awareness of plutonium safety risks has increased gradually over the 
last three years, a massive 26-volume assessment released Tuesday by the Energy 
Department provides significant new evidence that conditions are more serious 
than was previously thought, according to government and private experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the department's inventory of plutonium presents significant hazards 
to workers, the public and environment and little progress has been made to 
aggressively address the problem," according to an Energy Department report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report found hazards at nearly every major site in the nuclear weapons 
complex, identifying 299 specific environmental, health and safety problems. 
"Buildings and equipment that are aging, poorly maintained or of obsolete 
design contribute to the overall problem," the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a more serious problem than we knew of before," said Daryl Kimball, 
associate director at Physicians for Social Responsibility, a watchdog group on 
nuclear issues. "Some of these facilities are an accident waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The report found that the most serious problems exist at the Rocky Flats plant 
near Denver, which has 12.8 metric tons of plutonium stored in 10 buildings 
with serious fire, ventilation, and industrial equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The report ranked its other "most vulnerable" sites in descending order as 
Savannah River, S.C.; Hanford, Wash.; Los Alamos, N.M., and Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cold War ended, bomb output was abruptly cut off and the normal 
movement of plutonium in the production process came to a halt. As a result, 
plutonium was left in various containers that were never intended for long-term 
storage, O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious risks are those posed by 400,000 liters of plutonium stored 
in liquid form, which can leak or become concentrated enough to set off a 
nuclear chain reaction. Plutonium powders, oxides and ashes also pose serious 
storage problems because they are unstable, corrosive and can burn 
spontaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the containers used to store plutonium are plastic bottles, plastic 
bags, cardboard cartons, metal drums and even food cans, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department has 8.7 metric tons of its plutonium inventory stored in 
the form of scraps or residues in 34,000 various packages, of which 300 are 
located at Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
 The report noted that eight plutonium packages at Livermore had recently 
swelled because of hydrogen gas buildup caused by radioactive decay and 
moisture buildup.

HUBBELL'S FALL DEALS DEEP PERSONAL SETBACK TO CLINTON; FRIENDSHIP: THE LEGAL 
DIFFICULTIES OF FORMER AIDE SERVE AS A POLITICAL BLOW TO THE PRESIDENT. BUT THE 
REAL PAIN IS THE LOSS OF A CONFIDANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fall of Webster L. Hubbell is a political blow to President Clinton, but 
is an even deeper wound on a personal level. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short statement, the President said he was "saddened by today's events." 
White House aides noted that Hubbell's plea-bargain on fraud and tax evasion 
charges was unrelated to Clinton's and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
legal problems arising from the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not hard to imagine that the President's anguish over his close 
friend's fate compounds the grief he still feels over the July, 1993, suicide 
of Hubbell's former law partner and White House attorney Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the Clintons said Tuesday that their reaction is one of 
"sadness, surprise and empathy for (Hubbell's) family." 
</P>
<P>
 But one source familiar with Clinton's thinking says that despite his sympathy 
for Hubbell, the President did not feel responsible for his friend's fall, 
which was the result of fraudulent actions Hubbell undertook while in private 
law practice in Little Rock. Clinton believes that Hubbell brought his problems 
on himself by cheating the government and his partners at the Rose Law Firm, 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's real pain will be in the loss of a confidant, a man with whom he 
could share a golf outing or a quiet drink. Hubbell's value to the President 
was often his mere unquestioning presence and his laconic companionship. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual friends who have seen Clinton and Hubbell together said they often 
spent long periods in each other's company without speaking, whether out on the 
golf course or lounging around watching the Arkansas Razorback basketball or 
football teams on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were personally very close, friends for a long, long time," said Skip 
Rutherford, a Little Rock public relations consultant and a friend of both men. 
"He was more than a personal friend, someone to go to the football games with, 
to call up to go out to dinner. Webb was somebody that Clinton could just relax 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 What a long time ago November, 1992, must now seem for both men. One of the 
first post-election photos of the victorious Clinton shows him grinning in a 
golf cart alongside his old pal Webb Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little doubt that Hubbell would accompany the Clintons to 
Washington; the only question was in what capacity. Hubbell landed at the 
Justice Department, where he served as chief contact with the White House as 
Clinton stumbled through the process that began with the failed nomination of 
Zoe Baird as attorney general and eventually ended seven weeks later with the 
confirmation of Janet Reno as the nation's top law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Reno was sworn in, Hubbell remained Clinton's eyes and ears at 
Justice as associate attorney general, the department's No. 3 post. 
</P>
<P>
 After the conflagration at the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Tex., Clinton 
called Hubbell -- not Reno -- for information. In a television interview 
shortly after the disaster, Reno insisted that she was accountable for the 
botched FBI raid, but admitted that she had not spoken to the President. Reno 
said that Clinton had "had a direct conversation with Webb Hubbell" about the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell's relationship with the Clintons dates to the mid-1970s, when Hillary 
Clinton joined the Rose Law Firm to work alongside Hubbell and Foster as her 
husband moved to Little Rock to become Arkansas' attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell was already something of a local celebrity, having played on the Sugar 
Bowl-bound Arkansas Razorbacks football team in the late 1960s. In 1978, 
Hubbell was appointed to a vacancy on the City Board of Little Rock, and a year 
later, at age 31, was elected by his fellow board members to serve as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell's financial dealings in the early 1980s came under scrutiny during his 
confirmation hearings. Roy Drew, a broker with the local E. F. Hutton office 
and a next-door neighbor of Hubbell, urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to 
investigate Hubbell's profits from a 1983 stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew, a longtime critic of the Clintons, said Hubbell instructed him to buy 
500 shares of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Corp Inc. (Arkla), a regulated natural gas 
utility with a mediocre reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell sold the bulk of his shares seven weeks later for a substantial 
profit, shortly before it was revealed that Arkla was a potential takeover 
target. Thomas (Mack) McLarty, Clinton's boyhood friend and former White House 
chief of staff, was then on Arkla's board of directors and later became its 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew suspected that Hubbell benefited from inside information in his Arkla 
trading, but no impropriety was ever established by the Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Clinton appointed Hubbell to be chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme 
Court, to fill a six-month vacancy. Three years later, Clinton called upon his 
friend again, to chair a commission charged with writing a new ethics statute 
for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hubbell, Foster, Hillary Clinton and a fourth young Rose partner, 
William H. Kennedy III, engineered a coup that ousted the firm's managing 
partner and essentially took over management of the august 150-year-old firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several partners left Rose after the "Gang of Four" takeover, no 
bitterness was directed toward Hubbell, who remained highly popular within the 
firm as a mediator among senior partners.

FEC WON'T TRY TO PENALIZE 36 FOR EXCESS CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing restraints on its investigative capability, the Federal Election 
Commission has dismissed complaints against 36 wealthy Americans who exceeded 
the $25,000 annual limit on federal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The FEC action, taken Nov. 14 in a closed-door meeting, was disclosed Tuesday 
by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group that filed 
papers in January accusing 64 individuals of violating campaign reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was highly critical of the FEC for failing to pursue penalties 
against eight contributors who surpassed the federal ceiling by more than 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fear is the dropping of cases sends a signal to wealthy political donors 
that the laws are not always going to be enforced and they can easily take 
their chances and exceed the limits without worrying about any penalty," said 
Elizabeth Hedlund, director of the center's FEC Watch Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The excess contributions were first uncovered a year ago by The Times, which 
reported that 109 individual donors had exceeded the limit in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the FEC has levied a $35,000 fine on William C.W. Mow, chairman of 
Bugle Boy Jeans in Los Angeles, and penalties ranging from $28,000 to $15,000 
on three others, including retired Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive David 
Packard, for violating campaign laws. Complaints against 24 individuals are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The dropped cases include several prominent Californians, among them Robert A. 
Daly, chairman of Warner Bros. Inc.; Don Henley of Beverly Hills, a member of 
the rock group the Eagles; and Jerome S. Moss, founder of A&M Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-member commission voted to drop the complaints for a variety of 
reasons, including lack of evidence and recognition that some offenders had 
solicited refunds. But the most important factor was the FEC's inability to 
handle an overloaded docket of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission dismissed the cases because the bottom line is other cases 
took priority," said FEC spokesman Ron Harris. "Our workload simply dictated 
that we had to get rid of some." 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1975 to enforce federal campaign finance laws, the FEC has 316 
employees and a $27.2-million budget.

ROSE FIRM TO REPAY ILLEGALLY BILLED CLIENTS UP TO $140,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Webster L. Hubbell's former law firm expects to reimburse clients as much as 
$140,000 that Hubbell illegally billed them, the firm's managing partner said 
Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already in the process of reimbursing them and that will 
continue.That's always been our goal," said Ron Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Law Firm also confirmed for the first time that it had filed a formal 
complaint against Hubbell with Arkansas legal ethics authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, who was the associate attorney general until his resignation last 
March, pleaded guilty Tuesday to mail fraud and tax evasion in charges brought 
by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Firm said in a statement Tuesday that in April, 1993, its management 
committee uncovered numerous expense reports by Hubbell "that lacked necessary 
documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 A series of personal meetings and other communications with Hubbell failed to 
produce the documentation he promised, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Firm said it had disclosed the irregularities to the Whitewater 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the evidence presently available to us, it appears that the firm was 
the primary victim of Mr. Hubbell's actions," the statement said. "However, it 
also appears that a limited number of clients were improperly billed by Mr. 
Hubbell." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, in an interview Tuesday evening, said the firm's partners were 
"undecided about whether to take action to recoup any of the funds from Mr. 
Hubbell." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the reaction among clients who were improperly billed had been 
"very positive. They've been very understanding and very sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Rose Firm had lost any clients because of Hubbell's actions, 
Clark answered: "Not that I know of."

POLICY POWERHOUSE STEPS UP TO TREASURY; ADMINISTRATION: ROBERT E. RUBIN HAS 
BEEN CLINTON'S LODESTAR ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. HE'S A FACILITATOR WHOSE GOALS 
CLOSELY MATCH BENTSEN'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President-elect Clinton gathered his Administration's new economic team 
for its first meeting on Jan. 7, 1993, at the Governor's Mansion in Little 
Rock, it was unclear who would emerge as the most influential leader in a group 
of big egos, long resumes and rival ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, it was uncertain whether the team, which brought together 
conservatives and liberals with little in common save their ties to Bill 
Clinton, could reach a consensus on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet almost immediately after that crucial meeting, Robert E. Rubin emerged as 
the de facto leader of the Clinton economic team, someone who had not only 
gained Clinton's confidence but who had the ability to get the rest of the team 
to work together. Quickly, Rubin became the most powerful policy-maker in the 
Administration, eclipsing even Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the 
Administration's elder statesman and chief spokesman on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Rubin is finally poised to assume publicly the role that he has 
played in the White House for 22 months. On Tuesday, Clinton announced that 
Rubin is his choice to succeed Bentsen as Treasury secretary, after Bentsen 
finally announced his long-rumored decision to resign and return to the private 
sector in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of Rubin, a 56-year-old former co-chairman of the Wall Street 
investment firm of Goldman Sachs, is a sign of continuity, rather than change, 
at Clinton's Treasury Department. Rubin seems certain to continue to maintain 
Bentsen's focus on moves designed to expand free trade in the international 
arena, while continuing the pursuit of deficit reduction on the domestic side. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a remarkable similarity between our economic views," Bentsen said in 
an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bentsen noted, he and Rubin are old friends, and recommended each 
other for the job of Treasury secretary when the President-elect asked each man 
for recommendations. While at Goldman Sachs, Rubin personally managed a blind 
trust for Bentsen, and Rubin's son once worked in Bentsen's Senate office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said Tuesday that he told Clinton he would not accept the job of 
Treasury secretary if anyone other than Rubin was put in charge of the National 
Economic Council. Bentsen feared that the council, a new policy-making power 
center in the White House, would usurp authority from the Treasury unless it 
was led by someone like Rubin, who would act as a policy coordinator, rather 
than as an economic czar. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every senior Administration official who participates in council 
meetings describes Rubin as an "honest broker." A quiet, unassuming man whose 
laid-back style seems strangely at odds with his success in both the private 
and public sectors, Rubin has not tried to use his extensive access to Clinton 
to have the last word on policy disputes. Above all, he has seen his role as 
the behind-the-scenes mediator, often preferring to let others take the public 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact has won badly needed credibility for the new National Economic 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the stories about his quiet style and manner are true," said one senior 
Administration economic policy-maker. "He makes the group come to a decision, 
or he can help frame the debate for the President. But he treats the economic 
team as a team. If he didn't, if he tried to get in the last word with the 
President, then he would have hurt his credibility with the rest of the team, 
and the NEC decision-making process would have broken down, and other people 
would have gone around him to try to get to the President. But that hasn't 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, being an "honest broker" doesn't mean that Rubin is not influential. 
Rubin played the dominant role in persuading Clinton to focus his economic 
agenda on deficit reduction, which forced Clinton to abandon many of his 
campaign pledges to cut taxes for the middle class and spend more money on 
public works and infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin brings a different approach than Bentsen to Treasury on some key issues. 
A native New Yorker with a long involvement in New York Democratic politics, 
Rubin is more deeply interested in urban issues than Bentsen, and is likely to 
try to develop new tax policies to enhance such programs as enterprise zones. 
Unlike Bentsen, Rubin doesn't have much interest in a capital gains tax cut, or 
providing other new tax breaks for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin is to be succeeded as chairman of the economic council by White House 
deputy chief of staff Erskine Bowles.

MALFUNCTION IN COMMUTER PLANE FORCES LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An American Eagle commuter airplane made an emergency landing late Tuesday 
after reporting problems with the plane's de-icing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the plane's 16 passengers or three crew members was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR-42, en route from Dayton, Ohio, was approaching O'Hare International 
Airport for landing when it reported the malfunction and declared an emergency, 
said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Don Zochert. Rain and snow was 
falling over Chicago at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether (the de-icing equipment) malfunctioned or lights in the cockpit 
indicated there was a malfunction, we'll find out when we and American Eagle 
check the aircraft tomorrow," Zochert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR-42 is a smaller version of the ATR-72. An American Eagle ATR-72 
crashed in icy weather Oct. 31 near Roselawn, Ind., killing all 68 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that crash, the National Transportation Safety Board has recommended 
ATRs not fly in known icing conditions.

CENTRIST ALLY CALLS CLINTON 'OLD DEMOCRAT'; POLITICS: THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
PARTY'S LEADERSHIP COUNCIL URGES THE PRESIDENT TO RE-EMBRACE THE GROUP'S 
MODERATE VALUES OR LOSE ITS SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oklahoma Rep. Dave McCurdy, chairman of the centrist group that helped launch 
President Clinton's 1992 White House bid, Tuesday branded Clinton an "old 
Democrat" at heart and warned that he must mend his ideological ways or risk 
losing the organization's support. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy's remarks to the 10th annual conference of the Democratic Leadership 
Council reflected the resentment and disappointment felt by many in his 
audience. They had regarded Clinton's election in 1992 as a vindication of 
their own beliefs and as evidence that the Leadership Council had accomplished 
its longstanding goal of moving the Democratic Party to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton won the White House as "a moderate Democrat, a new Democrat," McCurdy 
said at the start of the daylong policy forum here. "But he has governed as 
something else. Not as a liberal as the Republicans say, but as a transitional 
figure. For while Bill Clinton has the mind of a new Democrat he retains the 
heart of an old Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself concluded the conference Tuesday night with a forceful defense 
of his record. Though he did not respond directly to the criticism from 
McCurdy, he proudly ticked off a list of his Administration's accomplishments, 
such as the enactment of the crime bill, reduction of the budget deficit and 
establishment of a national service program. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the November election results, the President blamed Democratic 
losses in part on the difficulties of bringing about change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking on tough issues is tough," he said. "If you try to do a lot of things 
in a short time, you are going to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton promised to keep pushing ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is not to reverse what we have done but build on it," he said. 
"The answer is to reach out to the middle class and say, 'We know why you're 
angry, we know why you're frustrated, we got the message of the election. We're 
not going back on our principles, but we're coming right at you because we were 
hired to help you build a better future for yourselves. That is our only 
purpose.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The President's vigor and passion won him rousing applause from the audience 
and a verbal salute from McCurdy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Bill Clinton we've been waiting to hear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day in his own speech, McCurdy claimed that Clinton had tried 
to follow both a moderate and liberal agenda at the same time. The result of 
this dual approach to governance, he said, was "the great confusion of the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to the future, McCurdy -- who lost his bid for a Senate seat on Nov. 8 
-- advised the President to avoid either making himself over as a Republican or 
joining with Democratic liberals on Capitol Hill "for a two-year trench war" 
against the Republican-controlled Congress. Instead, he urged Clinton to seek 
out moderates in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 He also invited the President to endorse the Leadership Council's own 10-point 
blueprint for economic, social and governmental reforms, which was unveiled 
this week as an alternative to the Republicans' much-heralded "contract with 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 All that Clinton needed to do, McCurdy said, was to make "a course correction, 
not a reversal." But he added: "If he wants our support, Bill Clinton must make 
these changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the harsh words are only the latest outbreak in an epidemic of 
finger-pointing since the midterm elections, they are particularly striking 
coming from McCurdy and the leadership conference. Not only was Clinton 
chairman of the organization before he ran for President, but McCurdy has been 
a longtime Clinton ally and had seconded his nomination for the presidency at 
the Democratic convention in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy's resentment is understandable. As he pointed out, his career as an 
elected official was interrupted at least temporarily by the November election, 
when he lost his bid for a Senate seat. And he implied later in the day during 
a panel discussion of the election that he thinks Clinton's proposed 
gays-in-the-military policy and his advocacy of gun control contributed to that 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear, though, how much leverage McCurdy and the Leadership Council 
-- comprised largely of elected officials, lobbyists, lawyers and businessmen 
-- will have in bargaining with Clinton on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate Democrats in Congress suffered disproportionately heavy losses in the 
midterm elections because many of them represented closely divided districts 
that ultimately went Republican on Nov. 8. McCurdy said that of 90 members of 
the Mainstream Forum, a group of centrist House Democrats in the 103rd 
Congress, 32 will not return for the 104th Congress -- either because of 
election defeats or retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about speculation that he might challenge Clinton for the 1996 
nomination, the 44-year-old McCurdy, who had considered a presidential bid in 
1992, said in an interview that he had no plans to do so. But he indicated that 
some of his supporters had been pressing him to consider such a move and he had 
not entirely ruled out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 To help soothe bruised feelings at the Leadership Council, the White House 
dispatched Vice President Al Gore, who, like Clinton, was a co-founder of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to the group, Gore declared that "Mandate for Change," the 
collection of essays on policy proposals published by the council two years 
ago, could be found in nearly every White House office.

HILL GETS DEATH SENTENCE FOR 2 CLINIC SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Hill, the former preacher who killed a doctor and his unarmed escort with 
a shotgun at an abortion clinic here, was sentenced Tuesday to die in Florida's 
electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Tuesday, Hill said little before he was given the ultimate penalty by 
Circuit Judge Frank Bell, who sternly concluded: "May God have mercy on your 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Hill, 40, had said: "I know for a fact that I'm going to go to 
heaven when I die. I am certainly guilty of no crimes . . . . My actions are 
honorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Pending appeals, Hill's execution would complete a circle drawn in blood in 
Pensacola. The city has been the scene of pitched anti-abortion protests, 
including the bombing of clinics and the murder last year of another abortion 
provider, Dr. David Gunn, whose killer was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's victims were Dr. John Britton, 69, and retired Air Force Lt. Col. James 
Barrett, 74. Barrett's wife, June, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he may choose not to appeal the sentence himself, Hill is granted an 
automatic appeal under Florida law.

JUSTICE DEPT. TAKES LIBERAL STAND IN 2 RIGHTS CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration lawyers, taking a liberal stand in two civil rights 
controversies, urged the Supreme Court on Tuesday to maintain preferences for 
minorities in the awarding of federal contracts and to continue a costly 
court-ordered school desegregation program in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the Administration lawyers contended that the justices should 
reject a strong conservative challenge, which argues that these special, 
race-conscious social programs have outlived their time. 
</P>
<P>
 The two legal briefs were filed Tuesday in the most closely watched civil 
rights cases pending before the high court. They came just a month after an 
election in which a substantial majority of white males deserted the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Clinton White House has shown signs of moving toward the new 
Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, the two civil rights briefs demonstrate 
that the Justice Department is holding firm to traditional liberal approaches 
on affirmative action and school desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contracting case, the Administration is defending a 1987 law that 
steers at least 10% of federal highway contracts to small businesses owned by 
minorities. The preference program is being challenged by a white road builder 
who submitted the lowest bid for guard rail work on a Colorado highway but lost 
out to a Latino-owned firm. 
</P>
<P>
 A conservative legal group is urging the Supreme Court to use the case 
(Adarand Constructors vs. Pena, 93-1841) to declare unconstitutional a series 
of federal funding laws that give explicit preferences to businesses owned by 
blacks, Latinos and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration lawyers argued that these laws do not violate the Constitution 
because they do not set a "fixed requirement . . . or a quota." Instead, they 
give preferences based on the "presumption that small businesses owned and 
controlled by members of racial minority groups are disadvantaged," said U.S. 
Solicitor Drew S. Days III. 
</P>
<P>
 In the school case, the Administration said that, despite 10 years of effort 
and the spending of $1.3 billion in state money, Missouri has not yet done 
enough to raise test scores for black students in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "When segregation has caused impaired educational achievement, evidence that 
students in the system continue to perform poorly when compared to others can 
be an important indication that the effects of discrimination persist," Days 
said in his friend-of-the-court brief (Missouri vs. Jenkins, 93-1823). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, a federal judge ruled that state officials in Missouri had failed to 
fully dismantle the segregated schools in Kansas City. Since then, the same 
judge, Russell G. Clark, has ordered a series of costly improvements in the 
district, as well as tax increases to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a special, $32-million high school was built with 
state-of-the-art computers, an Olympic-size pool and an indoor track. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992-93, the Kansas City schools spent $13,500 per student, far more than 
the suburban districts, which ranged from $4,200 to $7,500 per child. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Judge Clark ruled last year that Missouri had not fulfilled its 
duty under the desegregation decree because the Kansas City "district is still 
at or below national norms" in its tests scores, compared to the mostly white 
suburban schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Both civil rights cases will be argued before the high court in January, and 
written rulings are expected by June.

PANEL CALLS FOR BETTER WAY TO MEASURE TAR, NICOTINE IN CIGARETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal advisory panel Tuesday recommended major changes in the decades-old 
method of measuring the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes 
to more accurately reflect the range of these toxic substances that smokers 
inhale. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of experts said that the measuring method, which uses 
cigarette-puffing machines, yields results that often lull smokers into 
thinking they can reduce their health risks by choosing cigarettes labeled low 
in tar and nicotine. Smokers also are receiving deceptive information about the 
extent of the dangers, the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Research has shown that people who smoke cigarettes labeled low-tar may get 
much higher doses" of tar than that indicated on the label or in advertising, 
said Dr. Harold Freeman, chairman of the President's Cancer Panel, which was 
convened by the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking has been described by public health experts as the nation's leading 
cause of preventable death, responsible for killing 400,000 Americans annually. 
It is associated with pulmonary and heart disease and several cancers, chief 
among them lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's work is expected to add to the growing body of scientific evidence 
that federal health officials slowly have been gathering to support the 
regulation of tobacco. The Food and Drug Administration has been building a 
case over the last year presumably to regulate cigarettes as delivery systems 
of nicotine, a drug the agency has authority to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the traditional Federal Trade Commission's machine-measuring 
process, which dates back to 1967, have long recommended that the method be 
revised because cigarette designs have changed considerably in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines hold cigarettes and draw air through them in two-second puffs, 
repeating the puffs every minute until the cigarette is burned to the filter. 
But today, many brands of cigarettes have holes in their filter paper to dilute 
the smoke with air, thus the machine's measuring device cannot accurately 
calculate the amount of tar and nicotine contained in the cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference between people and machines," said Jack E. 
Henningfield, chief of the clinical pharmacology branch of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse's addiction research center. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers often do not smoke the way the machine smokes -- they may draw deeper, 
puff more, or cover the air filtration holes with their lips or fingers, thus 
blocking the air that would have diluted the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers who choose "light" cigarettes find ways to compensate and can wind up 
inhaling just as much nicotine and other ingredients as those who smoke regular 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have nicotine-dependent brains and they will beat the system to get 
the nicotine they need," Henningfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said that smoking cigarettes with low machine-measured yields 
may have a "small effect" in reducing cancer risk but has no effect on the risk 
of cardiovascular disease and an uncertain impact on the risk of pulmonary 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The health benefits of switching are minimal compared to quitting entirely," 
said Freeman, who is director of surgery at Harlem Hospital Center in New York. 
"And how you smoke is much more important than what you smoke."

 President Clinton on Tuesday declared today Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day,

</P>
<P>
 "Those Americans who remember World War II have a profound responsibility: to 
pass on the lessons of that conflict to the generations that have followed," he 
said. "Never again can America be unprepared, or permit an aggressor to 
threaten our vital interests, or isolate itself . . . ."

SUPERVISORS' DARKEST DAY BEGAN EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day began inauspiciously at 2:55 a.m. when Supervisor William G. Steiner, 
asleep at his home in Orange, was awakened by a telephone call summoning him to 
the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Emma Jane Riley was startled out of deep slumber by the 
ringing telephone next to her bed. A woman's voice asked for her husband, Board 
of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, also urging his presence in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 A while later, Orange County sheriff's deputies were dispatched to the homes 
of Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder. County staffers had 
been unable to reach them by telephone because they had left on their answering 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I thought it was either somebody who was drunk or playing a 
prank," said Wieder's husband, Irv, especially because they live in a gated 
community in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began one of the darkest Tuesdays in county government history, a prelude 
to Orange County's filing of the largest municipal bankruptcy ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, 82 and a diabetic, could not simply rush out. After dressing in coat 
and tie, he ate a quick breakfast and took some insulin before heading out the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the mounting financial crisis facing the county, Emma Jane Riley said 
her husband was not that surprised by the pre-dawn call. Nor was she. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget. I'm a military wife," Mrs. Riley said, referring to her 
husband's other title as a retired Marine Corps brigadier general. "He's used 
to crises. . . . He was just concerned that it was necessary to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment was shared by Elaine Vasquez, wife of Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez. "My husband was woken up for the Laguna fires, so we've been through 
these things before." 
</P>
<P>
 Top county administrators, meanwhile, had spent the night in their small, 
boxlike government offices within the maze of high-rise public buildings at 
Santa Ana's Civic Center. The crisis managers -- County Administrative Officer 
Ernie Schneider, County Counsel Terry A. Andrus, acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe 
and Finance Director Eileen Walsh -- had worked around the clock without sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 In what has become the most unusual and serious crisis to face Orange County 
government, the top officials were hastily shoring up their defenses for 
another day filled with uncertainty. At that point, they did not know which way 
the looming financial disaster would turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by a dramatic $1.5-billion loss in the value of the county's investments 
portfolio, they were scrambling to prepare for -- and then react to -- the 
opening of East Coast financial markets at 7 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. 
Schneider -- the point man directing the county's response -- had made the 
decision to call in the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 a.m., all five supervisors had arrived at the Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 They were escorted to the third-floor offices of the county administrator, but 
were carefully sequestered in separate areas. Schneider wanted the lawmakers 
there for close consultation, but knew he would have to keep them physically 
apart in order to avoid violating the Brown Act, the state open-meetings law 
that prohibits more than two supervisors from gathering at any one time when 
the public has not been notified in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning session took on the appearance of a "war room" as staffers 
shuttled between supervisors for more than five hours with regular updates. 
</P>
<P>
 With routine county business to conduct, the supervisors adjourned to their 
meeting chambers on the first floor for their regularly scheduled session. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, their meeting agendas are dispatched with the speed of a pit crew at 
an auto race. But on Tuesday, after spending about an hour on regular, mundane 
items, the board went into a closed-door special session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 2 1/2 hours of sleep last night," said Wieder, who appeared exasperated 
as she plopped in her brown leather chair in the board's meeting room after the 
lunch break. The supervisors were about to go behind closed doors for a second 
time Tuesday to discuss the status of the county's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, word on the street was that the county was considering filing for 
protection under federal bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of the sessions, Schneider passed a note to Steiner asking him to 
step outside the board room and take a call from Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the news broke last week that the county's investments portfolio was in 
trouble, the supervisors have said very little publicly. They have neither 
offered explanations nor made excuses. And Tuesday was no different. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the midmorning sessions, they had ducked questions from the crush of 
reporters as they slipped into a room behind the dais, emerging briefly to 
announce that they would reconvene at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 County staffers, inundated with calls from the media as well as a few from the 
public, claimed they also had little information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few people know anything, and those who do know don't feel it's prudent 
to discuss it until they have a handle on it," said Peter Whittington, an aide 
to Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 During their brief afternoon break, some of the supervisors returned to work 
and others simply retreated. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez stretched out on his office sofa for a nap. Steiner attended a 
criminal justice seminar, and the three other supervisors holed up in their 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 p.m., Steiner arrived back at his office, reviewed some papers, and 
awaited another call from the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members had also placed calls to other prominent officials, including 
U.S. General Services Administrator Roger Johnson, and California's U.S. 
senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as top officials with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3 p.m., the supervisors again went into what would be their final closed 
session of the day. When they emerged at about 5:30, the official silence was 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 They announced what had been rumored all day. The glitzy county known for the 
power of its money, had declared bankruptcy.

<P>
 Orange County became the largest municipality in U.S. history Tuesday to file 
for federal bankruptcy protection, after an all-day standoff with Wall Street 
investors who insisted the county repay $1.2 billion in loans to its troubled 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning news that one of the nation's largest, wealthiest and most 
politically conservative counties was seeking protection from its creditors 
capped a day of turmoil that shook not just Orange County but the country's 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Somber county officials insisted that the filing -- made at 5:01 p.m. Tuesday, 
an hour after the Santa Ana federal bankruptcy court's normal closing time -- 
would have no effect on the county's ability to maintain police protection, the 
county payroll and other basic services. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move raised questions about the funding of dozens of major projects in 
the county, from toll roads to a Disneyland expansion to a possible new stadium 
for the Los Angeles Rams and California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could cost the county its stellar bond rating, meaning it could become 
more expensive to borrow for public needs -- if the county and other local 
government agencies are allowed to issue debt at all. One rating agency said it 
would drop Orange County's rating today from double-A to triple-C -- meaning 
its bonds are viewed as in danger of default. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took this action on behalf of the county and other investors so that the 
current financial situation can be resolved in an orderly fashion," said Board 
of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, adding that the move will help the 
county restructure its debts and ward off claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy means that the county's investment pool -- which includes the 
savings of 185 cities, school districts and other agencies -- is frozen and 
restricted from withdrawals. It is unclear which debts the county will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) called the bankruptcy a 
"difficult pill to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shocking occurrence," said Bergeson, who will join the board in 
January. "We're going to have to look to Sacramento, to Washington, and 
obviously we're going to have to look to ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors were roused from their beds at 3 a.m. with news of an impending 
financial catastrophe. They spent virtually all day behind closed doors meeting 
with their money advisers and attorneys to sort through the dilemma, made more 
drastic by investors' demands that the county come up with $1.2 billion in cash 
or securities that had come due Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, county officials, through a private firm, had tried to liquidate 
the beleaguered investment pool's huge holding of derivatives -- complex 
financial instruments that magnified the fund's exposure to rising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior executive at one of the four biggest Wall Street firms, who declined 
to be identified, said the bankruptcy was made inevitable after Orange County 
began approaching various firms, but all turned the county down. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms rejected taking on such a monumental task, the source said, partly 
because they found that the fund's losses on the derivatives were much larger 
than the $1.5 billion that has been publicly reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The source declined to give a specific figure, but said his firm concluded 
that it's "hundreds of millions" more than that, although not double the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "They approached a number of people on the Street, including us, to liquidate 
the portfolio for them," the executive said. "But no one wanted to trade with 
them. The people who looked at it (the portfolio) were frightened by it." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, county supervisors and administrators were more nervous, placing 
calls to state and federal officials in search of financial help, such as 
low-interest loans to help resolve its cash crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 No assistance came, but one supervisor said the county has received an 
outpouring of genuine concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to a whole lot of people today . . . congressmen and senators and 
the governor . . . everybody else we could get ahold of, to ensure -- 
absolutely ensure -- that every avenue of legal relief was available to us," 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear by late Tuesday that the county had to file for bankruptcy, 
despite the embarrassment it would bring, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no alternative given to us," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
"We were concerned with the fact that we are here to protect the public and to 
protect the investors." 
</P>
<P>
 But investment bankers still wanted repayment of their loans and the county 
had no other choice. The county defaulted on 10 to 12 loans Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody walked," Wieder said. "The bond dealers -- they walked." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner expressed some bitterness over the demands of 
the investment bankers -- the same people that former Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron has done business with for so long. Citron resigned Monday 
after 24 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a steady parade of hot shots in blue suits representing the 
investment bankers pitching these sophisticated investment strategies and the 
treasurer obviously went down that path," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor said he had two conversations with Gov. Pete Wilson to ask for 
help, including advancing state funds due the county early to provide liquidity 
to the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to dealing with dysfunction," said Steiner, the former director of 
the Orangewood Home for abused and neglected children. "But never anything of 
this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code is a desperate last step 
for any public entity, because the stigma attached to such a move can lead to a 
bad credit rating and make it difficult, if not impossible, to borrow for 
public projects, legal and financial experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare, it's quite rare . . . for any government to take that step -- and 
unprecedented for a county of that size," said Bennett Murphy, a bankruptcy 
expert and partner in the law firm of Latham & Watkins. "It's seldom used, and 
I'd say that it's quite unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Chapter 9 functions much like Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
for businesses -- it provides a government with protection from its creditors 
while it attempts to work out a plan for rehabilitating its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drastic financial distress -- it's there for that purpose," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with criticism from federal regulators that state officials have failed 
to step in swiftly to help, Gov. Wilson issued a terse, one-sentence statement 
through his press office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will assist Orange County in analyzing the situation to identify the 
alternatives necessary so that Orange County can bring its finances back into 
solvency," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for the state Department of Finance said officials 
there were gathering information in hopes of developing a strategy to help the 
county find a way out of the calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Job One is to get a complete picture of what the situation is," said 
spokesman H.D. Palmer. "What we'll do depends on what we find out. I wouldn't 
want to prejudge any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors of a bankruptcy filing spread from Wall Street to Washington to 
California through the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) had been the first to appear on 
television hinting at a bankruptcy filing. Cox, a former securities lawyer, 
said he had been in contact with county officials as the financial crisis 
exploded and will hold hearings to sort out what happened and find ways to 
prevent such catastrophes in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy filing apparently was triggered when CS First Boston Corp., one 
of several large brokerages that has lent the county money to purchase 
securities, demanded additional collateral for its loans on Tuesday after the 
county failed to make a payment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the county was unable to put up the cash demanded, CS First Boston seized 
$2 billion of the county's securities that had been held as collateral for the 
loans, according to Wall Street traders familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage firm then placed those securities, mostly U.S. government agency 
bonds, on the bond market near the close of trading Tuesday, a move that 
stunned traders, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
 CS First Boston officials would not comment on their relationship with the 
county or on any actions the brokerage might have taken on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the brokerage with the closest relationship to the county -- 
Merrill Lynch & Co. -- said it had not asked for additional collateral and had 
no plans to cut off credit to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard G. Paget, managing director and head of the municipal bond department 
at Baltimore-based Alex. Brown & Sons, said rumors of a bankruptcy by the 
county had been circulating all day. He said bond holders had been trying to 
sell off their positions, but couldn't because there were no buyers. He said 
the situation "reminded me of the run on banks in the 1930s," when everyone 
tried to get their money out at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation was simple," Paget said. "People wanted their money out and 
couldn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paget said Alex. Brown received a report Tuesday morning from financial 
advisers that up to 180 of the bond issuers with investments in the Orange 
County fund were having financial problems and might be in danger of default. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the rumors and reports, municipal bond desks across the country 
were having extreme difficulty assigning prices to bonds. "It was pretty much 
confusion and pandemonium as far as credit analysis is concerned," Paget said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paget said the bankruptcy declaration was analogous to the federal bank 
holiday declared by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Depression, 
which halted the run on banks. "What this does is buy the county time to sort 
this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District -- which had threatened 
to pull its remaining $300-million investment out of the pool -- learned of the 
county's worsening troubles early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is high-stakes poker," Swan said. "I can understand from an investment 
firm's perspective that this is a bad situation and they have shareholders who 
are very concerned. However, investment firms also have to realize that if they 
pull the plug, that's it. And that's a hard pill to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office had lawyers "looking all day at the 
situation," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Dave Puglia said the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which is investigating the Orange County financial crisis, "has made contact 
with us," adding, "we're working with them in any way that can be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 But Puglia also said the office was rebuffed by the SEC earlier Tuesday after 
state attorneys requested access to all information on the ongoing crisis. The 
two sides agreed to discuss the dispute further on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Puglia said the attorney general's office has been in contact with Orange 
County, "but we have not been made privy to the discussions or decisions of the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
plans to take any major action in the near future, except to continue their 
very active investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC had considered seeking a court injunction that would have placed the 
Orange County fund into receivership. But federal regulators ruled that out, 
concluding such a step might cause more, rather than less, disruption to the 
securities markets, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worry was that a receiver might forbid securities firms from selling any 
of the collateral they hold, which could cause serious disruption in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same ill effects, however, might happen amid bankruptcy 
proceedings, in which a bankruptcy judge may issue orders about the handling of 
securities and collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, federal regulators were said to be concerned that there might be 
a political backlash if Washington stepped in to seize control of the Orange 
County fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators, however, were concerned and surprised that no one on the 
state level had moved to take control of the situation. Some regulators said 
privately that anxiety on Wall Street and among investors in municipal bonds 
might have been assuaged if Wilson or state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren had found a 
way to take charge and begin issuing directives to sort out the tangled mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Shapiro, chairwoman of the CFTC, and William R. McLucas, director of the 
SEC's enforcement division, declined to comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the largest investors in the fund said the bankruptcy could have a 
serious effect on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, chief executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
said his agency would be stuck financially if its $1 billion in the county's 
fund was frozen for a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken steps today to make sure we're OK until the end of the year," 
Oftelie said. "But after that I don't know how long we could last." He said the 
agency is counting on that money next to meet payroll demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth, referring to the Disney and stadium 
projects, said: "We will be looking at all major projects in the city, 
including all capital improvement projects, to see if we're going to freeze 
them," putting them on hold until the crisis passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Orange County, the bankruptcy drew mixed reaction from the cities and 
other agencies that relied on the county to invest its money over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraged by (the bankruptcy filing.) We think that means the county 
is taking control and protecting its assets," said Tim O'Donnell, Brea's 
assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the filing) was a wise move on the county's part," said Seal Beach 
Mayor George Brown. "A lot of towns were ready to draw their money out." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were angry and wondered why the Board of Supervisors weren't keeping a 
closer watch on the county's money. 
</P>
<P>
 'I think some of our supervisors really should think about resigning, except 
for the ones who were just elected," Santa Ana City Councilman Ted R. Moreno 
said. "They should all be fired. Citron might be an elected official and 
treasurer but it was their responsibility as county supervisors to keep an eye 
on what was happening to the money." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most shattering experiences that any of us in local 
government will ever face," said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly. More Coverage of O.C.

<P>
 In a move that could have severe repercussions, the county Tuesday sought 
protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The step, which is 
expected to result in a lower credit rating for the county, may lead to a host 
of cost-cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT IS CHAPTER 9? 
</P>
<P>
 Only a municipality, such as Orange County, may file for this type of 
bankruptcy. Chapter 9 buys time for cities, school districts or other 
governmental agencies to work out ways to pay their debts. 
</P>
<P>
 WHY ORANGE COUNTY FILED 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no alternative given to us. We were concerned with the fact that we 
are here to protect the public and to protect the investors. And, of course, 
the county itself is 37% of this fund. Then, everybody walked. The bond dealers 
-- they walked." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harriett M. Wieder, county supervisor 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT IT MEANS 
</P>
<P>
 The filing could affect about 185 municipalities, school districts and other 
governmental entities that have invested billions of dollars in the county 
investment fund. All of them use their investments to raise money to meet their 
obligations, such as new construction, day-to-day services or loan payments. 
They also might not be able to borrow more money. County Fund Investors 
</P>
<P>
 About 185 government agencies--schools, cities and special districts--have 
money in the Orange County investment fund. Money designated as being in the 
"bond pool" is kept separate because it is governed by specific rules regarding 
a trading practice known as arbitrage, an effort to profit by borrowing at one 
interest rate and investing at a higher one. Here is a partial list of 
investments as of Nov. 30. It does not include about $550 million borrowed by 
school districts and some individual investors: 03,38,19,19 Agency Commingled

O.C. FILING INTERPRETED AS MOVE OF LAST RESORT; BANKRUPTCY: RUINED CREDIT 
RATINGS, INABILITY TO SELL BONDS, NEED TO RAISE TAXES COULD ALL RESULT, EXPERTS 
SAY.

 Orange County's filing for municipal bankruptcy is viewed by legal experts as 
a move of last resort that can send shock waves through every level of 
government and trigger severe economic consequences that might take years to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Governmental agencies seeking protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code risk a host of fiscal woes, including the loss of hard-won 
credit ratings, inability to sell bonds to raise money for public works 
projects, deteriorating relations with employees and creditors, and the 
prospect of raising fees or taxes to help pay off the debts that triggered the 
bankruptcy petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal fees are enormous, and rounds of cost-cutting measures might become 
necessary, resulting in layoffs and reduced services to the public. Cities like 
Bridgeport, Conn., have spent years trying to rebuild their credit ratings and 
overcome the stigma of Chapter 9, leaving municipal officials wondering if it 
was all worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is often better to work out your problems with financial engineering 
rather than to crash and burn," said James E. Spiotto, a Chicago attorney and 
one of the nation's top experts on governmental bankruptcy. "Chapter 9 is the 
most extreme remedy, the last resort, if you can even call it a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 But Spiotto and other bankruptcy lawyers say Chapter 9 could provide Orange 
County with a "powerful shield" to fend off a potentially devastating run on 
the beleaguered investment pool that was managed -- or mismanaged, some might 
say -- by former County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial crisis developed for Orange County after it was reported last week 
that the $20-billion investment pool had lost $1.5 billion -- roughly 20% of 
the investors' actual stake -- because an investment strategy that Citron had 
used successfully for many years had turned sour as interest rates began to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Citron had pledged his investors' securities as collateral to 
borrow more than $12 billion in short-term loans to purchase long-term bonds 
that at the time were paying higher rates of interest. As the Federal Reserve 
began raising interest rates this year, however, the short-term loans could 
only be renewed at ever-increasing interest rates, while the value of the 
long-term bonds he bought tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of disclosures about the pool's losses, Citron resigned. A federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation is underway. On Tuesday, two 
bankruptcy filings were made -- one for the county and the other for the county 
treasurer's investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "You file Chapter 9 when the pressure is greater than your ability to handle 
it," said Richard Levin, a bankruptcy attorney for 20 years in Los Angeles. 
"Like a classic bank failure, you could prevent the race of the swift." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 is a backwater of federal bankruptcy law, which grants governmental 
agencies time to reorganize their finances and make arrangements with creditors 
to pay off their debts. The action is filed voluntarily, meaning that no 
creditor can force the governmental entity into bankruptcy, as they can a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, a governmental agency such as Orange County must clear 
five hurdles in order to declare a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, said attorney Marc 
Beilinson of Pachulski, Stang & Ziehl in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It must meet the legal definition of a municipality. State law must authorize 
it, which California law does. The governmental entity must be insolvent, and 
must be willing to develop a plan to pay its debts. And it must either obtain 
the approval of creditors holding a majority of its claims or must have 
negotiated with investors in good faith and failed to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipalities have a great deal more freedom under Chapter 9 than 
corporations have under somewhat comparable Chapter 11 bankruptcies, Beilinson 
said. Municipalities get protection from their creditors, but -- unlike 
bankrupt corporations -- they do not have to seek a judge's permission to 
borrow new funds or spend them as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys say the process also differs from regular bankruptcy in that, so 
long as the government entity has the power to tax or raise fees to help pay 
its debt, it cannot go out of existence as a failed business or corporation 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code was developed during the Great 
Depression, when many municipalities began losing their ability to raise taxes 
and had difficulty paying their debts. Since then, only 475 Chapter 9 petitions 
are known to have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those cases involved hospitals or small, special-purpose districts for 
schools, utilities, water or sewer services. No large or medium-size cities 
have ever filed a Chapter 9 proceeding and pursued it to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is there, but the hope is no one will use it," said Prof. Lawrence P. 
King, a bankruptcy specialist at the New York University School of Law. "When 
you file it, people want to stop dealing with you. The state starts breathing 
down your throat. Politicians get some mileage out of it. If there is one thing 
I would emphasize, it's the last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Up until Orange County's filing, Bridgeport, a city of 145,000 with a debt of 
$200 million, represented the largest Chapter 9 filing in the country. After 
seeking protection in 1991, the state's largest and poorest city lost its 
credit rating and could not sell municipal bonds to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad cost-cutting measures were instituted and employee morale plummeted 
along with the credit rating. There were even questions whether local banks 
would honor city paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut state attorney general challenged Bridgeport's decision in 
court, and a judge threw out the Chapter 9 petition, ruling that the city was 
solvent and could pay its bills. The city appealed, but Mayor Joseph Ganim, who 
was elected during the crisis, eventually withdrew the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fiscal, political and moral aspect to it all," Ganim said. "The 
whole impact on municipal government is enormous. Wall Street is skeptical and 
it was been an uphill battle to regain our credibility. It affects all levels 
of government. There is a freeze on hiring, a freeze on wages. If I were mayor 
when this started I would not have filed a Chapter 9." 
</P>
<P>
 New York City considered filing a Chapter 9 petition during its fiscal crisis 
in the mid-1970s, and federal law was changed to accommodate such a move. But 
city leaders decided against the move, fearing that a bankruptcy filing would 
deliver a devastating blow to the municipal bond market. At the time, New York 
City bonds represented some 27% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Cleveland never went through bankruptcy court for protection after 
it defaulted on bond payments to investors in 1978. In California, the San Jose 
School District, facing labor problems and the effects of Proposition 13, 
sought protection under Chapter 9 but managed to pay its obligations on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the amount of indebtedness, bankruptcy lawyers say Orange County 
could face some of the same problems. If bond and credit ratings plunge, the 
county would have a difficult time obtaining loans or selling bonds to raise 
money for a new stadium in Anaheim, a new county jail or a road. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy would harm Orange County's credit standing -- not just its rating 
from agencies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, but its long-term 
reputation among investors. It would immediately become more expensive for the 
county to borrow funds, as investors would demand higher interest rates to 
compensate for the increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as airline mogul Frank Lorenzo used the bankruptcy laws to break 
contracts with his unionized employees, Orange County could, if it chose, 
renegotiate collective bargaining agreements with its employees or seek to 
unilaterally change the pay or benefits, with the judge's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies to the county's deal with trash-haulers, for example, or 
other private contractors. It could press a judge to reject existing contracts, 
or use that threat to pressure contractors into providing more favorable terms, 
Beilinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, bankruptcy lawyers say that investors holding bonds sold by 
Orange County might not be able to earn interest, because interest ceases to 
accrue when a Chapter 9 is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday evening as news of Orange County's bankruptcy filing spread, Moody's 
suspended all of the county's bond ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is the stigma of the bankruptcy. Eventually, you have to 
go back to the bond market. Your credit ratings are ruined. Someone always gets 
hurt," Spiotto said. "This creates a tremendous strain on governmental 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond county government, the Chapter 9 filing could impact about 180 
municipalities, school districts and other governmental entities that had 
entrusted billions of dollars to Orange County to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be surprised if a number of other municipalities (that invested 
in the Orange County fund) were themselves forced to file for bankruptcy 
because they won't be able to meet their own obligations," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the top four investors in the county bond portfolio are the Orange 
County Transportation Agency, with $1 billion at stake, and the county 
Transportation Corridor Agencies, which invested $306 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies spend tremendous amounts of money for countywide transportation 
projects, such as bus service and freeway construction. The Transportation 
Corridor Agencies is now working on the San Joaquin Hills and Foothill-Eastern 
toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Telles, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, said the 
bankruptcy filing should not hurt the agency in the near term. But if the 
agency could not withdraw funds, over the long run it might interfere with the 
ability to pay for construction of the toll roads.

RESIDENTS CAN'T SEEM TO PICTURE O.C. BANKRUPT

 It seemed unimaginable at first, like some ridiculous joke, but as news spread 
that prosperous Orange County had somehow gone bankrupt, dazed taxpayers who 
didn't know a bond from a burger definitely weren't laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty amazed," said Debbie Fields, a 42-year-old planner from Irvine. "I 
feel speechless. I don't know what to think." 
</P>
<P>
 At Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza, Christmas shoppers were beyond shocked. 
Many in the vaunted cathedral of consumerism called Orange County the last 
place one expects a billion-dollar-plus financial calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought of Orange County as the last bastion of wealth and the 
American way," said Cameron Pylant, 32, manager of a men's clothing store in 
the mall. "I'm shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Adler, 61, felt victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to all the taxes I've been paying all these years?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was the exception. For most, the crisis was anything but personal. So 
complex are the issues, so delicate the web of loans and debts, few could 
predict the concrete consequences within their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how it will affect me," said Karen Darney, 44, of Santa Ana 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping with her 3-year-old son in a Santa Ana 98-cent store, Norma Juarez, 
25 and unemployed, knew she would pay, but didn't know how. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy will just keep going down," she said. "There are no jobs. No 
future. There are a lot of layoffs. This will make it harder. . . . I want a 
better future for me and my son. This will make it harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, before the bankruptcy filing was reported, the mood was less 
angry, more dazed. The county seemed like one big high school math class, and 
the deepening financial crisis marked the dreaded start of calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those people that doesn't have a clue," said Laura Conkey, 28, a 
waitress at Pop's Cafe in Santa Ana, where $2.99 gets you a chili dog with 
fries and the only percent people care about is 15%, as in the tip. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the public kitty may be $1.5 billion lighter because of various 
investment strategies was more difficult to digest than a heavy lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like usual," Conkey said, reprising a familiar refrain around Pop's crowded 
counter, "the bureaucrats were spending our money and not thinking about where 
it was going." 
</P>
<P>
 Conkey wasn't sure how Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned 
Monday, actually spent her money. Nor was lawyer Marc Levine, who hunched over 
his $4 hamburger and pleaded that Calvin and Hobbes are more accessible than 
Citron and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Westminster resident Jim Owen wanted was to raise his hand and ask 
someone why the county's shortfall is dismissed by several experts as a "paper 
loss." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confused by the whole thing," Owen said. "I've read in the paper that 
it's only a paper loss, but now I'm hearing that the county may file 
bankruptcy. What happened to the paper loss? How can it be a paper loss if 
there's $1.5 billion missing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Good question, and one they would have happily answered at Pop's corner table, 
where five silver-haired masons enjoyed a heaping portion of hindsight during 
their traditional Tuesday lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's always pulling something sooner or later," said Glenn Kirk, 81, a 
retiree from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 His fellow masons nodded gravely. Such is human nature. More puzzling to them 
was that all this loot wasn't watched by more county officials -- like the 
lunch check that sat in the middle of their little group, for instance, which 
they watched as if it were a coiled snake. 
</P>
<P>
 On a $25 bill, the men voted to leave their favorite waitress a 30% tip, 
prompting 66-year-old Dean Bradley to mutter, "We act sometimes like we work 
for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that people who seem to be in positions of power are abusing 
it," said Lesley Renvoize, a nanny from Laguna Beach who was feeding her 
8-month-old charge in Newport's Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it wasn't the math but the vocabulary that made people feel so dumb. 
"Derivatives" and "reverse repurchase agreements" -- financial phrases bandied 
about to describe Citron investment strategy -- fell on people's ears like 
Swahili poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just a bunch of fancy words," said Nazario Negrete, 45, a Fullerton 
maintenance worker studying the business section of the newspaper. "It's hard 
to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 "But one thing I do know," he added. "It looks bad for Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Berkey was one of the lucky ones who got it. 
</P>
<P>
 An electrician from Lake Forest, Berkey was polishing off a man-sized meal and 
telling two friends -- Ray Scrivner of Placentia and David Lawhorn of Anaheim 
-- how the county is wired. Fiscally speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all on paper," said Berkey, whose bushy mustache complemented his 
bristly oratory style. "Ain't no money lost. Yet. All right? But from what I 
understand, the budget is based on what's on paper."

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; LOSS LOOMS FOR SCHOOL UNITS THAT BORROWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified could face some of the worst damage from the 
county's investment crisis because, like four other school districts, it 
borrowed about $50 million in the spring of 1993 to make money in the Orange 
County treasurer's now-failed investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by the prospect of high returns in a time of dwindling funding from the 
state, the district struck a deal with the county and joined the investment in 
high-risk derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first year of the investment, the district made $1.5-million net 
profit. About half of that was spent on technology labs, while the other half 
remains in the county pool, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're strapped for cash. To us it meant that we wouldn't have to cut as many 
programs or suffer as much," said Kim Stallings, Placentia-Yorba Linda's 
assistant superintendent for administrative services. "In retrospect it looks 
different, but we thought we had the best county treasurer in the state. It was 
a big mistake, unfortunately. Looking back, it's always easy to say it was a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was separate but similar to the $200-million investment made by 
Newport-Mesa Unified, Irvine Unified, the North Orange County Community College 
District and the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday night of the Irvine Unified School District trustees, 
Deputy Supt. Paul Reed issued an emergency report laying out best-case and 
worst-case scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the worst case, we're broke; we close the doors of the schools and we 
declare bankruptcy," Reed said. But the bankruptcy filing could stabilize 
things and allow the district to get face value on its investment, he added. 
"The reality is, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Irvine and the other three school agencies, Placentia-Yorba Linda 
received no special guarantees protecting its principal. But the district did 
buy insurance to help cover its losses in case the variable interest rate on 
its $50-million loan skyrocketed. The insurance, however, doesn't protect the 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Tuesday's news that the county had declared bankruptcy, Stallings 
remained confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have to lose quite a bit of money to lose more than we've earned," 
he said. "Our big question is, 'Is the principal vulnerable? Or is it going to 
be protected?' We haven't been able to get an answer. If we're just going to 
have decreased interest earnings, that's not going to be as dire a situation."  
</P>
<P>
 Though the five agencies that borrowed money for the investments have the 
greatest exposure, all 31 of Orange County's school districts could face 
massive losses, because they are required by state law to keep virtually all 
their money in the county treasurer's pool. As of Nov. 30, school agencies had 
more than $1 billion in operating funds in the pool, plus some $550 million in 
borrowed funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambling for information Tuesday, a handful of school finance officials from 
various districts met to consider strategy, while several school districts also 
consulted private attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they were searching for legal loopholes in the requirement that all 
funds be deposited with the treasurer, so that tax receipts expected next week 
could be kept out of the ailing fund. Several also suggested that schools might 
have added legal recourse because they have no choice but to keep money in the 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wenkart, general counsel for the County Department of Education, said 
his office would probably hire outside legal and financial advisers as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unprecedented situation. We don't have the expertise in this area of 
the law," Wenkart said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wenkart and several other school officials said they were somewhat 
reassured by the bankruptcy filing because it will prevent a run on the county 
fund and could stabilize the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that the day-to-day operations of schools won't be 
affected," he said. "Kids will still go to schools, people will still continue 
to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 District superintendents and finance officers will meet Thursday afternoon at 
the county Department of Education. Until then, most are holding onto a 
wait-and-see attitude.

<P>
 Among the reactions to the crisis in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
 "At the minimum we will hold hearings in Washington on all the facts of the 
matter. The first line of attack, obviously, is Sacramento, because these 
investments were permitted under a special change in the law . . . arranged by 
the county treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a former securities lawyer 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite clear . . . that the state of California or Orange County is the 
entity that should proceed in some sort of action to protect the assets and 
work out a way to pay obligations over time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike McGill, chief of staff, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing legislatively (in Sacramento) that can be done right now. . . 
. You couldn't get a Mother's Day resolution through right now (because of the 
speakership fight in the Assembly)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- State Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the children are concerned, I have a feeling that the county will 
step up to the plate and take care of these matters. . . . Municipalities, they 
can lose money and whatnot, but children . . . the whole state and our 
community take special interest in the lives of children." 
</P>
<P>
 -- James D. Daily, attorney for 8-year-old Cameron Young, who was mauled by a 
dog and whose trust fund was invested in the county pool as part of liability 
settlement 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are monitoring it by the moment to see what they're doing. . . . We have 
not been kept informed. We don't know all of the intricacies of what's going 
on. That's part of the problem. If they would keep us informed, as major 
investors, maybe we could be of more assistance to them. I'm just trying to 
pick up bits and pieces where I can." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr., head of the county's city managers 
association 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is everybody is looking around and saying, 'What do we do?' 
. . . If you have your money in a bank and the bank isn't there, what do you 
do? It's not every day that we have something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Costa Mesa City Atty. Thomas Kathe 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we don't have a definitive answer what role the attorney 
general's office can and should take. Until we have all the facts and we have a 
clear picture of what precisely the state's posture can and should be, any 
offhand comments could cause more damage than good." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Puglia, spokesman for state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We will assist Orange County in analyzing the situation to identify the 
alternatives necessary so that Orange County can bring its finances back into 
solvency." 
</P>
<P>

 "Bankruptcy doesn't mean close up shop, and the county can't do that. So if 
it's a maneuver to buy time and evaluate options for handling the portfolio, 
then it might not be bad. I just don't know."

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; PROTECTION FILING MAY SPARK PANIC SELLING; BONDS: BIG 
INVESTORS MAY FACE HEAVY LOSSES ON CURRENT ISSUES, AND COUNTY COULD BE SHUT OUT 
OF MARKET FOR NEW OFFERINGS.

 Orange County's dramatic decision to seek bankruptcy protection Tuesday is 
likely to touch off some panic selling of existing bonds today and kill the 
county's ability to return to the bond market in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bankruptcy freezes the county's repayment obligations and gives it 
time to assess its finances, it will force many large investors to sell at 
steep discounts, because there are legal restrictions on the amount of troubled 
debt they can hold in their portfolios, said John Schotz, president of Saybrook 
Capital, a Los Angeles investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 And less sophisticated individual investors are likely to follow suit, said 
Lewis G. Feldman, head of the capital markets group of Cox, Castle & Nicholson, 
a Los Angeles public finance law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Further curtailing the county's ability to raise future bond money were 
decisions Tuesday evening by Moody's Investors Service to suspend the county's 
bond ratings and by Standard & Poor's Corp. to slash its rating on all Orange 
County debt. Officials at both rating agencies said they could cut the county's 
ranking to Triple-C as early as this morning, which would rank them as "poor 
quality" junk bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing its suspension, Moody's said: "There is little precedent to draw 
upon to predict the degree to which the federal bankruptcy court will protect 
debt holders." 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated downgradings are one of the factors likely to force 
institutional investors to start dumping Orange County bonds this morning, said 
Schotz. 
</P>
<P>
 Panicky investors already tried to unload Orange County bonds Tuesday, only to 
find that no one wanted them. And if it was difficult to sell the county's 
paper without drastic discounts before the Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy 
filing, it will only become more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, could create an opportunity for speculative investors who have 
faith that the county is a safe long-term bet and who would offer to buy bonds 
at much-reduced prices. "People used the same approach to pick up junk bonds 
and real estate when those markets hit the skids," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term prospects for Orange County are excellent," agreed Jeremy 
Ragus, California Tax Free Fund portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark 
in Boston. "There is no real general obligation debt" that encumbers the 
county's tax revenue "and it is a fast-growing, high-energy, wealthy community 
that is going to survive this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sanitation Districts found out Tuesday how scant the market 
was for Orange County debt. The agency could not find a buyer for $4 million 
worth of its notes -- basically interest-bearing IOUs -- as it tried to 
complete a scheduled refinancing of the paper, said Steve Kozak, the districts' 
financial manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard G. Paget, managing director and head of the municipal bond department 
at Baltimore-based Alex. Brown & Sons, said the situation "reminded me of the 
run on banks in the 1930s," when everyone tried to get their money out at the 
same time. "The situation was simple," Paget said. "People wanted their money 
out and couldn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 After offering prices of Orange County bonds continued to plunge Tuesday, they 
were generally 15% less than those of similar bonds from other municipalities. 
Prices are likely to fall much further today. 
</P>
<P>
 While uncertainty about Orange County's situation kept its bondholders and 
bankers on edge Tuesday, the overall bond market had a strong day as traders 
grew optimistic that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates enough to 
flatten inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields fell, continuing a weeklong rally in market prices. As yields 
fall, bond prices rise. The market's benchmark, the 30-year Treasury bond, was 
up 52.5 cents as its yield fell to 7.87% from 7.92%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is scrambling, we're under pressure to find (Treasury) bonds" 
because of high demand, said Rissy Mell, a trader at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Even foreign trading was affected as news about Orange County's problems 
spurred heavy bond sales on the Tokyo Exchange, traders there reported. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, however, conflicting rumors and reports about the Orange 
County situation "continue to foster a misinformed market" for those bonds, one 
trader said. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior executive at one of the four biggest Wall Street firms, who declined 
to be identified, said Orange County's bankruptcy was made inevitable after it 
hired a private firm that began approaching leading brokerages Monday to try to 
liquidate the county's huge holdings of derivatives -- a type of security whose 
value is linked to the market value of an underlying stock, bond, index or 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive said all of the firms approached turned the county down. They 
rejected taking on such a monumental task partly because they found that the 
funds' losses on the derivatives were much larger than the $1.5 billion that 
has been publicly reported. He declined to give a specific figure but said his 
firm concluded that it's "hundreds of millions" more than that, although not 
double the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't only large institutional bondholders who are asking questions that so 
far have no answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean?" bemoaned retiree Jack Brownstone, a Rancho Mirage 
resident who owns about $15,000 worth of Orange County bonds. "What happens to 
the value of my bond? Is it like when New York went bankrupt and the state 
guaranteed the funds?" 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar resident John Anderson, who says he owns a number of Orange County 
bonds through a municipal bond mutual fund, said Tuesday that he's afraid he 
could lose much-needed retirement income and is outraged that "somebody was 
allowed to mismanage funds to this degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Former county treasurer Robert L. Citron resigned Sunday amid increasing 
criticism of his high-risk investing style, but Anderson wonders if the blame 
should be placed on Citron alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how a person could be given that much authority without anyone 
else knowing about it," Anderson said, suggesting that county supervisors and 
financial officials of other agencies that collectively invested more than $7.5 
billion through Citron should have exercised more oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that government bankruptcies are rare, with the laws governing them 
somewhat different than for other bankruptcies, even some sophisticated money 
managers were clueless Tuesday about the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threatening to file bankruptcy is hysterical behavior unless there is 
something there that we don't know, (perhaps) that liabilities outweigh assets" 
in the county pool, said Fred Prager, a partner with the San Francisco bond 
trading firm of Prager, McCarthy & Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is groundbreaking material here," said W. Peck Ferrin, head municipal 
trader for Bank of America in San Francisco. "None of us has a handle on 
exactly what a Chapter 9 does" or how it affects bondholders. Bank of America 
is a leading underwriter of county bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major underwriter may have felt a sting from the bankruptcy rumors 
that circulated all day Tuesday. Merrill Lynch & Co., which has loaned the 
county $2.5 billion to purchase securities, saw its common stock drop $1 to 
$36.25 in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading. Bond Ratings: What They Mean 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bonds are rated according to their likelihood of going into 
default--the inability to pay interest to bondholders. Those rated AAA are 
considered least likely to default. Tuesday one of the nation's two major 
rating services, Standard & Poor's, indicated it is likely to drop Orange 
County's rating from AA to CCC. What the ratings signify: 03,34,11,10 Moody's 
Investors Standard Rating explanation Service & Poor's Highest quality Aaa AAA 
High quality Aa AA Upper medium grade A A Medium grade Baa BBB Predominantly 
speculative Ba BB Speculative, low grade B B Poor quality Caa CCC Highest 
speculation Ca CC Lowest quality, no interest paid C C In default DDD In 
arrears DD Questionable value D Source: Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; CRISIS MAY PUNCTURE DREAMS FOR FUTURE; PROJECTS: PLANS FOR 
IMPROVEMENTS LIKE A NEW BASEBALL STADIUM DEPEND ON THE ABILITY TO SELL BONDS.

 Within hours of the county's decision to seek bankruptcy protection and freeze 
its assets, an icy breeze blew through other local governments Tuesday night. 
Suddenly, big-ticket projects seemed not so certain. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, officials postponed plans to rescind a hotly debated utility 
tax. In Anaheim, where officials like to boast of 21st-Century projects 
expanding Disneyland and adding a new baseball stadium, the word was caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will absolutely have an impact on everything," said Anaheim City 
Manager James D. Ruth, referring to the Disney and stadium projects. "We will 
be looking at all major projects in the city, including all capital improvement 
projects, to see if we're going to freeze them." 
</P>
<P>
 Between lavish theme park resorts and new baseball stadiums, Orange County's 
dreams for the next century hinge on bonds. With the county's bond rating 
plummeting and the likelihood of cities having problems in the bond market as 
well, some of these dreams may have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is incredibly difficult. I think it would be extremely difficult 
for the city to make any long-term commitments," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's bond woes may also spell trouble for the Save the Rams 
organization, which has suggested bond financing as one way to build the NFL 
football team a new stadium and keep it in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county officials expressed worry as well. "There's a number of projects 
in which the county could be looked to to provide financial backing. We may 
have to put some of those things off until we get the issue of long-term 
security addressed," said Ken Moore, president of the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's decision to file for bankruptcy protection Tuesday is almost 
sure to result in a lower bond rating. And a lower rating can mean the county 
will have to pay higher interest rates, which could add thousands if not 
millions of dollars to capital projects, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a worst-cast scenario, the bankruptcy could result in Wall Street 
rejecting all of the county's new bond issuances altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to put Orange County in a very bad position," said Lou Feldman, a 
Los Angeles lawyer who heads his firm's capital markets group in Orange County. 
"The widows and orphans will probably steer clear of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot, he said, is that projects that are expected to produce 
revenue, like the Walt Disney Co.'s proposed $3-billion resort in Anaheim, do 
not depend entirely on county financing and could be better protected from the 
fallout. "I don't think it's a death knell for the Disneyland project," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Anaheim was pondering its future, others were more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ellis, spokesman for a group of local businessmen who want to build a 
commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station when it closes in 
1999, said the county financial crisis will not affect plans to build the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airports are financed primarily by revenue bonds. The revenues generated by 
the facility are used to pay bondholders," Ellis said. "You notice that bonds 
sold to pay for John Wayne Airport were not affected. By federal law, JWA bonds 
are an enterprise fund, separate from the the county's portfolio."

 County employees went about their work with growing worry and questions 
Tuesday, wondering how their jobs may be affected by the deepening financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees Assn., which 
represents more than 11,000 county workers, said he had few answers to 
questions coming into his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at the moment we're kind of treading water, not able to inform our 
members about what's going on because we don't know ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees calling the Orange County Employees Retirement System office 
received more reassuring news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The retirement (system) is still secure and we are operating as normal," said 
Terry Slattery, an investment analyst there. "There is no impact on our 
operations or any of the benefits we pay out." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley also sought to allay fears 
Tuesday and stressed that all county employees will continue to receive their 
paychecks and other basic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, employees wondered throughout the day how they would fare in the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Bond, a senior accounting assistant with the county Environmental 
Management Agency, said she worried that major projects countywide will be 
placed on hold and that her own personal credit rating could be affected. Her 
co-workers, particularly those near retirement who have money set aside in a 
deferred compensation fund, have been gravely concerned about the instability 
of the county's troubled investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a lot of big dreams," said "I don't know how they can 
materialize with the fund out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said that he and his wife also have a considerable amount of money 
invested in deferred compensation, but he said that county counsel assured him 
Tuesday that the county is legally obligated to pay that money. He said, 
however, that the crisis may delay payments. 
</P>
<P>
 County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron resigned Monday. On Tuesday, 
employees at the treasurer and tax collector's offices said the phones were 
ringing constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 investors had called the treasurer's office by lunch time looking 
for the acting treasurer, who was not available to take their calls, said 
Veronica Deves, the office's operations manager  
</P>
<P>
 "We have been swamped with calls, but we don't know anything so we can't say 
anything," she said. "We just tell them, 'Look at your newspaper.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Employees talked tearfully about Citron's resignation and described him as a 
man who cared deeply about his workers, recommending herbal teas for them when 
they got sick and encouraging all of them to do their best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all sad to see him go, being such an honest man," said Martha Gonzalez, 
a secretary in the office. "We're just not talking about anything. We really 
don't know ourselves what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of his employees are behind him, all of them," said a tax collector's 
office employee, who asked she not be named and left abruptly when she began to 
cry. "He's the only politician I have known who has been completely honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were planning on sending Citron a bouquet of flowers Tuesday, and 
many were writing him letters to convey their sadness, over the resignation, 
said Linda, an 18-year-employee who declined to give her last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all very sorry and upset that he resigned," she said. "I think he was 
pressured. He's a fighter when he has a good cause."

JOYOUS REUNION FOR MOTHER, CHILD; FBI, RUSSIAN AGENCY JOIN FORCES TO RESCUE 
GIRL 11 MONTHS AFTER ABDUCTION FROM L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Her boyfriend said he was taking her 2-year-old daughter on a birthday visit 
to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Nataliya Kaminskaya's little girl began an international odyssey 
nearly a year ago when she was kidnaped to Russia from her Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the FBI disclosed that Monique Michelle was rescued by its 
counterpart in Moscow -- Russian MVD agents helping to enforce a new U.S. law 
that prohibits international parental abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler played at her mother's feet and sang nursery rhymes in Russian as 
the 38-year-old Kaminskaya thanked FBI agents at their Westwood headquarters 
and observed: "So many things have changed in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Suspected kidnaper Michael Belakovsky, a Russian businessman who had been 
running an import company in the Hollywood area, will be extradited to the 
United States under the new law. He could face both federal and state charges, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This law became effective three weeks before Monique's abduction," said 
Charlie Parsons, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. "This 
is the very first indictment under this statute." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury unanimously indicted Belakovsky, 63, although he is not 
the girl's father, Parsons said. The kidnaping apparently "wasn't for the love 
of the child, but to harm the mother," he said. Neither he nor the mother would 
identify the child's father or disclose any specific motive for the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminskaya, a hairdresser who has lived in this country for three years, said 
she and Belakovsky had been friends for several months before Monique's 
disappearance last Dec. 29. She said Belakovsky would sometimes baby-sit the 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she called a private investigator after the abduction and toyed with 
the idea of asking for help from the famed Israeli intelligence agency, the 
Mossad, before a friend urged her to contact the FBI. "My friend said, 'We've 
lived in America many years, we have to believe in them,' " Kaminskaya 
explained.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminskaya feared the worst when Belakovsky wrote and warned: "You'll never 
see your baby again, never.' "  
</P>
<P>
 The Russian MVD -- short for Ministry of Internal Affairs -- took up the case 
in July when FBI Director Louis J. Freeh visited Moscow to meet with the 
ministry's organized crime office. 
</P>
<P>
 Belakovsky was arrested Nov. 23. Although no extradition treaty exists between 
the United States and Russia, authorities here voiced confidence that he will 
soon be returned.  
</P>
<P>
 "This represents one of the first tangible results of our new relationship 
with Russian law enforcement," Parsons said. But it's unlikely to be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Parsons said, the FBI is launching its own "Russian organized crime 
squad" to investigate crimes ranging from money-laundering to murder for hire 
among the estimated 500,000 Russian immigrants living in the Los Angeles area, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to learn from our experience. In the 1930s, law enforcement was 
very slow to attack the Cosa Nostra," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her rescue, Monique was living in Cyprus with Belakovsky's 
girlfriend, investigators said. Well cared for during the 11 months, she was 
reunited with her mother and her 15-year-old sister, Stella, on Friday. 
Russian-speaking FBI agent Pakala Bennett escorted her home from Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminskaya said Monique will celebrate her third birthday Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll cook a big cake," she said. And there won't be any Disney characters on 
top, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put the three letters on it. FBI."

FIRE CHIEF SAYS VIDEO OF WOMEN IS HARMLESS; PERSONNEL: OFFICIALS CRITICIZE HIS 
STAND BEFORE FIRE COMMISSION. TAPE SHOWS FEMALE RECRUITS STRUGGLING WITH 
TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Facing sharp criticism from incredulous city officials, Los Angeles Fire Chief 
Donald O. Manning and the captain who edited a controversial video of female 
recruits making repeated mistakes defended the tape Tuesday at a Fire 
Commission hearing, insisting that it was a harmless production not meant to 
ridicule women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was intended to be a sort of bloopers-like tape," Capt. Steve Owens said 
of the video, which features such scenes as women dropping ladders on 
themselves and a female recruit injuring her shoulder during training drills 
last year at the Fire Academy. "It was intended to be humorous." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said he viewed a portion of the hourlong video two weeks ago and 
ordered an internal investigation that found no wrongdoing. Still, the chief 
ordered that the tape no longer be shown because it might be "misinterpreted" 
as demeaning to women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that would . . . bring any discredit, discomfort, we do not 
condone," said a stern-faced Manning, who was interrupted several times by Fire 
Commissioner Leslie Song Winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the tape, and I think it's just outrageous," she said at one point. 
"It just makes you sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, meanwhile, introduced a motion Tuesday 
requesting an independent city investigation to determine how many firefighters 
were involved in taping and producing the video, how widely it has been 
distributed and whether any disciplinary action is warranted. Ridley-Thomas' 
request for a probe by the chief legislative analyst, the city administrative 
officer and Personnel Department will be debated by the council next week. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Hall news conference, he and two other council members said they 
were deeply disturbed that top fire officials would characterize the video as a 
harmless compilation of bloopers. Such comments, the council members said, show 
that insensitivity is prevalent at all levels of the 3,100-member department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that those (officials) at the top of the department just 
don't get it," said Ridley-Thomas, who has seen the video. "It's our job to see 
that they do get it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, dismissing the chief's characterization of the 
video as innocuous, said the tape can be interpreted in only one way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it is a humiliating and degrading film," Goldberg said she 
concluded after seeing the video. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Rita Walters agreed, saying: "I am really shocked by the 
existence of such a film." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Fire Commission meeting, about 20 minutes of the video was shown on 
a large screen as department members filled the room to catch a glimpse of the 
tape and the unfolding drama. One floor below, in City Hall East, another 40 or 
so firefighters gathered in a room to watch a simulcast of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Manning said he was only going to show one scene of recruits raising 
a ladder. But Winner, who sharply questioned the chief and Owens, insisted that 
one scene would not provide an accurate depiction of the video. She prevailed.  
</P>
<P>
 Immediately before the video's airing, Manning said he did not consider the 
footage offensive and that he had difficulty determining which recruits were 
men and which were women because they were decked out in bulky protective garb 
and sometimes wore face masks. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony, Manning did not say precisely when he ordered his 
investigation of the video, which was reported in The Times on Monday. But the 
department's spokesman, Assistant Chief Dean E. Cathey, said the probe was 
under way when the chief first viewed the video two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Winner also criticized the chief for notifying only the 
board president, Elizabeth Lowe, and not the entire five-member commission 
about the existence of the video. Winner demanded that Manning provide the 
commission with a copy of his investigation, which the chief said he would do. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain who edited the video told the commission that he destroyed the 
original copy after he, like the chief, realized that it could be 
misinterpreted. He said he did not know how the other copies were made or who 
circulated them. Firefighters have told The Times that the video was shown at a 
number of stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure of the video has added fresh fuel to growing concerns over 
whether the Fire Department -- long considered one of the nation's best -- has 
discriminated against minorities and women. Last month, the city's Personnel 
Department released a stinging audit that found that white males dominate the 
department's top posts and that women and minorities have been harassed and 
given unfair evaluations by supervisors, all in an effort to run them off the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of the videotape was first revealed in the audit, which quoted a 
firefighter as saying that copies were floating around firehouses but did not 
mention how widely distributed they were or who made them. The firefighter 
referred to the video as "female follies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Owens, the video's editor, told fire commissioners that the tape was 
really called "drill tower follies" because the footage shows situations 
involving both men and women -- an explanation that drew a sharp response from 
Winner. She said firefighters told her that it was actually called "female 
firefighter follies" and that the video only showed women making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner questioned how humorous it was to show the female recruit injuring her 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Winner: "I don't think she found that funny."

SUPERVISORS' MEETINGS TO BE AIRED; COUNTY BOARD: NEW MEMBER ZEV YAROSLAVSKY 
WINS PUSH FOR TELEVISING THE WEEKLY SESSIONS. THE BROADCASTS COULD BEGIN BY 
MARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Powered by its media-savvy newest member, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors entered the television age Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky joined Gloria Molina -- herself no stranger to the 
lure of publicity -- and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke in approving a proposal to 
televise the board's weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 In his inauguration speech Monday, Yaroslavsky had made televised board 
meetings one of the key components of his bid to open up county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1987, Ronald Reagan stood in front of the Berlin Wall and challenged 
Mikhail Gorbachev to 'tear down this wall.' Today, I ask my new colleagues to 
join me in tearing down the barriers we have erected between the people of Los 
Angeles County and their government. Let's televise our meetings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina, who presided over her first meeting as board chairwoman Tuesday, 
likewise has long argued that televised meetings would make county officials 
more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 But she had previously failed to sway her colleagues, who had voiced 
reluctance to spend the money -- officials estimate annual broadcast costs at 
$300,000 -- at a time when the cash-strapped county is fighting to preserve 
basic services. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the third vote was provided by Burke, who despite misgivings about 
the costs of the plan yielded to the enthusiasm of her two colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich opposed the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should we be spending money while we are in the most severe budget crisis in 
county history?" Dana asked. "Are we making sense by using these funds for what 
some might call self-aggrandizement?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Yaroslavsky, joining his first debate as a supervisor, spoke out 
forcefully in support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about promoting board members as individuals, it's about promoting 
the board to the public," he said. "Don't get caught up in this budget stuff. 
There are 100,000 things we do that the public would put their thumbs down to 
if they knew we were doing them. But there's a reason why we do the things we 
do and a justification; $300,000 to bring the board to the public is not a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The county will put out bids for production and distribution services. 
Officials estimate that meetings could be broadcast by the end of March, most 
likely on KLCS, which is operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said the supervisors must be more creative in how they manage resources 
and govern the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forging partnerships with other local governments to deliver services is an 
idea I would like to pursue; what we cannot afford on our own may be possible 
if these cost-cutting local partnerships are created." 
</P>
<P>
 She urged creation of a body of county, state and federal officials that would 
work to solve county problems, as well as a new budget committee that would 
meet monthly to improve the county's fiscal planning.

COURT BACKS 2 FIRED TRANSIT INVESTIGATORS; LITIGATION: APPELLATE RULING MEANS 
THEY CAN USE KEY CLAIMS IN SUIT AGAINST MTA AT TRIAL. THEY SAY THEY WERE 
DISCHARGED AFTER ALLEGING CONTRACT COVER-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An appellate court has found that two Los Angeles transit investigators appear 
to have been fired in 1990 for raising allegations of an agency cover-up and 
confronting their boss about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The state 2nd District Court of Appeal, in a ruling issued last week, refused 
to throw out several key claims made by the investigators. That clears the way 
for the two men to press their case at an upcoming trial that promises to shed 
light on several controversial practices in the awarding of lucrative contracts 
by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 To throw out the claims and shield transit officials from any liability in the 
firings, the appellate justices said in their decision, "would emasculate the 
entire effect and purpose" of state laws that protect so-called 
whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Laster, 57, of Garden Grove and Richard N. Yeats, 49, of Los Angeles 
were fired as investigators for the Southern California Rapid Transit District 
in the summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great vindication for us. We're just thrilled to death," Laster said. 
"We haven't won a penny . . . but finally it looks like somebody is saying 
there was a lot of truth in what we were saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Laster and Yeats contend that they were fired for simply doing their jobs too 
well. But lawyers for the MTA, created in 1993 after the RTD merged with 
another transit agency, said they hope to show at the trial that transit 
officials were well within their rights in dismissing them -- for reasons that 
the MTA refuses to divulge. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute centers on allegations that an Atlanta telecommunications firm was 
fraudulently awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in RTD contracts in the 
1980s as a disadvantaged minority business -- in part through the forged 
signature of a district employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Laster and Yeats were assigned to investigate the allegations in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They said they uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in the awarding of the 
contract to Communications International Inc., suggesting that the company 
might be a front for a non-minority business. But the investigators said they 
were stymied by the refusal of top RTD officials to cooperate with their 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 One district employee critical to the probe told the investigators that he was 
warned by RTD Inspector General Ernesto V. Fuentes that his career was 
"stagnant" and that he should not cooperate any further in the investigation, 
according to the appellate court record. 
</P>
<P>
 Laster and Yeats met with Fuentes in July, 1990, to discuss the issue, telling 
the inspector general that they had named him in their investigative report for 
allegedly making "intimidating" statements to the district employee, the 
appellate court said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fuentes angrily retorted: 'Are you accusing me of a crime?' " and threw the 
investigators out of his office, the court wrote. But later that same day, he 
summoned them back under an armed escort and fired them, ordering them to clean 
out their desks immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes no longer works for the district, and he could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court said Laster and Yeats uncovered evidence of a cover-up and 
were not -- as the MTA's lawyers claimed -- merely repeating complaints that 
had already been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact," the court said, "their findings appear to confirm that (Laster and 
Yeats) were summarily terminated after raising allegations of a cover-up and 
reporting criticism of Fuentes for his alleged role in intimidating a key 
witness." 
</P>
<P>
 The court said the firings may have violated the investigators' 1st Amendment 
rights and, in light of their "exemplary" records and the absence of any other 
reasons for their removal, may have been "retaliatory." A trial court should 
now decide, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy County Counsel Charles M. Safer, one of the lawyers representing the 
MTA, said the appellate decision "wasn't a total surprise" after the questions 
the justices had raised during oral arguments. But he said the MTA will now 
have a chance to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not put our case on," he said. "Other than the fact that these two 
employees were terminated, there are still a lot of disputed facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Safer said the investigators were serving at the pleasure of RTD officials so 
they could be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to discuss in detail why the men were fired or whether the 
decision related to their investigation into Communication International, but 
he said: "Essentially what it comes down to is their work product and whether 
their employers had confidence in their work." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Yee, attorney for the investigators, said she expects a trial date to 
be set Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Laster, who has worked sporadically in racetrack security since his firing, 
and Yeats, a tax law researcher, are each seeking $1 million in damages from 
the district. Both say they have been unable to find steady work in the 
investigative field since their dismissals. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil suit is not the first time that Communications International and its 
minority-business contracts have proven controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. Treasurer Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, once a prominent Latina in 
the Bush Administration, pleaded guilty earlier this year to concealing her 
business ties to the Atlanta company, among other charges. The Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office investigated the question of whether the 
company was fraudulently awarded minority business contracts, but did not bring 
any charges. And the FBI is now looking at that same issue in Los Angeles and 
elsewhere.

TRANSFERS BLOCKED BY CHARTER SCHOOL; EDUCATION: THREAT OF LEGAL ACTION STOPS 
L.A. DISTRICT'S PLANS TO REASSIGN EDUTRAIN DROPOUT FACILITY'S ENROLLMENT OF 
230. STUDENTS REMAIN ANXIOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Threats of legal action by directors of a charter school for dropouts abruptly 
stopped the Los Angeles Unified School District's first attempt to close the 
troubled Downtown campus Tuesday, but did little to assuage student fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Monday's school board vote to shut the independent school, a 
group of district administrators and teachers arrived at Edutrain Charter 
School at 8 a.m. Tuesday, planning to transfer out about 230 students. But they 
were headed off in the front office with news of the expected litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're on hold," said Dick Browning, director of high schools for 
the district and leader of the group. "We don't want the kids to get hurt in an 
adult problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Worry and anger seeped into the Grand Avenue school's classrooms and corridors 
anyway. Many of Edutrain's students landed there after trying -- and failing at 
-- several other public schools. . 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have 35 credits -- that's half of a freshman -- and I'm 18," said 
Dereck Figueroa, who began at Edutrain this fall and is on probation for a 
bus-tagging arrest. "I've been to at least 10 schools all around. I don't think 
any other schools would accept me and, if they did, I couldn't get along." 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain President Winston Doby carried word of the planned litigation into a 
morning math class, where he pleaded with glum students to keep coming to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't give up, and tell your friends to continue coming to school too," he 
said. "We're going to fight for you because we believe you deserve the 
opportunity that this school is giving you." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one youth raised his hand when Doby asked for questions, but he voiced 
the common concern: What would become of him if the school ultimately closes? 
</P>
<P>
 Doby said it was concern for the students' fate that led school directors to 
vote to file suit next week against the Los Angeles Unified School District. In 
an action that marked the first charter school failure in the nation, the 
district decided Monday evening to shut Edutrain because it had become mired in 
debt and record-keeping problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to ensure that the school continues to operate until this issue 
is resolved, so the students don't have to transfer somewhere else and then 
transfer back," Doby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doby, who helped found the school in July, 1993, and is also a UCLA vice 
chancellor, said Edutrain will challenge the closure on grounds that there was 
inadequate proof that the school had violated its charter contract with the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school will ask a judge to issue a temporary restraining order and 
force Los Angeles Unified to continue funding Edutrain while the suit is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified officials said they halted plans to begin transferring 
students Tuesday to see what happens in court, but they maintain that state 
charter law is on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation approved in 1992 allows 100 charter schools -- 10 of them in Los 
Angeles -- to operate largely free of outside control. But, local school 
districts must approve the five-year charter contracts and have the right to 
cancel them if their stated goals are not reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Edutrain officials) don't want us in the picture at this time, that's 
their wish," said Bill Rivera, spokesman for district Supt. Sid Thompson. "But 
what the board did last night was final." 
</P>
<P>
 The board acted on Thompson's recommendation to revoke the charter, based on 
staff reports that the school's accounting and roll-taking procedures were 
inadequate, even though the district had spent weeks trying to help correct the 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members also were influenced by allegations that while teachers lacked 
books and supplies, administrators treated themselves to expensive retreats and 
a housing allowance for the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Doby has acknowledged the past problems, but claims that many of them have 
been solved since the school underwent an administrative overhaul in early 
November. The school had asked the board for a three-month extension of its 
charter contract to enable it to complete a reorganization plan, pay off some 
of its about $1-million debt and continue its classes for troubled teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The very things that brought teen-agers to Edutrain in numbers peaking at more 
than 500 last spring may make it difficult to find alternative programs for 
them -- arrest records, gang affiliations, repeated academic failures, babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Gonzalez, 21, dropped out of school nearly four years ago when she 
became pregnant. She tried to return to her regular high school after her 
baby's birth, but was told that at 18 she was too old. She tried to find other 
programs that provided child care, but was told waiting lists were too long. 
She started working with an independent study program, but it closed up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the only one for me," said Gonzalez, whose 3-year-old son spends 
most days in Edutrain's on-site child-care center. "Now they want to take it 
away too. What a great city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain's student body is two-thirds Latino, one-third African American. 
About 85% of the students have arrest records; 15% are on probation and 
reporting to a resident probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers there estimate that dozens of gangs are represented at the school, 
yet its walls have remained remarkably graffiti-free and there have been no 
serious gang fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members who attend Edutrain say it is viewed as neutral turf, the first 
example of that many of them have ever experienced and a tribute to the 
painstaking efforts of teachers and staff to resolve conflicts peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "At other schools the gang thing was always going on, people saying it was 
their neighborhood and all . . . and I have a temper," said Undra Williams, 17, 
who came to Edutrain nine months ago after an unfocused stint with a home-study 
program and several stints in juvenile detention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, I don't have to worry about no gangs," Williams said. "And the teachers 
sit down and talk with you like you're a real person. . . . I can't go back to 
a regular school." 
</P>
<P>
 But Browning, the district high school director, expressed confidence that 
transfers could be arranged for all of Edutrain's students. "Kids do get 
attached to their school and don't want to leave it, and that's the kind of kid 
we would expect at Edutrain," Browning said. "But we probably have more 
alternatives than they're aware of."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROSEMEAD; BOY DROWNED 
IN WASHING MACHINE, AUTOPSY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An autopsy performed Tuesday confirmed that a 2-year-old boy who fell into a 
washing machine died of "accidental drowning," a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Moreno was found by his grandmother about 10 minutes after the accident 
Sunday night.Pathologists detected no signs of foul play, said Deputy Jeff 
Cannon.  
</P>
<P>
 The toddler was taken to Garfield Medical Center after someone called 911. 
Deputies who arrived at the scene found Robert Moreno, whose wife also was 
home, trying to revive his son.  
</P>
<P>
 "The top of the washer was propped open during the wash cycle because of a 
faulty mechanism," Deputy Diane Hecht said. "The boy apparently crawled on top 
of a top-loading washing machine (that was) running in the kitchen and fell 
in."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CRENSHAW DISTRICT; 
REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT'S EXPANSION WINS APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two years of study and debate, a plan to greatly expand the Crenshaw 
Redevelopment Project was unanimously approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, endorsed by the district's councilman, Mark Ridley-Thomas, enables 
the city's Community Redevelopment Agency to increase the project area by more 
than 150 acres to encompass Leimert Park Village, Santa Barbara Plaza and areas 
along Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the area in the project zone will enable city officials to use bond 
financing for redevelopment and eminent domain to condemn commercial properties 
that block redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal arose after the 1992 riots leveled many neighborhoods in the 
city, including some properties surrounding the nearby Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials lauded the action as a way of hastening the area's 
reconstruction, critics -- including some residents and merchants -- described 
the expanded redevelopment project as a land grab by the CRA.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; FIGURE 
IN DENNY CASE GETS 3 YEARS IN ATTACK ON OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gang member convicted of spitting on truck driver Reginald O. Denny and 
attacking another man during the 1992 riots was sentenced Tuesday to three 
years in prison for attacking police officers seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Lamar Brown pleaded guilty to charges of attempted lynching for the 
May 7 attack on police officers in the 1500 block of 70th Street in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 26, was sentenced after pleading guilty to one count of assault and one 
count of misdemeanor battery. He will receive credit for 399 days already 
served. 
</P>
<P>
 During the riots, Brown was convicted of attacking a Latino who had gotten off 
a bus in front of Tom's Liquor store, then spitting on Denny as he was beaten 
in front of the truck he was driving. Brown received a two-year prison term in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's attack, Brown and a "bunch of gang members" were at his home 
when two police officers attempted to impound friend Steven Poindexter's car, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 Poindexter, sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison in the incident, led an 
attack on the officers, Morrison said. The group pulled the officers into the 
house where they were attacked.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DIRECTOR 
OF MINNEAPOLIS LIBRARY HIRED BY L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of the Minneapolis Public Library will become Los Angeles' new 
city librarian, officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Goldberg Kent will succeed Elizabeth Martinez, who left this year to 
become executive director of the American Library Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the Los Angeles Public Library, Kent will oversee the renovated and 
expanded Central Library, 66 branches, four bookmobiles and a $37.4-million 
operating budget.  
</P>
<P>
 "Susan is superbly qualified for this job," Library Commission President Gary 
Ross said. "In addition to her vast expertise, she brings an energy and 
dynamism that will propel this library system into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan said Kent will be "a wonderful addition" to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Libraries are a special passion of mine, and I honestly can't imagine anyone 
better to guide this system and to make it prosper," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kent, who has worked in Minneapolis since 1990, said she is looking forward to 
coming to Los Angeles. She also has experience providing consulting services to 
libraries and nonprofit institutions in the areas of organization and board 
development, fund-raising, marketing and public relations, training, networking 
and resource-sharing.  
</P>
<P>
 Before going to Minneapolis, she was deputy director of the Tucson Public 
Library for 6 1/2 years and managing director of the Arizona Theatre Company 
for two years.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTLAKE; LANDLORD 
FINED $19,000 FOR 10 CODE VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a four-story Westlake-area apartment house pleaded no contest to 
10 health and safety and fire and building code violations and was fined more 
than $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Judge Barry Taylor also ordered Fereydoun Houriani, 36, 
to make repairs on the property or return ownership to the mortgage holder by 
Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor also placed Houriani, of Brentwood, on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge dismissed similar charges against Houriani's parents, part owners of 
the building. The charges, filed Aug. 24, grew out of inspections by the city's 
Slum Housing Task Force, according to City Atty. James Hahn.  
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors found numerous fire and safety violations on the property, 
including broken windows and doors, rodent and cockroach infestations, 
unsanitary bathrooms, and damaged walls, floors and ceilings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houriani told the judge that the 51-unit apartment house at 914 S. Alvarado 
St. is the subject of foreclosure proceedings.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
AGREES TO REVEAL DELIBERATIONS IN LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council agreed Tuesday to obey a court order to open the 
record of closed-door deliberations in a lawsuit that could affect future 
payments of punitive damages for police brutality.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts issued the order Monday in a lawsuit that 
seeks to make council members personally liable for paying punitive damages in 
excessive force cases. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James Hahn hopes that disclosure of the closed-door records will 
prove that the council does not foster a policy of condoning police brutality.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Hahn said he wants to protect the council's right to 
continue meeting behind closed doors when they discuss litigation against the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Stephen Yagman filed the federal suit on behalf of the daughter of 
one of three men killed by police in a shootout after robbing a McDonald's in 
Sunland in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit alleging excessive force, a jury awarded 5-year-old Johanna 
Trevino $44,000 in punitive damages against ex-Chief Daryl F. Gates and nine 
officers.  
</P>
<P>
 Yagman filed the latest lawsuit after the council, as a matter of routine, 
voted to spend government funds to cover the damages.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HUSBAND, 
65, CONVICTED OF STRANGLING HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 65-year-old man was convicted of second-degree murder Tuesday for strangling 
his wife of 42 years, then burying her body beneath their home.  
</P>
<P>
 Henry Castorena showed no reaction when the court clerk read the verdict, 
which came nearly three weeks after the Los Angeles Superior Court jury began 
its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Castorena faces 15 years to life in prison when he is sentenced by Superior 
Court Judge Mary Ann Murphy on Jan. 3 for the murder of his 64-year-old wife, 
Hortencia.  
</P>
<P>
 Her body was discovered Nov. 13, 1993, after the family dog began digging 
under the house. The animal ran to the nearby home of the couple's daughter and 
kept barking until she and her husband went to the house and found the body.  
</P>
<P>
 Castorena had been arrested two months earlier when his wife could not be 
found, but he was released for lack of evidence.

POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR DWP PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to cool off a flap with Mayor Richard Riordan, the Los Angeles 
Police Department disclosed Tuesday that it is ready to pay fair market value 
to a sister city agency for land for a key police training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision appears to end a dispute that began after a surprised Police 
Department learned recently that the Department of Water and Power, with the 
blessing of Riordan, expected the LAPD to pay $6 million for a 44-acre parcel 
that police want to use as an emergency vehicle and firearms training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP's request that it be paid market value for the land was initially seen 
by the LAPD as a betrayal of what it believed was a long-standing gentleman's 
agreement with the city-owned utility. Since 1986, the Police Department has 
assumed that it would be able to lease the parcel for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel is located on the west side of the Golden State Freeway between 
Granada Hills and Sylmar. The cost of constructing the training facility -- not 
including land costs -- is estimated to be $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its initial reservations, the LAPD has recognized the need of adapting 
to the Riordan Administration's fiscal philosophy, including its belief that 
departments -- like businesses -- ought to pay for assets they acquire, even 
from another city agency, said LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish, head of the police 
facilities construction group. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalish said the property's fair market value, as determined by the appraisal, 
would be the starting point for negotiations with the DWP to establish the 
final price the LAPD will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic that we can come to a fair resolution of this matter," Kalish 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley praised the LAPD's position as "exactly the way to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Councilwoman Laura Chick on Tuesday continued to question the 
propriety and wisdom of the sale, saying she still wants the council to 
consider a motion she introduced last week to review the Riordan plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley lawmaker said she wants to know what impact paying 
market value for the parcel will have on the LAPD's ability to meet its other 
facility demands. LAPD capital projects are to be paid with receipts from a 
$176-million bond issue, approved by voters in 1989, she said. At the very 
least, a multimillion-dollar payment to DWP would force the LAPD to reorder or 
drop some of its projects.

LAPD TO TEST NEW WORKWEEK IN EFFORT TO IMPROVE MORALE; POLICE: OFFICERS IN 
HARBOR, RAMPART, WILSHIRE AND VAN NUYS DIVISIONS WILL BEGIN PILOT PROGRAM OF 
THREE 12-HOUR SHIFTS WITH EXTRA MAKEUP DAY ONCE A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they hope it will boost morale, Los Angeles police officials are 
putting patrol officers in four divisions on a schedule of three 12-hour days 
per week in an experiment that could eventually become the norm citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong pilot program calls for officers to switch from a traditional 
workweek to a dramatically shortened schedule beginning Jan. 22. Under the 
program, patrol officers at the Van Nuys, Rampart, Wilshire and Harbor 
divisions will work three 12-hour shifts a week; detectives will work four 
10-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the compressed schedule say the shorter workweek will boost 
morale without incurring extra expenses by allowing officers to spend more time 
with their families and less time commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers have resigned to join other departments that offer such 
schedules, police officials and union leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees want it," said Capt. Richard Eide of the Van Nuys Division. 
"Happy, satisfied officers treat people better and they work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 By providing greater flexibility in scheduling, Eide said, the new schedule 
also holds the potential to allow the LAPD to do more of the community-based 
policing that the department is emphasizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because patrol officers will work fewer hours in each standard workweek, they 
will "owe" an extra day's work to the department at the end of each four-week 
period. On these catch-up days, commanders will be able to assign officers to 
special projects, Eide said, painting a scenario in which up to 75 officers 
could be deployed to "saturate" a community and drum up support for 
neighborhood policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has determined that the new schedule does not violate federal 
labor laws that sometimes hinder private employers who try to implement such 
plans, Eide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nearly half the state's law enforcement agencies are believed to 
offer shortened workweeks, the LAPD is the first large agency to venture into 
compressed schedules, said Dennis Zine, a director of the Los Angeles Police 
Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 Under orders from Police Chief Willie L. Williams, a committee was formed 
following the Northridge earthquake to study the effects of a compressed 
schedule after damaged highways made it difficult for officers, many of whom 
commute from distant suburbs, to travel to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Zine said the only concerns voiced over the program have come from officers at 
the Rampart Division, who have heavier court loads than officers in other 
areas. He said police officials have been holding conversations with court 
administrators in an effort to provide officers with more flexibility when it 
comes to appearing in court to testify.  
</P>
<P>
 "Officers have been waiting for this for years," Harbor Division patrol Capt. 
Betty Kelepcz said. "There are a lot of people that want to work it." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, officers assigned to the new work schedule will be fatigued late in 
their shifts, but that effect will subside in two to three months, Kelepcz 
said, quoting an LAPD study. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental schedule appears to have won the approval of even one of the 
department's toughest critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea," said James Fyfe, a former New York City police 
officer and professor of criminal justice at Temple University in Philadelphia, 
who co-wrote a book on police brutality. Fyfe, who has previously criticized 
the LAPD for being "insular and out of touch" when it comes to use of force, 
embraced the concept of fewer workdays for LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost by nature their work schedule is bizarre and unnatural," Fyfe said. 
"This will be a morale booster, especially in Los Angeles, where cops work so 
far away from where they live." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Lewin, professor and vice dean at the Anderson Graduate School of 
Management at UCLA, said that because police work requires officers to deal so 
much with the public, the officers' job performance, susceptibility to injury 
and illness, and fatigue levels must be monitored closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an open question," Lewin said of the compressed schedule. "After 
all, do you want someone breaking up a family dispute in the 11th hour of their 
shift or the first hour of their shift?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the concept is so popular among LAPD officers that over the last 
month or so Van Nuys Division commander Eide has received 20 requests from 
officers seeking to transfer to his division. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Police Chief Tom Mahoney said employee turnover and on-duty 
injuries and traffic accidents have significantly decreased since his 
department switched to a compressed schedule nearly identical to the one the 
LAPD is about to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe productivity is just as high if not higher, and our citizen 
complaints have become virtually nonexistent," said Mahoney, whose 33 officers 
police 3 1/2 square miles.

REYNOLDS, ANDERSON END THEIR SPAT; PARENTS: THE CELEBRITIES LEAVE COURT 
HAND-IN-HAND AFTER REACHING ACCORD ON SUPPORT PAYMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTED SON. 
TERMS OF AGREEMENT ARE NOT DISCLOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson entered a Van Nuys courtroom through separate 
doors Tuesday, but they left hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of excruciatingly detailed testimony about Reynolds' foundering 
financial affairs, the couple hammered out an agreement about how much monthly 
child support he should pay for their adopted 6-year-old son, Quinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached in Superior Court Judge Robert M. Letteau's 
chambers, and the transcript was sealed, so it could not be learned whether 
Reynolds will pay more or less than the $15,000-a-month he had been paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and Anderson did not disclose terms of the settlement, giving only 
brief statements and refusing to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've reached a decision amicably for our son's sake, who we love very much," 
Anderson told reporters during a brief news conference on the courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burt has been very generous to take care of his son, and we're friends," said 
Anderson, who wore a fitted red suit with a plunging neckline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting married," quipped Reynolds, who wore jeans and blue-suede 
boots. "Pick on Kevin Costner or somebody else. This saga is over. Let's put it 
to bed. We're thrilled about the outcome because it's all for Quinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, relations between the two were much chillier. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Tuesday morning why she and Reynolds did not acknowledge each other in 
court, Anderson said: "We've been separated for a year and a half. We don't 
have anything to say to each other. This is all about taking care of someone 
who's 6 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 The former spouses brought His and Hers accountants to court to dissect the 
actor's financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But settlement talks began in earnest after Reynolds' accountant, under 
questioning by the judge Tuesday, estimated the actor's net worth at $5 
million. On Monday, Reynolds had testified that the accountant told him that 
his net worth was minus $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had sought up to $17,000 a month for Quinton, but Reynolds had said 
he could only afford $7,000 a month. Anderson's lawyer contends that Reynolds 
makes $260,000 a month, while his lawyers maintain that the figure is $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has suffered some financial setbacks during the past year. He no 
longer can count on having a hit television show; "Evening Shade" was canceled 
in April. And Reynolds said he lost out on $3 million in commercial 
endorsements since his divorce, particularly Quaker State motor oil and the 
Florida Citrus Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they think divorced people don't drink orange juice," he 
grumped in court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Monday, Reynolds said he was having "cash flow problems," was in 
arrears on several loans, was dogged by bad investments and was strapped by 
heavy alimony and child support obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Reynolds' divorce from Anderson has cost him more than $2 million, and 
he pays about $47,000 a month in divorce-related expenses, accountant Gregory 
Young testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds bought Anderson a $1.9-million Los Angeles-area house as part of 
their divorce settlement, and makes the $9,000-plus monthly mortgage payments. 
He pays her $11,000 a month in alimony, but that ends this month. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has paid about $50,000 in alimony and $100,000 in child support, 
which does not include the additional $26,000 in miscellaneous expenses for 
Quinton -- a private school, jujitsu lessons, computer classes and other 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the courthouse, Reynolds told reporters: "I'm very happy that we 
were able to sell papers for a year and a half. Why that doesn't translate into 
money, I don't know. I'm glad you're curious about us. I'm glad America is 
curious about us."

HOSPITAL COMPUTER GETS $6.8-MILLION INFUSION; COUNTY: SUPERVISORS APPROVE

 Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday approved spending $6.8 million to 
continue operating a hospital computer system designed to make patient bill 
collecting more efficient -- a system that has cost more than $10 million to 
fix. 
</P>

 Although estimates vary, county officials say the IBAX computer system has 
lost between $2 million and $17 million in hospital billings that might not be 
retrievable. The county canceled the IBAX contract in June after an 
investigation of the system's shortcomings. The $6.8 million approved Tuesday 
came out of the Health Services Department budget for non-patient service, an 
amount that had been set aside in case an alternative billing system was 
needed, said Kathryn Barger, a health deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
Instead, supervisors decided to spend the money in an attempt to improve the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will cover costs for the next 18 months, including for a computer 
consultant and two computer firms to help develop a new billing system. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is integrate the new system with IBAX so we don't 
risk losing any more billings," Barger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county officials are searching for a replacement computer system to 
handle Medi-Cal and other billing at two county hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 IBAX, which cost $65 million, has been a frustration and an embarrassment to 
the cash-strapped county. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina has taken the lead in pursuing alternatives. "This 
IBAX monster failed us miserably," Molina said during Tuesday's meeting. "We 
need to get this behind us as quickly as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision came a week after the county reached a settlement with 
IBAX in which the firm paid $3 million in cash and $5.5 million in credits to 
purchase medical supplies and computer-related equipment. Neither side admitted 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 When the supervisors awarded IBAX the hospital billing contract in late 1990, 
the system was said to be state of the art, capable of replacing a myriad of 
contractors and in-house methods that were failing to promptly bill patients, 
insurance companies and other providers for hospital health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was installed first at High Desert Hospital in Lancaster and Rancho 
Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey and was planned to be used in the four 
other county hospitals. It was projected to save more than $10 million by 1998.

UTILITY TAX REPEAL ON HOLD; FINANCE: FULLERTON COUNCIL MEMBERS CITE COUNTY BOND 
CRISIS IN DECISION TO DELAY VOTE. LEVY LED TO RECALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With about $18 million tied up in Orange County's troubled investment fund, 
City Council members decided Tuesday to determine if the money is safe before 
they repeal the utility tax that led to the recall of the three council members 
who voted to levy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to see what happens because we have a lot of money" in the 
investment fund, said Mayor Julie Sa. "I certainly don't want bad news to hit 
us. We have to make sure we know what's happening to the money because if we 
lose it, we'll be in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeal of the 2% utility tax may be considered on Dec. 20.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is as it appears," said Councilman Peter Godfrey, who recommended 
postponing the vote. "If somebody wants to restore my confidence, you don't go 
resigning and filing for bankruptcy. . . . We need to wait for the county to 
meet and tell us what our guarantees are." 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting Manager Glenn Steinbrink said he and other city officials plan to 
meet with county officials on Thursday and the following Tuesday . 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the most prudent thing to do right now is to cooperate with the 
county," Steinbrink said. "I don't believe that anybody can answer what's going 
to happen in the future. . . . I cannot make a guarantee that there will not be 
losses in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the council postponed a vote Tuesday, a majority of Sa, Godfrey 
and Councilman Chris Norby assured residents at the meeting that they still are 
committed to repealing the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "You promised us that you were going to repeal this damn tax and you better do 
it tonight," resident Marie Whaling said amid cheers from residents at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents asked the council to carefully review the city's $81-million 
budget before repealing the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax on all utilities, levied in October 1993, triggered the recall of 
council members Don Bankhead, A.B. (Buck) Catlin and Molly McClanahan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recall election two months ago, voters replaced the council members 
with Jan M. Flory, Godfrey and Conrad DeWitte. But a month later, in the 
November general election, Bankhead won back a seat, ousting DeWitte, who now 
holds the record for the shortest council term: five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because DeWitte was the only one of three candidates endorsed by the Fullerton 
Recalls Committee in the October election, his subsequent defeat sent a mixed 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who favored keeping the tax, which is scheduled to expire in 
September, 1995, said it meant that the voters would rather pay the tax than 
lose city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said DeWitte's short stint in office meant the tax was not wanted 
and never should have been levied. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the council decide to rescind the tax, the city will lose about $2 
million, City Manager James L. Armstrong said Tuesday. He said cuts in services 
would have to make up for the loss.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to make cuts in the whole organization, but we will survive," 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 If on Dec. 20 the council votes to repeal it, the tax would be lifted 
effective Feb. 28. "Whatever the council decides, we'll deal with it," 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another action, council members announced their approval of an agreement 
reached in a lawsuit filed by former Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. 
O'Neill over the utility tax. He agreed to drop the suit when the council 
majority promised to repeal the tax.

UNITED WAY STUDY SHOWS POOR'S HEALTH NEEDS UNMET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's poor have "alarming" unmet health-care needs because they 
often lack insurance coverage and are stymied by other barriers to treatment, 
including language and transportation difficulties, according to a United Way 
report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-fourths of the county's poor have never been to a doctor for a 
regular checkup, and 41% of those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, 
heart disease and asthma said they are not receiving treatment for those 
conditions, according to a survey of more than 700 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnicity as well as poverty is a factor in determining who gets treatment, 
according to the study, conducted by the United Way of Orange County Health 
Care Council in collaboration with UC Irvine physician Shiraz I. Mishra. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one in six said they had faced language barriers when seeking 
medical treatment. And a third of Latinos said they lacked a regular source of 
care, compared to 11% of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Mishra presented the report Tuesday to the board of directors of OPTIMA, the 
organization charged with revamping services for the county's 300,000 
recipients of Medi-Cal, the government health insurance program for the poor. 
One OPTIMA board member, Dr. Peter Anderson, said that while the presentation 
was valuable, the report did not address all of the reasons why people do not 
seek basic medical treatment. By and large, he said, children in Orange County 
have access to pediatricians, and public health clinics offer free 
immunizations for youngsters under the age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "we have a tremendous problem with the vaccination rate," said 
Anderson, chief of emergency medicine at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and 
Medical Center and president of the Orange County Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is not that we don't have the access," he said. "It's just that 
parents don't take their kids in." That, he said, is a sociological problem 
that might not be entirely resolved "no matter what system we set up." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way survey suggests that poverty alone does not explain failure to 
vaccinate children. More than a sixth of poor children younger than 7 had never 
been immunized against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps and rubella. 
But a fifth of "non-poor" children in the same age range had never received 
measles, mumps or rubella shots either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found, however, that poor people do not get many other preventive 
and primary care services as often as those with higher incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The definition of "poor" was 125% or less of what the federal government 
defines as poverty-level income. For a family of four, that would be an annual 
income of $17,919 or less. Non-poor families were defined as those having 
incomes above $28,670. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a third of poor residents had not made an outpatient medical visit 
in the past year, compared to only 18% of non-poor residents. Among women 40 or 
older, more than twice as many poor as non-poor respondents had never had a 
mammogram. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor people were more likely than others to have to ride the bus or rely on a 
friend for transportation to medical appointments, the survey found, and to 
lack insurance coverage for prescription drugs and such services as mental 
health care and drug and alcohol treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommended that a community-based system be developed for poor and 
"nearly poor" people who have no regular source of health care. It should 
emphasize preventive services for children and adults, the report said, and 
should be publicized in English, Spanish and, if possible, some Asian 
languages. Translation, transportation and child-care services also were 
recommended for poor patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted with the help of Field Research Corp. of San Francisco, 
was based on telephone interviews conducted in English and Spanish with 718 
Orange County residents. The margin of error was plus or minus 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Results are to be presented to the County Board of Supervisors in January with 
a plan of action prepared by United Way.

INVASION FORCE GETS OFF THE GROUND; 20 HOVERCRAFT TRAIN ALONG COAST OF CAMP 
PENDLETON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The noise was deafening, the dust clouds immense. It could have been Somalia 
or the Persian Gulf, but it was here, mere feet from a rocky cliff, with the 
waters of the Pacific lapping in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Navy Capt. Hank Howe labeled it "Hovercraft Central." 
</P>
<P>
 This was no ordinary exercise, Howe said. These 20 Hovercraft, or LCAC 
(Landing Craft, Air Cushion) were the largest number to fly in formation at one 
time anywhere in the world. This was practice, he said, but "important 
practice" for a potential military crisis similar to those in Somalia and the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old Hovercraft -- 35 of them based at Camp Pendleton, with 35 more 
in Little Creek, Va. -- were deployed in both Somalia and the Persian Gulf and, 
in Howe's view, played indispensable roles in both conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Their primary contribution: giving the United States an "over the horizon" 
invasion force in which each Hovercraft can deliver 75 tons of soldiers and 
equipment from a maximum of 200 miles from shore. The craft's water speed is 35 
knots and they can go 25 m.p.h. over terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell," Howe said, "they expand the number of beaches we can hit, 
allowing us to go farther and deeper inland from the cushion of an 
over-the-horizon offshore location." 
</P>
<P>
 Each vessel is 47 feet wide and 87 feet long, a flat, rectangular, amphibious 
assault vehicle that, in Howe's words, is akin to flying "a bar of soap." The 
craft is powered by six turbine engines that, on Tuesday, stretched the decibel 
level to an eardrum's limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members wore earplugs, and those with contact lenses strapped on goggles 
to fight off the dust clouds created by an armada of LCAC from ACU-5, otherwise 
known as Assault Craft Unit headquarters at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love acronyms," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also loves Hovercraft, which arms experts say can cover 70% of the 
world's coastal areas, as compared to the 17% that its predecessors could 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The units cost $22 million each and are manufactured by two New Orleans firms. 
While at sea, they're stored, not on aircraft carriers, but on amphibious 
vessels that carry what is known as a "wet well." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say no Hovercraft have been damaged so far, but then none has 
encountered open conflict, even during Operation Desert Storm. The U.S. uses 
them primarily to move massive amounts of military equipment from sea to land, 
although each can carry 23 combat-ready Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the weapons capabilities other countries have, the over-the-horizon 
factor is the strongest attribute," Howe said. "By launching 35 miles offshore 
(the usual deployment distance), that's an enormous arc for anyone to defend 
against." 
</P>
<P>
 No other country has a Hovercraft quite like the U.S.-made LCAC, Howe said. 
However, Japan is about to purchase two from the United States, with delivery 
scheduled for 1997. North Korea and Russia have Hovercraft, but in his words, 
they "don't compare." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Camp Pendleton-based LCACs are currently deployed, with four due 
to return Thursday. Two are in Sasebo, Japan, near the North Korean coast; four 
are in the Indian Ocean and one is in Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Lt. Scott Davies, 28, is a veteran of Hovercraft deployments, having used 
them in Somalia from October, 1993, to February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to six different landing sites," Davies said. "Most displacement 
vessels were incapable of landing because of low tides and sandbars. The LCAC 
were able to land in Somalia, cross through sand -- it's extremely soft there 
-- and move up to a hard, packed road within minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The sensation of riding one, Davies said, is akin to flying, "especially when 
you're over land, since no part of the craft touches ground while in operation. 
The bottom of the skirt is two to three inches off the ground, while the bottom 
of the hull is four feet off the ground. The skirt entraps the air, which gives 
you the lift."

JUROR RESCINDS VOTE IN MANSLAUGHTER CASE; COURTS: PANELIST'S CHANGE COMES 
DURING JUDGE'S POLLING. GROUP IS SENT BACK TO DELIBERATE AND IT LATER CONVICTS 
DEFENDANT IN THE TRAFFIC DEATH OF A BOY, 8. 
</P>

 A juror in a vehicular manslaughter case tried to rescind his vote for guilty 
at the last minute Tuesday, but later joined his fellow jurors in convicting a 
Yorba Linda man after the panel was ordered back into deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror, Chuck Denmark, stunned the courtroom as the jury was being polled 
individually on the guilty verdicts against defendant Brandon Wattier, 22, who 
was charged with vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run driving in the death of 
an 8-year-old boy last year. When asked if he agreed with the jury's finding, 
Denmark answered with an emphatic, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge David T. McEachen held a brief meeting in chambers with 
Denmark, the prosecutor and the defense attorney before ordering the jury back 
into deliberations. About 30 minutes later, the jury returned and reaffirmed 
its guilty verdict on the felony vehicular manslaughter charge. Wattier clasped 
his hands and bowed his head after the jury also pronounced him guilty of 
misdemeanor hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Wattier was accused of causing an accident that killed Wesley Straw of Moreno 
Valley on Oct. 10, 1993, as the youngster and his father were driving south on 
the Costa Mesa Freeway near Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Denmark said most of the jurors considered Wattier guilty 
from the outset of the deliberations, while he had reservations and wanted to 
discuss the evidence further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt there was a possibility of reasonable doubt," Denmark said. "I 
thought (the jury polling) was the time to rescind my vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Denmark said he believed he was allowing his emotions about the case to cloud 
his judgment. But he said he went back into the jury room, discussed the case 
with fellow jurors and decided once again to find Wattier guilty. He said he 
was worried his fellow jurors would be angry with him, but he added they were 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very supportive, they were very compassionate about the whole 
thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Yonemura said he was stunned by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very unusual -- you don't have jurors saying, 'No,' at the last 
minute," he said. "It caught me by surprise. I think it caught everyone by 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jeff Kent said he believes the incident will be grounds for 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mr. Denmark feels Brandon was not guilty of felony vehicular 
manslaughter, and that due to the pressure of the other jurors he succumbed . . 
. and changed his verdict," Kent said. "I think the judge should have declared 
a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He want back in there and had a chance to talk it over again and I'm glad he 
did that," Yonemura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Wattier caused the crash while speeding and driving 
recklessly. But the defense blamed the crash on another driver who allegedly 
forced Wattier's car onto the shoulder. They contended that Wattier struck the 
victim's car as he tried to negotiate his way back onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Wattier suspected that he clipped the vehicle that forced him off the road and 
did not immediately call police to report the accident. Wattier had a friend 
contact authorities when he learned a child was killed and police were seeking 
a car fitting his vehicle's description. 
</P>
<P>
 Wattier was still reeling from the jury's verdict late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in shock," Kent said. "He really hasn't said a word about it, but he 
feels he's been wrongly convicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Wattier is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 3. He faces up to six years in 
prison on the vehicular manslaughter charge.

FOREST SERVICE OPPOSES KEY ELEMENT OF LANDFILL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER and MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critics of the proposed Elsmere Canyon landfill said the controversial project 
was dealt a major setback Tuesday when U.S. Forest Service officials announced 
they are opposed to a land swap viewed as vital to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill's proponents downplayed the government's action but for years 
have called the 1,600-acre land swap a key component in a developer's plans to 
place a 190-million-ton landfill in Elsmere Canyon, east of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway and just outside Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed swap, the federal government would allow BKK Corp. to take 
over a portion of Angeles National Forest for the landfill. In return, BKK 
would deed to the government land of equal financial and aesthetic value. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service officials oppose the trade because the landfill would eliminate 
open space and harm the area's riparian habitat, said Paul Johnson, a deputy 
forest supervisor with the agency. The landfill project also fails to 
adequately explore other possible sites for a dump, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is some astounding information that would come in," agency 
officials will oppose the land swap in their written comments for the Elsmere 
Landfill's draft environmental impact report, Johnson said. That document, 
which has been in the works for several years, is projected to be released in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill opponents, from members of a citizens group created to fight the 
proposal to the Santa Clarita City Council, are calling the Forest Service 
stance an important victory. They note the federal agency's concerns are 
similar to their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we've been saying all along," said Marsha McLean, president of 
the Santa Clarita Valley Canyons Preservation Committee. McLean and city 
officials fear the landfill could contaminate ground water, increase air 
pollution and give off foul odors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't stopped the landfill yet, but we've slowed them down," said Jo 
Anne Darcy, a Santa Clarita city councilwoman and a field deputy for Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the landfill proposal downplay the recommendation's 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Kazarian, president of Torrance-based BKK, said he was disappointed by the 
announcement. He predicted the agency will reverse itself and recommend the 
land swap once public hearings and studies of the draft environmental report 
are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Forest Service is in a position where they can't do anything but 
take that position until they've had a fair hearing of the issues," said 
Kazarian. "Otherwise, they would fall into the category that some people . . . 
have put them in by saying it's a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 BKK has spent more than $1.5 million on the environmental report, and an early 
recommendation by the Forest Service in favor of the land swap could have 
further fueled opponents' arguments, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Clarita has tried to make the accusation that the environmental impact 
report was going to be no good because BKK is paying for it and we can 
influence it," said Kazarian. "I would say that, number one, this goes to prove 
that they're incorrect and, second, people have to look at the real data." 
</P>
<P>
 Public input might not change the Forest Service recommendation, but studies 
of environmental and technical findings in the preliminary environmental report 
should support BKK's position, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the land swap does fall through, BKK will study the feasibility of putting 
a landfill on the several hundred acres of land the company owns elsewhere in 
Elsmere Canyon, Kazarian said. That landfill would probably be smaller than the 
projected 190-million-ton capacity of the existing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the preferred alternative from our standpoint," said Kazarian. "When 
we started the project we looked at that, but we figured our current proposal 
was superior. Not necessarily environmentally, but technically, in its 
operation, and visually."

APPOINTMENT BACKERS GET REPRIEVE; COUNCIL: GROUP PUSHING FOR INTERIM 
YAROSLAVSKY REPLACEMENT GETS MORE TIME. 
</P>

<P>
 A citizens coalition Tuesday won an additional week to muster support for its 
plan to temporarily fill the Los Angeles City Council seat left vacant by the 
departure this week of Zev Yaroslavsky to the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprieve came as council President John Ferraro persuaded his colleagues 
to delay for a week a decision to hold a special April election to permanently 
fill Yaroslavsky's seat for the two years left in the unfinished term. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council is to appoint an interim representative, it must under city 
bylaws make the appointment before it votes to hold the special election. 
</P>
<P>
 By delaying the decision, the council left open the possibility of appointing 
a replacement for six months, an option backed by a coalition of homeowners and 
business leaders in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great," said Alan Kishbaugh, president of the Federation of Hillside 
and Canyon Assns. and a member of the coalition that has pressed for the 
appointment. "We need some time to get people used to the idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest name to surface as a candidate for the temporary position is 
Michael A. Jimenez, a public relations consultant and Yaroslavsky's former 
legislative aide who resigned in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Jimenez said he is interested in the post and even 
moved last weekend from Santa Monica to Bel-Air, which is in the district, so 
he would be eligible for the seat if he is appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky refused to say whether he endorses Jimenez as his replacement but 
said "he would be very good at this job and what's most significant to me is 
that the community wants him." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Supervisor Ed Edelman, who retired last week and was replaced by 
Yaroslavsky, threw another name into the running by endorsing his former chief 
deputy Bob Geoghegan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said Geoghegan "would also do a good job but the community is the 
one that is pushing for Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's developments were the latest chapter in a long and contentious 
debate over whether to appoint an interim replacement or leave the post vacant 
and allow Ronald Deaton, the city's chief legislative analyst, to watch over 
the day-to-day operations of the district until the special elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of an interim replacement say the quake-battered district that 
stretches from Sherman Oaks to Westwood needs a voting representative to ensure 
that the area is not neglected during the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members opposed the idea, saying the district would be better 
off in the hands of an experienced city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the council filled a seat by appointment was in 1966. Since 
then, the council has left at least a half-dozen vacancies unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot understand how you can justify doing it in one district when it 
wasn't done in others," Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. "There is no 
district that is any more important than any other, and I am uncomfortable with 
the appearance of a double standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents portions of the East Valley, where 
residents have expressed concern over the vacancy, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the district will be well taken care of, and I'll certainly do my 
part to look after them," he said. "I just don't think you can make exceptions. 
I don't see any need to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 But another Valley representative, Councilwoman Laura Chick, said she thought 
it was "criminal" that other seats were left vacant in the past and said she 
supports a temporary replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel this way even if there hadn't been an earthquake," she said. 
"This is not a Valley issue, this is a good government issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Brogin, who heads a coalition of residents and business leaders 
supporting the appointment, said the group is not promoting candidates for the 
post but is lobbying the council to make an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 She confirmed that the two top contenders for the post are Jimenez and 
Geoghegan and added that her group "generally feels comfortable with the names 
that are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ferraro also moved Tuesday to name Councilman Richard Alatorre to 
head the council's Budget and Finance Committee, an influential post held by 
Yaroslavsky since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro also named himself and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Ferraro announced formation of a special five-member ad hoc city budget 
committee to keep this year's budget in balance and craft a new budget for the 
1995-96 fiscal year. The panel will consist of the regular budget committee 
members and Councilwomen Jackie Goldberg and Rita Walters.

LAPD WILL TRY 3-DAY WORKWEEK; POLICE: PATROL OFFICERS WILL WORK 12-HOUR SHIFTS 
UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM. IT IS SET TO BEGIN NEXT MONTH AT FOUR DIVISIONS, 
INCLUDING VAN NUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they hope it will boost morale, Los Angeles Police Department officials 
are putting patrol officers in four divisions, including one in the San 
Fernando Valley, on a schedule of three 12-hour days per week in an experiment 
that could eventually become the norm citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong pilot program calls for officers to switch from a traditional 
workweek to a dramatically shortened schedule beginning Jan. 22. Under the 
program, patrol officers at Van Nuys, Rampart, Wilshire and Harbor divisions, 
will work three 12-hour shifts a week and detectives will work four 10-hour 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the compressed schedule say the shorter workweek will boost 
morale without incurring extra expenses to the department, by allowing officers 
to spend more time with their families and less time commuting to and from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some LAPD officers have already resigned to join other departments that offer 
such schedules, police officials and union leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees want it," said LAPD Capt. Richard Eide, of the Van Nuys 
Division. "Happy, satisfied officers treat people better and they work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 By providing greater flexibility in scheduling, Eide said the new schedule 
also holds the potential to allow the LAPD to do much more of the 
community-based policing programs that the department is now emphasizing. The 
reason: Because patrol officers will work four fewer hours in each standard 
workweek, they will now -- after allowance for a monthly paid holiday -- "owe" 
an extra day's work to the department at the end of each four-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 On these catch-up days, local commanders will be able to assign officers to 
special projects, he said, painting a scenario in which as many as 75 officers 
could be deployed to "saturate" a community and drum up support for 
neighborhood policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has determined that the new schedule does not violate federal 
labor laws that sometimes hinder private employers who try to implement such 
plans, Eide said. 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly half the state's law enforcement's agencies are estimated to 
offer shortened workweeks to their employees, the LAPD is "the first large 
agency to venture into" compressed schedules, said Dennis Zine, a director of 
the Los Angeles Police Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 Under orders from LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams, a committee was formed 
following the Northridge earthquake to study the effects of a compressed 
schedule, after damaged highways made it difficult for officers, many of whom 
commute from faraway suburbs, to travel to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause for the study was that many officers stated during exit 
interviews that they were resigning to work at police departments that offer 
such modified schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stop attrition and take care of our officers now," Zine said. 
"We're trying to make them happy and make this an attractive position despite 
the stress and hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD was apparently the only police department out of 11 Southern 
California law enforcement agencies that did not offer some form of a 
compressed schedule to its employees, according to a memo circulated by 
Williams, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zine said that so far, the only concerns voiced over the program have come 
from officers at the Rampart division, who have heavier court loads than 
officers in other areas. Police officials have been holding conversations with 
court administrators in an effort to provide officers with more flexibility 
when it comes to appearing in court to testify against suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Patrol Capt. Betty Kelepcz, of the Harbor Division, said her station had 
initially conducted a study on compressed work schedule several years ago. 
Plans to implement a modified work schedule, which had been approved by 
then-Police Chief Daryl Gates, were put on hold following the Los Angeles 
riots, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officers have been waiting for this for years," Kelepcz said. "There are a 
lot of people that want to work it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zine said the LAPD and the police union will establish committees to monitor 
fatigue, response times, injuries and auto collisions on duty, personnel 
complaints, productivity, morale, the frequency of the use of force and a 
laundry list of other factors to gauge the success of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelepcz said a recent LAPD study revealed that for a short period of time, 
officers assigned to the new work schedule will be fatigued late in their 
shifts, but that their fatigue will subside after two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other agencies said (their officers) were tired, but not to the point of 
being unsafe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental schedule appears to have won the approval of even one of the 
department's toughest critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea," said James Fyfe, a former New York City police 
officer and professor of criminal justice at Temple University in Philadelphia, 
who co-wrote a book on police brutality. Fyfe, who has in the past criticized 
the LAPD for being "insular and out of touch" when it comes to use of force, 
embraced the concept of fewer workdays for LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost by nature their work schedule is bizarre and unnatural," Fyfe said. 
"This will be a morale booster, especially in Los Angeles, where cops work so 
far away from where they live." 
</P>
<P>
 David Lewin, professor and vice dean at the Anderson Graduate School of 
Management at UCLA, said that because police work requires officers to deal so 
much with the public, that the officers' job performance, susceptibility to 
injury and illness and fatigue levels must be monitored closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an open question," Lewin said of a compressed schedule for 
officers. "After all, do you want someone breaking up a family dispute in the 
eleventh hour of their shift or the first hour of their shift?" 
</P>
<P>
 So popular is the concept among LAPD officers, Eide said, that over the last 
month or so he has received 20 requests from officers wanting to transfer to 
the Van Nuys Division, which he described as very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general consensus is that most officers are looking forward to it," said 
LAPD Sgt. Roy Sulton, of the Van Nuys station. "It will mean more days off and 
more uniformity in schedules." 
</P>
<P>
 Sulton said that under the program, officers will be assigned to "platoons," 
which will have set schedules. A seven-year veteran, Sulton said his only 
concern is that the extended shifts, which he has worked before -- during the 
Los Angeles riots and following the Northridge earthquake -- can be fatiguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Stephen Fisk, who is in charge of homicide investigators in the Van 
Nuys division, said there will continue to be detectives available at the 
station five days a week and possibly even six, under the new schedule, with 
detectives working staggered shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knee-jerk reactions to it is that courts are open five days a week so 
detectives may not get the extra day off they had planned," Fisk said. "I kind 
of have mixed emotions about it, but we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 If similar programs already in place at other stations are any indicator, then 
LAPD officers who switch to the compressed schedules could experience a boost 
in morale along with a host of other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Police Chief Tom Mahoney said that employee turnover and 
on-duty injuries and traffic accidents have significantly decreased since his 
department switched to a compressed schedule nearly identical to the one the 
LAPD is about to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 Where formerly two or three officers resigned from his department each year, 
only two officers have quit since the workweek was changed in 1991, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe productivity is just as high, if not higher, and our citizen 
complaints have become virtually nonexistent," said Mahoney, whose 33 officers 
police a 3 1/2-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
 Morale improved in part because the shortened week allowed many officers and 
support staff employees who had been renting apartments near the station to 
purchase affordable housing in bedroom communities farther away, because they 
no longer have to commute five days a week, Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney said the most significant problem was adjusting to officers having 
12-hour sick days that had to be filled on overtime, compared to an eight-hour 
shift with the traditional schedule. He said his department worked closely with 
the police association to ensure that overtime was kept under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no perfect system," Mahoney said. "But what is important here is a 
system that provides at least the same -- if not better -- service to the 
community, while at the same time improving the organization's morale."

REYNOLDS, ANDERSON END SPAT OVER CHILD SUPPORT; SETTLEMENT: THE CELEBRITIES 
LEAVE COURT HAND IN HAND AFTER REACHING ACCORD ON HIS PAYMENTS FOR THEIR 
ADOPTED SON. TERMS OF AGREEMENT ARE NOT DISCLOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was the big chill as Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson entered a Van Nuys 
courtroom through separate doors on Tuesday. They left hand in hand, as 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Following two days of excruciatingly detailed testimony about Reynolds' 
foundering financial affairs, the couple hammered out an agreement about how 
much monthly child support he should pay for their adopted 6-year-old son, 
Quinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached in the chambers of Superior Court Judge Robert M. 
Letteau, and the transcript was sealed, so it could not be learned whether 
Reynolds will pay more or less than the $15,000-a-month he had been paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and Anderson did not disclose the terms of the settlement, giving 
only brief statements and refusing to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've reached a decision amicably for our son's sake, who we love very much," 
Anderson told reporters during a brief news conference on the courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burt has been very generous to take care of his son, and we're friends," said 
Anderson, who wore a fitted red suit with a plunging neckline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting married," quipped Reynolds, who wore jeans and blue suede 
boots. "Pick on Kevin Costner or somebody else. This saga is over. Let's put it 
to bed. We're thrilled about the outcome because it's all for Quinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, relations between the two were much chillier. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Tuesday morning why she and Reynolds didn't acknowledge each other in 
court, Anderson explained, "We've been separated for a year and a half. We 
don't have anything to say to each other. This is all about taking care of 
someone who's 6 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 The former spouses brought His and Her accountants to court to dissect the 
actor's financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But settlement talks began in earnest after Reynolds' accountant, under 
questioning by the judge Tuesday, estimated the actor's net worth at $5 
million. On Monday, Reynolds testified that the accountant told him that his 
net worth was minus $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had sought up to $17,000 a month for Quinton, but Reynolds had said 
he could only afford $7,000 a month. Anderson's lawyer contends that Reynolds 
makes $260,000 a month, while his lawyers maintain the figure is $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has suffered some financial setbacks during the past year. He no 
longer can count on having a hit television show; "Evening Shade" brought him 
$2.9 million before it was canceled in April. And Reynolds said he lost out on 
$3 million in commercial endorsements since his divorce, including those for 
Quaker State Motor Oil and the Florida Citrus Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they think divorced people don't drink orange juice," he 
grumped in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Monday, Reynolds said he was having "cash flow problems," was in 
arrears on several loans, dogged by bad investments, and strapped by his heavy 
alimony and child support obligations. Still, accountant Gregory Young 
testified Tuesday, he refuses to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Reynolds' divorce from Anderson has cost him more than $2 million, and 
he pays about $47,000 a month in divorce-related expenses, Young testified. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought Anderson a $1.9-million Los Angeles-area house as part of their 
divorce settlement, and makes the $9,000-plus monthly mortgage payments. He 
pays her $11,000 a month in alimony, but that ends this month. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has paid about $50,000 in alimony and $100,000 in child support, 
which does not include the additional $26,000 in miscellaneous Quinton expenses 
-- a private schools, jujitsu lessons, computer classes and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the courthouse, Reynolds told reporters, "I'm very happy that we 
were able to sell papers for a year and a half. Why that doesn't translate into 
money, I don't know. I'm glad you're curious about us. I'm glad America is 
curious about us."

 A 23-year-old man who died earlier this week from gunshot wounds to his upper 
body was identified Tuesday by police as Cesar Molina of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina was found sprawled on the side of the road at Resh and Water streets 
about 2 a.m. Sunday after a shootout that erupted during a bungled robbery 
attempt, Anaheim police Sgt. Steve Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 He died several hours later at UCI Medical Center in Orange, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said they believe Molina and several other men were 
trying to rob a couple coming back from a date. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, whose names were not released by police, were standing at the 
front door of the woman's house in the 500 block of South Resh Street when the 
men pointed guns at them and demanded money, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 A confrontation followed, and the woman's friend was shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He happened to be carrying a handgun, so he fired back at them," Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15 gunshots were fired, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's friend, who suffered minor injuries, was later questioned by 
detectives but was not held because he acted in self-defense, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suspects who accompanied Molina are at large. THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; PTA TILE PROJECT DRAWS A CROWD

 First-grader Scott Sagan planned a serene picture of purple snowcapped 
mountains, a blue ocean and yellow trees for his decorative tile that will soon 
join 500 others on walls at Hidden Hills Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 But halfway through painting it Tuesday morning, Scott heard his classmates at 
recess and decided he would rather play than paint. So mom Denise was left to 
add the last tree leaves and snow flurries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful," Denise Sagan said about the popular tile project 
sponsored by the new school's Parent-Teacher Assn. "It gives the kids a sense 
of being part of a new school, and it gives them something to see later on. 
Scott's already talking about someday bringing his own kids here to see his 
tile." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of parents, grandparents, students and local city dignitaries have 
paid $15 each for the chance to paint 6-inch-square tiles that will be mounted 
on a school wall. Proceeds from the personalized tiles will go to the fledgling 
PTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the first year to be something special," said PTA member Monette 
Ashen, whose two daughters, Marinna and Coral, painted their tiles with fish 
and butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted something for all the kids to participate in and feel proud of. 
It's really been exciting to see the kids doing their own work and the gamut of 
what they've been painting." 
</P>
<P>
 The tile paintings, in subdued blues, yellows, peaches and purples, range from 
spotted owls -- the school mascot -- to children's handprints and sayings such 
as "God bless our school." The tiles will be glazed and fired in the school's 
own pottery kiln. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great. It brings the people to the school, and that's what 
schools are about -- people," said outgoing Councilman James F. Krembas, who 
painted the school's theme, "Global Communication," and "Good luck" on his 
tile. "For people to come and be a part of the school is outstanding."LYNN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; 'GOOSE WALK' A CLOSE LOOK AT WINTER VISITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College is planning its first-ever "goose walk," a day set aside for 
the public to get an up-close look at the Canada geese that winter each year in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 17 event will be held near the Agricultural Science Building between 
7 and 10 a.m., said Ralph Kinchloe, a Pierce biology teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 During those hours, the geese forage for tender grasses on the school's farm. 
</P>
<P>
 A $1 charge for those over 12 will go to reseed pastures and for maintenance 
around the farm, according to school officials. For more information call (818) 
719-6447. 
</P>
<P>
 The geese have been coming to the school each fall since at least the 1970s, 
Kinchloe said. Tracking studies show that the birds come from the Great Basin 
Desert, an area that includes Utah and western Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually arrive in the San Fernando Valley about mid-October, and reach 
Pierce by mid-November," he said "This is the final stop in their migration." 
</P>
<P>
 They come to California because food is scarce in winter in those regions, 
Kinchloe said. They usually leave the Valley in early March. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 3,500 geese spend their winters in the Valley, but only about 1,200 have 
been counted at Pierce College at one time. The geese began coming to the farm 
after pastures near Victory Boulevard were developed as part of Warner Center, 
Kinchloe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds come to the farm at dawn and leave at sunset, and apparently sleep 
at either the Encino or Chatsworth reservoirs, he said. It is believed that 
most of the birds that come to Pierce come from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 That belief is based on studies in which birds were banded at birth with the 
names of the states in which they were found, he said. One year in the 1970s, 
10 of 12 birds found at the farm came from Utah, while the other two came from 
Montana, Kinchloe said. 
</P>
<P>
 College President Mary Lee said the walk is designed to show off the farm to 
the public. It is also held to draw attention to the school's efforts "to 
preserve the nature center and the farm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm has come under fire in recent years from critics who say it's a waste 
of money because of low enrollment in the school's agricultural programs. But 
many in the community say the farm is a valuable asset to the urban area 
surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals can sponsor the goose walk for $50, and businesses that pay $250 
can have their names painted on wooden signs posted along the walk area, 
according to school officials. The signs are cut out in the shape of farm 
animals. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY EXPECTED TO OK OFFICE, RETAIL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today is D-Day of sorts for the developer of the proposed Park Centre 
Calabasas, a large-scale office and retail center that opponents say is too big 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council -- mindful of threats by the developer to sue if he 
doesn't get what he wants -- tonight is expected to approve one of two 
compromise proposals drafted by a special committee that has been working with 
the developer to reduce the project's size. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Save Our City, an organization opposed to the project, say they 
aren't happy, however, with either compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that it's not a reasonable approach, because the proposal is too 
great a burden for the city to bear," said Michael Fichera Jr., a member of 
Save Our City. "We want the developer to reconsider his proposal, and we hope 
the City Council will back us up."  
</P>
<P>
 Save Our City has offered its own proposal, which differs significantly from 
either of the two committee proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Industries received approval from the county for a 
1.5-million-square-foot office and retail center at the corner of Calabasas 
Road and Parkway Calabasas before Calabasas became a city in 1989. The project 
also was to include a 50,000-square-foot retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 But developer John Kilroy wants to increase the retail portion to 200,000 
square feet, because there is no demand for office space in the current 
economic climate. The City Council must approve any change in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were scheduled to vote on the project in August, but postponed 
the matter after all five members told Kilroy they would reject the project 
unless it was scaled down.  
</P>
<P>
 To forge a compromise, the council formed a committee, made up of council 
members Marvin Lopata and Dennis Washburn and representatives from Kilroy 
Industries. Lopata said Kilroy has agreed to abide by either compromise 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the first option, the overall size of the project would be reduced 
300,000 square feet, with 200,000 square feet of retail guaranteed. The 
developer would be allowed to build a seven-plex, 2,000-seat theater, with an 
option to add 400 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the second, the overall size of the project would be reduced by 150,000 
square feet, with 200,000 square feet of retail space guaranteed. It would 
permit a seven-plex, 1,800-seat theatre with an option to add 600 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our City wants to scale down the development so that it produces no more 
than 15,655 daily traffic trips, instead of the 26,000 daily trips called for 
by the developer, and the group wants to prohibit creation of compact parking 
spaces and shared parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Save Our City, arguing that a large-scale theater would bring crime and 
traffic congestion, wants to limit the theater to 800 seats.  
</P>
<P>
 Lopata, as the chief city negotiator, has been under increasing pressure to 
come up with a solution. He said he believes Save Our City's proposal is 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 No theater operator would be able to make money managing a theater with just 
800 seats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the group's parking proposal, he said, "That is not the standard that is 
being set today . . . The Warner Center (in Woodland Hills) has shared parking 
and it works great." 
</P>
<P>
 Fichera, a real estate attorney, said Kilroy has no legal grounds to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the appropriate zoning, really," said Fichera. "He needs a 
conditional use permit to build anything but his office complex, and a 
conditional use permit is at the discretion of the City Council." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; WHERE PARADE DIES, A FESTIVAL IS BORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Undaunted by the cancellation of its traditional annual holiday parade, the 
community of Chatsworth has rallied to host a special holiday festival Saturday 
in Mason Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit is not dead; it just needed to be aroused," said Bill Powers, 
president of the Chatsworth Chamber of Commerce."The Grinch has not stolen 
Christmas -- or Hanukkah either, for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's parade, a 13-year tradition, was canceled because the chamber was 
unable to find enough volunteers from the community, which was devastated by 
the Jan. 17 earthquake, Powers said. Three volunteers signed up to help 
organize the parade, he said, when it normally takes about 60 volunteers 
donating about 30 hours apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Various groups have since been working on last-minute plans to organize a 
smaller event to replace the Chatsworth Holiday Parade, Powers said. The result 
is the Chatsworth Holiday Festival, which will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Special guests include Santa Claus, who will arrive at the park at 1:30 p.m. 
on a hook-and-ladder truck provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department, Powers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a silent auction from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to benefit the 
children's program at Mason Park, said Powers. There also will be special 
booths for arts and crafts. Music will be provided by Creation Unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival-goers are asked to bring a can of food, which will be donated to the 
needy, Powers said. At 2 p.m., there will be a special ceremony in which 
fair-goers will join hands and form a circle around the park, to promote 
community spirit, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone seeking further information should call the Mason Recreation Center at 
(818) 998-6377, the chamber at (818) 341-2428, or the Chatsworth Coordinating 
Council at (818) 360-0894 or (818) 882-3572. FRANK MANNING

<P>
 Police are investigating the weekend shooting of a man who apparently was 
critically wounded by two men who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Montano, 35, was shot twice in front of his home in the 1800 block of 
Moorpark Drive at 8:40 p.m. Saturday, said Sgt. Ed McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Montano, who manages an auto parts store in Los Angeles, has not regained 
consciousness since being airlifted to an undisclosed hospital, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told police that after he was shot with a handgun, Montano told them 
his two male attackers knew him. The attackers fled in a maroon car. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew the people that were involved" but the nature of their relationship 
will not be known until he can be interviewed at the hospital, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Montano's residence had been burglarized several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's related or not to the shooting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were shaken by the attack, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all scared and concerned about a shooting in the neighborhood," he 
said. "It's not something that happens there." MARK I. PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; COLLEGE, PEPSI CLOSE TO SCOREBOARD DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback Community College District trustees have voted to install a new 
$37,500 scoreboard at Saddleback College's baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the money will come from the college district's coffers because 
officials have struck a tentative deal with PepsiCo Inc. that gives the soda 
company exclusive rights as soda supplier at Saddleback College in exchange for 
the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriett Walther was the only trustee opposed to the action taken Monday, 
saying: "Just because it's free doesn't mean it's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Walther said that the current 15-year-old scoreboard was probably "getting 
kind of shabby" but that she would rather see such money spent for books or 
student scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Other trustees, however, supported the arrangement and said it would provide 
the college with a piece of badly needed equipment. Pepsi will have exclusive 
soda rights for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It affords us something we couldn't afford otherwise," said Trustee John 
Williams. "I think it's a wise decision." 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Diane Riopka said Tuesday that trustees are expected to 
approve the contract with PepsiCo next month. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's meeting, district Chancellor Robert A. Lombardi told trustees 
that giving a company exclusive rights to sell products in return for equipment 
such as scoreboards is not a new practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very common occurrence now at colleges," Lombardi said.JEFF BEAN

 Twenty-five students at Santa Margarita Catholic High School have been named

<P>
 Only about 12% of the 459,000 students nationwide who took the exams in May 
scored high enough to be honored by the College Board as AP Scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette Anaya qualified for an AP Scholar With Distinction award by earning 
grades of three or above on five or more AP examinations.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COMMUNITY COLLEGE ELECTIONS IN LIMBO

<P>
 The results of Glendale Community College's recent student body elections are 
in limbo, awaiting the outcome of a probe into allegations of illegal campaign 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates for Associated Student Body offices filed a grievance with the 
college's judicial review board last week, saying they witnessed a campaign 
worker for incumbent ASB president Arthur Katchatourians instructing students 
how to vote on election day. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates said they filed the grievance because college administrators 
dealt with their written complaints in an "irresponsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the two-day election, which concluded Nov. 30, will be withheld 
until administrators decide what action to take. Paul Schlossman, dean of 
student activities and supervisor of ASB government meetings and elections, 
said the judicial panel could nullify the election results if it finds any 
substance to the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, the votes have not been counted yet," Schlossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ASB officers for the spring semester are usually sworn in before the 
holiday break -- which begins in three weeks -- Schlossman said it is unclear 
whether the dispute will be settled by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The grievance mirrors the complaints raised by a group of students who called 
last week for the disqualification of Katchatourians from the elections.  
</P>
<P>
 Katchatourians said the students involved in the alleged unfair electioneering 
did not work for his campaign and denied any wrongdoing on his part or by 
others on his behalf. STEVE RYFLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; C-SPAN TOURING BUS GIVES STUDENTS A LOOK 
AT THE NEWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 local high school students got a look at how the news is 
produced Tuesday when the C-SPAN Bus rolled into Newport Beach on its national 
educational tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-foot motor coach functions as a mobile television studio, classroom and 
promotion for the government affairs cable channel. It has been touring the 
country for a year, visiting campuses nationwide to spark student interest in 
news and in government. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 students at each Newport Beach campus boarded the bus in small groups 
and saw how technology makes news coverage more immediate and accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 C-SPAN spokeswoman Maura Pierce guided each group through a sort of video 
flash card presentation of international newsmakers, amplifying some images 
with clips to show the breadth of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Students seemed more interested in the bus itself than the news it helps 
deliver. "Do you guys stop for takeout?" one student queried. (Yes, they do.) 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and administrators took the opportunity to introduce students to 
other informational resources with presentations about other educational 
channels, the city library system and school career centers. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's a neat opportunity for our kids to see how the news is covered as it's 
happening," said Corona del Mar High Principal Don Martin. "The broader item is 
to get kids tuned in to the fact that there is television beyond MTV." 
</P>
<P>
 After a presentation, Corona del Mar seniors Carter Wells and Courtney 
Robinson, both 17, said that it helped them learn what is available but that it 
probably will not change their viewing habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said she would tune in to C-SPAN "if there was an issue or 
something." Wells said the presentation made it more likely that he would tune 
in, but not a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "More likely, yes," he said, "But I'm not saying I'm going home to do it right 
now." HOLLY J. WAGNER

 A 15-year-old boy was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of attempted burglary and 
car theft after a chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police received a call at 3:30 a.m. from a resident in the 10300 block of 
Calle Madero, reporting a suspicious-looking vehicle in the area.A garage door 
was later found to have been forced open, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As officers approached the car, which had been stolen in Santa Ana, the 
occupants fled at speeds of up to 90 m.p.h., said Lt. Larry Griswold. After the 
car spun out and was blocked by patrol vehicles, the three occupants ran, 
police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver was caught by a police dog and arrested on suspicion of auto theft, 
burglary and assault with a deadly weapon and taken to Orange County Juvenile 
Hall. The two others escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 a.m., Santa Ana police said they were informed by residents of Gunther 
Street, where the car was taken and where the arrested teen-ager lived, that 
two people were hiding in the bushes at the nearby intersection of 1st and 
Jackson streets. The officers found the pair and held them until Fountain 
Valley police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Lt. Dave Petko said that at the request of the Fountain Valley 
officers, a 15-year-old juvenile and a 28-year-old man were fingerprinted, 
photographed and then released. MARK I. PINSKY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; PLAY AIMS TO SNUFF OUT KIDS' DESIRE TO SMOKE

<P>
 Fairy tales have come a long way, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinderella's evil stepsisters are not only mean and nasty, but they smoke 
cigarettes. Jack, formerly associated with a certain beanstalk, traded in his 
beloved bovine for a share of the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 These stories are told in the form of an anti-smoking and anti-tobacco play 
put on by members of the Valley Community Clinic for schoolchildren, to teach 
them the dangers of smoking and how to overcome peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Loosely modeled after Stephen Sondheim's musical "Into the Woods," the play is 
called "Into the Smoke," and was performed in front of the students at 
Fernangeles Elementary School in Sun Valley on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Intertwining the stories of Jack and Cinderella, the play touches on issues of 
peer pressure, nicotine addiction and self-esteem to give children the tools to 
make educated decisions about smoking later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get them now to have enough information, then they won't indulge 
(in smoking)," said Reasie Flagg, the director of the clinic's Tobacco 
Education Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The play opens with Jack en route to the market to sell his cow when he is 
stopped by a sneaky tobacco dealer. The dealer pressures Jack into trading the 
cow in for tobacco seeds by telling him he's a "mama's boy" if he doesn't 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cinderella's -- or rather Cindy's -- sisters, Bronchitis, Emphysema 
and Leukoplakia, have decided to start smoking and chewing tobacco to make them 
look beautiful and cool so they can win the attention of the bachelor prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get a cigarette, the prince would surely marry one of us," they 
conclude. "We're doing exactly what the billboards and magazine ads have been 
telling us to do!"  
</P>
<P>
 Jack's tobacco seeds grow into an enormous stalk and Cindy's sisters buy 
leaves from him. As Jack grows rich, he wonders why people keep coming back for 
more tobacco when a magic fairy godmother explains what nicotine addiction is. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy starts to consider smoking too, when the same fairy godmother appears 
and tells her that smoking and chewing tobacco can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the prince, who ends up being Jack in a bizarre twist of the plot, 
declares that he only wants a nonsmoker for a wife and chooses Cindy, and they 
start an anti-smoking organization together to educate the people around them. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one member of the audience got the message. Fred Figueroa, 8, said he 
will never smoke even if his friends try to pressure him into starting.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; 11 COMPETE FOR 2 SEATS ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While the two senior members of the Burbank City Council have decided to give 
up their seats in next year's municipal elections, 11 contenders, including a 
former three-term councilwoman, will vie to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Robert Bowne, who was first appointed to the council in 1984 
and won reelection in 1987 and 1991, and George Battey Jr., a council member 
since 1991, could leave behind a council composed entirely of freshman members. 
The three other sitting council members were all elected in 1993, replacing 
incumbents who also chose not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of accomplishing city business could become slower at first, as 
the new members go through the learning process," said Battey, 72. "But I'm 
confident the voters will select people who are truly representative of the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Battey, a retired engineer, said he chose not to seek a second term so he 
could spend more time with his family. He said he will continue to serve as an 
ex-officio member of the construction committee of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, a post to which he was recently named. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the council candidates, only two have held elective office previously. 
Robert Dunivant, 59, a real estate agent and former Burroughs High School 
football coach, is now finishing out his first term as a Burbank School Board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Howard, 57, served on the City Council for 12 years before she was 
ousted in the 1991 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other council candidates have run unsuccessfully for the office before. 
Jules Kimmett, a retired janitor and a mainstay at the council's weekly 
meetings, has tried twice, while painting contractor Bob Kramer fell only about 
100 votes shy of a council seat in the 1993 election, when Bill Wiggins, David 
Golonski and Susan Spanos were elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are Jerry Augustine, a financial secretary; William 
Thomas Barron III, an engineer at the city's power plant; David Gerred, a 
member of the city Planning Board and owner of a glass company; Ted McConkey, a 
retired aerospace engineer and president of a local homeowners association; 
Todd Tomlinson, owner of the Grounds Zero coffee house, a popular youth 
gathering spot on San Fernando Road, and Peter Ray Torres, a salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate qualified for the ballot by turning a petition signed by at 
least 50 registered voters from Burbank to the city clerk's office by last 
Friday, city officials said. The four top vote-getters in a Feb. 28 primary 
election will compete in an April 11 runoff election, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six candidates also filed nomination papers for two open seats on the Burbank 
School Board. Incumbent board members William Abbey and Elena Hubbell are being 
challenged in their reelection bids by Malcolm Kelman, a marketing consultant, 
Mike McDonald, a realtor and retired NFL football player, David Nos, past 
president of the Burbank Chamber of Commerce, and Steve Tannen, another former 
professional football player. STEVE RYFLE

<P>
 Four seniors at Westminster High School have been named Commended Students in 
the 1995 National Merit Scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Lee, Hung M. Tran, Marc A. Walton and James K. Williams were among 
35,000 students across the nation who were honored for academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 They placed among the top 5% of the more than 1 million high school students 
who took the 1993 preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test/National Merit 
Scholarship qualifying exam. 
</P>
<P>
 However, their test scores were below the level required to be eligible for a 
Merit Scholarship award in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Each will receive a commendation from the National Merit Scholarship Corp., 
which conducts the program. BERT ELJERA

 Five family members who had been living in one cramped motel room will soon be 
in their own apartment, thanks to the owners and employees of the Bella Teresa 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Michael and Teresa Jordan donated the restaurant's entire proceeds 
Tuesday evening to pay first and last month's rent for the struggling family of 
two working parents and three teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 With the restaurant's help, the family will be able to move into a modest 
Costa Mesa apartment near where the parents and eldest child work. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant staff also donated their tips to stock the apartment's 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out really well," said Michael Jordan, who doubles as the 
restaurant's chef, cooking with the family's southern Italian recipes. "God 
willing, we hope to try to do something like this once a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordans came across the family through Friends in Service to Humanity. 
With the holidays approaching, they decided to do what they could to help the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordans ended up finding donated furniture and even a Christmas tree to 
help the family be comfortable in their new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold our house and went after our dream in opening this restaurant," 
Michael Jordan said. "People said it would never work out. It has so far, and 
with helping this family on Tuesday, even if we had to close (the restaurant) 
tomorrow, we would consider it a success." LYNN FRANEY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MEETING OFFERS TIPS FOR FIGHTING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Tis the season to be wary. 
</P>
<P>
 Tips to avoid crime during the holidays will be delivered to merchants and 
consumers who attend the Van Nuys/Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch meeting 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at 6:30 p.m., the free, one-hour meeting at Economy Office 
Furniture, 6300 Van Nuys Blvd. in Van Nuys, will feature officers from the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The holiday season is the season for crime to get worse," said Flip Smith, 
president of Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith should know. He had his own car phone stolen a few weeks ago. During the 
three hours it took him to realize it was missing, the thieves made 27 calls, 
including four to Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to preventing burglaries of cars, officers will give tips to 
shoppers on where to park, when to use automated teller machines, when to lock 
cars and homes and even when to put the presents under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants will be warned about credit card fraud, dealing with aggressive 
panhandlers and closing their stores for the holidays. Police say it is 
important to educate the public because crime may increase during the holidays, 
but extra money for police protection does not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to have the extra time to do extra patrols," said Van Nuys 
Officer Joe Losorelli. "We're basically telling people to watch out for each 
other and watch out for yourself." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; ILLEGAL CONTRACTOR ORDERED TO PAY $910 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man working illegally as a contractor after the Northridge earthquake was 
ordered Tuesday to pay $910 in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Pardal, 53, of Encino was convicted in Los Angeles Municipal Court of 
contracting without a license after a declaration of a state of emergency, said 
Deputy City Atty. P. Greg Parham. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardal was arrested Feb. 16 during sweeps by the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Bunco-Forgery Division and is the fifth person to be convicted of 
illegally contracting after the devastating Jan. 17 quake, according to the 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person he was working for said she didn't believe she was owed any 
restitution because he had completed the job," said Parham. "But he was working 
without a license." 
</P>
<P>
 Pardal, who also used the name Jack Perry and was doing business at Econo Tree 
Service when he was arrested, was removing trees and bushes as part of quake 
repairs at a home in the 9200 block of Crebs Avenue when investigators found 
him, Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 He told investigators he was hired to remove 20 trees and bushes for $1,800.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; GRIFFIN ELECTED MAYOR OVER BONE'S DISSENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new City Council sworn in Monday elected Councilman Don R. Griffin mayor 
despite a loud, "No," cast by outgoing Mayor Donald L. Bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin has been mayor pro tem for the past year and the voice vote making him 
mayor was not a surprise. Bone, who became a council member, refused to comment 
on his vote against Griffin. "The vote should speak for itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone did reflect on his time as mayor and said he had mixed emotions as he 
left that job. "On the one hand, you think, 'It's taken me 12 months to learn 
this job and I finally know what I'm doing,' " he said. "On the other hand, you 
think, 'Thank God it's over.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The city's future looks bright, with new jobs moving in, Bone added. He 
suggested the new council pursue an update of its long-range planning, improve 
relations with ethnic groups moving into the city and to continue to document 
city policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said the council policy book was one of Bone's highest achievements in 
office and he thanked him for doing "an excellent job" during a controversial 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any family, when you have strong leaders with strong personalities, you do 
talk out issues," Griffin said. He refused to comment on Bone's vote against 
him. "We have a job to do and let's do it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Marshall, top vote-getter in November's election, was elected mayor pro 
tem. 
</P>
<P>
 New Councilman Gerald N. Sigler took his seat as well, and resigned his 
position on the Planning Commission. The appointment for the commission's 
vacancy will probably be discussed at next Monday's study session, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Arthur C. Brown took his oath after a squeaker of a race that 
turned on 34 absentee ballot votes a week after he appeared to have lost to

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY TO SEEK APPLICANTS FOR SILVA'S 
COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted on Monday to not appoint the fifth-highest vote-getter 
from November's election -- in which four seats were up for grabs -- to fill 
the vacancy that will occur next month when Councilman Jim Silva takes a seat 
on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to accept applications for the vacancy and to make an 
appointment by late January. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who said he will resign from the council Jan. 3, the same day he is 
sworn in as the 2nd District supervisor, voted against the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he believes the fifth runner-up in the election, who was city 
Planning Commissioner Susie Newman, should be appointed to complete the two 
years remaining on his term. Twenty-two people ran for the four seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said the cost of a special election -- which could be as high as 
$129,000 -- is too expensive in light of the city's financial woes, and that it 
would be unfair to residents for the seat to remain vacant until an election in 
June. The council voted against holding a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dave Garofalo, who favored appointing the fifth runner-up or 
holding a special election, said, "We are overriding the electorate." He ended 
up voting for the application process. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Peter Green said he doesn't want to see the appointment process 
hastened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not hurry," he said. "This is one of the most important things we can 
do this year. It's going to set the tone of this council." 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Dec. 19 is expected to decide the criteria used to select a 
replacement and set a date to begin accepting applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's charter says the council must fill a seat within 60 days of a 
vacancy. If the council does not fill the vacancy within that period, a special 
election must be called.DEBRA CANO

SUPERVISORS OK JAMES A. MUSICK JAIL RELOCATION STUDY; SURVEY: BOARD CHAIRMAN 
THOMAS F. RILEY WITHDRAWS OPPOSITION, JOINS OTHERS IN BACKING PLAN TO LOOK INTO 
MOVING THE IRVINE FACILITY TO THE EL TORO MARINE BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously authorized a study on 
the possibility of relocating the James A. Musick Branch Jail from Irvine to El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would offer the least expensive land cost," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton 
said in urging fellow supervisors to authorize the study. "It would not require 
any condemnation of public property." 
</P>
<P>
 The study is to be completed within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was taken after Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley on Monday backed off 
earlier statements strongly opposing the relocation and suggesting that any new 
jail facilities ought to be built in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing those remarks as "off the cuff," Riley on Monday added his 
signature to Stanton's request for the El Toro study, which Riley said he had 
decided to support despite his personal objections to the proposed move. 
</P>
<P>
 Those objections seemed to have been temporarily put aside Tuesday as Stanton 
said he was "delighted to join Chairman Riley" in urging the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question that has to be answered," Stanton said of the proposed 
relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to authorizing the study, the board directed county staff to 
prepare an application to the federal government for acquisition of about 300 
acres of the 4,700-acre Marine base for the possible relocation and to assess 
the value of the 100-acre Musick jail site for possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's proposal calls for shutting down and selling the Musick jail -- a 
minium-security facility equipped to house 1,256 inmates -- and using the 
proceeds to construct a jail on part of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the federal government encourages local governments to use part of 
closed bases for jail facilities, the county might be able to get the El Toro 
property for free, county officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation of the Musick jail, Stanton has said, would put the facility in 
a remote corner of the county, where it would not bother residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has for many years been plagued by overcrowded jails, with no 
money available to build new facilities or expand old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over what to do has been renewed because of the demands of the 
state's new "three strikes and you're out" legislation, the future closure of 
the El Toro base and a recent Orange County Grand Jury report calling for 3,000 
additional jail beds at the Musick and Santa Ana jail facilities.

ANAHEIM KEEPS UP BARRICADE TO BILLBOARDS; ADVERTISING: LOS ANGELES COMPANY HAS 
BEEN TRYING FOR 10 YEARS TO GET PERMISSION TO ERECT THE SIGNS ALONG FREEWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles advertising firm which has been trying for 10 years to get 
permission to place freeway billboards throughout the city was turned down 
Tuesday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It's) a dead issue unless the company chooses to resurrect it later," Mayor 
Tom Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc. was seeking to erect 10 billboards along 
freeways in the city. In exchange, they proposed tearing down 13 smaller 
billboards on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles company has been lobbying for a decade to persuade city 
officials to overturn the ban. They also failed in 1985, 1988 and twice in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard proposal has continually been opposed by members of the business 
community, including the Walt Disney Co. They have complained that the 
billboards would add clutter. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's planning staff has also said the proposal would interfere with 
efforts to improve the appearance of the tourist areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The company proposed putting up four billboards at the junction of the Orange 
and Riverside freeways. The 950-square-foot signs would have been up to 60 feet 
above the road. They also would have been at least 500 feet apart from each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the council postponed consideration of the proposal.

3RD VALLEY QUAKE RECOVERY PLAN OKD; REDEVELOPMENT: HARD-HIT AREA COVERS 200 
ACRES OF MOSTLY COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to establish an emergency 
redevelopment plan to help rebuild quake-battered neighborhoods in North 
Hollywood, the third such recovery plan approved in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery area covers 200 acres of mostly commercial properties and is 
designed to use property taxes to generate $1.7 million in commercial and 
residential loans and money for improvements to public buildings and other 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment project is one of six that city and redevelopment officials 
are proposing for hard-hit areas in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. In 
total, the projects would raise about $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans have generated controversy primarily due to the checkered history of 
the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which would oversee the operation of 
each recovery area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the portions of North Hollywood 
within the recovery area, said residents and redevelopment officials have 
drafted a recovery plan that limits the power of the CRA and eliminates its 
power to condemn private property. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes that the plan will help rebuild a hard-hit area that 
includes Laurel Plaza and Valley Plaza malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want this area to stagnate," he said. "There is a lot of potential 
here, and I don't want it to deteriorate because of an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also listened to supporters and critics of a proposed 
redevelopment plan for 2,400 acres of hard-hit neighborhoods in Canoga Park, 
Winnetka and Reseda. But the council delayed a final decision on that plan for 
a week to respond to written criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism, Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the portions 
of the West Valley included in the plan, said the recovery proposal has the 
support of the "full fabric of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, residents and business owners in a proposed recovery 
area for the northwest Valley had to scramble Tuesday morning to rewrite 
portions of their plan after City Atty. James K. Hahn ruled that it was legally 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the proposed northeast Valley recovery 
area, said redevelopment officials and residents have corrected the problems 
addressed by Hahn without dramatically changing the plan's characteristics.

BOARD OKS FUNDS TO CONTINUE COSTLY HOSPITAL BILLING SYSTEM; FINANCES: THE 
COUNTY IS SETTING ASIDE $6.8 MILLION TO HANDLE COSTS FOR 18 MONTHS. IBAX HAD 
BEEN LAUDED AS STATE OF THE ART, BUT HAS PROVED AN EMBARRASSMENT.

<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday approved spending $6.8 million to 
continue operating a hospital computer system that was designed to make patient 
bill collecting more efficient but has cost more than $10 million to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Although estimates vary, county officials say the IBAX computer system has 
lost between $2 million and $17 million in hospital billings that might not be 
retrievable. The county canceled the IBAX contract in June after an 
investigation of the system's shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6.8 million approved Tuesday came out of the Health Services Department 
budget for non-patient service, an amount that had been set aside in case an 
alternative billing system was needed, according to Kathryn Barger, a health 
deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich. Instead, supervisors decided to spend 
the money in an attempt to improve the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will cover costs for the next 18 months, including a computer 
consultant and two computer firms helping to develop a new billing system. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is integrate the new system with IBAX so we don't 
risk losing any more billings," Barger said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, county officials are searching for a replacement system to 
handle Medi-Cal and other billing at two county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 IBAX, which cost $65 million, has been both a frustration and an embarrassment 
to the cash-strapped county. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina has taken the lead in pursuing alternatives. "This 
IBAX monster failed us miserably," Molina said during Tuesday's meeting. "We 
need to get this behind us as quickly as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision came a week after the county reached a settlement with 
IBAX in which the firm paid $3 million in cash and $5.5 million in credits to 
purchase medical supplies and computer-related equipment. Neither side admitted 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Board of Supervisors awarded IBAX the hospital billing contract in 
late 1990, the system was billed as state of the art, capable of replacing 
myriad contractors and in-house methods that were failing to promptly bill 
patients, insurance companies and other providers for hospital health care 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was installed first at High Desert Hospital in Lancaster and Rancho 
Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey and was planned to be used in four other 
county hospitals. It was projected to save more than $10 million by the time 
its contract expired in 1998.

ANAHEIM DELAYS DECISION ON HIKING GOLF COURSE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday postponed a vote on a series of fee hikes at the 
two municipal golf courses for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 New council members Bob Zemel and Lou Lopez, who were sworn in last week, said 
they did not feel prepared to vote on the matter, which will be brought before 
the council again Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee hikes were proposed in order to make the H.G. (Dad) Miller and Anaheim 
Hills golf courses more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rates, the golf courses would charge weekend rates on Fridays 
and double tournament weekend fees to $10. Friday fees would increase from $11 
to $13 for nine holes and from $16 to $22 for 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that the doubling of weekend tournament fees would probably 
result in some tournaments being moved to weekdays, leaving more tee times for 
the individual golfers on weekends. This strategy is expected to increase the 
number of rounds played. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes could raise city revenue by $160,000 annually. The 
courses now bring in about $1.5 million each year to the general fund, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the council rejected a proposal to privatize the two golf 
courses, which are among the few in Orange County to be owned and operated by a 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal by American Golf Co. to run the courses would have brought in an 
estimated $85,000 annually for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal led to a fierce debate between those who maintained that 
privatization would make money and opponents who said the city would lose 
control of a valuable asset. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council decided against privatization, it directed city staff to 
find ways to make the two courses more profitable.

NEWPORT BEACH LIBRARY EARNS GRANT FOR ENERGY-SAVING MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Public Library has received a $51,247 grant from Southern 
California Edison for building energy-conservation measures into the new 
Central Library that opened in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8.2-million main library, at 1000 Avocado Ave. in Newport Center, has 
reflective glazing, automatic lighting controls that shut off lights in 
unoccupied rooms, efficient high-energy light bulbs, variable-speed motors for 
heating and air conditioning units, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is expected to save about $12,000 to $15,000 a year by using the 
energy-saving fixtures and materials, Library Director LaDonna Kienetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are grateful to our architects and to Southern California Edison for 
helping us maximize the energy efficiency of the building, enabling us to 
significantly reduce operating costs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library building was designed by San Francisco-based Simon Martin-Vegue 
Winkelstein, in association with James L. Pirdy in Newport Beach.

GIRLFRIEND OF PANORAMA CITY SLAYING SUSPECT TURNS SELF IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police say they moved closer Tuesday to catching a man they suspect of killing 
a Panorama City man after they arrested the suspect's girlfriend, who had been 
on the lam with her boyfriend for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Lewis, 20, gave herself up to Los Angeles police Monday after her 
parents persuaded her to turn herself in, Detective Stephen Fisk said.Lewis is 
charged with being an accessory to the murder of Benito Ozaeta, 23, who was 
shot on a Panorama City street Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officials believe Victor Fuller, 29, also of 
Panorama City, walked up to Ozaeta in front of an apartment building about 8:30 
that night and fired at him several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had said Ozaeta was a familiar figure in the neighborhood who ran 
errands for local gangs. Fisk said witnesses identified Fuller as the killer, 
and an arrest warrant for him was quickly served. Police also began looking for 
Lewis. "She went with him after the murder," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller also has been identified as the man who stabbed two men on the same 
block just hours before the shooting, LAPD Detective Oscar Lopez said. The men 
were treated for their injuries at a local hospital and released. Police say 
they don't know what precisely motivated the stabbings or the shooting. "I've 
got different stories" explaining Fuller's actions, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe Fuller is still in the area. "He's definitely armed," Lopez 
said.

COUNCIL TO RELEASE DETAILS OF VOTE TO INDEMNIFY POLICE; COURT: DISCLOSURE IS 
PART OF LAWSUIT SEEKING TO HOLD PANELISTS INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE FOR DECIDING TO 
PAY PUNITIVE DAMAGES ASSESSED AGAINST OFFICERS IN MAN'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a stern ruling from a federal judge, the Los Angeles City 
Council agreed Tuesday to release information about closed-door sessions in 
which council members decided to indemnify officers in a number of police 
brutality cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The rare agreement to disclose discussions that are normally kept confidential 
came as the latest development in an unusual and potentially far-reaching 
lawsuit that could result in a ruling holding individual council members 
financially liable for voting to pay punitive damages assessed against police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But city lawyers said Tuesday the council is willing to make full disclosure 
because it has always acted properly, again voicing hope that the suit will be 
dismissed before it goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anything to hide," City Atty. James K. Hahn said Tuesday after 
emerging from a closed-door session on the matter with the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the trial was originally scheduled to begin this week before U.S. 
District Judge J. Spencer Letts, the case has been continued until Feb. 6 to 
allow more time to comply with the plaintiff's discovery motions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Stephen Yagman, who is suing 10 current and former council members on 
behalf of the 4-year-old daughter of a police shooting victim, contends in the 
trial that the council's tradition of indemnifying police officers ordered to 
pay civil brutality judgments fostered a policy of more police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiff Johanna Trevino's father, Javier, was one of three robbers slain by 
police as they fled a MacDonald's restaurant in Sunland in 1990. A fourth man 
was critically wounded in the shootout, which police said ended a series of 
armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman won a jury verdict of $44,000 in punitive damages against the nine 
officers involved in the shooting, as well as then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
Jurors specified that they wanted the officers to pay the damages themselves, 
not have them covered by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council voted to indemnify the officers anyway during an April 15, 
1992 closed session, Yagman sued again, this time saying that their action made 
the council members themselves liable to pay the Trevino girl punitive damages 
for the death of her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman hailed Tuesday's disclosure agreement as unprecedented and said it 
could reveal what happened in as many as 44 police brutality suits that cost 
city taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yagman also said he is highly skeptical of how much information he will 
actually receive, suggesting that council members might claim memory lapses and 
city clerks could say crucial tapes and documents have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm going to get anything," Yagman said after a closed-door 
hearing in Letts' chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Letts on Monday strongly urged the council to be more forthcoming about the 
1992 vote that prompted Yagman's suit, and he chastised the city attorney's 
office for advising the council members to invoke executive and attorney-client 
privileges to avoid answering Yagman's questions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council agreed Tuesday to comply, another hearing was convened 
before Letts, apparently to iron out how many brutality suit discussions the 
council would reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said the city wanted to limit the disclosures to the 1992 verdict 
underlying the Trevino case, but that he wanted to prove a pattern of 
rubber-stamping such indemnification decisions by looking at similar cases 
dating back to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 A private attorney for the council, Skip Miller, declined to discuss what was 
said in Letts' chambers. Miller agreed the council will release information on 
closed-door sessions about police punitive damages, but he said the number of 
relevant cases is closer to 11 than the 44 cited by Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
 The material on confidential discussions that the council turns over to the 
court will be sealed by the judge, not made part of the public record.LOS

COASTLINE COLLEGE WINS GRANT TO AID BRAIN-INJURED ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coastline Community College has been awarded a three-year, $219,000 grant from 
the U.S. Department of Education that it will use to improve its cognitive 
retraining curriculum for adults with brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was one of 72 colleges and universities nationwide to receive a 
grant from the Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of 
Post-secondary Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing with 1,895 applicants from colleges and universities nationwide, 
Coastline was one of only eight two-year colleges to receive grant money, 
Coastline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The college is also the only winner that will use the grant money to address 
the needs of people with disabilities. The grant will be used to redesign 
curriculum for the college's Traumatic Head Injury Program at Coastline's Costa 
Mesa Center, said Project Director Stacey Hunter Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money is given to colleges that have innovative programs, which can 
also be used as models for other institutions, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz will lead a team of 12 Coastline faculty members who will devise the 
curriculum by drawing on materials and strategies used elsewhere. The group 
will evaluate the material, incorporate it into the existing curriculum, link 
it all to a computerized plan, and test its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Schwartz: "It takes hours and hours to redesign a curriculum. We're 
thrilled to have the funds set aside so we can make our dreams a reality."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 4-MONTH-OLD KILLED IN MOBILE HOME FIRE; BLAZE: 
THE INFANT'S PARENTS RECENTLY REMOVED BATTERIES FROM A SMOKE ALARM THAT COULD 
HAVE PREVENTED THE PALMDALE TRAGEDY, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 Fire officials say the death of a 4-month-old boy in a mobile home fire 
Tuesday could have been prevented if his parents hadn't removed batteries from 
a smoke alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Duenas, 38, and his 4-month-old son, Manuel, were in the family's home 
when flames broke out shortly before 10:30 a.m., said Inspector Wade Little, 
community relations officer for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Duenas awoke from where he was sleeping on a living room couch and tried to 
leave through the mobile home's front door, but was driven back by flames and 
left by the back door. He thought Manuel was with his mother, Guadalupe Salas, 
at a neighbor's house, but the baby was actually in another room of the mobile 
home, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father attempted to put out the flames with a water hose. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Salas returned and was injured as she attempted to enter the 
mobile home's front door to retrieve the baby, Little said. Salas, 37, was 
later taken to the Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, where she was 
treated for smoke inhalation and cuts to her arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile home in the 35800 block of 165th St. East was already engulfed in 
flames when firefighters arrived, Little said. Multiple explosions shook the 
structure as several five-gallon propane tanks burst. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mobile home was equipped with a smoke alarm, the parents earlier 
had removed the batteries because it had been beeping constantly, Little said. 
The sound may have been the device's warning signal that a fresh battery was 
needed, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the father) would have been woken earlier by the smoke alarm, he probably 
could have gotten the baby out," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fortunate to wake up," said Little. "Most people don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are still investigating the cause of the blaze. Salas told fire 
officials she had placed wood in the trailer's wood-burning heater shortly 
before leaving to go to their neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused an estimated $15,000 in damage to the mobile home, which was 
located in a rural, scrub-covered desert area with few nearby structures. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second time in two days that a person was killed in a mobile home 
fire in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Harper, 32, of Lancaster died of smoke inhalation early Monday morning 
when a portable electric heater started a fire in a home at the Desert Breeze 
Mobile Home Park.

AIRPORT OR RISK LOSING IT FOR THE MARCH 7 BALLOT.

 A referendum that could settle the future of Agua Dulce Airpark by allowing 
residents to decide whether to expand the tiny airport or risk losing it was 
approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The air park issue will be on the ballot March 7 during regularly scheduled 
local elections as a non-binding measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Agua Dulce voters overwhelmingly reject the idea of ownership by the 
county -- which has in the past favored expansion of the facility -- the county 
will abide by that decision, said Dave Vanatta, an aide to Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a clear (majority), we'll leave it alone, . . . but if it's 51% to 
49%, I don't know what we'd do," Vanatta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the airport has been a divisive issue in Agua Dulce for nearly a 
decade and became even more contentious earlier this year when its owner 
announced his intention to build single-family homes on the 208-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who favor purchase by the county are pilots who live in the area 
and use the facility. Other supporters say the air park is an asset in case the 
area is struck by another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of Agua Dulce's 2,100 residents are concerned that a county-run 
airport would increase noise and traffic in their bucolic community. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the past decade, public opinion polls have shown the town's residents 
opposed to an expanded air park by as much as a 3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ted Gustin, chief of the aviation division in the county's Department of 
Public Works, said those polls left too much open to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people really thought it was going to be another Burbank (Airport)," 
he said. "So this time, we're going to try to keep (the question) as simple as 
we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact language of the measure will be determined after holding meetings 
with Aqua Dulce residents, Vanatta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The air park has been controversial since three businessmen built it for their 
private use in 1959 and, later, tried to expand it. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles leased the facility for 10 years beginning in 1968, 
but scrapped plans to use it as an auxiliary to Van Nuys Airport because of 
community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action affecting the Santa Clarita Valley area, the supervisors 
Tuesday approved the environmental impact report for a 1,544-home development 
north of Santa Clarita and appropriated $30,000 for improvements at Castaic 
Lake State Recreation Area.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEFENSE CALLS WOMAN IN KIDNAPING A 'WILLING 
COMPANION'; COURTS: ATTORNEY FOR TIMOTHY DANIEL SHUE ALLEGES REALTOR CONCOCTED 
TALE OF ABDUCTION, RAPE. PROSECUTOR TELLS JURORS OF VICTIM'S TERROR DURING 
TWO-DAY ORDEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Defense attorneys for a man accused of kidnaping a Santa Clarita Valley real 
estate agent for two terrifying days told a federal jury on Tuesday that the 
alleged victim had really been a "willing companion" eager to teach her husband 
a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendant Timothy Daniel Shue had no idea when he met alleged victim Paula 
Harrington that "she was in an unhappy marriage with a husband who never came 
home -- and that she'd let him know what that felt like," said Deputy Federal 
Public Defender Neison M. Marks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening day of Shue's trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
Marks said Harrington's only misgivings about their fling across California and 
Arizona arose when Shue told her he was on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was a remorseful Harrington who then concocted a tale of abduction and 
rape to save her reputation, Marks told the jury, adding that the Century 21 
saleswoman forced Shue to play along and tie her up by threatening to turn him 
in to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, 38, is being held without bail on charges of kidnaping Harrington June 
29 as she showed him houses for sale in Val Verde and threatening her with a 
gun during a two-day drive to Arizona. If convicted, he could face life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 A Michigan native and convicted robber, Shue's alleged abduction of Harrington 
culminated what authorities say was a two-month odyssey of rape, robbery and 
brutality. The case is being tried in federal court because it crosses state 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Marks' opening statements, Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel P. Collins 
outlined for the jury what appeared to be an open-and-shut case against Shue: 
Harrington survived the ordeal to identify him as her kidnaper and rapist; 
Shue's fingerprint was lifted from the Gila Bend, Ariz., motel room where 
Harrington was found bound and gagged, and Shue gave FBI agents a detailed 
confession after his arrest at a bar in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington endured "a nightmare," Collins said, in which Shue constantly 
threatened the 27-year-old woman with a gun, forced her to withdraw cash with 
her ATM card, and to have sex with him in two motel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 With his handgun never far from reach, Shue forced Harrington to pose for him 
in fishnet stockings and drink champagne, and to perform oral sex as well as 
intercourse, Collins told the jury. At one point, he joined her in the shower 
with his gun in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This frightened her a great deal," Collins said, "because she was afraid he'd 
shoot her and let her blood wash down the drain like she'd seen in movies." 
</P>
<P>
 As Collins spoke, the pale, balding Shue smiled and occasionally laughed, took 
notes and whispered with his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks urged the jurors to be skeptical of Harrington's testimony, and to also 
look askance at an unsigned, unrecorded confession he said was taken while Shue 
was under the influence of beer, tequila and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks also noted the absence of rape charges against Shue, telling the jurors 
there was no medical evidence of forced sex because Harrington had been a 
consenting partner and resisted medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Harrington's friends and relatives were present in court and seemed 
upset by the defense's case. But they declined to comment. "I don't think we 
dare," said one woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was to continue today.

 A 5-year-old girl died Tuesday after she was trapped in her mother's car when 
it overturned after colliding with a car driven by an off-duty sheriff's 
deputy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Mazariegos, 30, of Palmdale was driving south on 45th Street East near 
Avenue R with her three daughters, ages 3 to 5, at about 5:20 p.m. when her car 
collided with another driven by Joseph Skophammer, a deputy who works out of 
the Santa Clarita Station, said Lt. Sandra Crawford of the Los Angeles 
Sheriff's Department.Skophammer was accompanied by his 6-year-old daughter, 
Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazariegos' car overturned, trapping Amy Mazariegos, 5, inside and ejecting 
the mother and her two youngest daughters, Leslie, 4, and Martha, 3, said Capt. 
Doug Moe of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy died at Desert Palms Hospital from massive injuries. Her mother was in 
serious condition at Antelope Valley Hospital with a broken pelvis, Crawford 
said. It was unknown whether they were wearing seat belts, Crawford added. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-duty deputy and his daughter, Karina Skophammer, were both wearing 
seat bets and received only minor injuries, Crawford said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

MAN CHARGED IN STALKING, STABBING OF EX-GIRLFRIEND

 A Canoga Park man was charged with attempted murder and stalking Tuesday in 
the stabbing of his ex-girlfriend, a woman he shot in 1991, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Dale Harden, 54, was arrested Saturday after allegedly chasing Diane 
Pierce-Hamrick, 49, and stabbing her several times in front of her Canoga Park 
apartment, said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty.Robert Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce-Hamrick was recovering from her injuries at a local hospital, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said Harden was charged with stalking because "he had been hanging 
around and bugging her since he got out of prison (for shooting her). She 
apparently didn't want him around." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce-Hamrick and Harden lived together for 20 years before they broke up in 
1991, family and friends said. Harden shot Pierce-Hamrick during a jealous rage 
and was convicted of the crime that same year, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He kept trying to get her to continue the relationship as it was before and 
she really didn't want to," said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden is being held in lieu of $800,000 bail at Los Angeles County Jail, 
Cohen said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

'HOLIDAY SURPRISE' TARGETS CAR BURGLARS; CRIME: POLICE STAKEOUT AIMS AT CURBING 
THEFT AT SHOPPING MALLS. IT GETS OFF TO A SLOW START. 
</P>

 Message for thieves: If it looks too good to be true, maybe it is. 
</P>
<P>
 To crack down on car burglaries at San Fernando Valley shopping malls, police 
Tuesday launched operation "Holiday Surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 A brightly wrapped Christmas present and a cellular phone were left inside an 
unattended convertible, with the top down, at Panorama Mall. A dozen hidden 
cops watched. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours, no takers, even after police added a couple of bags 
filled with wrapped gifts. Nor did police have any success when they ran 
through the program the day before at upscale Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find a way to park the car inside the mall," quipped one 
detective, when it became apparent Tuesday that the stakeout was off to a slow 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD launched the program in an effort to curb car burglaries, which they 
say jump into the hundreds during the busy holiday shopping season. More than 
16,000 cars had been burglarized throughout the San Fernando Valley by the end 
of October, a 1.3% increase over the previous year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, no thieves took the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of complaints," said LAPD Detective Bob Arzuman, of the 
Valley Bureau's auto theft task force. "We're trying to address the concerns of 
the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 One businessman who complained, Flip Smith, said he was amazed to learn that 
the operation had failed to deliver a single suspect in its first few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it, we thought this would be an absolute field day," said 
Smith, co-chair of the Sepulveda and Van Nuys Boulevard Business Watch. Smith, 
who also owns a tire store in Sepulveda, said he had high hopes that police 
would nab a burglar like the one who stole a cellular phone from his car just 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Business watch members have been asked to post flyers warning car thieves that 
"The next car you break into may be the one that police are watching." 
</P>
<P>
 "Steal at your own risk!!!"

DRUG PROBE AT SCHOOL YIELDS 6 ARRESTS; INVESTIGATION: UNDERCOVER OFFICER POSING 
AS A STUDENT AT SONORA HIGH IN LA HABRA HELPS NET SUSPECTS, WHO ARE ACCUSED OF 
SELLING MARIJUANA OR METHAMPHETAMINES. 
</P>

<P>
 The new student was surly and unmotivated, ditching classes at Sonora High 
School and quickly falling in with other students who might have access to 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, four of those friends were arrested on charges that they had sold 
small quantities of marijuana or methamphetamines to that rebellious transfer 
student, who actually was an undercover cop. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth Sonora High student was suspended, and an arrest warrant was issued 
for a sixth. In addition, two La Habra men were arrested Tuesday in the case, 
police said. All are suspected of selling small amounts of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police acknowledged that the number of arrests from the three-month undercover 
investigation was about half what they had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly expected the number to be a double-digit," said Capt. John Rees, 
whose daughter is a senior at the school. "I'm not disappointed at all. I just 
think the problem, fortunately, isn't as big as it was perceived." 
</P>
<P>
 But police and school officials said the targeted students, three of whom were 
arrested on campus after being called out of class, make up the core of a 
limited campus drug market. The undercover officer was able to buy marijuana 
and methamphetamines but could not find the most powerful drugs: cocaine, LSD 
and heroin, Rees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say based on the evidence just gained, it's minimal," said Cindy 
Ranii, principal of the 1,389-student school. "But we know there's availability 
and use in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover officer, who was temporarily assigned to La Habra from another 
Orange County police agency, hung out with students and learned favored sites 
to buy and use drugs, Rees said.  
</P>
<P>
 The officer, whose real identity was known on campus only to Ranii, acted the 
role of a troubled teen so convincingly that teachers and counselors kept 
offering their help, Ranii said. Rees placed the officer's real age in the 
mid-20s.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RESIDENTS SEEK TO RECALL 3 LANCASTER COUNCIL 
MEMBERS; GOVERNMENT: GROUP STARTS PROCESS TO OUST OFFICIALS WHO AWARDED 
LUCRATIVE CONTRACT EXTENSION TO CITY MANAGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents angry about a lucrative contract extension given last month to the 
city manager have handed recall notices to three City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a group called Concerned Citizens of Lancaster gave the 
intent-to-recall papers at Monday's council meeting to Mayor Frank Roberts and 
Councilmen Henry Hearns and George Runner, charging that the three ignored a 
community outcry over City Manager Jim Gilley's new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "You three gentlemen show the utmost contempt for the citizens of Lancaster," 
said Harriet R. Whitton, spokeswoman for the recall campaign. "We have no 
choice. We can't get your attention in any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall notices also accused the three councilmen, who voted for the 
contract, of failing to hold a public hearing on redevelopment practices, 
harming small businesses by granting unnecessary concessions to commercial 
developers, buying property above the appraised value and "general dereliction 
of duty." 
</P>
<P>
 If 20 signatures on the intent-to-recall notices are verified by the city 
clerk, the recall activists will have 120 days to collect about 9,400 
signatures from registered Lancaster voters on petitions for each of the 
targeted council members. If those signatures are verified, a recall election 
will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall papers were handed out near the beginning of a meeting that drew a 
standing-room-only audience, including many people wearing gold ribbons to show 
their support for the councilmen targeted for recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the recall foes, who have formed their own group called Lancaster 
Citizens for Good Government, argued that the effort to oust Roberts, Runner 
and Hearns was unwarranted and harmful to the city's efforts to attract new 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any recall hurts everyone," said Michael Pope, a member of the anti-recall 
group. "It's going to cost money, and it's going to tear at the fiber of our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 After residents from both sides had their say, the council members unleashed 
harsh verbal attacks against the recall proponents and contended that the two 
council members not targeted for recall -- Michael Singer and Deborah Shelton 
-- had instigated the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts charged that the recall was "driven and started by two of my close 
colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and Shelton acknowledged that they had contacted community leaders and 
news reporters after a proposal to revise the city manager's contract was added 
at the last minute to the Nov. 7 City Council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, Singer and Shelton said they do not support efforts to recall 
the other council members. But Singer said residents deserved to know about the 
last-minute changes proposed in the city manager's contract. "I do not 
apologize for talking to the citizens who elected me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, Gilley, whose $127,000-a-year contract was to run through 
August, 1997, was to receive automatic one-year contract extensions each August 
and up to 30 months of extra pay as a consultant if he were fired by a 3-2 vote 
of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nov. 7 meeting, angry residents complained that the contract was too 
generous and asked that a vote be delayed for two weeks so that the provisions 
could be reviewed in greater detail and compared to other city managers' 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, Runner and Hearns opposed such a delay, voting to drop the automatic 
annual contract extensions and consulting bonus, but approved the remaining 
provisions, including a one-year extension and annual pay raises linked to the 
cost-of-living index. Shelton and Singer voted against the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Shelton and Singer urged that the city hire an independent mediator 
to help restore harmony among the council members. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberts said the battle lines appear to have been drawn. "It's time to 
proceed with the recall," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Runner appeared confident that the recall effort would not succeed. Referring 
to the 25 signatures on the initial recall papers, he said: "You can get 25 
people's names on a paper saying the Earth's flat."

20,000 NATIONWIDE INVESTED IN PHONY RETIREMENT PLANS, OFFICIALS SAY; 
SECURITIES: ABOUT 1,000 CALIFORNIANS WERE ALLEGEDLY BILKED OF AS MUCH AS 
$30,000 EACH IN THE $1.5-BILLION SCHEME. 
</P>

 About 20,000 people nationwide have invested an estimated $1.5 billion over 
the past 18 months in allegedly phony retirement plans, which were falsely 
promoted on television as being approved by the Internal Revenue Service, 
securities officials from several states disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the Department of Corporations -- in its largest enforcement 
effort -- has taken legal action against 426 individuals and entities that took 
in several hundred million dollars through the scheme, said G.W. McDonald, 
chief of enforcement. An estimated 1,000 California investors were bilked of 
between $1,500 to more than $30,000 each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extraordinarily unlikely that people would get their money back" based 
on past fraud cases, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 In television infomercials, promoters targeted the holders of individual 
retirement accounts by promising incredibly high rates of return -- up to 600% 
over five years -- and the safety of "IRA-approved" offerings endorsed by the 
IRS. The investors' money would supposedly be used to build high-tech 
communication projects based on the government licenses for interactive video, 
mobile radio and other wireless forms of communications. 
</P>
<P>
 But the IRS does not approve or endorse any individual investments, and the 
licenses held by many of the promoters have proven to be either overvalued or 
nonexistent, according to investigators. In fact, most of the investors' funds 
have been eaten up by large fees charged by the promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 "These investors were looking to provide for themselves in their retirement 
years," California Commissioner of Corporations Gary Mendoza said in a 
statement. "It's a cruel hoax to raise false hopes of investment return with no 
prospects of delivery and rob people of their retirement plans." 
</P>
<P>
 California investigators made a crucial breakthrough when they identified a 
Pasadena pension fund administrator that the promoters used to gather the 
investors' funds. The administrator, who was not identified by state officials, 
agreed to provide investigators a list of the 7,000 investors and more than 140 
individuals and firms involved in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the yearlong investigation, the Department of Corporations has 
recommended the criminal prosecution of seven Southern California residents on 
charges of securities fraud and the sale of unregistered securities, McDonald 
said.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; REDUX OF ATARI CRASH OF 
'83?; VIDEO GAME MACHINE SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE OFF 15%

 Atari Corp. President Sam Tramiel remembers well the video game crash of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 As sales of the hugely popular Atari 2600 game machine plunged to half of 
their peak of a year earlier, the Commodore 64 -- the low-cost home computer 
sold by his father's company, Commodore Business Machines -- was selling in 
record numbers, largely at Atari's expense. The Tramiels left Commodore to take 
over the troubled game company the following year, and have been trying to 
resuscitate it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, following the industry's meteoric resurrection -- crafted by 
Nintendo and Sega in the second half of the 1980s -- some industry observers 
say history may be about to repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans buy personal computers and CD-ROM drives like never before, sales 
of Sega and Nintendo's 16-bit video game machines -- which together have made 
their way into 30 million American homes -- are expected to be off as much as 
15% this Christmas season compared to last. Sales of game cartridges are 
forecast to be flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Several next-generation game machines, which promise to incorporate newer 
technology and faster microprocessors, have not yet reached the market. And 
those that have, such as the 3D0 Multiplayer and Philips Electronics' CD-I, are 
more than double the $130 base price of a Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo 
Entertainment System. Many consumers are choosing to wait till next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, analysts say the PC market is already siphoning off nearly 15% of 
video game sales. Equipping a personal computer to play CD-ROM software costs 
about $250 -- and by the end of the year over 5 million American households are 
expected to own multimedia-capable PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is definitely in a transition period between generations of 
technology," said multimedia analyst Bruce Ryon of Dataquest, a market 
consulting firm in San Jose. "And it's not clear how deep the trough is going 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 No one expects the dip this time around to be as dramatic as the infamous 
Atari bust of 1983. But the break in the industry's relentless climb will 
likely mean that Sega Enterprises and Nintendo Co. will have to share the 
market to new competitors like Sony Corp. and 3DO, and perhaps an old 
competitor like Atari. 
</P>
<P>
 It will mean a shakeout among game developers who don't have the financial 
strength to weather the transition. And it may mean that the video game 
industry loses a key set of consumers -- at least for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The shifting currents in the video game business also come at a time when 
dozens of new players are trying to get into what has been the lucrative 
business of publishing games. Every Hollywood studio has made significant 
investments in game publishing over the last two years -- and some of them may 
soon find that it's not such an easy business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Interactive's first cartridge title based on the "Pagemaster" movie, for 
example, is reportedly selling poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents our belief that the video game market is here to stay," said 
Steve McBeth, chief of the new interactive division the Walt Disney Co. 
announced earlier this week. "But unfortunately there is this platform war -- 
we know there are going to be a few bumps along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry veterans like Tramiel point to the transition from Nintendo's 
original 8-bit game system to the 16-bit systems prevalent today as proof that 
consumers are dedicated to upgrading their interactive consumer electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a crash," says Tramiel, "It's a pause. When the Atari 2600 went 
down, it wasn't that the industry crashed, it was that a different machine came 
into play. And that's what's going to happen now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tramiel hopes the Atari Jaguar is that machine. Using a 64-bit processor -- 
the fastest on the market -- the Jaguar has received positive reviews, but few 
games are available to play on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other competitors in the market for next-generation machines include Sony's 
32-bit Playstation, Nintendo's Ultra-64, and Sega's Saturn, all due sometime 
next year. This Christmas, Sega is also marketing an adapter to the Genesis 
called 32-X, which makes for faster game play. And next spring Nintendo plans 
to release a 32-bit portable game player called "Virtual Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 But some game developers and analysts are more wary of the current transition. 
Sega and Nintendo kept the price of their 16-bit systems below $200, for one 
thing, while most of the next-generation machines are expected to initially 
cost $250 and up -- beyond what has traditionally been able to garner 
high-volume sales. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more competitors this time, too. "How can you possibly support all 
those platforms?" asks one game developer. "It's impossible. You can't. You 
just have to bet on a few." 
</P>
<P>
 And analysts say that by the time the advanced technology becomes available on 
game machines that hook up to the television, young children will have already 
become accustomed to playing games and using educational software on the PC -- 
and parents may see no reason to switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger kids are used to playing PC entertainment and educational 
titles," said Keith Benjamin, who follows the industry for Robertson Stephens, 
an investment firm in San Francisco. "We suspect parents may be holding off on 
video game platforms for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin noted that several video game titles aimed at young kids this season, 
including the most recent in Sega's hit "Sonic" series, "Sonic and Knuckles," 
have done poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp., for one, is making a big push to woo children who may not 
have been exposed to video games yet. The firm's multimillion-dollar 
advertising campaign for its new "Microsoft Home" line of CD-ROM software 
includes, among other things, a 45-foot-long "ExplorasauraBus" currently making 
a nationwide tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional video game developers are plowing more money into development of 
CD-ROMs for the PC market, too. San Mateo-based Electronic Arts spent nearly $5 
million developing "Wing Commander III," a flight-simulation game for the PC 
with live action video "starring" actor Mark Hamill of "Star Wars" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "CD-ROM games will be 20% to 25% of our total revenue this year, up from 2% 
last year," said Bing Gordon, EA's executive vice president. "That's a dramatic 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the video game business, even in decline, is not to be sneezed at. 
Nintendo expects to sell a whopping 2.5 million of its just-released "Donkey 
Kong Country" game for the Super NES -- enhanced by sophisticated computer 
programming to look far more realistic than other NES games -- by the end of 
the year in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, we have to take a cue from the traditional linear media 
business," said Robert Kotick, chairman of Los Angeles-based Activision, whose 
main Christmas offering, "Pitfall," is, ironically enough, recycled from its 
days as a hit on the Atari 2600. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy is to do 10 of the biggest-budget, highest production value 
games, and market the crap out of them," he said. "The key to our future is 
mass media exploitation of characters and stories that go beyond our medium. 
Video games have to become the place where new concepts in pop culture start, 
not end." Peaking Popularity? 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of video game hardware and software appear to have peaked, while sales 
of personal computer CD-ROM games are growing sharply. Sales, in millions of 
units:

JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: DEBACLE WILL COST EVERY CITY, TOWN IN 
THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Behind Orange County's unprecedented bankruptcy filing lies a pattern of 
sheer, loopy amateurism and intellectual dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
 With little of the oversight or controls that are common to corporate finance 
or the management of any mutual fund, Orange County's treasurer managed to turn 
$7.5 billion in public tax revenues -- put in his care to earn short-term 
interest -- into bankruptcy on a fund totaling almost $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code is tactical, 
intended to shield the county's fund from redemptions and lawsuits by some of 
its 187 investors, which include cities, school districts and transport and 
sanitation agencies in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a tactic that will have long-term consequences for every city, town 
and school district in the United States. Simply put, they will have to pay 
more to borrow money from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 "This turns the world of municipal finance upside-down," says the head of a 
Los Angeles municipal bond firm. "It changes the view of investors toward 
municipal debt. If issuers can consider bankruptcy as an alternative, then it 
raises the level of risk for all." 
</P>
<P>
 How did proud Orange County come to this? It's yet another case of "We have 
met the enemy, and he is us."  
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the county faces a threat of $1.5 billion in losses in a fund of 
only $7.5 billion of public money. But that public tax money was leveraged 
almost threefold by $12 billion in borrowings designed to enhance the returns 
on investment -- the more you invest, the more you can earn, or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 And what was the public purpose of those borrowings? It was to give county 
agencies, cities and school and water districts a little extra in their 
budgets. That way, government officials and county residents could get around 
the realities of life in a time of stern voter resistance to taxes and vocal 
protests about the size of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is not alone. Across the United States, municipalities have been 
piling on debt for years even as Americans have crowed about shrinking 
government. State and local government borrowings rose to $289 billion last 
year from $154 billion in 1991, according to the Federal Reserve System, 
although rising interest rates have cut the number of bond issues this year. 
Total municipal debt outstanding has risen to $1.22 trillion from $365 billion 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is only unique in the amount of leverage," says Joe Mysak, 
editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, a biweekly newsletter. 
Municipalities in other states, from Florida to Wyoming, have come to grief in 
complex investments involving interest rate swaps and other financial 
derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County is unique as the largest political entity ever to declare 
bankruptcy -- New York in 1975 never got to bankruptcy, and a judge turned down 
the 1991 filing by Bridgeport, Conn.  
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on the incredible amateurishness with which County Treasurer Robert 
L. Citron was allowed to manage the vast portfolio of tax revenues. Even as the 
fund declares bankruptcy, public finance officers in California and elsewhere 
have many unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who authorized Bob Citron to borrow that much?" asks a public finance expert. 
"Was it the supervisors?" Citron ran a peculiar operation, trading billions in 
bonds himself, says a bond dealer who knows him.  
</P>
<P>
 Citron's basic investment approach was not complicated. He reasoned that 
longer-term investments paid higher interest than short-term ones, so he used 
interest rate swaps and other financial techniques to "lengthen the portfolio's 
duration," explains Robert Haugen, a professor of finance at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's fund investments attained an average maturity of 2 1/2 years 
and thus earned higher interest. And that return was then enhanced by using 
borrowed money to increase total investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal flaw in Citron's approach didn't really show up until this year, as 
interest rates rose. Values of bonds and notes in Orange County's fund fell, as 
did those of most bond funds. But unlike mutual and pension funds and prudent 
corporate treasurers, Citron was not required to revalue his investments daily 
to reflect market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's reports to the county's five-member Board of Supervisors, in 
contrast, were chatty reviews of the economy. In this year's report, he 
included an observation that "governmental accounting standards do not require 
municipal investment pools to periodically adjust the cost of their portfolios 
to reflect current market." 
</P>
<P>
 So the supervisors apparently were not aware of the extent of the fund's 
problems. And oversight by the debt-rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and 
Moody's, proved a joke. Consistently, their reviews of Orange County debt 
focused on the area's underlying economic strength and praised the high returns 
Citron's fund was making -- without questioning how he was making them. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lax regulation is about to change. "There will be much more scrutiny of 
municipal debt," says the head of a bond firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of Wall Street houses in Orange County's failure will receive 
attention in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and in 
congressional hearings and lawsuits in the months ahead. Merrill Lynch loaned 
Orange County $2.5 billion and then supplied the investment vehicles in which 
Citron put the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing, in short, looks less like a professionally managed investment 
fund than a political slush fund. And in truth, that is partly what it was, not 
in the traditional sense of graft, but in the contemporary sense of office 
holders under pressure from rising costs and angry voters trying to get a 
little leeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will pay for the mistakes? The people of Orange County will pay, either 
with more cash to support their stricken communities and school districts or in 
reduced services. And every other county, town and city will pay too, because 
amateurism and intellectual dishonesty have just raised the level of risk for 
all.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FINANCIAL MARKETS FEAR THE CRISIS WILL HAVE SEVERE 
REPERCUSSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial markets are bracing for what could be severe fallout from Orange 
County's bankruptcy filing and from Tuesday's first step in the liquidation of 
the county's massive bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the scope of the crisis is so broad -- encompassing the 
municipal bond market, the market for U.S. government securities and the mutual 
fund industry -- that it presents a monumental challenge to Wall Street and to 
federal and state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to shake confidence in the entire bond market," said Richard 
Lehmann of the Bond Investors Assn. in Miami Lakes, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is in shock," said one Southland muni bond trader. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the solution that markets often look to in times of crisis -- for 
the Federal Reserve Board to quickly ease interest rates, reducing strain on 
the financial system -- is not an option for the central bank because of the 
economy's continued strength, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Fed's decision to tighten credit this year for the first time 
since 1989 in effect sowed the seeds of Orange County's financial disaster by 
driving all interest rates higher and by narrowing the spread between short- 
and long-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, which has used its $18.5-billion investment fund to bet heavily 
on lower interest rates, is just the latest big investor to be ruined by the 
Fed's turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
 But the list of losers has lengthened as the year has progressed, and Wall 
Street's great fear is that the county's unraveling now will prompt new losses 
for a host of other teetering investors -- or bring to light the heretofore 
hidden portfolio problems of other municipal investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The only good news for Orange County and for other owners of longer-term bonds 
is that the bond market has been trying to rally over the past two weeks, 
pushing long-term interest rates somewhat lower. The yield on 30-year Treasury 
bonds slid to 7.87% on Tuesday from 7.92% on Monday, and down from 8.13% two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that rally can continue, however, may depend on investors' response to 
the Orange County bankruptcy filing and to the potential for a new round of 
bond liquidations by institutional and individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what analysts are most concerned about: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. government securities. Bonds issued by the Treasury and government 
agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. make up the bulk of 
securities in the Orange County fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wall Street begins to fear that the fund will be liquidated -- dumping 
$18.5 billion in securities on the market -- other bond investors may attempt 
to sell ahead of the fund, driving interest rates up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although $18.5 billion in bonds is relatively small given the 
multitrillion-dollar size of the government bond market, it still is a 
formidable portfolio to digest, bond pros say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the market perceives there's a lot more to come, the implication becomes a 
snowballing effect," said one major Southland bond investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the county's bankruptcy comes at a time when many other big investors 
that had bet on lower interest rates also are throwing in towel, liquidating 
bonds in the same two- to 10-year maturity range that comprises the bulk of the 
county fund's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those investors, like the county, had borrowed using short-term loans 
to buy longer-term bonds. It was a profitable transaction while short-term 
interest rates remained low in 1993. But in 1994, as short-term rates have 
moved ever higher, the cost of the loans has come to exceed the yield earned on 
the longer-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two months the market yield on two-year Treasury notes has 
soared nearly a full percentage point, to about 7.5% currently, in part because 
banks and other large investors have bailed out of those securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for the U.S. government bond market is that "we don't know where 
we are in the (unwinding) process," said Jim Grant, editor of Grant's Interest 
Rate Observer newsletter in New York. "The banks have been trying to get out in 
front of the problem, but we don't know how much more short-term stuff is left 
to be sold." 
</P>
<P>
 Although brokerage CS First Boston was able to unload $2 billion of Orange 
County's bonds in a surprise sale late Tuesday, analysts said the market's 
ability to digest those came before investors fully understood where they were 
coming from, or that the county's bankruptcy was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular concern nationwide is whether other municipal investment funds, 
like the Orange County fund, have waited until now to acknowledge their bond 
market losses and troubles with complex "derivative" securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the market now wonder who else that we don't know about has one foot 
in bankruptcy," Lehmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal bonds. Wall Street is terrified that the county's bankruptcy, 
which had not been considered even a remote possibility as recently as last 
weekend, will so stun institutional and individual investors that many will 
seek to bail out of any and all muni bonds -- even those far afield from Orange 
County and California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most analysts say that wholesale dumping of muni bonds would be 
illogical -- because most municipal bond issuers are certain to come out of 
this crisis without any financial difficulties -- that is unlikely to stop some 
fearful investors from selling. 
</P>
<P>
 The muni bond market, like the U.S. Treasury bond market, had been rallying in 
recent weeks, pushing yields lower. But some analysts said Tuesday that the 
rally could end for now, especially in California muni bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutual fund industry is especially concerned. Because the funds have 
become such important players in the muni bond market over the past five years, 
a slew of redemptions by fund shareholders could quickly slam the muni market 
and the funds, because portfolio managers may find there are few other big 
investors on which to unload bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds that own any Orange County bonds or related securities fear that 
they are particularly vulnerable to selling -- even if they own a relatively 
minuscule amount of the county's paper, and even if their bonds are covered by 
private insurance or other enhancements that will guarantee that interest 
payments are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about everybody owns some of it," said one mutual fund manager, 
referring to Orange County debt. And the managers stuck with a public relations 
problem could include those managing short-term funds, such as muni money 
market funds, as well as those managing longer-term funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But if investors sell out of munis and perhaps out of longer-term U.S. 
government bonds, where would they put their money? 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters expect a "flight to quality" -- meaning that investors 
will rush into very short-term U.S. Treasury securities, such as three- and 
six-month T-bills. That could drive down yields on those securities. But many 
economists say that would not affect the Federal Reserve Board's stance on 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The best the markets can hope for, experts say, is that the Fed will decide 
against any additional increases in short-term rates until the current crisis 
blows over. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philip Barach, a bond portfolio manager at Trust Co. of the West in Los 
Angeles, sounded a hopeful note late Tuesday, noting that peaks in interest 
rates often occur around financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is usually when you see a market turn," Barach said, recalling the Latin 
American debt crisis in the early 1980s and the stock market crash in 1987. 
Piling Up Debt 
</P>
<P>
 America's local governments have piled up more than $1.2 trillion in debt, an 
increase of more than 250% over the last 15 years. Orange County's financial 
crisis has raised doubts about the safety of municipal debt and the integrity 
of public finance.

 Fidelity Investments Says Blunder Limited: The brokerage, which unnerved 
investors Monday with news of a $2-billion accounting error in its Magellan 
fund, said the more than 200 other funds it manages are free of similar errors. 
The mutual funds powerhouse is the second-largest financial services firm in 
the United States, with more than $400 billion in assets. Its disclosure of the 
accounting error forced it to scrap year-end payments to shareholders of the 
venerable Magellan fund once managed by Peter Lynch.

WIESENTHAL CENTER WON'T URGE BOYCOTT OF IKEA CHAIN

 In a move that defused a potential conflict with a Jewish human rights 
organization, furniture chain Ikea said Tuesday that it is now looking for 
opportunities to establish a store in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said it decided 
against calling for a boycott against Ikea.The center had threatened such 
action because it suspected the company of involvement in an Arab-sponsored 
boycott against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The center began looking into the Swedish company's practices in the wake of 
revelations that Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad associated with pro-Nazi groups in 
the 1940s and '50s -- ties Kamprad has called a "mistake of misguided youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ikea owns about 100 stores worldwide, none of them in Israel. The center has 
said that Ikea may have avoided commercial involvement in Israel despite 
possible opportunities. Until Tuesday, Ikea had said it had no plans to set up 
shop in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the center Tuesday, Ikea President Anders Moberg reiterated 
that his company had not participated in the Arab boycott, adding that 
"investigations are being made for the establishment in Israel of an Ikea store 
under franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ikea has been very responsive," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Wiesenthal 
Center.

MERGER TO CREATE 7TH-LARGEST INSURANCE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 CNA Financial Corp. agreed to buy Continental Corp. for $1.1 billion, a deal 
that would create the nation's seventh-largest insurance group, the companies 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental stockholders would receive $20 a share in cash -- a 43% premium 
over Tuesday's $14 closing price on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 CNA Financial is 84%-owned by Loews Corp., a key company of the Tisch family 
of New York, which also holds a substantial stake in television network CBS. 
Laurence Tisch serves as chairman of both Loews and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see opportunities to apply both companies' experience in improving 
efficiencies, and this should reduce costs," said Dennis Chookaszian, chairman 
of CNA Insurance Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, the insurance expertise of CNA and Continental can be further 
leveraged though the agents and brokers of both organizations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CNA Insurance Cos., the operating unit of CNA Financial Corp., is the 
12th-largest insurance organization in the United States and the sixth-largest 
property-casualty insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 It had revenue of $11 billion last year and assets of $41.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Corp., based in New York, is the 11th-largest property-casualty 
company and had revenue of $5 billion last year and assets of $16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said both their boards have approved the transaction. 
Shareholder approval is also required. The acquisition may be funded with 
long-term debt or may include a combination of long-term debt and equity. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with the deal, CNA would invest another $275 million. The money 
would replace funds that Insurance Partners had committed under a previous 
agreement with Continental. 
</P>
<P>
 CNA Financial stock closed at $63, off 37.5 cents on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DRAMATIC DECISION IS LIKELY TO TOUCH OFF PANIC 
SELLING; SECURITIES: MANY LARGE BONDHOLDERS MAY NEED TO LIQUIDATE AT STEEP 
DISCOUNTS, ANALYSTS SAY. ONE INVESTOR SERVICE HAS SUSPENDED THE COUNTY'S 
RATING. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County's dramatic decision late Tuesday to seek bankruptcy protection 
is likely to touch off some panic selling of existing bonds and kill the 
county's ability to return to the bond market in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bankruptcy freezes the county's repayment obligations and gives it 
time to assess its finances, it will force many large investors to sell at 
steep discounts because there are legal restrictions on the amount of troubled 
debt they can hold in their portfolios, said John Schotz, president of Saybrook 
Capital, a Los Angeles investment banking firm.  
</P>
<P>
 And less sophisticated individual investors are likely to follow suit, said 
Lewis G. Feldman, head of the capital markets group of Cox, Castle & Nicholson, 
a Los Angeles public finance law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Further curtailing the county's ability to raise future bond money were 
decisions Tuesday evening by Moody's Investors Service to suspend the county's 
bond ratings and by Standard & Poor's Corp. to slash its rating on all Orange 
County debt. A company official said the rating agency could cut the county's 
ratings to CCC this morning, which would rank them as "poor quality" 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 That huge rating drop is one of the factors likely to force institutional 
investors to start dumping Orange County bonds this morning, Schotz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panicky investors already tried to unload Orange County bonds Tuesday, only to 
find that no one wanted them. And if it was difficult to sell the county's 
paper without drastic discounts before the Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy 
filing, it will only become more difficult.  
</P>
<P>
 That, however, could create an opportunity for speculative investors who have 
faith that the county is a safe long-term bet and who would offer to buy bonds 
at much-reduced prices. "People used the same approach to pick up junk bonds 
and real estate when those markets hit the skids," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sanitation Districts learned Tuesday how scant the market 
was for Orange County debt. The agency could not find a buyer for $4 million 
worth of its notes -- basically interest-bearing IOUs -- as it tried to 
complete a scheduled refinancing of the paper, said Steve Kozak, the districts' 
financial manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the offering price of bonds issued by Orange County and its 
various municipalities was down 12% to 15% on Tuesday compared to bonds with 
comparable yields and credit ratings, as would-be sellers offered discounts of 
an additional two to three percentage points from Monday's prices. Prices are 
likely to fall much further this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 While uncertainty about Orange County's situation kept its bondholders and 
bankers on edge Tuesday, the overall bond market had a strong day as traders 
grew optimistic that the Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates enough 
to flatten inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields fell to continue a weeklong rally in market prices. As yields 
fall, bond prices rise. The market's benchmark, the 30-year Treasury bond, was 
up 52.5 cents to $5.31 per $1,000 bond, as its yield fell to 7.87% from 7.92% 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is scrambling. We're under pressure to find (Treasury) bonds" 
because of high demand, said Rissy Mell, a trader at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 One trader said conflicting rumors and reports about the Orange County 
situation "continue to foster a misinformed market" for those bonds, however. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't only large institutional bondholders who are asking questions that so 
far have no answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean?" said retiree Jack Brownstone, a Rancho Mirage resident 
who owns about $15,000 worth of Orange County bonds. "What happens to the value 
of my bond? Is it like when New York went bankrupt and the state guaranteed the 
funds?" 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar resident John Anderson, who says he owns a number of Orange County 
bonds through a municipal bond mutual fund, said he's afraid he could lose 
much-needed retirement income and is outraged that "somebody was allowed to 
mismanage funds to this degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that government bankruptcies are rare, with the laws governing them 
somewhat different than for other bankruptcies, even some sophisticated money 
managers were clueless Tuesday as to what the impact will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threatening to file bankruptcy is hysterical behavior unless there is 
something there that we don't know -- (perhaps) that liabilities outweigh 
assets" in the county pool, said Fred Prager, a partner with the San Francisco 
bond trading firm of Prager, McCarthy & Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is groundbreaking material here," said W. Peck Ferrin, head municipal 
trader for Bank of America in San Francisco. "None of us has a handle on 
exactly what a Chapter 9 does" or how it would affect bondholders. Bank of 
America is a leading underwriter of county bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was gloomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term prospects for Orange County are excellent," said Jeremy Ragus, 
California Tax Free Fund portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in 
Boston. "There is no real general obligation debt" that encumbers the county's 
tax revenue "and it is a fast-growing, high-energy, wealthy community that is 
going to survive this."

PG&E TO SLASH PRICE OF DIABLO ELECTRICITY; ENERGY: THE MOVE TO CUT RATES FROM 
THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COMES AS THE INDUSTRY PREPARES FOR DEREGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Tuesday that it will cut the price of 
electricity produced by its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant by more than $2 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant near San Luis Obispo, which was bitterly opposed by environmental 
activists, cost $5.5 billion to build. Cost overruns on its construction in the 
early 1980s eventually led to a $1-billion write-off on the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, since a 1988 rate agreement with the California Public Utilities 
Commission, the utility has been accused of reaping unreasonable profits from 
Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's plan was reached in agreement with the PUC's Division of Ratepayer 
Advocates, the state attorney general and several consumer groups. It is 
subject to approval by the full PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the move would help PG&E compete more effectively with 
lower-priced independent power companies as the California utility industry is 
deregulated. The PUC has proposed that competition be phased in over several 
years, beginning in 1996 -- though just how this will be done is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan means that "we're going to have less revenue, and it will affect the 
bottom line," said Stanley T. Skinner, PG&E president and chief executive, "but 
this represents no threat to the dividend." Skinner said the utility expects to 
offset the plan's impact on earnings by continuing an aggressive cost-cutting 
program and by increasing its own unregulated, independent power production 
business.  
</P>
<P>
 PG&E has cut 6,000 jobs in the last two years and plans $285 million in cost 
reductions for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, who had been concerned that high rates for Diablo power would make 
it difficult for PG&E to compete with lower-rate power companies and other 
utilities, applauded the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "PG&E's competitive position will substantially improve," Charles Benore, a 
PaineWebber analyst, said in a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benore warned that PG&E's average electricity rate, 10.6 cents a 
kilowatt-hour, is among the highest in the nation and will remain high even 
with the price reduction at Diablo Canyon. (The average rate represents the 
average price paid for power to residential, industrial, commercial, wholesale 
and retail users.) 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said all customers will benefit from the plan with an extension of the 
utility's current rate freeze through 1996. He predicted rate drops to begin in 
1997. One consumer group, San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization, refused to sign the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan requires "no real sacrifices," said Audrie Krause, TURN executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ratepayer Advocates director Ed Texeira called the agreement 
"unquestionably a $2-billion step forward in reducing . . . excessively high 
rates."  
</P>
<P>
 Electricity generated at Diablo Canyon currently costs 11.89 cents a 
kilowatt-hour; the price was scheduled to rise to 12.2 cents in 1995 and to 
13.3 cents in 1999. Under the new plan, PG&E would instead reduce prices 32% in 
the next five years, for a price decrease to 11 cents per kilowatt-hour in 
1995, 10.5 cents in 1996, 10 cents in 1997, 9.5 cents in 1998 and 9 cents in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
 PG&E stock closed off 12.5 cents at $61.375 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

 Purchasing Managers See Growth Slowing in '95: The National Assn. of 
Purchasing Management said a drop-off in American manufacturing will occur as 
the overall economy cools down. Most industrial companies will see improvements 
in their businesses, the group said in its 48th semiannual economic forecast, 
but revenues will rise at less than half the growth rate this year, indicating 
lower demand for products. The survey of purchasing managers at 300 companies 
shows that 81% expect revenues to increase in 1995, the largest percentage to 
forecast such growth since 1983.

 Borden Suitor Raises Bid: Investor Paul Kazarian said he raised his bid for a 
part of Borden Inc., offering $660 million rather than $430 million for a 
minority stake in the food and consumer products company. In a meeting before 
reporters and analysts, Kazarian responded to questions from the Borden board 
of directors seeking further details about the offer. On Monday, Borden's board 
rejected Kazarian's earlier offer as "not realistic or credible."

 Fraud Suit Over Generators Dismissed: Westinghouse Electric Corp. said a U.S. 
District Court jury in Pittsburgh dismissed the last of the charges filed by 
five utilities seeking $350 million in damages. The utilities, which own the 
Beaver Valley Nuclear Plant in Pennsylvania, had claimed they were misled as to 
whether the nuclear steam generators Westinghouse makes and sells represented a 
proven and tested technology. Four related charges were dropped earlier this 
year.

 Mortgage Delinquencies Reach a 21-Year Low: Economic expansion and the recent 
rash of refinancings helped Americans push the rate down in all regions of the 
nation in the third quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Assn. said the seasonally 
adjusted delinquency rate was 3.9%, down from 4.21% in the second quarter and 
at the lowest level since the first quarter of 1973, when it was 3.89%.

RETIREMENT SAVINGS OFF 34% DURING LAST 2 YEARS; PLANNING: SURVEY FINDS AMERICAN 
WORKERS WILL SET ASIDE AN AVERAGE OF JUST $1,776 THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The amount of money set aside by American workers to finance their retirement 
has fallen by 34% during the last two years, according to a survey released 
Tuesday by the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted by Workplace Pulse Surveys of America on behalf of the 
employers council, shows that workers will save an average of just $1,776 this 
year toward their retirement.The figure is down sharply from $1,932 last year 
and $2,688 in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the dramatic decline, most workers have not lowered their expectations 
of the quality of life they will experience during retirement, the survey 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families "just don't realize how much money it takes to create the kind 
of nest egg they're going to need," said Ken Feltman, executive director of the 
council. The Washington-based association represents the interests of member 
employers in discussions of compensation policy.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the strengthening U.S. economy has not enabled the typical worker to 
set aside more funds for the future, said William M. Bennett, a spokesman for 
Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Co., which co-sponsored the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though they need to save more, most working families -- especially those 
younger than 45 -- just can't seem to find the means to do so in spite of the 
reports that the economy is strengthening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inadequate tax incentives could be one factor in the decline, the report says. 
Only 14% of the 1,000 workers surveyed said existing incentives are adequate to 
promote personal savings.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; ORANGE COUNTY BOND WOES CUT T-BILL YIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County financial crisis pushed Treasury bill yields sharply lower 
Tuesday as investors, unnerved by rumors that the county might file for 
bankruptcy protection, squirreled away money in short-term U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the bankruptcy filing came after the market's close. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, falling interest rates failed to lift spirits on Wall Street. 
Stocks struggled and ended the day mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the money flows into T-bills were concerns that the Orange County 
investment fund's woes could send broad ripples through the financial markets 
and perhaps cause a new round of dumping of long-term muni and government 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 As investors fled for the safety of short-term securities, the yield on 
one-year Treasury bills fell to 6.96% from 7.12% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are putting cash into the bill market. No one really knows how all 
this will land," said Eric Hamilton, a market analyst at Technical Data in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates also fell, though not as sharply. The key 30-year 
T-bond yield closed at 7.87%, down from 7.92% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty over Orange County's finances had a muted impact on the financial 
market for municipal securities, in part because most of the county's bonds are 
so thinly traded and because the rumors about bankruptcy were disbelieved for 
most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average, which was moderately 
higher at midday, veered downward in the afternoon action before 
computer-guided buy orders returned it to a nearly neutral reading. The 
blue-chip index, off more than 25 points at its worst, ended at 3,745.95, up 
4.03 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader measures fell, however, while losers outnumbered gainers on the New 
York Stock Exchange by about 11 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's uninspiring performance was traced in part to lingering 
disappointment over news Monday that investors in Fidelity's flagship Magellan 
Fund -- the country's largest mutual fund -- won't receive a dividend at the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fidelity said the decision reflected an accounting error and 
apparently wasn't due to problems in the stock and bond markets, the news 
"caused a moment of reflection," particularly for bearish investors, said 
Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G. Edwards & Sons in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Shares of major airlines tumbled after financier Warren Buffet was quoted as 
saying his USAir investment was a mistake, adding that "no airline is going to 
be a substantial business." 
</P>
<P>
 USAir fell 1/8 to 4 3/8, AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 1 1/8 to 50 
3/4, UAL dropped 1 1/8 to 91 7/8 and Delta Air Lines fell 3/4 to 48 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some private muni bond insurance companies dropped on fears that they could 
be hit hard covering losses on defaulted Orange County bonds. MBIA fell 1 3/4 
to 49 1/8 and Ambac lost 7/8 to 32 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer networking products company NetWorth sank 5 1/8 to 9 5/8 after it 
told analysts it expects lower revenue in the second quarter than in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 * BankAmerica dropped 1 1/4 to 40 1/2. Traders cited PaineWebber's downgrading 
of the stock to "neutral" from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Megatest, which makes testing equipment for the semiconductor industry, said 
it expects a loss of as much as $4 million on continuing operations for its 
fiscal first quarter ended Nov 26. The stock plunged 4 1/2 to 5 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intelligent Electronics fell 3 1/8 to 9 3/8 after the company's chairman 
said he has asked an independent committee of the board to review the marketing 
practices of the nation's largest computer reseller. 
</P>
<P>
 * ECI Telecommunications fell 3 1/8 to 14 after two brokerages reduced their 
estimates for the Israeli company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel rose 3/8 to 64 1/2 in heavy trading. News of a flaw in the Pentium 
microprocessor had triggered a selloff. Selling overseas set a somber example 
for U.S. stocks to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Germany's 30-share DAX average fell 24.24 points to 2,046.88. 
London's Financial Times 100-share average declined 17.4 points to 3016.1. In 
Mexico, the Bolsa fell 7.06 points to 2,514.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended at 19,340.47, up 34.81 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar declined in relation to most other major currencies. It 
closed at 100.08 Japanese yen in New York, down from 100.48 on Monday. It fell 
to 1.572 German marks from 1.573.

POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / 
TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; ENCRYPTION PROTECTS VIRTUAL CASH FOR ON-LINE SHOPPING 
ON NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL AKST, Daniel Akst, a Los Angeles writer, is a former assistant 
business editor for technology at The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internet is good for a lot of things, but one thing it's not much good for 
-- at least not yet -- is commerce. Plenty of businesses are using the 
Internet, mostly as a promotional vehicle to disseminate information about 
their products, but there's no really good way to buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Security is the biggest problem. Large commercial services like CompuServe and 
Prodigy make it possible to buy from a merchant securely, but transactions over 
the Internet are just too public: If you send your MasterCard number via 
e-mail, the message might pass through many sites en route, giving the 
unscrupulous plenty of opportunities to steal your credit card number. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of cyber-money may have prolonged the Net's communal flavor and 
pleased some purists. But the absence of a way to pay, say, 25 cents for an 
investment column or a recipe for reindeer chili means that really good 
investment columns and reindeer chili recipes are scarce in cyberspace -- and 
everybody is poorer for it. 
</P>
<P>
 An Internet-wide system for secure transactions has been the Holy Grail of 
cyberspace for some time, but only this year has a solution been in sight. 
During 1994, a whole series of plans for secure credit card transactions and 
digital cash have been announced, some of them with backing from players big 
enough that they have to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 One big thrust comes from CyberCash Inc. of Vienna, Va., whose founders and 
partners include William Melton, the founder of Verifone Inc., which makes 
machines used by retailers to authorize credit card purchases, and James 
Bidzos, a major player in software encryption. Bidzos says the goal of 
CyberCash is "extending the credit card network into the Internet." Another 
nascent competitor is First Virtual Holdings Inc., based in San Diego. Headed 
by Lee Stein, a well-known attorney and financial adviser, First Virtual plans 
to use a relatively simple e-mail system in which consumers would be asked to 
confirm every purchase they make. First USA, a Texas bank, would provide credit 
card authorization and clearing, while giant Electronic Data Systems would 
handle data processing. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. and Visa International also have plans for a system of secure 
electronic credit card transactions, using encryption technology from RSA Data 
Security Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., a company headed by Bidzos. Visa and 
Microsoft have even said they will make their technical specifications public, 
presumably in hopes of establishing their system as the standard. 
</P>
<P>
 And just this week, Netscape Communications, a leading purveyor of the Mosaic 
software for navigating the Internet, and BankAmerica said they would join 
forces to develop a secure system for Internet credit card transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as most people use plastic for some purchases and cash for others, 
some entrepreneurs insist that consumers in cyberspace will want virtual cash 
as well as virtual plastic. And to me, the rise of true digital cash is one of 
the most interesting developments in cyberspace today. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital cash may sound futuristic, but an Amsterdam-based company called 
DigiCash is working on bringing what it calls e-cash to the Internet. You have 
to take DigiCash seriously (e-mail info@digicash.nl for information) because 
it's owned by David Chaum, a bearded Los Angeles native and Ph.D cryptographer 
who is a leading light in this field. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumian digital cash relies on a clever dual-key encryption system that 
simultaneously protects the spender's privacy, provides the user with a 
transaction record, and assures that the cash is legitimate. Transaction costs 
are so low that even purchases costing just pennies won't break the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing is based on the concept of the digital signature, familiar to 
Internet privacy hounds from the PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, software freely 
available in cyberspace. PGP relies on a set of "keys," or codes that the 
program uses to encrypt and unencrypt messages. A user has a public key, 
available to everyone, and a private key, which no one else gets. Messages 
"signed" using the private key can be verified by recipients using the signer's 
public key. 
</P>
<P>
 Now imagine that Alice wants to buy something from Bob (Alice and Bob are 
cryptography's favorite hypotheticals). Alice presents the First Digital Bank 
with what amounts to a digital check -- a 100-digit number randomly generated 
by her computer, mathematically "blinded," and "signed" with her private key. 
The bank verifies her signature (using her public key), replaces it with its 
own signature, and returns the "money." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice then spends the money at Bob's on-line store, and receives a record of 
the transaction. Bob gets the money. And the bank cannot link the specific 
electronic currency to Alice, which prevents the bank from tracking her 
activities and preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 CyberCash has reportedly been discussing licensing Chaum's technology, which 
is showing signs of catching on elsewhere as well. In Germantown, Md., for 
instance, entrepreneur Bob Houston has created what he calls NetCash, which is 
already in use here and there (for information, e-mail 
netbank-info@agents.com). 
</P>
<P>
 Chaum's system could have big implications. It would vastly expand the 
marketplace for information by permitting sellers to charge as little as 
pennies at a time. But on a big enough scale, the private and instantaneous 
nature of Chaumian payments conceivably could erode the power of governments to 
monitor and tax spending, implement monetary policy and monopolize the issuing 
of currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kelly, in his book "Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological 
Civilization" (Addison-Wesley), suggests that digital cash is the perfect 
vehicle for the privatization of currency, since "the law of the Net is: He who 
owns a computer not only owns a printing press, but also a mint." 
</P>
<P>
 He welcomes messages at akstd@news.latimes.com but regrets that he cannot 
reply to each and every one.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON, TIME TO THINK ABOUT TAX-DEDUCTIBLE BUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holiday gift shopping might be your main preoccupation at this time of year, 
but it's also time to think about some decidedly less festive acquisitions: 
computer products that you might be able to deduct from your 1994 taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone can write off computer-related expenses. But if you're 
self-employed, run a business from home or are using the computer for "the 
convenience of your employer" you may -- and I stress may -- qualify for a tax 
deduction on any equipment and software you buy during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a tax expert, so I consulted with Daniel Caine, a Boston-based tax 
lawyer and author of TaxCut, a leading tax-preparation program from Meca 
Software, a subsidiary of H&R Block. I also spoke with Orlene Chartain, a 
Redwood City, Calif., certified public accountant. And it's always best to 
check with your own tax professional or the IRS before making any tax-related 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, people who run their own businesses -- either full- or part-time 
-- have more leeway than those who work for others. If you operate a business 
from home, you may be able to deduct up to $17,500 for business equipment and 
software in a single year. (That's up from $10,000 in 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for this "Section 179 expense election," or so-called rapid 
write-off, the equipment must be used more than 50% for business purposes, and 
you can only write off the business portion of its use. For example, if you 
purchased a $1,000 printer that was used 70% for business and 30% for personal 
use, you could write off a cost of $700. If you're married, both spouses 
together can claim a maximum of $17,500, even if you're filing a joint return, 
according to Caine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People who work for others face more restrictions on write-offs. To qualify 
for a deduction, the equipment has to be used "for the convenience of your 
employer." 
</P>
<P>
 Office workers who buy a computer to finish reports late at night do not 
qualify, according to Caine. If your employer requires you to operate a 
computer from home (or on the road), then you may qualify for the rapid 
write-off, or you may be able to depreciate the equipment over several years -- 
assuming, of course, that the employer doesn't reimburse you for the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 If you qualify for a deduction, you can take it only if you itemize and forgo 
the standard deduction. You can write off expenses only in excess of 2% of your 
adjusted gross income. An employee with an AGI of $50,000, for example, cannot 
deduct the first $1,000 of business expenses. And to qualify for a deduction in 
1994, the equipment or software must be purchased and put into service before 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you go out and spend those tax-deductible dollars, it's a good idea to 
take stock of what you have and what you might need. This might be a good time 
to upgrade your personal computer and add some useful accessories. If you are 
using Windows or Macintosh and have less than eight megabytes of random access 
memory, consider adding more, especially if you plan to upgrade to Windows 95 
or OS/2 sometime in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If your hard disk is as cramped as your hall closet, it might be a good time 
to add an extra hard drive. On most personal computers, you can add another 
drive without giving up the one you have. I'm very happy with the 1.08-gigabyte 
(1,008-megabyte) Western Digital hard disk I bought for about $450. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS would certainly approve of your buying a tape backup system, as long 
as you use it to back up your business records and other work-related files. I 
use an Iomega Parallel Port II tape backup drive that plugs into my PC's 
printer port. It took me less than 10 minutes to install both the hardware and 
software, and, best of all, I never had to take my machine apart. The device 
stores up to 250 megabytes per tape and has a street price of about $320. If 
you're willing to take apart your machine, you can get a Colorado Tape Backup 
system for $165 that connects to your PC's floppy-drive controller. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Games and educational programs are not good candidates for write-offs (no 
matter that surveys show they're heavily used at the office). But no business 
user should be without a utility program, such as Norton Utilities for DOS, 
Windows or Macintosh. This software helps prevent and recover from problems 
with your hard disk. On more than one occasion it has saved my business records 
from near-certain oblivion.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; NEW MACHINE SORTS OUT 
THE PROBLEM OF PLASTICS; RECYCLING: THE LATEST INFRARED AND X-RAY TECHNOLOGIES 
NOW HELP SEPARATE TRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A recycling organization today plans to introduce a machine that brings to 
bear the latest in infrared, X-ray sensors and advanced computer technology on 
the prosaic problem of sorting garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Magnetic Separation Systems of Nashville, Tenn., the $1-million 
machine can determine the density, color and type of each plastic as containers 
speed along on a conveyor belt, and then separate them into nine categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garten Foundation of Salem, Ore., a nonprofit company that offers 
vocational training in recycling and other fields for people with disabilities, 
will be first to use the system, under the sponsorship of the American Plastics 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine and others that are similar could radically alter the economics of 
recycling and make it feasible to recycle many materials that currently cannot 
be used again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plastics industry wants to see as many types of plastics recycled as 
there are sustainable markets for them," said Red Cavaney, chief executive of 
the American Plastics Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now residents and businesses can include more types of plastics in their 
recycling programs, and this facility is able to sort and market them to 
plastics reclaimers locally and nationally." 
</P>
<P>
 The machine uses four infrared, X-ray and vision sensors to determine the type 
of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer keeps track of the information as the plastics continue along the 
conveyor belt and separates the items into nine different categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The sorted plastics are then bundled and shipped out to recyclers and 
manufacturers for processing. The whole process has a 99% accuracy rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Garten Foundation recycling coordinator John Matthews said the addition of the 
plastics-sorting system will allow the company to successfully separate 
different plastics for recyclers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is the first in the state to employ a comprehensive system for 
sorting plastics, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will help eliminate the need for specialized trucks that have to gather 
different types of plastics from citizens, who often do not know how to 
properly sort them. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnetic Separation Systems began working on its BottleSort system in early 
1993 to help develop a more specialized method of sorting plastics ranging from 
translucent milk bottles to opaque yogurt containers, Marketing Director Derek 
Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous systems have since been created, with prices running from about 
$100,000 to $700,000, depending on how big and specialized a company's needs 
are, Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though MSS does not have any orders yet, Vaughan is confident that the Garten 
Foundation demonstration will spark sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once operating experiences prove successful, other systems will be 
purchased," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sales of the system are not likely to take off until there is a robust 
market for recycled plastic, which is currently used in making benches and for 
building materials.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; LE

 If state environmental regulators have their way, Southern California -- the 
great heartland of the automobile -- will soon be home to the reborn electric 
car. So it came as something of a surprise that among the stars of the 12th 
International Electric Vehicle Symposium, held here this year, were a massive 
contingent of experts from . . . France. 
</P>
<P>
 A test under way in the small city of La Rochelle, 300 miles southwest of 
Paris, has yielded spectacular results. Jean-Yves Helmer, executive managing 
director of the automotive division of PSA Peugeot Citroen, said that French 
drivers have been profoundly touched by the small battery-driven cars known, in 
all languages, as EVs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EV changed my life," one French driver told researchers, according to the 
elegantly straight-faced Helmer. Even the less-emotional apparently appreciate 
benefits such as home charging, dependable starting no matter what the weather, 
and the calm of le silence on the road. The cars also help with the congenital 
national problem of aggressive driving, making city streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The French have discovered "a different kind of driving pleasure," Helmer 
averred. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics help, too. France is fertile country for electric vehicles because 
most of its electricity is derived from cheap nuclear power, while gasoline 
costs more than three times the U.S. price. The French also live mostly in 
dense cities, with short commutes. 
</P>
<P>
 La Rochelle's success has prompted 80 other French cities to sign up for the 
experience, and the French government has announced that it will spur EV 
production by subsidizing the higher cost of the electric cars (they now cost 
about $12,000, up to $4,000 more than an equivalent gasoline car). 
</P>
<P>
 Helmer says that EVs could be part of a strategy Peugeot is pondering for a 
possible re-entry of the U.S. market, from which French car makers retreated in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese car makers, who don't need to worry about U.S. market re-entry but do 
need to worry -- and soon -- about California clean-air mandates, were also out 
in force at the show. All four of the Japanese auto makers that must offer 
emission-free cars as 2% of their showroom fleets by 1998 -- the same standard 
U.S. auto companies must meet -- showed prototypes, some for the first time in 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars -- mostly small station wagons that are used for deliveries in Tokyo 
-- perform flawlessly around a parking-lot test course. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite widespread rumors that the Japanese car makers would announce 
provocative strategies to meet the California mandate, they used a joint press 
conference to recount the history of electric car research in their island 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 1998 mandate is looming like a specter for all the major auto makers, who 
for all practical purposes must decide what to do in the next several months. 
If they are going to manufacture their own vehicles -- instead of meeting the 
California requirement by, say, purchasing and marketing cars built by a 
handful of small electric car makers -- the big companies have only 2 1/2 years 
before electric cars must be rolling off the assembly line -- an extremely 
tight schedule for the automotive world. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wallace, Ford Motor Co. director of electric vehicle programs and 
chairman of the symposium, lamented the state of electric car technology -- 
particularly the batteries. Though he praises the electric car as "an industry 
being born," for him and all the other big car makers, it is being born too 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the 1998 deadline, Ford should be going to "primary prototype . . . in 
a very few months," Wallace said. But he hasn't yet found an "acceptable" 
battery maker, vital to building the prototype. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more conservative than many people," Wallace said wearily. "It has to do 
with actually having to make the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were optimists aplenty at the show, and lots of evidence that 
electric car technology is moving ahead rapidly: 
</P>
<P>
 * An electric school bus from the Antelope Valley was the oversized star of 
the show. Built by Blue Bird Corp. and Westinghouse Electronic Systems, and 
paid for by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, it has been 
hauling school kids around the Southern California desert for almost six 
months. Antelope Valley Schools chief executive Ken McCoy reports lower 
maintenance, improved safety and low fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Solectria Corp., an ambitious Massachusetts car converter, unveiled the 
Sunrise, designed to be built in the automotive version of a micro-brewery. One 
of the small plants is planned for California, and Solectria hopes to sell the 
car for under $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * AC Propulsion, the small Southern California company run by engineer Alan 
Cocconi, an electric car wizard, is showing off a 200-horsepower EV -- easily 
the muscle car of the show. It can do zero-to-60 in 6.2 seconds, which would be 
impressive even for a gasoline-powered car. When an engineer with one of the 
Big Three hit the accelerator during a test-drive, her startled response was a 
well-known expletive.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; DNA'S MOST IMPORTANT USE: DIAGNOSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 DNA analysis might grab headlines when it's used in criminal cases such as the 
O.J. Simpson murder trial, but it's most important day-to-day use will likely 
be as a diagnostic tool. Already, DNA analysis can reveal the presence of 
certain hereditary disorders, and as biologists decipher more of the 
information in our genetic code, DNA's diagnostic potential will expand. To 
make use of this knowledge, however, doctors will need a fast, low-cost and 
low-priced method of conducting DNA analysis. Scientists at the UC Berkeley 
believe they have taken a big step in that direction by miniaturizing one of 
the crucial steps in DNA analysis, using what they call "DNA 
analysis-on-a-chip." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, DNA profiling is a complex and time-consuming business. Basically, it 
involves extracting DNA from blood, semen or tissue, amplifying it by perhaps a 
million times, cutting it into many pieces, tagging those pieces that contain a 
specific marker, then separating the pieces along the length of an 
electrophoresis gel. These gels, in which particles are suspended in a liquid, 
are one of the major bottlenecks in DNA analysis: it can take weeks for the DNA 
fragments to separate out into distinct bands that can be detected using 
radioactive analysis methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Berkeley scientists have constructed a miniaturized gel about an inch 
long and only two- thousandths of an inch wide -- 50 times smaller than the 
standard slab gels. With this gel, analysis that might take weeks can be done 
in just two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The gel-on-a-chip is created by chemically etching microscopic channels into a 
glass plate and covering them with a second glass plate. When filled with gel, 
DNA fragments migrate down the channel at a rate determined by their size. 
Under a grant from the Advanced Technology Program of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology, Molecular Dynamics of Sunnyvale, Calif., and its 
partner, Affymetric of Santa Clara, Calif., will develop miniaturized DNA 
diagnostic systems, with help from the Berkeley scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 He's Not My Brother: Bone-marrow transplants can mean the difference of life 
or death for leukemia patients. But successful transplantation requires that 
certain characteristics of the donor and the patient's immune system be closely 
matched to avoid rejection and other complications. And fewer than 30% of 
leukemia patients who might benefit from a bone-marrow transplant have a 
matched donor even among their siblings, while just 3% to 5% manage to find 
such a person among other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now researchers from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and Perugia University 
in Italy have a developed a method that may significantly improve the chances 
for a successful transplant from unmatched donors. The key to the new technique 
is megadoses of donor marrow. Such doses appear to be effective by giving donor 
cells an edge in their competition with the patient's own cells, thus 
minimizing the risk of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain these large amounts of marrow, researchers gave donors hormonal 
drugs called cytokines, which increase the number of cells in the blood by 
mobilizing them from the bone marrow. The amount of marrow obtained this way 
can be seven to 10 times greater than from the bones. The marrow is treated 
with a soybean-derived lectin to eliminate white blood cells that would 
otherwise attack the recipient's tissues. While the treatment has only been 
tried on people with leukemia, in the future it may be modified to treat 
non-cancerous blood disorders such as sickle-cell anemia. 
</P>

 Digital Dairy: What database contains such keywords as "genetic improvement," 
"reproduction" and "milk management"? Try the National Dairy Database, which 
lets dairy farmers search for up-to-date information on dairy-cattle management 
and marketing and health aspects of dairy products, and also offers software 
programs on budgets, soil, fertility and herd health. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD-ROM database is a result of a decade of work on a USDA-funded project 
coordinated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The database, 
which is being sold through the University of Wisconsin at Madison for $99, 
will be updated each year.. 
</P>
<P>
 More Fog: Caltrans wants Californians to know that they have a fog warning 
system similar to the one from the Georgia Department of Transportation 
described in "In Development" on Oct. 19th. The program, which includes the use 
of high-tech roadside weather stations, visibility sensors and closed-circuit 
TV, focuses on the seasonal fog in the Central Valley. Data is collected along 
U.S. 99, relayed back to the Caltrans headquarters in Fresno and then used to 
update electronic message signs and warn motorists via radio.

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY OVAL: ON BOOKMOBILES, MANY STORIES HAVE HAPPY 
ENDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When Linda Hanks recently broke her ankle and didn't work on the Santa Ana 
Public Library bookmobile for several months, she received periodic calls from 
a library patron she'd gotten to know over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really touched to get calls from her," says Hanks, who has worked 14 
years on the bookmobile, an RV or cabin truck stocked with library books that 
travels to designated places regularly. "It made me feel good to know someone 
had missed me and was looking forward to my return." 
</P>
<P>
 Such friendliness is common with people who are involved with bookmobiles, 
says Ninfa Duran, who is in charge of bookmobile services for the Santa Ana 
Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bookmobiles aren't as intimidating to many people as the regular library," 
she says. "They have more of a neighborhood atmosphere. People stop to chat 
while they pick out books." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Santa Ana, Fullerton and Anaheim city libraries have them. For 23 
years, the county of Orange had several bookmobiles but put them to rest in 
1982 when fuel costs rose and new branches opened throughout the county, says 
Helen Lotos, community relations manager for the Orange County Public Library 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana has two bookmobiles that each carry an average of 5,000 books and 
make a total of 31 weekly stops to schools and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bookmobiles fill a very real need," Duran says. "They travel into 
predominantly Spanish-speaking, Latino areas of the city where many families 
with children and older individuals probably wouldn't get books otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show how popular Santa Ana's bookmobiles are. In 1992, the city's 
bookmobiles had the highest circulation in the state. In one year, they checked 
out nearly 350,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the intimate atmosphere on bookmobiles, some relationships between 
workers and patrons become true friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the people at the bookmobile are very nice, but Linda (Hanks) is my 
special favorite," says Liz Dietrich, 62, who lives in Santa Ana and visits the 
bookmobile on Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Linda and I enjoy reading the same kinds of books, so she knows my taste," 
Dietrich says. "She'll set aside books she knows I'll enjoy, and they'll be 
waiting for me when I get to the bookmobile. She's even let me borrow some of 
her books. Whenever I request a book, she also does whatever she can to get it 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The two women also share information about each other's lives, sometimes 
offering a sensitive ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter had a stroke three years ago, and I began taking care of her," 
Dietrich says. "I would walk to the bookmobile and tell Linda about it, and she 
would have the time to listen. That was very comforting." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana bookmobile worker Teresa Davalos has also been missed recently. 
Because of surgery, she won't be able to ride the bookmobile until January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how many people have missed me," says Davalos, who has worked 
on the bookmobile for eight years. "All of the calls and messages have been 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Davalos also enjoys the many friendships she has made on the bookmobile, like 
her relationship with the Castro family of Santa Ana. Maria Castro and her five 
children visit the bookmobile every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a really nice family," Davalos says. "The little children bring me 
flowers and drawings they've made. Whenever any of them request a book, I do my 
best to find it. I've really missed them during my absence." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has missed Davalos too, and tracked her down in the hospital to give 
her a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very touching to get the call from her," Davalos says. "She was 
worried and concerned about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, 39, says that she looks forward to seeing Davalos at the bookmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a very good person and has helped me a great deal," said Castro in 
Spanish. "When my youngest child was an infant, she brought her some clothing. 
That was very thoughtful of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's children also enjoy talking to Davalos. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really nice," says Sylvia Castro, 14, who was 6 when she met Davalos. 
"Any time I call and ask for information for a school report, she always brings 
it to the bookmobile." 
</P>
<P>
 Davalos says that she makes an extra effort to help children who come onto the 
bookmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read children's books so I can choose ones I think they'll like," she says. 
"We also regularly read books to classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 When she's working in the main library, Davalos is often stopped by children 
who recognize her as "the lady from the bookmobile." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I say I remember who they are, they get huge grins on their faces," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Williams, who works on the Anaheim Public Library's bookmobile, also 
enjoys interacting with the children. She especially enjoys watching youngsters 
develop a love of reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen one family grow over the past six years, and it's been really 
wonderful to see," says Williams, who has a special relationship with one of 
the daughters, Marivel Bermudez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Marivel since she was 13. She's always been interested in books 
and is now in her second year at UC Irvine. I'm very proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says that she and Bermudez have a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marivel will come in the bookmobile, and we'll chat about how her classes and 
part-time job are going. I've even invited her over to my home." 
</P>
<P>
 Bermudez, 19, considers Williams "a really good friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's easy to talk to and often gives me advice about school," says Bermudez, 
who lives in Anaheim. "On many occasions, she's helped me with school projects 
and papers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bermudez says that if it weren't for the bookmobile, she doesn't think she 
would have read as much as she has. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bookmobile has a better selection of books than the schools do, and it's 
very convenient, because it's right down the street. I'm an avid reader, and I 
think that has a lot to do with going to the bookmobile since I was 9 years 
old," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked for bookmobiles never forget the friendly atmosphere and 
special patrons. David Hamdorf, a communications technician with the Orange 
County Public Library, worked for the county's bookmobile for 10 years until it 
closed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would go up into Trabuco and Modjeska canyons, and patrons would ride up 
on their horses to the bookmobile," he says. "Some people would even bring 
their dogs on to the vehicle, but we didn't mind." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hamdorf, working on the bookmobile full time was very rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look back on those years fondly," he says. "It was an excellent way to 
spend time. We met a lot of really nice people."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; 'CHRISTMAS AT RITZ' MAKES FASHIONABLE TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Santa Claus and "The Nutcracker," the annual "Christmas at the Ritz" 
benefit for Chapman University has become a favorite holiday tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fashionables, a support group for Chapman, heralded the holiday season 
with its eighth annual get-together on Saturday at the Ritz restaurant in 
Newport Beach. The $85-per-person luncheon drew 350 guests and was expected to 
net $50,000 for Chapman. Tradition 
</P>
<P>
 The Fashionables' holiday party has become so well-loved by its devoted 
followers that organizers have learned not to mess with certain key aspects of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The invitations are always the same; the menu is always the same," said Mary 
Dell Barkouras, event chairwoman. "It's just a lovely, rather Victorian way to 
start Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members learned the hard way that people like the party just the way 
it is when, several years ago, they decided to experiment with the menu and 
nixed the traditional cold poached king salmon in dill sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was upset," said Mary Lou Hornsby, president of the Fashionables. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Christmases past, fashionable guests wearing their holiday best were 
greeted by Santa and carolers dressed in Dickens-style costumes. While sipping 
champagne from flutes of Kir Royale, they explored the restaurant's dining 
rooms, which glowed with Christmas trees strung in white lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while guests were enjoying their salmon and raspberry creme brulee , 
models in evening wear from Neiman Marcus visited each table (I. Magnin had 
been scheduled to provide the models, but when the store suddenly announced its 
closing and had to pull out, Neiman Marcus agreed to fill in on just one week's 
notice.) 
</P>
<P>
 One feature was added to the luncheon this year, courtesy of the video 
department at Chapman: Monitors were installed in all rooms of the Ritz so 
everyone could see and hear the speeches and thank-yous. Fashionable Cause 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Fashionables because its founder, Mildred Mead, was a fashion 
columnist, the group was formed in 1971 to raise money for Chapman University 
in Orange. Proceeds from the luncheon are designated for the university's 
All-Faiths Chapel, which is in need of a major donor before ground- breaking 
can begin. Each guest received a crystal ornament with an etching of the future 
chapel, designed by architect Fay Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Fashionables members are not Chapman alum; they support the school 
because they believe in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fashionables have been around a long time," said Jim Doti, Chapman 
University president. "They're part of our extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests: William Haney, a 40-year Chapman trustee, and his wife, 
Georgia; George Argyros, Chapman board president, and his wife, Judie; Ritz 
owner Hans Prager and his wife, Charlene; Herb Sutton, honorary chairman; 
Donald and Nancy Wynne, Elon and Mary Ann Wells, Edward and Roella Edwards, Jim 
and Patty Edwards, Peggy Goldwater Clay, Gloria Gellman, Charles and Nora 
Hester, Tita Loza, Virginia Leishman, Lois Aldrin, Matt and Tina Schafnitz, 
Cerise Feeley, Russell and Marla Patterson, Lee and Dawn Wood, Jim Johnson and 
Nora Jorgenson Johnson. KATHRYN BOLD

FDA TO MOVE L.A. OPERATION TO IRVINE IN '95; REGULATORS: THE FEDERAL AGENCY 
ALSO PLANS TO BUILD A STATE-OF-THE-ART LABORATORY IN O.C. MORE THAN 100 
EMPLOYEES WILL BE AFFECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 As part of an ongoing nationwide consolidation, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration said Tuesday that it will move more than 100 employees to Irvine 
from Los Angeles in March and is seeking property to build a laboratory nearby 
that will replace an aging facility in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA, which regulates the safety and efficacy of foods, drugs and 
cosmetics, said it will move its administrative, compliance and investigative 
office employees from a building on West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles to 
Newport Gateway Towers, a two-building complex on MacArthur Boulevard near 
Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said it is advertising for a 10-acre tract of land in Orange County 
where it will build a 185,000-square-foot laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the office staff will move in 1995, it will be at least two years 
before the 40-person laboratory staff transfers to Orange County, FDA spokesman 
Don McLearn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves are part of an FDA restructuring designed to reduce the number of 
agency facilities across the country. The FDA now has 18 laboratories, some 
which opened 50 or more years ago, McLearn said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the consolidation is completed, the agency will have about half that 
number. FDA officials say that the consolidation will improve laboratory 
services because the remaining locations will be state-of-the-art facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the remaining labs will specialize, with areas of expertise including 
seafood products research, nutritional analysis and toxic research. The Orange 
County facility will be one of four full-service laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given today's fast and reliable transportation, there is no need for each 
facility to meet the entire spectrum of scientific requirements," a recent FDA 
staff report said.

'CYBERGODDESS' PLANS TO EXPAND ELECTRONIC DOMAIN; COMPUTERS: CONFERENCES -- 
LIVE AND ON-LINE -- ARE A POPULAR PART OF NEW YORK WOMAN'S SMALL SERVICE. SHE 
HOPES TO HAVE A NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Queen of Cyberspace plans to expand her domain to a city near you. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Horn runs Echo, the hip New York on-line computer service, out of her 
small apartment in New York's Greenwich Village, where computer equipment 
shares space with rubber figures of Godzilla, a rat and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Echo's own computers provide an electronic salon where members gather via 
their own computers and phone lines to discuss a dizzying variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn wants to set up locally run and locally flavored Echo offshoots in 
Boston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Seattle, Minneapolis and Miami, along with 
interactive television programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3,500 members, Echo is tiny compared with such on-line giants as 
CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy, whose memberships top 1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 But its New York feel and reputation as a relatively friendly place for women 
have drawn attention from Newsweek, Rolling Stone, the New Yorker and other 
magazines. The media have dubbed Horn "Cybergoddess" and "Queen of Cyberspace." 
</P>
<P>
 Echo members include luminaries such as feminist author Susan Brownmiller, New 
Yorker magazine television critic James Wolcott and, briefly, John Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoids or Echoistes, as they call themselves, don on-line pseudonyms like 
"Garbled Uplink" and "Neandergal" and communicate through electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Echo's most entertaining features is its conferences, devoted to 
particular topics. 
</P>
<P>
 The service's 50 to 60 conferences have titles such as "Culture," "Sex," "New 
York" and "Food." There are conferences devoted to New York institutions such 
as the Village Voice weekly newspaper and the Whitney Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The conferences are divided into discussion headings, such as "Does God Have a 
Sense of Humor?" 
</P>
<P>
 But for Horn, a sense of community -- in the real world as well as on-line -- 
is Echo's most important aspect. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled how a young hacker once known as Phiber Optik -- real name Mark 
Abene -- began helping with Echo's technical aspects but said he didn't want to 
get involved with Echoids. Despite himself, he did, meeting a woman known 
on-line as Cafephreak who is now his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 When Abene ran afoul of the law, drawing a one-year prison sentence for 
unauthorized computer access, Echoistes threw him a lavish going-away party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me cry," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoistes get together every two weeks at Greenwich Village's Art Bar. Some 
also meet for softball, bowling or poker at Brownmiller's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that face-to-face element, I think, that's really strengthened the 
electronic community," Horn said. "There are all sorts of problems with 
communication on-line because you can't see the person." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn has worked to make Echo a friendly place for women, who make up 38% of 
its membership, higher than some of the larger services like CompuServe, whose 
membership is 8% female. America Online says 30 percent of its customers are 
female while Prodigy has 38%. All say they want more women on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn hastens to add that her service is for all kinds of people. "You need 
more variety. . . . I wanted more women on-line just because I thought it would 
make Echo cooler." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn developed Echo with 20 friends, opening it in March, 1990. But only in 
the past year or so has it taken off, with membership growing 10-15% a month. 
"It's incredible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to have the Echo offshoots -- which will pick their own names -- up 
and running in early 1996 and all hooked up to the original service in an "Echo 
Network." 
</P>
<P>
 "You live where you want to live because that's where you're most comfortable, 
but you want to visit other places," she said. "Unlike the other systems that 
are trying to break down all these geographical and cultural boundaries, I'm 
trying to strengthen them, because what's the sense of visiting these other 
places if they're not different? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to spend a couple of months researching each city," then meet 
with the most promising-sounding groups of people there, she said. "We'll help 
them find the space, set up the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then from there, they will run it. We will just provide advice, guidance, 
support, whatever they need, but it's theirs. As they prove their success, then 
they can start buying (shares in) it. It'll still be a corporation but it'll be 
more of a partnership," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn is seeking capital but hasn't found the perfect source yet. "I want 
somebody who's in love with this whole thing . . . and (who can) bring 
expertise that I don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 As with Echo, she plans to own the majority stake in the offshoots. "But if it 
works out, they'll be rich. And I'm not greedy. In fact, I pretty much have all 
the money I want."

 New York Times Co. Expands Into Electronic Media: The publisher said it plans 
to spend at least $1 billion buying local television stations and cable 
networks and developing programming.Executives described the outlays, to be 
spread over five or six years, as a diversification effort aimed at reducing 
the company's reliance on newspapers for about 90% of its profit. The company, 
which owns the New York Times and 28 regional newspapers, also announced the 
launch of a new on-line service by its Boston Globe newspaper. It already 
operates an electronic outlet through America On-Line, called @Times.

GINSENG MAKES A GREAT TONIC FOR ECONOMY; CROPS: THE GNARLED ROOT IS A PRIZED 
PRODUCT IN CANADA, WHICH EXPORTS IT TO ASIA. IT IS USED IN HOLISTIC MEDICINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA OSTERMAN, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where the craggy peaks of the Rocky Mountains give way to rugged arid valleys 
in Canada's westernmost province, the most valuable legal crop in the world 
sprouts from the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It's ginseng, a gnarled root prized in traditional Asian medicine and more 
profitable than any other plant aside from illicit drugs, according to growers 
and government data. Although people generally associate ginseng with the Far 
East, it's becoming big business in western Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, companies based in British Columbia have become some of the biggest 
individual commercial producers in the $2-billion-a-year worldwide ginseng 
trade, which has historically been dominated by small family farms. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of riches is increasingly prompting farmers in the prime growing area 
of the Okanagan Valley in southeastern British Columbia to turn their land over 
to ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's booming," said Gerry Gill, president of Chai-Na-Ta Corp., a leading 
grower. 
</P>
<P>
 Based outside Vancouver, Chai-Na-Ta sparked the Canadian ginseng craze and 
claims to be the world's biggest single corporate grower, with 1,400 acres 
under cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver-based Canadian Imperial Ginseng Products Ltd., which went public 
only last February, is newer on the scene but believes it may already be the 
world's second biggest ginseng company. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies say it is impossible to know their rankings for sure because 
data for state farms and collectives in China and Korea, major ginseng 
producers, are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have no doubts about ginseng's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow marijuana, you go to jail. When you grow ginseng, you go to the 
bank," joked Maurice Levesque, a spokesman for Canadian Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics only have to travel as far as Vancouver's Chinatown for proof. At the 
Teck Shun herb shop, ginseng jars line the shelves, but the place of honor goes 
to a box of the root that sells for a hefty $4,400 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Business is brisk, although customers usually buy cheaper varieties that can 
sell for as little as $7.40 an ounce. "Ginseng can give you health. It's very 
popular," said owner George Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chai-Na-Ta estimates that an acre of ginseng generates gross revenues of up to 
$92,600. That compares to $18,500 for kiwi fruit, its closest rival, and $385 
for lowly alfalfa, government data show. Profit margins for ginseng are around 
60%, analysts calculate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing else like it. Other crops don't even come close," said 
investment analyst Jennifer Tai of brokers Brink, Hudson & Lefever Ltd who has 
studied ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadians began experimenting with ginseng in the early 1980s after 
Chai-Na-Ta's founder attended a ginseng auction during a business trip to Hong 
Kong where one rare root sold for more than $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the Canadian production is exported to Asia, usually passing 
through the hands of Hong Kong brokers who then sell it in China, Singapore and 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginseng has been used in Chinese holistic medicine for more than 2,000 years 
and at times has been more valuable than gold. The Canadian producers grow 
what's known as North American ginseng, one of two commercially cultivated 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 Prized for its soothing properties, North American ginseng accounts for about 
one-fifth of the world market of 6,500 metric tons while the main Asian strain, 
known for its energizing effects, accounts for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for North American ginseng is forecast to rise because it is perceived 
as a premium product. Also its reputation as a calming agent is expected to 
boost consumption as lifestyles in Asia become increasingly hectic. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally users make a tonic of ginseng by steeping slices of the root in 
water or broth. But Canadian growers are increasingly focusing on developing 
value-added products like ginseng teas and capsules. They are also hoping to 
expand consumption in Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Tai forecasts that Canada's wholesale ginseng exports will hit $148 million by 
1996 from $24 million last year. Canadian producers are currently fetching 
about $24.40 a pound for their ginseng at the farm level and the mark-up at the 
retail level is about 12 times that, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the price is down from more than $30 last year, and analysts fear that 
prices could fall further as production rises. These worries have been keeping 
Chai-Na-Ta's and Canadian Imperial's stock prices in the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have gotten into ginseng, but no one really knows how much 
the market can absorb. It's still a risky crop from a cultivation and marketing 
point of view," said Gretchen Bozak, a specialist at Agriculture Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 British Columbia's interior has an advantage over other areas where North 
American ginseng is grown -- notably the Canadian province of Ontario and 
Wisconsin -- because the weather is drier and growing conditions are easier to 
control. This is crucial because it takes four years for a ginseng crop to 
mature.

PACIFICARE TAPS TEXAS EXECUTIVE TO HEAD CALIFORNIA UNIT; HMO: JON WAMPLER WILL 
ASSUME HIS DUTIES AS PRESIDENT AND CEO BY FEB. 1, THE CHIEF OF THE 
CYPRESS-BASED PARENT COMPANY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. has chosen Jon Wampler, its top executive in 
Texas, to be president and chief executive officer of the health maintenance 
organization's operations in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment, to be announced publicly today, follows the unexpected 
departure of Jeffrey Folick, who resigned in October as president and CEO of 
PacifiCare of California to take a job with a large Minneapolis-based HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Wampler, 43, has been president of PacifiCare of Texas since August, 1990, 
when he joined the company. He will assume his new duties by Feb. 1, said Alan 
Hoops, president and CEO of PacifiCare Health Systems, the national parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Wampler will now also be a vice president of PacifiCare Health Systems, which 
has 1.2 million members overall. Half of them are with PacifiCare of 
California, the company's principal subsidiary, with the rest in Florida, 
Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoops said in an interview Tuesday that Wampler was one of three final 
candidates. "The thing we liked about Jon is that he's a team-oriented 
executive. He's built an atmosphere of cooperation and teamwork," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Wampler, like his predecessor in California, had built up the 
HMO's business for Medicare recipients, which has become an important part of 
PacifiCare's growth. "We're really looking for him to provide the glue to 
maintain the growth of PacifiCare of California," Hoops said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wampler, who could not be reached for comment, has 16 years of experience in 
the industry. Before joining PacifiCare, he was executive director of Humana 
Health Care Plans of Colorado. He had also worked at MetLife HealthCare 
Network, also in Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 Wampler lives in San Antonio with his wife and daughter.

KNOTT'S PLANS NEW ROLLER COASTER; ENTERTAINMENT: THE JAGUAR IS SCHEDULED TO 
DEBUT MEMORIAL DAY. A PARK SPOKESMAN SAYS THE RIDE WILL COMPLEMENT DISNEYLAND'S 
NEW INDIANA JONES ATTRACTION AND BOOST O.C. TOURISM. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to lift its summer attendance to new heights, Knott's Berry Farm 
unveiled plans Tuesday for a new thrill ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Jaguar, the new steel roller coaster will give passengers a four-minute 
ride -- about a minute more than most similar roller coasters, Knott's 
officials said. The coaster will cost more than $10 million to build and is 
projected to open by Memorial Day, the unofficial start of the summer tourism 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride will open shortly after nearby Disneyland unveils its splashiest ride 
in years: an adventure ride based on the Indiana Jones film trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's said the parks will complement -- not compete against -- each other 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "With both Orange County parks unveiling new attractions, it could be the year 
that tourists return to Southern California," said Bob Ochsner, a Knott's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride will become the centerpiece of the Fiesta Village section of the 
theme park. At 2,600 feet, it will be long enough to travel over a sixth of the 
park's area. It will zoom over a lake, thread through a 45-foot loop and then 
climb to the top of a tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Roller coasters are the most popular of theme park attractions, said Paul 
Ruben, Northern American editor of Park World, a theme park industry weekly 
based in England. Because they are such a draw, he said, they generally pay for 
themselves within two years of operation through increased attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the No. 1 reason people visit theme parks," Ruben said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jaguar will be the second major new attraction at Knott's within a year. 
Mystery Lodge opened this year as a theater in which Native Americans tell 
stories while images appear in simulated campfire smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochsner said the new roller coaster has been planned for five years. Park 
President Terry E. Van Gorder said in interviews earlier this year that he had 
been hesitant to launch new rides earlier because California was deeply 
entrenched in recession. 
</P>

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; US FACILITIES HOPES BUY-BACK WILL BOOST FALTERING STOCK 
PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors seem to have lost interest in the hostile takeover bid for US 
Facilities Corp. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding company for insurance underwriting services can't seem to get its 
stock price back to the $13-a-share level at which it was trading last spring 
when Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine offered $15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 So US Facilities recently decided to buy back as much as $5 million worth of 
its stock in an effort to boost the price, which has recently been $10 a share 
or lower. The stock closed Tuesday at $9.875 a share, unchanged, in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The low price typically would indicate that investors don't think the takeover 
is goinggo through. 
</P>
<P>
 At US Facilities' annual meeting in May, Fidelity won a shareholder vote to 
put the company up for sale to the highest bidder and appeared to win two seats 
on US Facilities' board. 
</P>
<P>
 But US Facilities, which is incorporated in Delaware, challenged the election 
in Delaware Chancery Court and won an order reversing the vote. Fidelity 
appealed the decision and is awaiting a ruling from the Delaware Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock buy-back offer could also stifle additional Fidelity efforts to 
acquire US Facilities. The offer could attract shareholders who supported 
Fidelity, which could erode support for the nation's fifth-largest title 
insurance company. But the low trading price is no endorsement of the current 
management of US Facilities, either.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: COMPUTER EQUIPMENT MAKER PRINTRONIX INC.'S STOCK JUMPS 
13.8% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Printronix Inc.'s common stock rose 13.8% Tuesday. The company said it knew of 
no particular reason for the gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing went out today in terms of news, but we're doing significantly better 
than we were last year," said George Harwood, chief financial officer of the 
Irvine-based company. "I think there are just lots of people interested in our 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Printronix, which manufacturers computer printers, recently reported a 
$1.5-million profit on revenue of $34.3 million for the quarter ended Sept. 23. 
A year earlier, the company had posted a profit of $96,000 and $24.5 million in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's Nasdaq trading, Printronix stock gained $4 a share to close at 
$33.

 DuPont Pharma: The North American arm of the DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. 
said Tuesday it has chosen Irvine as the site of its Western headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPont's seven-member sales and marketing staff opened its new offices at Palm 
Court in the Irvine Spectrum in late November. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to Irvine was prompted when DuPont decided to open regional 
headquarters across the United States. Previously, DuPont had only a district 
sales office in Orange County. The company maintains its worldwide headquarters 
in Wilmington, Del.

 Diagnostic Solutions Inc.: The LifeScan unit of Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday 
it has settled lawsuits against three companies, including Irvine-based 
Diagnostic Solutions Inc., that challenged its hold on the $250-million market 
for strips used in diabetes home test kits. 
</P>
<P>
 LifeScan, based in Milpitas, would not provide terms of the settlements with 
Diagnostic Solutions, Can-Am Care Corp. and Chronimed Inc. LifeScan called the 
agreement "a major victory," saying that the companies admitted having violated 
LifeScan's patents and agreed to sell their products under license in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis-based Chronimed said it sells the test strips under the Quick 
Check One brand name. Can-Am, based in Chazy, N.Y., distributes generic test 
strips manufactured by Diagnostic Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Krantz, president of Diagnostic Solutions, would not comment Tuesday on 
the terms of the settlement but said that the privately held firm will not be 
financially hurt by the action.

 Birtcher Medical Systems Inc.: The struggling maker of surgical supplies said 
Tuesday that it has signed an agreement to be acquired by a New York competitor 
in a stock swap valued at $16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher's definitive agreement with Conmed Corp., a manufacturer of 
disposable medical devices, would provide one-twelfth of a share of Conmed 
common stock for each share of Birtcher common stock, and one-half of a Conmed 
share for each share of Birtcher preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher, based in Irvine, had been weighing a sale in the face of losses in 
recent years. Its merger deal with Conmed, contingent on shareholder approval, 
among other things, is expected to be closed in the first quarter next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Conmed, based in Utica, N.Y., also makes heart monitoring and other medical 
products used in hospital operating rooms. Birtcher makes a variety of 
electrosurgery equipment.

 Executive Exchange: Several Orange County savings and loans have changed top 
executives and are rethinking their business strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Savings Bank in Orange hired veteran thrift operator Kellogg Chan as 
its chairman and president. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan built East-West Federal Bank in Los Angeles from an S&L with $25 million 
in loans and other assets in 1979 to a regional concern with $1.3 billion in 
assets by the time he retired in 1992. Universal's owner, Taiwanese businessman 
J.S. Chang, hopes Chan can do something similar at Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume there's going to be some growth once we get some of the problems 
here resolved," Chan said. Universal wants to rid itself of some bad apartment 
loans that have been a drag on earnings and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 At Standard Pacific Savings in Newport Beach, there is little lending going 
on. Its parent company, home builder Standard Pacific Corp. in Costa Mesa, laid 
off the president, chief lending officer and nearly the entire mortgage banking 
operation at the end of July. Higher interest rates this year have crimped 
mortgage bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still working on a game plan," said Richard Ambrose, the S&L's chief 
financial officer and acting president. The thrift is still making some loans, 
both to hold in its portfolio and to sell to investors, to generate enough 
revenue to cover expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard Pacific's former president, David Spahlinger, landed at Cornerstone 
Savings & Loan in Mission Viejo. Cornerstone has given up the apartment and 
commercial real estate lending that has hurt it, and Spahlinger is helping to 
devise a business plan by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift, which is operating under regulatory orders, laid off most of its 
lenders before Spahlinger arrived several weeks ago. Cornerstone "at the 
moment" is making just enough loans to break even, the new president said.

EDITOR TO DIVORCE HERSELF FROM LONG CAREER OF HELPING BRIDES; MARRIAGE: NEAR 
RETIREMENT, BARBARA TOBER RETAINS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE INSTITUTION SHE HAS SERVED 
SINCE 1966 AT A MAGAZINE REGARDED AS A BIBLE FOR THOSE ABOUT TO WED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost 30 years of engagement rings, bridal gowns, bouquets, table settings, 
honeymoon tips and assorted marital do's and don'ts might sound like a 
monotonous nuptial nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Tober still bubbles as enthusiastically today about weddings as 
she probably did in 1966 when she became editor-in-chief of a magazine that is 
one of the bibles of the bridal industry. Rather than bored, Tober is 
passionate, even now as she prepares to retire at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In recalling her career, Tober radiates professionalism. Any notion that her 
magazine is a frivolous fashion rag is quickly discarded after hearing her 
business philosophy. Weddings involve serious money -- to the tune of $32 
billion a year -- and Tober has statistics at her unpolished fingertips that 
make every cent spent on every detail seem significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people marry, other people work," Tober flatly states. "A wedding brings 
economic health. . . . It is a great banquet from which everyone can derive a 
living. It makes enormous economic sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
 An oversized cup of herbal tea goes unsipped during an interview in a cozy 
library adjoining Tober's office. Tober, a youthful 60-year-old, barely has 
time to take a breath, let alone drink tea, as she ticks off highlights of her 
time with the Conde Nast magazine now known as Bride's & Your New Home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her professional persona comes across elegantly. In a gray wool suit woven 
with bronze metallic threads, chrome-coiffed Tober conveys a no-nonsense style. 
But she's not off-putting; her stylish aura is tempered by a cheerful attitude 
that gives her fuzzy, friendly edges. Here is someone with sophisticated 
fashion sense whom any blushing bride would feel comfortable confiding in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tober exudes self-confidence. Being sure of herself and believing in her work 
helped her endure the '60s, when traditional weddings were bell-bottoming out. 
Back then, when free love threatened to make marriage obsolete -- or so some 
pundits claimed -- being in charge of Bride's magazine seemed like an 
endangered occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marriage was a shaky 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 in those days," says Tober. 
"People would laugh at me at parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Through those dark ages, Tober was steadfast. "We carried on and we held our 
head high. We knew what we were here for." 
</P>
<P>
 It took about 10 years for Tober to feel vindicated. "I began to see in the 
mid-1970s respect come back to this industry." Suddenly, radio and television 
talk show hosts who once scorned her sought her opinions on honeymoon travel, 
love and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have watched the entire nation change its mind over this 30-year period," 
Tober reminisced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tober studied design and had eight jobs before coming to Bride's. She was a 
secretary, copy editor and beauty editor at Vogue and attended the Fashion 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned down an offer to run Bride's two years before eventually taking the 
job. At the time she was overseeing the editorial operations of a publisher 
whose menu included Photoplay, True Love and other titles serving up similar 
zesty fare. In rejecting Conde Nast's initial overtures, she said she hadn't 
"crested" in her position yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Her training in fashion and interior design complemented Tober's 
communications skill and proved a good fit for Bride's. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about her Bride's tenure, Tober is proud that she was born in the same 
month and year that the magazine's predecessor was founded, in 1934. It began 
as 'So You're Going to Be Married," a giveaway to women whose wedding 
announcements appeared in the social pages of Northeastern newspapers. It 
dispensed advice to brides. One sample: call husbands at work only in extreme 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication expanded to become Bride's, which Conde Nast bought in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of its life, the magazine was simply plain old Bride's. It was 
renamed Bride's & Your New Home with the December, 1991-January, 1992, issue as 
Tober repositioned the magazine to underscore its influence on the formation of 
new households. 
</P>
<P>
 Computerization has allowed the magazine to gather data to back up its claims 
about the economic importance of weddings, Tober says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not just a magazine, we are a . . . service organization," she 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Skimming through the bimonthly turns up pieces on predictable topics like how 
newlyweds can break out of traditional gender molds by sharing kitchen chores. 
Each fat issue -- a typical one tops 600 pages -- is crammed with facts on 
everything from flowers to furniture. Never mind that novice readers might find 
it difficult to distinguish articles from ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost any topic could be considered fodder for Bride's, Tober says. "It's a 
big drama here. Anthropology, sociology, psychology, travel; there's nothing we 
don't touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trends Tober has witnessed are a few she thinks underlie the 
country's shifting attitudes toward marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She has observed greater participation by the groom's family in wedding 
preparations, including sharing the financial burden with the bride's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea of two families melding has been growing in our society over the 
last 30 years," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms seem more involved in the event than in the past. Engagement and 
wedding pictures printed in newspapers and elsewhere increasingly show the 
groom alongside the bride. 
</P>
<P>
 Tober has been married three times. Her husband of 21 years, Donald G. Tober, 
is chairman and chief executive officer of Sugar Foods Corp., which markets the 
artificial sweetener Sweet 'n Low. 
</P>
<P>
 Tober pauses in her recollections to remember which surname she had at a 
certain point. She giggles thinking that someone looking at the masthead over 
the years might think there have been three different editors-in-chief all 
named Barbara, "when the whole time it's been me!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to say I kept doing it until I did it right," Tober says, noting that 
her main reason for retiring is to spend more time with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tober leaves Bride's at the end of the year, she will be succeeded by 
Millie Martini Bratten, executive editor at Bride's since 1991. Bratten joined 
the bimonthly in 1976 as a fashion coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The zeal Tober tapped to transform a magazine once perceived as dowdy and 
backward should help her in retirement. Her new calling is crafts, a category 
encompassing objects sometimes derided as second-rate art. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her involvement on the Board of Governors of the American Craft 
Museum, she intends to become a high-profile advocate of the craft movement and 
improve its image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember when people said there was no craftsmanship left in America? It's 
not true. My role will be to see that this message gets out. I have a mission," 
she declares. "I'm passionate about it."

 High school basketball -- A story in Sunday's editions of The Times 
incorrectly reported that the Santa Paula boys' team had not won a tournament 
in 22 years before winning the Nordhoff tournament on Saturday. Actually, Santa 
Paula had not won the Nordhoff tournament in 22 years but had won other 
tournaments.
