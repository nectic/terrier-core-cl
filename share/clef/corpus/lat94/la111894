YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; SOUNDING AN ALARM ABOUT CAR FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Question: I am amazed by how often I am stuck in a traffic jam KNX or KFWB 
blames on a car fire. What causes these car fires and is there anything I 
should be doing to prevent a fire in my car? 
</P>
<P>
 -- E.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Thousands of cars every year are destroyed by spontaneous car fires, 
which have received scant attention from the federal government, car 
manufacturers or major automobile-safety organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of these fires do not appear to be caused by any known safety 
defects, but rather by wear and tear on engines, fuel leaks, faulty electrical 
systems and cooling systems that in many cases are poorly maintained by car 
owners. Arson also figures into many of these fires, although nobody is sure 
about the frequency of that either. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, the Los Angeles Fire Department recorded 6,084 car fires, of 
which about 1,300 were arson fires in stolen cars. Presumably, most of the rest 
caught on fire for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most frequent causes of car fires is believed to be worn-out 
radiator and heating hoses, which burst and douse the engine compartment with 
antifreeze. Often, the engine has overheated, which caused the hoses to burst 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethylene glycol, the main ingredient in antifreeze, is a sibling of the 
alcohol family and will burn at high temperatures, according to George Parker, 
research and development chief at the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. So, you want to make sure your hoses are in good condition and 
your car is not overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause of car fires is faulty electrical equipment. Cars have a lot 
more electrical gear -- wiring, computers, power windows, power seats and other 
convenience items -- than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 As these systems age, short circuits can develop that lead to sparks that 
ignite nearby combustible materials. In older cars you should check for frayed 
or loose wires. 
</P>
<P>
 A fuel leak in the engine compartment is an obvious hazard. Car manufacturers 
no longer use rubber fuel lines, so there is a lower risk of leaks in newer 
cars. Any time you smell gas, it's time to pull over and check out the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause of fires is missing air cleaners. An older, poorly tuned car can 
backfire. When that happens -- when the spark plug fires with the intake valve 
still open -- the flame shoots back into the intake manifold and up through the 
carburetor. The air cleaner will prevent the flame from continuing into the 
engine compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does not investigate fires 
that are not involved with automobile crashes, Parker said. (About 2% of fatal 
car crashes involved fires between 1979 and 1992, according to safety 
administration figures.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even when automobile fires are not caused by a crash, they can be quite 
hazardous. Fires can quickly engulf a passenger compartment and hold the 
potential to detonate the gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, motorists have no idea their car is on fire until it is burning 
furiously. In engine fires, the first indication sometimes comes when the paint 
on the hood begins to melt and bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Some motorists carry fire extinguishers, although using an extinguisher can be 
dangerous. You should never attempt to open the hood of a burning engine. 
Better, call the Fire Department and then your insurance agent.

 Comic Argus Hamilton, on the Clintons' vacation: "They are spending a few days 
alone and away from everybody. The country insisted on it."

 Worried parents in Danville, Ill., believe their teens are not using the

The observant parents, says comedy writer Mark Miller, "are also beginning to

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; COLLECTION OF TALES HAS A DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR; 
ENCHILADAS, RICE AND BEANS BY DANIEL REVELES ; BALLANTINE $9 PAPERBACK, 261 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a fictional meal, all right -- nine courses, plus an aperitivo and a 
despedida -- but Daniel Reveles gets the menu a bit wrong. Enchiladas, rice and 
beans are the basics of Mexican cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 This collection of stories is more like tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa -- 
lightweight fare, if plenty tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveles dares us to eat just one. 
</P>
<P>
 He sits us down in the plaza of Tecate, a small town just over the Baja 
California border a few miles east of Tijuana. With hospitable flourishes, he 
hands us a Jose Cuervo and signals for the mariachis to play more sweetly. 
Instead of "common cliches and stereotypes," he insists, "I want to introduce 
you to real Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as if we are hearing the gossip of Tecate directly from the balloon man, 
the fire eater or the Popsicle vendor who moonlights as a veterinarian, Reveles 
tells us about: 
</P>
<P>
 * El Gato, Tecate's version of Robin Hood, a crusading lawyer who keeps his 
mother in Mexico City supplied with Winchell's doughnuts from San Diego and 
with plants and flowers for the potholes that municipal crews never fix. 
</P>
<P>
 * " Senor Jeemy," an American furniture manufacturer who finds Mexico to be a 
paradise of low wages, high profits, compliant wives and spicy mistresses -- 
until the ruinous devaluation of the peso in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dona Lala, the 100-year-old witch who knows what kind of "miracle" has 
enabled a group of farm laborers to quit work and still sport new clothes, 
canned food and jugs of mezcal -- but isn't about to spill the frijoles.  
</P>
<P>
 * Big Caca, the corrupt border guard who wakes up one morning to find his 
2,000-pound bull stranded on the roof of his barn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rodolfo (Fito) Fernandez, who grows rich and powerful as an unintended 
result of the vow he takes on discovering that, while drunk, he has shot and 
killed his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sonya Avila, who explains to her ex-boyfriend's wife why, in Mexico, it's 
better to be the "other woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * Don Pedro Gonzalez Rosencranz, who dares to defy the superstition -- 
involving a dropped knife -- that has kept his ranch hands from sleeping in the 
bunkhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Faustino, the poor, love-struck youth whose friends bury a fake treasure in 
his yard and come to regret the joke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teresa Martinez, who petitions the saints for a way to keep her husband from 
drinking up his paycheck before he gets home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute, we say. Aren't these exactly the kind of stereotypes that 
Reveles said he would avoid? These "real Mexicans" are warm, romantic, musical, 
religious, hard-working but a trifle disorganized -- just as they are in the 
popular imagination. Don't we expect border guards to be corrupt, potholes to 
remain unfixed, wives to be chaste and husbands unfaithful, and fires to burn 
themselves out before the manana when the fire engine arrives? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are an American reading this," Reveles admits, "you may find the 
chauvinism of the men and the submissiveness of the women somewhat 
exasperating. I do too." 
</P>
<P>
 But this disclaimer is just another of the author's flourishes. Reveles, a Los 
Angeles-born songwriter, TV director and documentary filmmaker who lives on a 
rancho outside Tecate, is a sophisticated man who chooses here to hide his 
sophistication (except for an occasional wink) in the interests of 
yarn-spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 The flavor of "Enchiladas, Rice and Beans" is close to that of John 
Steinbeck's "Cannery Row." A semi-magical place is populated with 
larger-than-life characters. Real problems -- like those Steinbeck explored in 
"The Grapes of Wrath" -- are acknowledged but kept firmly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveles serves up these stories bite by leisurely bite, garnished with 
metaphors and comic asides, as if we really have joined the lunch crowd at El 
Taco Contento (where the tacos might be made of calves' cheeks, tongues or 
eyes). As befits a border town where the 19th Century is jostling with the 
21st, he blends shrewd, realistic observation with the conventions of the folk 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Tecate really like this? Reveles makes us want to visit and find out. His 
Mexicans, real or not, are a reproach to all those Anglos who voted for 
Proposition 187. Afraid of these people? For shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Reveles serves up these stories bite by leisurely bite, garnished with 
metaphors and comic asides, as if we really have joined the lunch crowd at El 
Taco Contento.

INK: GOOD AND BAD NEWS FOR BIG NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When the camera pulls back from the recent circulation declines at the 
country's dozen largest newspapers, the wider view reveals more dramatic 
comparisons to the numbers of five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 USA Today's circulation of nearly 1.5 million in the six months ending Sept. 
30 was down almost 2% compared to the same period in 1993. But since 1989, it 
has showed a handsome gain of 10.59%. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture at the Detroit Free Press was bad and worse -- circulation was 
down 2.07%, to 544,606, compared to the same period last year, and down 13.6% 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto the San Francisco Chronicle, which was off 6.38%, to 509,548, and down 
9.47% compared to five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post, whose circulation of 810,675 reflected a negligible slip 
of .22%, is riding a nearly 5% circulation gain since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the dozen leading newspapers, the New York Times in addition to 
USA Today and the Post, showed circulation increases over figures posted in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the highly competitive New York market, the Times dropped 2.32% in the 
April-to-September period, to 1.11 million, but its circulation was up 4.37% 
over the same six-month period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Post, which ranks 18th in circulation nationwide, was the only 
paper among the top 20 to gain in the past year. Its reported circulation of 
405,318 was up 2.7%, but that same number was down 20.1% since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times reported a circulation of slightly more than 1 million, 
off 2.5% compared to the same six months last year and down 4.1% compared to 
the same period five years ago, due to the closure of the San Diego edition and 
planned cuts in national and state circulation outside the primary market area. 
</P>
<P>
 The illuminating five-year comparisons, based on figures submitted by the 
papers to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, come from Media Industry Newsletter, 
a weekly publication of Phillips Business Information Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the decline) says to me is that there are more media to compete with, 
including interactive media, and higher newsstand prices also are a factor," 
says Steven Cohn, the New York-based editor of the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the trend over the past 10 years or so is simply that people are 
far less dependent on newspapers than they once were." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, newspaper revenues have been rebounding from a recessionary 
slump. John Morton, a newspaper analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan, says 
newspapers pulled in nearly half of all local ad revenue last year -- more than 
TV and the other leading media combined. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Big Books: Two hefty new volumes of film lit are out. Pauline Kael's "For 
Keeps: 30 Years at the Movies" (Dutton) gathers in a 1,291-page collection the 
best of the veteran film critic's reviews in the New Yorker ("Some of the 
readers seemed . . . to enjoy hating me") and other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 New from Knopf is an updated third edition of David Thomson's "A Biographical 
Dictionary of Film," which the British critic first wrote in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 An intellectual's selection, his new 834-page edition includes respectful 
entries about Jennifer Jason Leigh and director Steven ("sex, lies and 
videotape") Soderbergh, but nothing on other young faces such as Wesley Snipes 
and the late River Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On the Racks: In this week's issue of the New Yorker (Nov. 21), Fredric 
Dannen, author of the 1990 bestseller "Hit Men," a revealing portrait of the 
record industry, goes inside the mighty Warner Music Group and sorts out the 
boardroom warfare beyond what has been reported in the business pages of recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of O.J. Simpson's defense strategy "will be to plant seeds of 
reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds at every opportunity." So says Simpson 
defense team attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., profiled in the December-January 
issue of Vibe magazine. "If black people want to be with the prosecution after 
all the evidence is in, OK," Cochran says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think that will happen, because if you are African American, you 
don't necessarily accept the official version."

FIRST PERSON: SO, LIFE HAS COME TO THIS: MUGGER MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how hard she tried, Mama never could get me to carry cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," she'd say, slipping a $5 bill into my pocket. "Put this in your wallet 
for emergencies. And don't spend it." 
</P>
<P>
 But I was a teen-ager and the money waltzed right back out. For lip gloss. RC 
Cola. Gas. 
</P>
<P>
 For years I have lived close to the edge, telling myself that even pay phones 
and tow-truck drivers accept credit cards. Who needs the real stuff, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 But now I am having doubts. For the first time, I am thinking of carrying 
cash. And not for impulse purchases, either. 
</P>
<P>
 We are talking mugger money. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of my friends in New York, where walking is still the way to get around, 
have long carried mugger money. That way, if a thug demands cash, they can 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't think of leaving my apartment without it," my Manhattan friend 
John says with a horrified shudder, tapping the shirt pocket where he stashes a 
spare $40. 
</P>
<P>
 He's had to replenish it twice in 12 years and considers himself lucky. The 
muggers took the money and ran. So did John. 
</P>
<P>
 Mugger money runs on the same principle as flinging a half-eaten hamburger at 
the snarling dog that suddenly appears from nowhere. You want to appease the 
beast and perhaps save your life. Of course, the aggressor might pounce anyway, 
but that's something I don't want to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I find myself thinking about this a lot lately. I live in Silver Lake, 
where an armed robber struck 20 times in June. 
</P>
<P>
 I was jogging around the reservoir when officers in a police car pulled up 
alongside to warn me. They said the robber's modus operandi was to approach 
potential victims in his car, feign being lost, pull out a gun and demand cash. 
His targets were folks like me, walking their dogs, chatting on the street with 
neighbors or circling the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike large swaths of the city, Silver Lake is a place where many people 
still feel safe taking a stroll, even at night. It's a throwback to the old Los 
Angeles, with narrow, windy streets; old Spanish-style houses and California 
bungalows, and residents ranging from retired Japanese gardeners to Anglo 
professionals to hip Latino filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And increasingly, crime. I know the notion of mugger money seems ludicrous to 
those who sleep in the bathtub for fear of stray bullets from the street. Or to 
those who have no cash to spare. But for me and my neighbors, the debate over 
mugger money marked a painful loss of innocence. We wondered, "How much does it 
take to placate a mugger?" Is $20 enough? $40? $100? 
</P>
<P>
 A query to the police on mugger-money protocol didn't help much. "That's a 
judgment call," said Police Officer Alicia Ski, who often speaks to community 
groups about crime prevention. "We recommend that people not carry large 
amounts of cash. But if it's your life, then we advise people to give up 
whatever a person demands." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the news that the police had a suspect who sounded a lot like our 
guy. He was 16, lived in Echo Park, and told the officers that he stole money 
to finance a drug habit. We all relaxed a bit, but as one resident told a 
reporter, two or three more feral youths would soon pop up to take his place. 
That's the city we live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one good thing had come of this: a stronger sense of community. Those 
who were only nodding acquaintances days ago have become confidantes. Before 
the arrest, I had hailed a woman, walking alone at twilight like me, to warn 
her about the robber. 
</P>
<P>
 As we talked, a young man crossed the street from his house to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ladies heard what's going on in our neighborhood. About the armed 
robber?" he said, explaining that he had been among those robbed at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to let you know, from one human to another, be extremely 
careful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I made my decision. The next morning, I visited the ATM, looked 
around suspiciously, and withdrew $40. Mama will be pleased to know that, this 
time, I plan to hang on to it.

'SUNSET' AT HOME ON BROADWAY; CLOSE RETURNS TO NEW YORK STAGE, OWNING ROLE OF 
NORMA DESMOND BODY AND SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrew Lloyd Webber's genius is to produce shows that add up to vastly more 
than the sum of their parts, and this he has done in "Sunset Boulevard," which 
opened Thursday at the Minskoff Theatre on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber and his lovably unsubtle director Trevor Nunn have used more than 
just the publicity they garnered in the London and Los Angeles runs of the 
show. Obviously major casting kinks have been worked out along the way and, 
several lawsuits later, Glenn Close emerges triumphantly owning the role of 
Norma Desmond body and soul in a production that, while virtually 
indistinguishable from the L.A. version (Alice Ripley as the ingenue is the 
only major cast member who did not appear in Los Angeles), looks freshly 
spruced and glossed for its long-awaited Broadway debut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In turban and sunglasses, Glenn Close makes her star entrance descending John 
Napier's grand gilt staircase; she seizes the role of Norma Desmond even as she 
becomes an instant caricature whose grotesque grimace has already been 
emblazoned on the minds of New York theater-goers the way the song "Memory" was 
before "Cats" opened here in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's bitter view of Hollywood, as the place where "dreams are not enough 
to win a war/Out here they're always keeping score/beneath the tan, the battle 
rages" may play to more eagerly sympathetic ears on the East Coast than it did 
on the West. But "Sunset Boulevard" is still a show you can laugh at even as 
you become engaged by its gorgeous sets, bravado performances, and a score that 
can become infectious and sickeningly familiar all in one listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The score takes itself very seriously, make no mistake. Its grandiose themes 
match the stunning gilded front room in movie star Norma Desmond's 
mausoleumlike house, yet the show's set has changed at least four times before 
the melody varies even once. And while many of the sets and effects (and all of 
Andrew Bridge's lighting) are drop-dead gorgeous, others are already on their 
way to becoming stultifying kitsch, following "Phantom's" chandelier and "Miss 
Saigon's" helicopter. Norma's chauffeur-driven Isotta Fraschini, for example, 
cost $50,000 and is simply a cheesy set piece. And when the hero pretends to 
steer a car while noir footage of a car chase and a giant speedometer are 
flashed on top of a scrim, it's even more ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 With her mournful black-rimmed eyes and red-talon nails, Close seems to have 
based her Norma less on Gloria Swanson in the original 1950 Billy Wilder film 
than on Max Shreck's vampire in the silent "Nosferatu." 
</P>
<P>
 She creates a Norma who is more elaborate and fleshed out than her two biggest 
songs, "With One Look" and "As If We Never Said Goodbye," both of them insipid 
odes to ego that show-tune divas all over the world have and will continue to 
record. Close's voice is strong (and sounds better rested than it did last 
spring in Los Angeles) with a warped pitch that is perfect for Norma, but it is 
telling that the star is still most affecting in her non-singing moments: when 
she strikes an exaggerated Theda Bara pose; her despair at the burial of her 
monkey, with her mysterious caretaker Max helping her offstage as her sobs 
engulf her; her pantomime of desperation and drinking on New Year's Eve after 
she is left by her young lover Joe (Alan Campbell). This last scene is made all 
the more poignant because we simultaneously see struggling young people in a 
low-rent Hollywood flat having fun and living free of suffocating illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Close's most spectacular moment comes during Norma's visit to the sound 
stage where Cecil B. DeMille is filming a biblical epic. A light operator 
recognizes the star and before he can turn the merciless beam directly on her, 
she trembles with fear even as she readies herself to fill the sound stage with 
her glory at the precise instant the light hits her -- at that moment Close 
achieves as close a thing to greatness as this vehicle can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Joe, Campbell looks like a cross between Kevin Anderson, who played the 
role in London, and Dan Aykroyd. He provides an appealing laconic cynicism, 
offering the audience a way in which to view Norma's strange world. He's often 
quite funny, when mingling his world-weariness with keen observation, such as 
when he notes that, decorated for New Year's, Norma's house looks like gala 
night on the S.S. Titanic. He occasionally takes Joe's noir smoothness 
overboard into lounge-lizard land, particularly in the title song that starts 
the second act. 
</P>
<P>
 That song shows Lloyd Webber at his most posturing -- and Campbell, as well as 
lyricists Don Black and Christopher Hampton -- follow suit.  
</P>
<P>
 As Max, George Hearn is corsetted in the iron straitjacket of Erich von 
Stroheim's movie performance, and one senses that this usually flamboyant actor 
may be tired of his thankless part. At times he breaks through -- when he 
stands near the projector watching Norma's silent films he looks like a corpse 
in pain. But Hearn's character also carries the burden of bursting into 
full-confessional song at the slightest prodding of Joe, one of the more 
archaic conceits of the show. Norma does this too, but this trait is more 
understandable in an unhinged diva than in a severely repressed German serving 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Avian's few fully choreographed dance bits are sometimes corny, such as 
when suited movie executives join in the same steps as DeMille's dancing girls. 
Anthony Powell's sumptuous costumes match the Napier sets for heft and 
believability -- the glittering gown and matching robe (always with fur at the 
cuffs and feather in the hair) that Norma dons for New Year's seem to weigh and 
cost as much as Napier's fabulously solid-looking front gate of Paramount 
Studios. Even more than it did in L.A., this production reeks of scads of money 
spent as it is in the stock market -- to make scads and scads more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before her mind deteriorates completely, Norma appears sans wig or turban 
in a tufted hairdo that makes her look like the bird people in the Cirque du 
Soleil. While one may be tempted at that moment to call this a performance 
without vanity, it is not, of course. Other leading ladies have been bloodied 
and felled in the war to take this role, which is the centerpiece of "Sunset 
Boulevard," the musical and the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Close gives herself completely to the role's pathetic grandeur, and she 
seems more sure of herself than ever. For an actress who began on the New York 
stage but gained her greatest fame in the movies, it must be a most satisfying 
homecoming. Certainly her performance is the most satisfying aspect of a show 
that started off shakily in London (with a $6-million advance) and took the 
long route across the globe before landing triumphantly on Broadway (with a 
$37.5-million advance). 
</P>
<P>
 Like Norma Desmond, Lloyd Webber will do what he must do to take the 
spotlight, and never mind the dead bodies in the swimming pool. They make a 
great effect.

MOVIE REVIEW; THE 'MIRACLE' OF 1947, 47 YEARS LATER; MAIN CHARACTERS ARE A JOY 
TO WATCH, BUT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN JOHN HUGHES' UPDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Miracle on 34th Street" is one of the genuinely beloved holiday movies, 
winner of a trio of Oscars in 1947 and a Christmas season fixture ever since. 
So producer/co-writer John Hughes, the force behind this remake, has 
understandably tried hard to be faithful to its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes has shared his screenplay credit with initial writer George Seaton, 
cast Alvin Greenman (who played a teen-age Santa back then) in a cameo role, 
and even tried to get R.H. Macy's to repeat its role as the story's pivotal 
department store. Macy's declined, a decision that now looks rather wise. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not that the original (from a story by Valentine Davies) has 
been trashed. In truth, Richard Attenborough and Mara Wilson, taking on the 
roles that brought an Academy Award to Edmund Gwenn and stardom to a young 
Natalie Wood, do fine work and are the best things about this production. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rather that Hughes and director Les Mayfield have undertaken to not just 
remake but update "Miracle," which means making it cruder and more vulgar to 
match the tenor of modern times and Hughes' fatuous sensibility. Although 
attracted to the original's innocence, they eventually lost faith and ended up 
tampering with its purity in small but ruinous ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic outline of "Miracle" remains thankfully unchanged, although this 
version is a sluggish 18 minutes longer than its predecessor. It is the day of 
New York City's big Thanksgiving parade, here sponsored by the C.F. Cole 
Department Store, a landmark on Manhattan's 34th Street. But Dorey Walker 
(Elizabeth Perkins), the store's director of special projects, is more frazzled 
than happy. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the store's Santa, the parade's piece de resistance , is too 
inebriated to do his festive duty. In desperation Dorey turns to a nearby old 
gent (Attenborough), who happens to look just like Mr. Claus and says that yes, 
he's had a bit of experience in that line. 
</P>
<P>
 The old gent is a big success in the parade, ditto later in the week with the 
customers at Cole's, where he astonishes everyone by directing shoppers to 
whatever store has the best prices, even if it's the dread Shoppers Express 
(Gimbles in the original) just across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems too good to be true, and in fact Dorey soon uncovers a glitch. The 
man not only says his name is Kriss Kringle, he claims with total sincerity to 
be the true Santa Claus, the one with the reindeer, the elves, the whole nine 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course rationalist Dorey finds this hard to believe, as does her 6-year-old 
daughter Susan (Mara Wilson), who has been trained to be as skeptical as her 
mom. "I've known for a long time," Susan says in somber tones, "that he's not 
real." So Kriss' task is not only to persuade the world to have faith but to 
bring the spirit of the holiday back to one particular family as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking every inch the emperor of the North Pole, Attenborough, an actor 
before he was a director, was an inspired choice for Kringle. His eyes have an 
Eveready battery twinkle, his chuckle is vigorous and hearty, and he has the 
impressive hauteur of someone who's been important for ever so long. "If I 
didn't know better," a store executive says, "I'd think he was the real thing," 
a sentiment audiences will inevitably share. 
</P>
<P>
 Matching him twinkle for twinkle is Wilson -- Robin Williams' youngest 
daughter in "Mrs. Doubtfire" -- as the doubting Susan. An engaging, cheerfully 
precocious cherub, she also has an affecting melancholy side that keeps sugar 
overload from contaminating her performance. 
</P>
<P>
 After this, things gets dicier. The relationship between Susan's mother and 
handsome neighbor Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott) is awkward and not even close 
to convincing. And the extended courtroom scenes where Kriss' claims to be the 
real Santa are put to a legal challenge do little to hold our interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Least welcome of all are the hard edges Hughes and company have felt a 
compulsion to add to the mix. These range from having the inebriated Santa's 
backside visible, to changing the force behind the trial (now it's the sinister 
owner of Shoppers World, an uncredited Joss Ackland), to having someone bait 
poor Kriss with charges of child molestation. If this is pleasant escapism and 
the spirit of Christmas, it will be news to most folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when "Miracle on 34th Street" remembers that it's supposed to be a 
sweet piece of hokum, when it has the wit to leave Attenborough and Wilson on 
the screen together and forget about its rash of putative improvements, it does 
offer well-scrubbed family fare. Kriss himself would want us to forgive its 
flaws, and at this time of the year it gets harder and harder to turn the old 
gentleman down. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for some mild language. Times guidelines: It includes a 
reference to child molestation, and other harsh touches sound discordant notes.

THEATER REVIEW; TIGHT MUSIC, LOOSE STORY AT 'SMOKEY JOE'S CAFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway  
</P>
<P>
 They say there's always magic in the air . 
</P>
<P>
 -- "On Broadway," by Jerry Leiber, 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stoller, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil 
</P>
<P>
 Songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller worked for awhile at a Broadway 
address, but they never created a Broadway show. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smokey Joe's Cafe," a revue of 39 of their hits -- primarily from the '50s 
and '60s -- is at the Doolittle Theatre, en route to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of the material in "Smokey Joe's Cafe" is so familiar, it 
probably won't astonish anyone. "Magic in the air"? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 But it provides a lot of high-octane fun. 
</P>
<P>
 A giant image of a dashboard greets the audience at the outset. As the lights 
go down to start the show, they linger briefly on the car radio, reminding us 
of where we first caught the melodic and rhythmic hooks and the sly lyrical wit 
of the Leiber and Stoller songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway powerhouse director Jerry Zaks ("Guys and Dolls") has translated the 
duo's classics into a theatrical format. This requires a more extended focus 
than, say, a Top 40 playlist, although the first part of the show still seems a 
bit random. 
</P>
<P>
 After the initial rendition of the lesser-known 1974 song "Neighborhood," 
which announces our entry into Nostalgia Land, fairly lightweight songs bop on 
by without forming much of a pattern. Those who thought the narratives of 
"Forever Plaid" and "Five Guys Named Moe" were too thin will find this show's 
simply nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the appeal of this ensemble quickly becomes as apparent as that 
of the individual songs. In contrast to "Plaid" and "Moe," this cast has 
W-O-M-E-N (to paraphrase a lyric) as well as men. The interplay between the 
sexes raises the romantic stakes and the sexual temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights: the snaky moves of a male quartet in "Searchin' " and 
"Poison Ivy," the scorching moves of DeLee Lively and Brenda Braxton in 
"Trouble" and Braxton again in "Don Juan" ("musical staging" by Joey McKneely), 
the bass tag lines delivered with bemusement by Frederick B. Owens, the 
extravagant suits in "Shoppin' for Clothes" -- which look as if designer 
William Ivey Long borrowed them from his recent work on "Guys and Dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually the show becomes a bit more cohesive as well. Although the Leiber 
and Stoller songs aren't as rich in character details as many songs written 
directly for the theater, Zaks and company found thematic bridges between some 
of them that make this "Cafe" more than a routine medley. The first half ends 
with a logical but clever match between "D.W. Washburn," about a fairly 
contented bum, and "Saved," in which a squad of do-gooders try to raise him up. 
</P>
<P>
 These bridges become longer and sturdier in the second half of the show, which 
is also, yes, smokier and more dimensional. The first part of the second half 
is set in the eponymous cafe, which -- judging from the outfits -- appears to 
be a higher-class joint than the title song might suggest. The backstage band, 
the Night Managers, makes a brief appearance onstage, with conductor Louis St. 
Louis dressed in classic bluesman attire. Oddly, no one performs "Smokey 
Joe's," although the title appears in the band's soulful "Stay a While." But 
Pattie Darcy Jones quickly establishes the sexual tension with "Some Cats 
Know." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few playful moments in the second half, most notably when DeLee 
Lively teaches a quivering Robert Torti to shimmy. It's funny when Victor Trent 
Cook implores B.J. Crosby to "Treat Me Nice," only to be told that he ain't 
nothin' but a "Hound Dog" (in the original lyrics as recorded by "Big Mama" 
Thornton instead of the revised version sung by Elvis Presley). And the 
potentially incendiary "Riot in Cell Block 9" is quickly cut short when 
everyone joins the "Jailhouse Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a more serious tone finally culminates in four intense heart 
throbbers. Crosby reprises "Fools Fall in Love" -- which she had sung up-tempo, 
with wry detachment, in the first half -- as a powerful, personal cry of 
anguish. Ken Ard and Brenda Braxton make a stunningly glamorous couple in 
"Spanish Harlem." Cook's falsetto wrenches bitter tears out of "I (Who Have 
Nothing)," and Adrian Bailey leads the ensemble in the perfect benediction, 
"Stand By Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the show ever becomes heavy. The cast has six blacks and three 
whites, which might have led to some reflection on the racial issues that lay 
under the surface of pop music in the '50s and '60s, a la "Dreamgirls." But no, 
"Smokey Joe's" doesn't cross that threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond entertainment, its only agenda is to celebrate the vast repertoire of 
hits by Leiber and Stoller (and, if you examine the small print on the credits 
page of the program, by a few others as well). This it does, with style.

 MoMA's New Director: New York's Museum of Modern Art has named Glenn D. Lowry, 
director of the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, as the museum's next 
director, ending a 14-month search that began when Richard E. Oldenburg 
announced plans to retire. While at the Canadian gallery, Lowry is credited 
with completing a $58-million renovation and expansion, as well as placing 
added emphasis on modern and contemporary art. Lowry's previous positions 
include curator of Near Eastern art at the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler 
Gallery and Freer Gallery of Art. Lowry, 40, will take the MoMA post on July 1.

the department's senior curator emeritus on Dec. 1. Meanwhile, LACMA President 
William A. Mingst has confirmed rumors that Evan Maurer, director of the 
Minneapolis Institute of Arts, will not be the museum's next director. "Evan 
was an excellent candidate, but by mutual consent we have agreed not to go 
forward," Mingst said. Maurer was widely believed to be the leading contender

 Wallace Reprimanded: CBS News President Eric Ober has reprimanded Mike Wallace 
and "60 Minutes" producer Bob Anderson for surreptitiously taping an interview 
with a free-lance writer without her knowledge. The writer, Karon Haller, 
chatted with Wallace about a story she had covered, but did not want to do an 
on-camera interview. However, the discussion, was secretly recorded by tiny 
hidden cameras, one of which was secreted in the drapes. The monitor was placed 
next door in Morley Safer's office. "The surreptitious taping was a violation 
of CBS News standards," Ober said. "It was a violation of journalistic ethics. 
They used very, very poor judgment."

 KLOS Rocks Its Personnel: Rock station KLOS-FM (95.5), moving to combat a 
ratings decline over the past year, fired two veteran deejays Thursday. The 
dismissal of Bob Coburn from the 10 a.m.-2 p.m. slot and Joe Benson from the 
6-10 p.m. job follows on the heels of the Oct. 24 firing of Gino Michelini from 
the 2-6 p.m. show. Replacements for all three are expected to be named today. 
The station said the changes are part of an effort to reach a younger audience.

New Line Cinema from releasing the upcoming Susan Sarandon movie "Safe 
Passage," despite a producer's claims he was denied credit for helping to 
create the film. Dan Lupowitz, who says he served as executive producer for 
seven months, asked for the injunction pending the outcome of his breach of

New Line, saying that Lupowitz had not established that he had "any implied

 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has disqualified Kryzsztof 
Kieslowski's acclaimed film, "Red" from competing for Switzerland in the 
foreign film Oscar category. Academy executive director Bruce Davis said 
Thursday that the decision was based on the "artistic control rule" and that 
not enough of those in "creative control" of the film were of Swiss descent. 
However, Kieslowski's film "White," submitted by Poland, is eligible for the 
Oscars. . . . Due to high ticket demand, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers have 
added nine performances to their Dec. 13-18 "Live on Stage" dates at Universal 
Amphitheatre. The new dates are Dec. 20-22, with three shows each day. . . .

 Iranian-born director Amir Naderi, who has been living in New York City since 
1987, has a fine eye for the city's avid, woebegone landscape. In "Manhattan by 
Numbers," his first American feature, he lets his camera roam from Washington 
Heights to the Lower East Side, and he always finds fresh ways of seeing 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 The film might have been better if Naderi, who made the acclaimed "The 
Runner," had made a documentary. He has such a lyrical, free-flowing feeling 
for the city that the story he comes up with seems forced and perfunctory by 
comparison. It's about a laid-off Daily News reporter, George Murphy (John 
Wojda), who spends a long day trekking around the city trying to stir up $1,200 
to avoid eviction. His wife and daughter are staying with his father-in-law in 
Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 As George rifles through his address book calling friends from pay phones and 
getting nowhere, you begin to get a sinking feeling: This is going to turn out 
to be an Odyssey. When George tries to locate an old despairing friend who 
appears to have dropped out of sight, George's money hunt turns into a Samuel 
Beckett escapade: It's Looking for Godot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wojda's overwrought acting jars with Naderi's naturalism. Perhaps Naderi 
agrees, since long stretches of the film show the actor in medium and long shot 
wandering the streets wordlessly. But he manages to work in a range of New York 
"types" -- homeless people, reporters, landlords -- who resonate as more than 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manhattan by Numbers" is listless but Naderi is a true filmmaker. His 
evocation of the city deserves a better movie, but this one's not bad.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE PROFESSIONAL' GOES FOR HOLLYWOOD-STYLE SMARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Professional" is being touted as the Hollywood debut of "La Femme Nikita" 
director Luc Besson, but, of course, "Nikita" was pure Hollywood in every way 
except the subtitles. It was more Hollywood than its Hollywood remake, "Point 
of No Return." 
</P>
<P>
 Besson has a gift for amoral sleaziness that should serve him well over here. 
In his very first American film, he has gone straight for the smarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: It's about Leon (Jean Reno), a hit man who befriends Mathilda 
(Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old who has lost her family in a drug-deal 
rub-out. Seeking vengeance, Mathilda cajoles Leon into teaching her the tricks 
of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Besson makes sure his hit man -- "cleaner" -- is sympathetic. Leon may look 
like Sylvester Stallone after being run through a duck press, he may wear 
sunglasses indoors, but he knows where to draw the line in his job: "No women, 
no children." He drinks milk, tends to his best friend -- a houseplant -- and 
can't read. (Illiteracy, per Forrest Gump, seems to be a point of sympathy in 
the movies these days.) He allows a chummy Mafia capo (Danny Aiello) to bank 
his earnings. He loves Gene Kelly movies. (Kelly should sue.) 
</P>
<P>
 This sub-verbal lunk is a blood brother to Lennie in "Of Mice and Men" -- in 
other words, Besson defuses the relationship with Mathilda by making Leon 
essentially sexless. We're supposed to regard his live-in relationship with the 
girl as a platonic, father-daughter thing, although she's a lot more wised-up 
than he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Besson recognize that he shows off Mathilda as a tart little Lolita? The 
first shot of her in the movie is a slow tilt up her stockinged legs, and in a 
couple of sequences he dresses her like Jodie Foster in "Taxi Driver." She does 
vampy impressions of Marilyn Monroe and Madonna, singing "Like a Virgin." 
(Madonna should sue.) If the point of all this is to show how an abused child 
becomes precociously sexual in order to find love, the intention is coated with 
gunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Portman isn't enough of an actress to unfold Mathilda's pain, and, in 
any event, Besson doesn't seem very interested in it. The girl's family -- 
including her 7-year-old brother -- has been wasted, but she's not terribly put 
out by it. (Her father was a sleazeball with a live-in lover, and her sister 
was "only" a half-sister.) Her vengeance on the Drug Enforcement Administration 
kingpin (an over-the-top Gary Oldman) who provoked the killings seems motivated 
more by pique than rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Professional" reaches its nadir -- and that's saying something -- when 
Leon teaches Mathilda the fine points of picking somebody off with a long-range 
rifle. From a tenement roof she plugs a Donald Trump-looking jogger in New 
York's Central Park. The bullet, of course, turns out to be a red-fluid-filled 
blank. Besson plays the scene for laughs. Hardy-har-har. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Professional" works in a sub-zone of Hollywood amoralism where violence 
is intended as turn-on and neglected children are displayed as moppets and 
killers are sweetened by their attentiveness to houseplants. It's a vile little 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong graphic violence and for language. Times 
guidelines: It includes a lot of implied smarminess involving a 12-year - old 
girl and much in-your-face violence. 'The Professional'

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A THUNDEROUSLY SATISFYING SET BY DINOSAUR JR. IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As mastermind of the Amherst, Mass., power trio Dinosaur Jr., J Mascis has 
spent a decade building bits of glum disaffection into roaring guitar rock, 
sounding one moment like a sublime pop satirist and at the next like the most 
earnest of Deep Purple revivalists.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, any irony in Mascis' 
songwriting was overshadowed by the straightforward crunch and wail of his 
guitar as he led the band through a thunderously satisfying set. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding forth in front of a head-high stack of Marshall amps, the unsmiling 
Mascis was a reluctant showman, holding his stage patter down to, "All right," 
"Oh yeah" and "Thank you." But he was hardly disengaged when, against the 
steady throb of bass and drums, he ripped at his guitar to produce a wash of 
tuneful, textured, near-deafening sound.  
</P>
<P>
 Dinosaur Jr.'s songs don't build to sing-along choruses, and Mascis rarely 
plays a clear, signature lead line, but each song's crafty mix of obtuse lyric, 
accessible melody and cranked guitar becomes, in effect, its hook -- pulling 
the listener into Mascis' high-volume world of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunes' steady, unhurried tempos didn't encourage much mosh-pit action, but 
an energetic version of its current alternative hit "Feel the Pain" had a good 
portion of the crowd pogoing in place. Mascis' laconic warble and alienated 
lyrics might qualify him as the mumbling spokesman for the nation's slacker 
population, but in concert, his guitar speaks up with power and passion. CHUCK

MOVIE REVIEW; DEAD CAN DANCE'S 'WITHIN': AN EXOTIC MUSICAL HEAD TRIP; MARK 
MAGIDSON ESCHEWS FLASH IN DOCUMENTING THE GROUP'S ECLECTIC OFFERINGS. THE 
MELTING POT OF SOUNDS CAN BE TRANSCENDENT -- OR MAKE YOU VERY, VERY SLEEPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Byrne may have alluded to the idea of singing in tongues, but Lisa 
Gerrard really does it. Her group, Dead Can Dance, brings together so many 
vaguely recognizable exotic musical elements -- the Celtic and Middle Eastern, 
principally -- that it's easy to presume she's more of a multilinguist than she 
is, at least when she stops singing in English and her powerful, 
Arabic-sounding alto gets a bit vague. Just think of it as etherealist scat. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the interview footage moderately sprinkled throughout "Toward the 
Within" -- a new concert movie documenting a Dead Can Dance performance at 
Santa Monica's Mayfair Theatre last year -- Gerrard spreads the gospel of 
freedom through glossalalia: 
</P>
<P>
 "Because people are desperately trying to find a way of releasing themselves 
from this fleshy prison," she says, "they turn to you when they see you 
escaping momentarily and think, 'How did you get out?' And it's very easy -- 
let the language grow by itself, your own language. You have the ability to, 
through arts, through tongues . . . travel to places more beautiful than we're 
ever promised." 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, it's a "head" movie, all right, in the great midnight cinema tradition. 
Not that director Mark Magidson does anything the slightest bit flashy in 
documenting the show; the cuts are nearly imperceptible, the staging far from 
psychedelic. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a few of Dead Can Dance's 14 represented numbers settle into any sort 
of musical literalism. Their melting pot of Chinese dulcimers, Irish bouzouki, 
uillean pipes, whistles, guitars, goblet drums and mellifluous caterwauling 
will, with little provocation, take you to that beautiful language- and 
culture-transcendent place . . . or, if you're not a Dead-head, make you very, 
very sleepy. 
</P>
<P>
 The film (also just out on VHS and laser disc, for the non-theatrically 
inclined) modestly lets the band sell itself -- and that'll be a hard sell to 
non-fans, given the lack of visual dynamics. (Among seven musicians on stage, 
only the jumpy timpani player moves around much, even in the more propulsive, 
percussion-heavy sections.) 
</P>
<P>
 But, at the risk of seeming too taciturn for cinematic translation, Dead 
founders Gerrard and Brendan Perry don't need to dance to suggest the benefits 
of "transmigration" (as Perry puts it, speaking of the Irish death ballads the 
band covers amid its less traditional originals). The fleshiness is weak, but 
their spirit is perked along by Gerrard's trilling. 
</P>

all. 'Toward the Within'

JAZZ REVIEW; OSCAR BROWN JR. SHOWS OFF HIS ECLECTIC SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar Brown Jr. has always been a difficult performer to categorize. Part jazz 
singer, part poet, part entertainer and part songwriter, he has persistently 
avoided the stylistic pigeonholing that seems essential to a high-visibility 
career in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
 His appearance at the Jazz Bakery Wednesday night, however, illustrated the 
long-term creative values of the pursuit of his own muse. Working only with 
pianist Calvin Brunson, Brown delivered a collection of quirky, off-center 
tunes -- mostly originals, with a few idiosyncratic adaptations of jazz 
standards -- with a platform-stalking, declamatory presentation that required 
every bit of his eclectic skill. 
</P>
<P>
 At 68, and not especially prominent in either the jazz or the pop mainstream, 
Brown has matured into a detached, wily elder, offering his view of life and 
love with the sly irony and knowing theatrics of a player who has seen it all. 
Many of his songs simmered with the double-entendres and whimsical sexual 
metaphors intrinsic to his writing style. "You knew damn well I was a snake 
before you took me in," he sang in one lyric. Another described a "Honey, do 
this, honey do that" relationship and, in a third, he postured -- only half 
jokingly -- "One good bull is half the herd." 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces had a darker quality, one that often was tinged with the barely 
disguised bitterness of aging. "There he sits," Brown sang of one character, 
pondering his mortality, "recounting his blessings, the blues and the bliss." 
And of another, looking back on receding joys, "What was that we used to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's performance was energized by the deceptively propulsive jazz rhythms 
he brought to each of his tunes. And Brunson was the perfect accompanist, 
singing a few lines of harmony here and there, tossing in an occasional 
improvisation, but primarily acting as a kind of rhythmic Greek chorus to 
Brown's captivating flights of poetic fancy. * Oscar Brown Jr. at the Jazz 
Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver City, (310) 271-9039. $20 entrance charge. 
Brown plays two sets each night, 8:30 and 10:30, through Saturday. DON HECKMAN

'MEFISTOFELE': THE DEVIL GOES CAMPING; S.F. OPERA'S RENDERING OF THE ETERNALLY 
PROFOUND CONFLICTS OF GOETHE'S 'FAUST' DARES TO TAKE CHANCES AND, FOR BETTER OR 
WORSE, TRIES TO MAKE THE AUDIENCE THINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 All the world's a stage, and much of what transpires on that stage is 
grotesquely funny. Also ribald, symbolic, colorful, picturesque, outrageous, 
clever, poignant and gimmicky. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the essential premise of Arrigo Boito's mighty "Mefistofele" as staged 
by the naughty Canadian Wunderkind Robert Carsen for the San Francisco Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept may be a bit primitive for a work that tries to take the eternally 
profound conflicts of Goethe's "Faust" seriously. The concept may trivialize, 
even parody, the romantic fervor of Boito's score. The concept may be oversold 
as a stage-within-the-stage and show-within-the-show harboring frenzied 
burlesque figures, masked deities, raunchy revelers in sort-of-modern dress 
(and undress), an apple-orchard encased on an off-kilter merry-go-round and, 
always at the center, a good-humored two-bit villain with an ever-changing 
wardrobe who deals in cheap magic tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept may seem forced, sometimes even perverse, and its application can 
border on the arbitrary. But -- a very big but at the War Memorial Opera House 
these days -- one must be grateful for one huge favor: This "Mefistofele" does 
have a style of its own, a consistent look, a distinctive tone. 
</P>
<P>
 It has ideas, possibly too many. It dares to take chances and, for better or 
worse, it tries to make the audience think. 
</P>
<P>
 One can't say things like that for most of the safe and somnolent 
singing-pageants currently on display here. Together with his inspired 
designer, Michael Levine, Carsen has created a lavish, big-league production 
that takes nothing for granted on either side of the false-Baroque proscenium. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was new five years ago, sight tended to obliterate sound. Now, with 
Peter McClintock serving as the directorial sorcerer's faithful apprentice, 
with a stronger conductor and a mostly different cast, the proper balances of 
power are nearly restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial holdover from the class of '89 is Samuel Ramey, who still revels 
in the inherent hocus-pocus maneuvers, still sings with a generously plangent 
basso, still snarls with gusto, still compels matinee-idol attention at all 
times, and still bares his trademark chest for no apparent reason beyond hairy 
exhibitionism. Although he cannot make the sentimental fossils out front forget 
Giulio Neri, much less Norman Treigle, he certainly gives the devil his 
luxuriant due. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Margison, the burly Canadian cast as Faust for the first time in his 
extraordinarily promising career, brings ringing, golden tone to the challenge, 
not to mention musical sensitivity and dramatic acumen. He plays the old Faust 
like Emil Jannings in "The Blue Angel" -- not a bad model -- and adds a nice 
touch of self-mockery to his youthful reincarnation. He even submits to the 
indignity of Carsen's Peter Pan flying act at the end of the transformation 
scene with good cheer. At last, another tenor. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Aprile Millo, the Margherita, has encountered some unfortunate vocal problems 
lately, and not all of them seemed to be solved on this occasion. Nevertheless, 
she sang carefully at worst, with genuine luster at best, really savored the 
pathos of the death scene and, whether giddy or tragic, followed Carsen's 
directions with affecting dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Neblett, who had undertaken both Margherita and Elena in the celebrated 
New York City Opera production of 1969, contented herself with the duties of 
the Trojan siren on this occasion. Although her vibrant soprano betrayed a few 
signs of stress, she still exuded ample allure, both physical and vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong supporting cast included Judith Christin as an endearingly silly 
Marta, Joseph Frank as an incisively earnest Wagner and Elizabeth Bishop as an 
engagingly mellifluous Pantalis. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called serious ballet, now entrusted to Victoria Morgan, executed its 
cliches deftly. The mass scenes were monopolized, however, by the lusty 
choristers and extras who often bared all (nudity more simulated than 
stimulated) in quest of dramatic mock-verity. 
</P>
<P>
 The guiding force, and abiding voice of sanity, emanated from the podium. 
Julius Rudel, a late replacement for the ailing Antonio Pappano and a 
"Mefistofele" specialist since 1969, conducted with equal concern for Boito's 
delicately calibrated agitation and all-encompassing grandeur. The heroic 
climaxes were brilliantly gauged, and getting there -- with leisurely breadth 
and telling nuance -- was more than half the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when high camp dominated the stage, the maestro supported high art in the 
pit. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mefistofele" presented by the San Francisco Opera, 301 Van Ness Ave. 
Remaining performances Monday at 8 p.m., Nov. 27 at 2, Nov. 30 at 7:30, Dec. 3, 
6 and 9 at 8. Patricia Racette sings Margherita the last three nights. Tickets

JAZZ NOTES: MONK COMPETITION PUTS SINGERS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Autumn White or Pete McGuinness may be the next big-name vocalist in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" you say. 
</P>
<P>
 White and McGuinness aren't exactly household names, but they do have one 
thing in common: They're among 11 semi-finalists in this year's Thelonious Monk 
International Jazz Vocals Competition, being held Monday at the John F. Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And given the hubbub over some past other Monk winners, like pianists Marcus 
Roberts and Jacky Terrasson or tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman, chances are 
that one of these singers will be a name we will come to know fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, a victory in the Monk Competition has become a ticket to jazz 
stardom. Redman, an unknown when he won the event three years ago, became the 
subject of a bidding war, and he eventually signed a lucrative contract with 
Warner Bros. Records. He has gone on to become one of the two bankable stars in 
jazz -- the other being Wynton Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Monk runners-up have done well. Trumpeters Nicholas Payton and Marcus 
Printup, who both came in behind trumpeter Ryan Kisor in 1990, have albums due 
out soon on Verve and Blue Note, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby Fischer, executive producer of the competition, says that while the 
affair started out as simply a means of exposing young jazz artists and 
increasing visibility for jazz in general, commerce has definitely come into 
the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, all the major labels have given financial support and will have 
representatives at the semis and finals," she says. "They recognize that they 
can come here and find talent. They're all looking for the next big star." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the competition has focused on pianists, trumpeters, saxophonists 
and drummers. This is the first year singers are competing, and Fischer feels 
that vocalists will benefit from the exposure.  
</P>
<P>
 The Monk Institute received more than 200 audition tapes, from which the 11 
semifinalists were selected. This latter group, all age 33 and under, reflects 
jazz's worldwide appeal -- there are semifinalists from France, Italy and 
Germany -- as well as its substantial presence in New York, where five of the 
semifinalists live. 
</P>
<P>
 Three finalists for Monday's affair will be chosen from performances on Sunday 
judged by Abbey Lincoln, Jon Hendricks, Dianne Reeves, Shirley Horn, Cleo Laine 
and Jimmy Scott. The first-place winner receives $10,000, second place gets 
$5,000 and $3,000 goes to the third-place entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Singers: If Stephanie Haynes were entered in the Monk Competition, 
there are many who feel she'd have an excellent chance of winning. Regarded as 
one of the finest jazz-influenced singers anywhere, Orange County-based Haynes 
has a dynamic voice and works with a remarkable sense of rhythm. She knows how 
to swing.

MUSIC REVIEW; SALONEN OFFERS PREVIEW OF TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon to depart on a tour that will take them to Mexico and the East Coast, 
Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic are using this week's 
concerts at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to hone the traveling repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 As heard Wednesday night in a muscle-flexing program, they don't have a whole 
lot of honing left to do. Impressive sounds and polished performances were on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Salonen played things rather close to the vest. For better or worse, 
this was cool and objectified music making, the conductor's and players' 
personal views generally left out of it, or, perhaps more accurately, beside 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's highlight was an ultra-snazzy run-through of Bartok's Concerto 
for Orchestra. Here, Salonen and orchestra made the most of the showcase 
aspects of the work, revealing a huge dynamic range (with a wow-'em 
pianissimo), bold, glittering and pastel colors, impeccable solo work, precise 
ensemble and monumental climaxes. It would be difficult to ask for more, even 
though one occasionally felt like doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there the music didn't seem to be as cute as it needed to be, or as 
elegant and gracious as it could have been. These things take a personal effort 
on the part of the conductor, which Salonen didn't appear willing to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellist Ronald Leonard, on sabbatical this season from his duties as a 
principal in the orchestra, took on the sardonic, rapturous Cello Concerto No. 
1 by Shostakovich at midpoint in the program. In a technically commanding 
performance of the difficult score, Leonard projected an intensity throughout, 
with especially searing and purposeful accounts of the Moderato and Cadenza. 
The fizz was missing from the outer movements, however, perhaps because of the 
slowish tempos or the not quite fluent or fully characterized orchestral 
accompaniment. Jerry Folsom offered giant horn solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's Overture to "The Consecration of the House," a neo-Handelian work 
of considerable bluster, opened the event in a reading capturing all its 
oratorical fervor and knitted-brow solemnity.TIMOTHY MANGAN

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MODADA IS AN OTHERWORLDLY EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to cruise very slowly along Melrose just west of Crescent Heights to 
spot the avenue's newest restaurant. There's still no sign out front, only a 
placard proclaiming complimentary valet parking.The former Andrea's scumbled 
yellow facade is now faced in narrow wood planks. And ghostly fish and seaweed 
sprawl across the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, I immediately wanted to go home and change into something more 
suitably baroque. Chandeliers and wall sconces fitted with burning tapers give 
the room an otherworldly air. Booths and chairs are covered in African mud 
cloth, and waiters sport what look like uniforms from some long-disbanded 
republic's army. Welcome to the world of Modada. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next table, mussels with a flurry of frizzled leeks are served in a 
miniature silver watering can. A "pillar" of crab and artichoke confit has 
yellow and green pole beans poking out, like an edible instrument of torture. 
And a quartet of dim sum comes with three thimbles of sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Main courses hail from Air, Land or Sea. Can I picture ordering Erotic Chicken 
(Air) -- "a roasted whole boneless baby chicken stuffed with forest mushrooms 
on a flower of purple endives with a rose petal sauce"? Sure thing. The menu 
also asks me to "envision a braised lamb leg, a grilled lamb chop and a lamb 
loin wrapped in feuille de brick, all seen in 'The Lamb in 3D,' " served with 
Moroccan mint oil (Land). Surely, chef Sam Marvin, even though he did cook at 
the once terminally trendy Monkey Bar, can't mean leaves of brick? More likely 
Tunisian brik. But you never know. 
</P>
<P>
 * Modada, 8115 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 653-4612. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays for dinner; lunch starting mid-December. Valet parking. 
Appetizers $4.50-$8; entrees $13-$19. S. IRENE VIRBILA

RESTAURANT REVIEW; FOLLOWING THE SALT TRAIL TO PUCK'S NEW PLAYGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Saturday afternoon at the popular Wolfgang Puck Cafe on Montana, where 
Luma used to be, and boy, does that space ever look different. Gone is Luma's 
elegant sophistication; enter Barbara Lazaroff's yellow and green walls, noisy 
tile work and, overhead, a protruding clump of big, senseless beams checkered 
with color. And this room is toned down compared to Puck's Universal CityWalk 
cafe, where the colors, tile work and cartoony facade are so amped they're 
borderline nightmarish. But this, after all, is the civilized, urbane Westside 
and the visual hysteria is tempered.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Lazaroff is present, having herself videotaped talking to customers. 
The woman responsible for the look of her husband's restaurants dresses with a 
flair that echoes her interior design -- Princess Leia's hair, a leather jacket 
patterned with colorful slices of fruit. The older couple next to us 
congratulates her on the birth of her son Byron 13 days before. 
</P>
<P>
 These cafes are Puck's answer to such chains as California Pizza Kitchens and 
Crocodile Cafes -- upscale, tricked-up casual restaurants that will no doubt be 
as emblematic of these times as '50s diners and '60s coffeeshops are for 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-lived Eureka notwithstanding, Puck has the magic touch. He knows 
what his public craves. In this cafe, Puck appeals to that basic American 
affection for salt. The food is salty in the way that french fries, potato 
chips and hot dogs are salty -- pleasurably, addictively salty. I don't mean to 
imply that chef Guy Leroy's food is junk food -- it's made, actually, with 
fresh, excellent ingredients -- but it does provide all the pleasures of junk 
food: big obvious tastes and generous portions. In terms of marketing, this is 
brilliant. Because as noisy and visually hyper as the room is, as salty as the 
food is, people are lining up and waiting 45 minutes and an hour for a table. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron's butternut squash soup, a velvety orange puree that tastes mostly of 
cream, would indeed be as bland as baby food without a swirl of ground red 
peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Typical excess is found in a salad of roasted eggplant, tomato and fresh 
mozzarella, which might have been perfectly fine drizzled with good olive oil. 
Instead, it is deluged with a homogenized balsamic vinaigrette and a generous 
scoop of olive and caper tapenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicy Asian shrimp salad is like a carton of good to-go Chinese shrimp with 
vegetables all mixed up with baby greens. Deep-fried popcorn shrimp are good 
and sweet with a perfect crunchy crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas are made fresh and, of themselves, toothsome and tasty. There's nothing 
subtle about the sauces or toppings, however. Barbara's fettuccine (yes, almost 
the whole family has a dish in their honor) sports broccoli, colorful peppers, 
sweet perfectly cooked shrimp and an excessive amount of oily, intense 
ginger-cilantro pesto. Sauteed scallops, also skillfully handled, are served on 
a springy linguine that's squid-ink black on one side of the noodle, white on 
the other; again the sauce, a spicy Chinese black bean concoction, is plentiful 
and far from discreet. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a grilled chicken is a great bargain at $9.50; it comes on a scattering 
of pale but crisp and salty onion rings and a minor mountain of mashed 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Excess is truly inappropriate in the baked salmon's saffron aioli, which is as 
yellow as French's mustard. Too much saffron invariably imparts a scorched, 
medicinal flavor. In this case, a friend dipped into the bright yellow stuff 
and exclaimed, "What's this? Burnt rubber?" The salmon itself was a lovely 
piece of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Puck's designer wood-fired pizzas are, by now, universally known and either 
you like the soft, slightly spongy crust and his jazzy flavor-bomb toppings or 
you prefer another style of pizza. Certainly, there's never a dull (or 
saltless) bite in the marinated shrimp pizza with leeks and sun-dried tomatoes. 
I, personally, prefer a simpler prosciutto pizza; one without goat cheese, 
where the prosciutto isn't shredded. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, as might be expected, tend toward the gloriously sweet. Even the 
tarte tatin, which seems quite delicious as it is, wears a thick coat of 
caramel sauce and a cloud of whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wolfgang Puck Cafe, 1323 Montana Ave., Santa Monica . (310) 393-0290. Open 7 
days for lunch and dinner. Full bar. Visa and Master Card accepted. Dinner for 
two, food only, $27-$55.

RESTAURANT NOTES: FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO FEAST, NOT FUSS IN KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If you've closed your kitchen for Thanksgiving this year, there are plenty of 
restaurants only too happy to prepare the entire spread for you. But hurry up 
and reserve right away; restaurants are booked up early. Nobody wants to miss 
out on this biggest food holiday of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly Yours restaurants in Tarzana and Northridge are offering a truly good 
deal, especially for families with small children. A three-course traditional 
turkey dinner costs only $13.95, and for every adult at the table, a child gets 
to eat free. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Miller, chef-owner of the cozy Joe's in Venice, includes hor d'oeuvres for 
the table and choice of turkey breast with wild rice or the traditional roast 
turkey with mashed potatoes and stuffing in the four-course, prix fixe ($28) 
menu he has put together for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options include the Players in Beverly Hills ($22.95), St. Moritz 
Restaurant at the Toluca Lake Tennis Club ($25), Les Freres Taix on Sunset 
($11.95), Silver Grille in Beverly Hills ($19.95), Duet in Glendale ($17.95) 
and Chez Melange in Redondo Beach ($16.95). 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, chef-owner Joachim Splichal's Patina on Melrose offers a more 
elaborate Thanksgiving feast, this year for $40 per person. Besides roast 
turkey with gingered yams, he's making Virginia ham with caramelized mango, 
whitefish with polenta, John Dory with lentils and beef tenderloin with 
shallots and chanterelle mushrooms. (Bear in mind, though, that Patina is not 
allowing customers to bring their own wines, however illustrious, on this 
holiday.) Always the businessman, Splichal will also prepare the meal for take 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 DC3 at the Santa Monica Airport also offers turkey to carry out ($69.95, 
serves 6 to 8) or eat in at $29.95 per person. On the holiday, 72 Market St. 
will be closed for dining, but, if you order ahead, a roast turkey and all the 
fixings can be picked up Thursday between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. A 10-12-pound bird 
with all the trimmings goes for $119; a 20-22 pounder, $169. BG to Go, the 
Bistro Garden's takeout shop in Studio City, will also provide turkey to go at 
$17.50 per person with 24-hour advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that tourist hot spots such as Universal Studios, Disneyland and 
Knott's Berry Farm also offer Thanksgiving dinners. And most hotels do, too. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, in addition to all the traditional 
Thanksgiving foods, you can load up on ham and roast beef, a seafood and pasta, 
and all sorts of desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hotels offering Thanksgiving dinner include Pasadena's Ritz-Carlton 
Huntington Hotel, JW Marriott in Century City and Hotel Bel-Air. Also Azalea 
Restaurant & Bar at the New Otani Hotel downtown and Le Meridien Newport Beach 
both offer Thanksgiving buffets.  
</P>
<P>
 For vegetarians, the Inn of the Seventh Ray in Topanga Canyon has planned a 
complete meatless Thanksgiving meal of hors d'oeuvres, soup, vegetables and 
macrobiotic "turkey" for $29. 
</P>
<P>
 Openings: Sonora Cafe reopened at its new location on Wednesday. After 
unsuccessfully trying to negotiate a new lease with his downtown landlord, 
owner Ron Salisbury took over what once was City Restaurant on La Brea and 
completely gutted the space. "I don't usually get excited about things," 
Salisbury says, "but I think it turned out wonderful." . . . El Gallo Giro has 
cloned itself in City of Commerce. The Mexican mini-chain features tacos, 
tamales and tortas, all made from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Vic's Restaurant Group, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this 
year, plans to go casual and inexpensive with a series of Island Bistro 
restaurants in various parts of the country. The family-style chain will 
feature a blend of French, Creole and Asian cuisine.

THEATER BEAT: 'RADIO HOUR' DIALS UP A DIFFERENT ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can hear the blizzard howling just outside the walls of Tim Farmer's 
superbly realized set of a New York radio station. Inside, however, we're snug, 
warm and completely entertained as an impressive corps of troopers belts, 
croons and harmonizes its way through the big-band standards of the day -- Dec. 
21, 1942, to be exact. In Walton Jones' "The 1940's Radio Hour," the cast of a 
popular, long-running radio show gathers for its weekly live broadcast. It's 
hard to imagine more perfect holiday entertainment than this. 
</P>
<P>
 The blizzard isn't the only thing that's raging outside. For more than a year, 
the United States has been battling the Big One. Other than the speciously 
patriotic advertising jingles scattered throughout the broadcast, the sounds of 
war have remained muffled in this soundproofed radio studio. It's only when 
band member Biff Baker (Keith Allen Burns), dapper in his uniform, announces 
that he's shipping out tomorrow that a tear runs down the cheek and a shiver 
down the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Miller heads a dynamite mini-orchestra that provides the musical texture 
of a much larger band. David Schall's wonderfully dapper emcee is the core of 
this corps. Perry Stephens plays a heartthrob crooner whose bedroom eyes are 
the windows to a disillusioned soul. Antic funnyman William Akey is the best 
first banana since Lou Costello. The superb cast -- which includes Ken Strong, 
Welborn Ferrene, Gus Corrado, Julietta Marcelli, Rachel Sheppard, Thomas 
Hillmann, Lori Berg and Linda Kerns -- enfolds us in a familial warmth we are 
reluctant to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from its recent success with "Into the Woods," the Actors Co-op has 
topped itself admirably. Director Alan Johnson has constructed a snappy 
Christmas cracker of a show, tickets for which should be a requisite stocking 
stuffer. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The 1940's Radio Hour," Actors Co-op at the Crossley Theatre, 1760 N. 
Gower, Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Dark 
Thanksgiving. Ends Dec. 18. $15. (213) 964-3586. Running time: 2 hours, 23 
minutes. Sweet Misfits of 'Life in the Trees' 
</P>
<P>
 An amusing exegesis of urban Angst , "Life in the Trees" places Catherine 
Butterfield among the premier ranks of disaffected playwrights whose humor 
derives from endearingly neurotic characters ravaged by the killing stress of 
big-city life. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Woody Allen school of writing. And while Butterfield might not be 
as intellectually lambent as Allen at his peak, she's more life-affirming.  
</P>
<P>
 "Chemistry," the centerpiece of this triptych of one-acts at the Melrose 
Theatre, proves that where sexual chemistry flares, logic fails to follow. The 
prickly Carolyn (Kaitlin Hopkins) spurns her decent, eminently eligible 
neighbor Hugh (Harry Victor) in favor of his cad of a roommate Zach (Patrick 
Warburton). Carolyn may think that she's a sensible sort, but her hormones are 
leading her into disaster as surely as the doomed movie heroine blundering into 
a spooky basement when we know monsters are about. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Problem," the opening salvo, features Suanne Spoke as the marvelously 
twitchy, tormented Paula, a would-be actress who has a disastrous lunch date 
with her former group therapy intimate Terry (Nancy Morgan), now an obnoxiously 
yuppified gallery owner. Paula might be a mess, but it is actually the rigidly 
perfectionistic Terry who hovers on the brink of a breakdown, as we discover in 
an O. Henry surprise ending. 
</P>
<P>
 The closer, "The Last Time I Saw Timmy Boggs," about the unlikely romance 
between two directionless singles, once again illustrates Butterfield's point 
that society's successes often rise to the top by jettisoning their humanity, 
while society's misfits founder under the weight of their own compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor, Kaitlin and Warburton are standouts among the uniformly fine 
performers in these respective plays, all of which have been directed with 
distinctive wryness by Mary Lou Belli. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed be Butterfield's sweet misfits, for in the midst of urban hell, they 
will inherit our laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Life in the Trees," Melrose Theatre, 733 N. Seward St., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Dark Thanksgiving. Ends Dec. 11. 
$15-$18. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. The Burlesque of 
'Is This Your Life?' 
</P>
<P>
 A parody of the popular old television show "This Is Your Life," "Is This Your 
Life?" dares to be corny -- to a fault. Fortunately, the laughs outstrip the 
groans in this new musical by Ron Abel and Chuck Steffan at the Zephyr Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel and Steffan realize ya gotta have a gimmick -- and the gimmick here is 
that a different member of the audience is chosen nightly as the "honoree" 
whose "life story" will be told during the course of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Abel, the show is firmly rooted in low burlesque, complete with a 
steamy strip number. Antony Alda, David Engel, Cady Huffman and Peggy Mannix 
portray more outrageous characters than you can shake a shtick at, some 
genuinely uproarious, some just plain over-the-top. Bombastic master of 
ceremonies Henry Polic II keeps the action rolling faultlessly -- off the cuff 
and by the seat of his well-tailored pants. 
</P>
<P>
 A veritable steamroller of a production, "Is This Your Life?" can be 
crushingly funny -- if you are fond of juggernauts. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Is This Your Life?," Zephyr Theatre, 7456 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. 
Mondays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Dec. 7. $20. (213) 660-8587.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; BLACK WRITERS GET A NEW FORUM FOR AUDIO BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black writers are woefully underrepresented in the audio book business. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Renee Leggett, director of marketing for Juneteenth Audio Books, 
of the tens of thousands of audio books on the market, only about 200 are by 
black authors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pitiful," Leggett said about an industry that grosses more than $1 
billion a year. But rather than sit around and gripe about the situation, she 
went out this year and, with partner Steven Williams and the financial backing 
of Time Warner, founded Juneteenth to put out audio books by black authors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a desperate need in this business for a company like 
Juneteenth," said Fran Morrill, marketing director for Heller Audio Books, a 
three-chain retail outlet in New York City. "They're doing a really good job in 
filling the void. I can tell from the response of our customers. They're 
committed and they're putting out good titles." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do so few black writers make it to tape? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're up against the stereotype that says black people don't read, black 
people aren't interested in literature, so there's no market and no demand," 
Leggett replied. "We don't buy that." But there are other reasons too, she 
added. For one thing, there are fewer books published by African American 
authors than white authors, so there will naturally be fewer audio books by 
black authors. And audio book publishers maintain that fewer blacks go into 
mainstream book stores, which are the big outlets for audio books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these obstacles deterred the Juneteenth founders. Their first releases 
are Susan Taylor's "In the Spirit," Bebe Moore Campbell's "Your Blues Ain't 
Like Mine" and Tina McElroy's "Ugly Ways." Ernest Gaines' "A Lesson Before 
Dying" is due out by the end of the year. (These are all abridged versions -- 
two-cassette packages that run about three hours and are priced at $20 each.) 
</P>
<P>
 Juneteenth is relying on Time Warner's clout to help get the tapes into book 
stores, but it also hopes to build a strong mail-order market. (Information: 
(800) 830-8088). 
</P>
<P>
 Leggett said Juneteenth plans to cover a wide area -- fiction, nonfiction, 
children's books and classics -- and will put out about 8-10 titles a year. 
Music Videos 
</P>
<P>
 If you couldn't get tickets to the Stones concert, you can get plenty of 
satisfaction from "The Rolling Stones: Live-Voodoo Lounge Tour," a 90-minute, 
17-song tape shot last August at a New Jersey stadium show. Available by 
mail-order only, from Brockum Global Merchandising, at $20; (800) 947-7868.

Epic's "Live Concert Home Video" is priced at $20. Special Interest 
</P>

necessary tools. From Wehman Video, the half-hour tape is $30; (800) 659-1553. 
What's New 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed" (FoxVideo): A mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) terrorizes Los Angeles and is 
tracked by a crafty cop (Keanu Reeves) who engineers some hair-raising escapes 
from several bomb threats. In the most heralded sequence, a bus races through 
town, driven by a passenger (Sandra Bullock) who's trying to keep it from 
dropping below a certain speed, which would activate a hidden bomb. This 
thrilling movie belongs in the action-suspense Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wyatt Earp" (Warner); This 191-minute, two-cassette biography of the famous 
lawman (Kevin Costner) has an impressively realistic look. It's fine as history 
but, if you were expecting a gritty action Western, skip this one. A very, very 
slow movie that plays better on video, because you can watch it in segments. 
Seeing it in one sitting is a chore. As Doc Holliday, Dennis Quaid does the 
best acting in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a Man Loves a Woman" (Touchstone): A housewife (Meg Ryan) with a 
seemingly ideal marriage is an alcoholic who winds up in rehab. The premise, 
that her devoted, nice-guy husband (Andy Garcia) is an unwitting "enabler," is 
hard to swallow. A fair melodrama weighed down by some shameless tear-jerker 
sequences.  
</P>
<P>
 "Beverly Hills Cop III" (Paramount): Eddie Murphy returns as Detroit cop Axel 
Foley, who's on another investigation in Los Angeles, this time checking out 
the crooked activities at a theme park called WonderWorld. There's a thrilling 
shootout at the park but not much comedy, and Murphy is not as spirited as he 
was in the original. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Entertainment III" (MGM/UA): Another compilation of clips from 
Hollywood musicals. Since all the best sequences were used in the first two, 
this one resorts to oddball moments and outtakes. Not as much fun as the first 
two, of course, but still a delight for hard-core fans of musicals. The best 
sequences feature Esther Williams, Fred Astaire and Judy Garland.

DON SCHANCHE; TIMES FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Schanche, a retired Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent who was one of 
the most widely traveled and highly regarded journalists of his time, died 
Thursday of cancer at his home in Key Biscayne, Fla. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Schanche came to The Times in 1976 from a distinguished career as a magazine 
editor and writer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reporter for Life magazine and later as an editor and writer for the 
Saturday Evening Post and Holiday, and as a free-lance writer, Schanche 
crisscrossed the globe, diving for treasure in Bermuda, trekking with Laotian 
hill tribesmen, sailing on the first underwater crossing of the Atlantic aboard 
the U.S. nuclear submarine Skate. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Life, Schanche was ghost writer for the Mercury astronauts who 
charted America's path into space. As a free-lance writer, he was Saul Kapel 
MD, author of a syndicated newspaper column on child psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 15 years of his professional life, Schanche served as Times bureau 
chief in Cairo, Rome and Miami, from which he covered, respectively, the Middle 
East, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Schanche chronicled turmoil in Iran -- the fall of the Shah and the rise of 
Ayatollah Khomeini -- the civil war in Lebanon, war between factions of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and the assassination of Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat. 
</P>
<P>
 Schanche, whose first foreign post was as a 25-year-old Korean War 
correspondent for the International News Service, was an inveterate -- and 
irreverent -- student of human nature: "I never met a truly evil man who was 
not also a charming son of a bitch," he observed recently. 
</P>
<P>
 From Rome, he covered the attempted 1981 assassination of Pope John Paul II, 
and reported from 66 countries on 29 trips with the Pope across 250,000 miles.  
</P>
<P>
 To colleagues, Schanche's insouciance -- he was unflappable in the face of 
destruction, death and deadline -- was one of his most remarkable traits. He 
was legendary for his aplomb under fire. Breakfasting by the pool at Beirut's 
Hotel Commodore after a mortar attack one morning, Schanche politely complained 
to the waiter that there was shrapnel in his eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Schanche, who had been an inveterate smoker, was diagnosed with lung 
cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, he was found to have inoperable pancreatic cancer, a 
terminal illness he endured with grace. One recent day in Miami, while a 
particularly colorless specialist earnestly poked him, Schanche asked, "Tell 
me, doctor, will I keep my sense of humor until the end?" He did. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Arthur Schanche was born in New Brunswick, N.J., of Norwegian stock on 
May 26, 1926. He grew up outside Atlanta where, as a seventh-grader, he met 
Marybelle Waddington. They were married on Jan. 7, 1952, in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Schanche attended Georgia Tech and the University of Miami, and graduated from 
the University of Georgia with a degree in journalism in 1950. During World War 
II he served in the U.S. Navy as radioman with a P.T. boat squadron in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 His six books include "Mister Pop: The Adventures of a Peaceful Man in a Small 
War," about an Indiana farmer who went to Laos as an agricultural adviser and 
found himself drawn into conflict, and "The Panther Paradox: A Liberal's 
Dilemma," about Eldridge Cleaver and the Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schanche is survived by his wife; a son, Donald A. Jr., city editor of the 
Union-Recorder in Milledgeville, Ga; two daughters, Didrikke (Didi) 
Schanche-Shields, an Associated Press correspondent in Nicosia, Cyprus, and 
Anne Schanche Ferro, an associate administrator of the Motor Vehicle 
Administration of Maryland; a brother, Norman Dean Schanche, a retired Army 
colonel, of Severna Park, Md., and six grandchildren.

 Saigon Duck: If you're having trouble making reservations at Wolfgang Puck's 
famous eatery in West Hollywood, you'll soon have an alternative -- in Ho Chi 
Minh City. A restaurant named Spago, filled with paintings of Hollywood stars 
such as Marilyn Monroe, is being erected on busy Dong Khoi Street. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which comes as news to Puck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear of people using our name from time to time," said Tom Kaplan, one of 
Puck's partners. "It's happened in several countries -- Germany, France, Canada 
and Sweden, to name a few. But it's difficult to do anything about it because 
the laws differ and it might wind up costing you a tremendous amount of money." 
</P>

 From dueling Spagos to dueling Elvi: The Flying Elvi are suing the Flying 
Elvises over who has the right to don costumes of the King and dive out of 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Feeney, manager of the Flying Elvi, claims he came up with the 
marketing concept prior to 1990 -- before the Flying Elvises were formed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elvises member Mark Miscevic contends in a suit filed in Las Vegas that 
the producers of the 1992 movie "Honeymoon in Vegas" originated the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elvises say the Elvi do not have the permission of Presley's estate. The 
Elvi contend that the estate owns no rights in this case "because during his 
lifetime, Elvis Presley did not perform as a sky diver." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the picture is the fact that some Elvises were previously Elvi. 
Or is it the other way around? Sorry, we're sort of lost in space.

star had been caught robbing a bank . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 We never got our day in court: When the L.A. Trial Lawyers Assn. announced 
that it was searching for a new name to enhance its image, we appealed to 
readers to help out. Eventually, we recommended the entry of Tom and Lisa 
Burkdall, who suggested the appropriately solemn title, Earnest Attorneys 
Trying in Los Angeles (EATLA, for short).

REP. ARCHER ON POOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) suggests placing children of the indigent in foster 
care (Nov. 11). Doesn't he realize that this would merely shift the taxpayer 
"burden" of caring for these children from one government agency to another? 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that he and his fellow Republicans take a serious look at "A Modest 
Proposal" satirically offered by Jonathan Swift in the 18th Century -- leave 
the poor out in the cold to starve and sell their young children to the wealthy 
as a source of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer could, like Swift, claim that this plan would promote "the public good" 
and would no doubt find great support among today's electorate.

irresponsible to find jobs.

</P>
<P>
 I'm all for cutting down on waste, but the Republicans are targeting the wrong 
folks: The poor and indigent don't have much money, nor do they get much from 
the government as a percentage of the overall budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The real "welfare problems" include farmers in the Midwest that are paid to 
not grow produce; agribusinesses in California's San Joaquin Valley whose water 
is so heavily subsidized that they pay 5% by volume what urban users pay, and 
miners and ranchers who basically freeload on our public lands, paying pennies 
an acre in rent.

under this plan?

HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's always distressing to learn of women being harassed, no less so in the 
case of women athletes ("Female Volleyball Stars Play in Fear," Nov. 7). Before 
now I have wondered why, with professional volleyball's advent into greater 
legitimacy, increased coverage and ever-larger numbers of fans, the women 
players continue to wear swimwear in tournaments.After all, this is a 
professional sport, not an advertisement for beach gear. 
</P>
<P>
 In a better-functioning society, women as well as men should have the freedom 
to wear anything that does not detract from their performance. Unfortunately in 
present times there are just too many kooks at large. The objectification of 
women's bodies -- any women's bodies -- can translate into a threat against the 
personal safety of all women.

SOUNDS AS IF HE'S DOING HIS JOB

 It was predictable that lawsuits would be filed to challenge the 
voter-approved Proposition 187, the measure designed to bar many services to 
illegal immigrants. It was also predictable that some of the measure's 
supporters would be as eager for the court battles as the opponents. But eight 
challenge lawsuits have been filed so far in federal and state courts. That's a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the Los Angeles Unified School District's participation in a state court 
challenge amount to such an unnecessary piling on that it is basically a misuse 
of local tax dollars? Does it warrant a recall election effort against school 
board President Mark Slavkin? The answer, on both counts, is probably no. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin and the school district make the point that city schools have a huge 
financialinterest in the 187 situation. Proposition 187 requires schools to 
report suspected illegal immigrants. The courts must determine whether that 
violates the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, which generally 
prohibits schools that receive federal funds from disclosing information in 
student records without parental consent. At stake, Slavkin says, is $628 
million in federal funds. The legal action, called a complaint, also cites the 
California Supreme Court decision in Butt vs. California, which held that there 
is a fundamental right to a public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, from Slavkin's perspective it can be argued that it would have been 
irresponsible for the state's largest school district to not have sought 
immediate legal clarification on what parts of Proposition 187 would violate 
federal and state law and thus jeopardize funding. That does not sound to us 
like a misuse of local tax dollars, or like reasonable grounds to recall 
Slavkin. Supporters of 187 need to be reasonable and recognize that Slavkin is 
not trying to undermine the will of the 59% who voted for it. He is just trying 
to do his job.

STOCKTON'S BIG BANG THEORY; GIVE EVERYONE A GUN AND RUN FOR COVER, FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, Stockton experienced unspeakable tragedy when a deranged 
drifter showered gunfire from an AK-47 assault rifle on children on an 
elementary school playground. That horror, in which five youngsters were killed 
and 29 others were wounded, became the impetus for California's landmark 1989 
assault weapons ban and a recent federal prohibition against the manufacture 
and sale of certain military-style semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a cruel paradox, Stockton's City Council is considering a wrongheaded 
and dangerous measure that encourages firearms proliferation and directly 
imperils public safety. It would force the police chief, who opposes the 
measure, to issue concealed weapons permits to nearly all of the city's adult 
residents who requested them. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with "good moral character," no felony convictions and not judged 
mentally infirm under state law would be eligible to carry a firearm hidden on 
their person or in their vehicle anywhere in California anytime. 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates that would put CCW (carrying concealed weapons) permits in 
the hands of as many as 130,000 Stockton residents. Proponents, including the 
National Rifle Assn., say that would promote safety. But how could it? 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton has reduced crime by 5.5% by adding more police officers. It should 
be proud of that, and build on it. Letting so many citizens carry pistols would 
undo what the town has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Pistol packers would include many who, though "law-abiding," lacked the depth 
of training and mind-set to safely bear a firearm in a public setting. All in 
all, it's a severe threat to law enforcement officials. Not to mention anyone 
else nearby -- armed or otherwise -- when the inevitable gunplay begins. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for good reason that Old West marshals seeking to cleaned up lawless 
towns required people to check in their side arms. Today, good reason dictates 
that CCW permits be given only to the few individuals who can demonstrate a 
true need. As for Stockton, it would do itself and California a great service 
by rejecting this dangerous proposal.

IT'S A NATURAL FOR REPUBLICANS; FREE TRADE . . . DOES GOP WANT TO FIGHT THAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free trade is one of the oldest ideas in the books, but now its time finally 
may have come. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year President Clinton lobbied for congressional passage of the historic 
North American Free Trade Agreement. Congress, which never should have been so 
difficult on an issue so clearly in the national interest, grudgingly came 
through. Now Congress bodes to be difficult again on another free-trade issue 
-- the complex but vitally important General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
That passage is in some doubt is a commentary on how partisan and ridiculous 
Washington has become. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT, as it is called, is a titanic international treaty that now only needs 
to be approved by all the signatory nations to begin to lower trade import 
taxes on a variety of goods from around the world. The treaty would lower the 
cost of many imported goods gradually but steadily. For good reason Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) says that for the average American, GATT would 
represent the largest tax cut ever; because it would reduce U.S. import taxes 
on goods, consumer prices on many foreign articles would decline. 
</P>
<P>
 But GATT's passage is now in doubt, especially in the Senate, where Ernest F. 
Hollings (D-S.C.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) are doing sentry duty for various 
domestic U.S. protectionist interests. Helms, who is to become chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has even threatened to hold all sorts of 
Clinton Administration business hostage if the GATT vote is not postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton should stand up to Helms, and so should the senator's Republican 
colleagues. The GOP historically has been a signal champion of free trade. To 
retreat from that valuable economic philosophy now would be shameful treachery, 
done solely for partisan purposes: to embarrass the Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that every single aspect of GATT is unblemished. The 
disciplinary proceedings of the powerful World Trade Organization, to be 
created under GATT to monitor member compliance with all the mandated 
tariff-reducing, should be open to the press, not closed; this needs to be 
addressed. And here or there, individual member-state problems need more work. 
</P>

 But the totality of GATT, achieved after more than a decade of talks, is 
extraordinary. It moves the planet further from the bleak world of closed-door 
trading blocs and economically inefficient commerce. Now, thanks to the 
prodigious efforts of gifted American trade negotiators such as Carla Anderson 
Hills (under President George Bush) and Mickey Kantor (under Clinton), this 
jewel is all but a done deal. Thus Congress should approve the agreement in 
showdown votes that will come soon and not risk making itself the laughingstock 
of the world.

 Re "Eastin Strikes Conciliatory Note," Nov. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 How strange. Jean Merl points out that Maureen DiMarco, the loser for 
superintendent of public instruction, will continue in her appointed office as 
Gov. Pete Wilson's education policy adviser along with the Wilson-appointed 
State Board of Education; and it is the elected winner, Delaine Eastin, who 
will be expected to "seek compromise."Appointees have more clout than elected 
officials? Why?! 
</P>
<P>
 Why should someone elected to office by about the same percentage of votes 
(56%) as the governor (55%) have to seek compromise with a group of appointees 
on whom voters had no say? The one appointee the voters could vote on -- 
DiMarco -- was defeated. Surely Wilson is looking for a different education 
policy adviser -- the voters don't want this one. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope he will act on this call for change as quickly as he acted to implement 
Proposition 187. Voters look for consistency in thinking and behavior. 
Presidential hopefuls might do well to keep that in mind.

CRIME WATCH; HOLDUP AT PEN POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An old saying has it that you can steal more with a pen than a gun. Now a new 
study for the U.S. Justice Department shows that you're likely to spend much 
less time behind bars, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Two UC Irvine criminology professors and a sociology professor from St. John's 
University in New York examined fraud in the savings and loan industry, in 
which the collapse of dozens of institutions in the 1980s resulted in well over 
$100 billion in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the average prison term for those convicted of major crimes related 
to savings and loans was 36.4 months. The average burglar spent 55.6 months in 
prison and the average car thief 38 months, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the outrage is the fact that although the crimes cost S&Ls more 
than $8 billion that year, judges imposed fines and restitution orders of less 
than $348 million. The study said far less than that ended up being collected. 
The findings mock the nation's commitment to equal justice under the law, and 
foster cynicism about white-collar crimes and the willingness of prosecutors to 
pursue them vigorously. The Justice Department should direct federal 
prosecutors to seek stiffer sentences from judges and take a closer look at 
plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes may be nonviolent, but they do victimize. Taxpayers must cover the 
insured losses of the savings and loans. Some bank customers were not protected 
by insurance and wound up impoverished. Prosecutors need to get tougher and 
judges need to crack down on crime in the suites as surely as in the streets.

NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is one thing I am certain of: If I am still alive in 1996, I will unplug 
my television, stack away my radio and cancel my newspaper subscriptions. I 
cannot go through another election year -- eight or nine months of campaign 
mudslinging! 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Thatcher had the right idea -- limit campaigning to three weeks 
before an election! Couldn't we at least limit it to one month before the 
primary and one month before the general election? 
</P>

<P>
 * We currently have laws banning television advertising which is felt to be 
not in the public interest or harmful to society. Tobacco and liquor are the 
obvious examples. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe a solution to the current despicable use of television and radio by 
those running for office or promoting propositions -- and a way to curb the 
obscene amount of money being spent on elections -- is to ban political 
advertising from the electronic media. Such a ban would eliminate a huge amount 
of information distortion, and help stop the current hijacking of the election 
process by 30-second spots. Who knows, it might even encourage people to work a 
little harder to learn about candidates and issues. 
</P>
<P>
 I also think laws requiring candidates to hold a minimum number of 
face-to-face debates when running for office would be helpful to voters and 
useful to force candidates to discuss issues, not accusations.

 * I have two ideas that will improve the next election campaign. First, permit 
campaign contributions only from people registered to vote for the candidate. 
In the primary that means if you are a registered Republican or Democrat, you 
can only contribute to candidates in your party. If you are registered as an 
independent, you can donate only to candidates running as independents. That 
would be the end of PACs, the Hollywood left, the religious right and the 
political powerbrokers. If you can't vote for the candidate, you can't 
contribute either. The second idea concerns the content of campaign 
advertisements. Every word spoken on a TV spot, or printed on the TV screen, 
must be spoken, on camera, by the candidate and the mouth must be visible! I 
have the feeling that a lot that was said in the past elections would not have 
been said if the candidate had to say it, with his or her face in full view. 
Every sign, bumper sticker, billboard and all literature sent by mail, must 
contain the candidate's picture large enough to be recognized at a distance.  
</P>
<P>

 * When children can be denied education, when the sick can be denied health 
care, when candidates campaign on who is the greater immigrant-hater and 
compete over which one is more enamored of executions, and the public votes 
based on these "issues," we are truly in a quagmire from which we may never 
extricate ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 We're undertaxed, catered-to whiners, resisting necessary taxes, scared and/or 
unwilling to face tough solutions, yet demanding panaceas; flailing in 
desperation to the Republicans, our saviors, forgetting that their pandering 
policies created our economic mess and that their tired "law and order" 
rhetoric has accomplished zero. 
</P>
<P>
 That a lying, posturing, self-aggrandizing hypocrite like Mike Huffington can 
almost buy a Senate seat illustrates the awesome gullibility of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 As so presciently stated by H.L. Mencken: "No one ever lost a plugged nickel 
underestimating the intelligence of the American public."

made the following observation. The most noticeable difference between 
Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats accept defeat with dignity and vow 
to work for change. Republicans never accept defeat and vow revenge.

PERSPECTIVE ON RACISM; WE BELIEVE WHAT WE WANT ; MAKING 'THE BELL CURVE' A 
TOPIC OF SERIOUS CRITICISM SUGGESTS THAT ITS 'BLACK INFERIORITY' THEME IS 
WORTHY OF REBUTTAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. RICHARD BANKS, R. Richard Banks is a San Francisco-based lawyer and 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate generated by Charles Murray's and Richard Herrnstein's "The Bell 
Curve" -- and the book's astounding commercial success -- tell more about our 
society than any arguments Murray and Herrnstein offer. 
</P>
<P>
 That this book has elicited such serious discussion -- even among those who 
steadfastly oppose its claims -- demonstrates that we have yet to shake off the 
heaviest psychological shackle bequeathed to us: the assumption of black 
inferiority which, in turn, provides an explanation or, worse yet, 
justification for the wretched condition of so many black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 However much Murray and Herrnstein dress up their contention in dense prose, 
complex statistical analysis, or reasoning that only indirectly points to race, 
the fact remains that such arguments find open ears only because of the 
persistence of American society's tenet of black inferiority. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoting any attention to the substance of Murray and Herrnstein's arguments 
legitimizes them. The attention lavished on their book -- from the pages of the 
New Republic and the New York Review of Books to Newsweek and Time magazines -- 
suggests that while Murray and Herrnstein may not have it all right, there is 
something to talk about, perhaps an area within which reasonable people, as the 
saying goes, can differ. President Clinton expressed this same attitude when, 
after being asked about the book at a news conference, he thoughtfully stated 
that he "disagreed" with their conclusions, suggesting that the matter is up 
for debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, many, if not most, commentators have harshly critiqued "The Bell 
Curve" and rejected its racist implications. Yet even complete refutation, 
requiring an airing of the ideas, implicitly legitimizes the authors' 
assertions. If we didn't already accept the possibility of black inferiority, 
no one would need expend the energy or time necessary to refute the type of 
theories Murray and Herrnstein put forth. 
</P>
<P>
 While we remain resistant to viewing assertions of black inferiority as beyond 
the pale, similarly ridiculous arguments about other groups we acknowledge for 
what they are. When Leonard Jeffries talks about white, war-mongering "ice 
people" and loving, melanin-rich "sun people," no one unfurls the banner of 
unfettered discourse to consider the theory's validity. And when, as 
occasionally happens, some lunatic group condemns "evil Jews" as having brought 
the Holocaust upon themselves through their shrewd manipulations of the 
European economy (or, conversely, claims that the Holocaust never happened), no 
right-thinking person accepts that the claim is valid. The preposterous nature 
of these arguments places them beyond the need to be disproved. 
</P>
<P>
 Such contentions are discussed only as a means of examining social context. 
Jeffries' arguments may be used to examine the rise of Afro-centrism on college 
campuses, the evil-Jew theories to open a window into the mind of an 
anti-Semite. But neither is taken seriously as a potentially insightful 
observation about whites or Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Murray and Herrnstein provide ample evidence in support of their 
conclusions. How could one dismiss "The Bell Curve" when its authors marshal 
such voluminous data? 
</P>
<P>
 Were one predisposed to see whites as mean-spirited "ice people" or Jews as 
money-hungry troublemakers, "evidence" could be found to support that belief as 
well. (After all, didn't the "ice people" start two world wars and aren't the 
Jewish people inordinately successful in high finance?) We believe what we are 
inclined to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with black intellectual ability. For all that earnest debate, Murray 
and Herrnstein haven't told us anything new. They've simply given us permission 
to engage an idea whose hold we have never shaken -- and whose attractiveness 
we remain unwilling to admit.

ONE GURU'S INTERPRETATION: HOT AND COLD RUNNING GOVERNMENT; ELECTION '94: THINK 
OF IT AS A COURSE CORRECTION BEFORE THE BOAT TIPPED PORTWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN STONEHILL, Brian Stonehill directs the media studies program at Pomona

<P>
 After the Republican landslide Nov. 8, I climbed Mt. Wilson to visit my guru, 
hoping to find out what it all means. My guru calls himself Avie (pronounced 
like A/V, as in audio/visual), and he lives like a monk in an unmarked control 
booth up there where all the Los Angeles television stations have their 
broadcast antennas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Avie," I gasped (a little winded by the climb), "What's it all mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bearded little man turned his large dark eyes upon me, a trifle annoyed, 
it seemed to me, to be interrupted in his meditation over what looked like a 
rerun of "Gilligan's Island" on the KTLA monitor on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does what mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The election results," I said. "The country's sudden lurch to the Republican 
side of the aisle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Left foot, right foot," uttered my guru. "Left foot, right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "All cultures advance by swinging from side to side off their center of 
gravity, just the way a two-legged creature walks."  
</P>
<P>
 "But," I pursued, "isn't there any hope of sticking with a single path of 
wisdom?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Look at your brain," said Avie, doing the typical guru thing by asking the 
impossible. "Your brain has two hemispheres, and from them you look at the 
world from two different sides. Every system that humans make re-creates that 
same two-sided pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 "It does?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. How many political parties do you have?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, two, basically but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Avie cut me off. "How many chambers in Congress?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Two, but I don't see . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "How many teams compete in a football or basketball or baseball game, or how 
many opponents in a tennis match?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Two, but I still don't see what all that has to do with why the voters 
abandoned the Democratic Party and gave the Republicans a majority in both 
houses for the first time in half a century." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you can't hop as far on one foot as you can stride by swinging from 
one foot to the other," said Avie, cloaking himself in that guru-speak again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," I said, "my feet are tired. Could we try another metaphor?" 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," he said. "How many different kinds of water come into your sink?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, two, hot and cold." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes! But how many kinds of water come into your house?" 
</P>
<P>
 This took a second's thought. "Just the cold water. The hot water gets made by 
the heater in the garage." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the two ways. The two ways of your brain, the two ways of the 
political system everywhere: the individual and the group. The cold water and 
the hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "To use your language," Avie went on, "the Democrats believe in the cold water 
system: a centralized system that delivers to everybody. The Republicans 
believe in the hot water system: everyone should heat his or her own water." 
</P>
<P>
 "But which one is right?" I demanded.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you see?" said my guru. "They're both right. It makes sense to have a 
centralized cold-water system, because you can't have a well under every house 
in every town. And it makes sense to have decentralized water heating, so you 
don't lose all that heat moving the hot water from place to place." 
</P>
<P>
 I was starting to get it, but something was still bothering me. "So you're 
saying the Democrats are right for some things, because some things, like cold 
water, make sense as a collective activity. And the Republicans are right for 
other things, meaning the ones that make more sense if they're handled by the 
individual. So when they're arguing about health care, say, or gun control or 
even taxes, it's really an argument about whether the individual's rights or 
the society's interests should come first. OK, OK, I see that." 
</P>
<P>
 "So what's bothering you?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Then why did we vote out nearly all the Democrats who were running, and vote 
in nearly all the Republicans? Shouldn't we have tried to keep a balance, so 
that we'd get a proper mix of policies?" I was tempted to say something about 
needing to avoid the bathtub extremes of scalding or chilling ourselves, but I 
didn't want to overdo Avie's own metaphor.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are different ways to fill a tub," he said. "You don't have to run the 
hot and cold simultaneously," he explained. "You can run the hot for a while, 
and then the cold, and then some more hot. That's what's going on now. And 
that's why I said, 'Left foot, right foot.' You can't go very far or very fast 
if you're picking up both feet and putting them down at the same time. That's 
called a potato sack race." Here he started chuckling.  
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," Avie said, "your President is still on the left even though you'll 
have a Congress on the right. Remember how under Reagan and Bush, you had a 
Congress that balanced the right-wing White House policies with a left-wing 
correction? The system knows how to steer itself," he said, turning back to his 
TVs. "Even a sailboat has to tack from side to side to get where it wants to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Great. Another watery metaphor to ponder as I zigzagged my way down the 
mountain, back toward the hot tubs of the Los Angeles Basin.

DANCE REVIEW; GRIGOROVICH BY ANY OTHER NAME STILL HAS RUSSIAN FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by confusing ads and announcements, many local balletomanes believe 
the Moscow Grigorovich Ballet is really the Bolshoi in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Not nearly, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that danced "The Nutcracker" Wednesday at the Cerritos Center for 
the Performing Arts (with a Pasadena "Swan Lake" scheduled next week) 
represents something like a Bolshoi farm team: youthful trainees gathering 
experience in the choreography of Bolshoi artistic director Yuri Grigorovich. 
They are not members of the Bolshoi Ballet, nor are they technically and 
expressively seasoned enough to camouflage the weaknesses in Grigorovich's 
joyless, Soviet-era version. However, they do bring exemplary Russian training 
to their assignments as well as great freshness. And if adult dancers must play 
children in the Act 1 party scene (as they do here), the younger the adults the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced to taped Tchaikovsky, this "Nutcracker" begins as a festival of false 
noises and stale character-dance parodies of bourgeois manners. (Remember 
Communism?) There's no mystery to Oleg Dedogriuk's buoyant Drosselmeyer, no 
innocence to Elena Kniazkova's proud Marie (named Clara in most American 
versions). However, Kniazkova's technique proves undeniably impressive even if 
she seems essentially a bravura dancer miscast in a role demanding softness and 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 The ineptly staged Mouse battle introduces the forceful Maxim Knysh as the 
Mouse King and the technically uneven, easily winded Dimitri Tuboltsev as the 
Nutcracker Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the snow and flower corps look ragged, and the great Waltzes for them so 
deadly in choreographic spirit and invention that you have to keep whispering 
the words "Kevin McKenzie" to remind yourself that it could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinterpreted as a suite of doll dances, the Candyland divertissement requires 
all the skill and charm the young company can muster. And the dancers do rise 
to the occasion, looking happy and well coached. The Spanish and Russian 
segments feature, respectively, the commanding Tatiana Ledovskikh and the 
winsome Maria Mosina, dancers listed to play Marie at other, unspecified 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Simon Virsaladze offers postcard prettiness in his Act 1 set designs 
but no genuine stage magic when the Christmas tree should grow -- only an 
endless projected snowstorm. Act 2 has more special effects but a highly 
unappealing backdrop executed mostly in tones of mildewed silver. 
</P>
<P>
 As an incubator for Russian stars of the future, and in presenting the first 
"Nutcracker" of the season, the Moscow Grigorovich Ballet has time on its side. 
Other companies will presume on the public's Christmas spirit in the Southland 
this year. But few others will grant us glimpses of a fabled classical style 
that, even in decline, remains superbly majestic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moscow Grigorovich Ballet dances "The Nutcracker" tonight, Saturday and 
Sunday at 8 p.m., with matinees on Saturday and Sunday at 2. Casting has not 
been announced and may or may not be the same as reviewed here. Tickets: $16 
(children) to $45. The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts is located at 
12700 Center Court Drive. Box office: (310) 916-8500.

THEATER REVIEW; 'LITTLE WOMEN' SEEM UNEASY IN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is it about Louisa May Alcott's huge novel, "Little Women," that keeps 
making it seem attractive to the stage and screen? 
</P>
<P>
 There have been more than a half-dozen Los Angeles-area stage productions in 
recent years, and Gillian Armstrong's film version is about to appear -- the 
fourth since George Cukor's in 1933. For good measure, Westminster Community 
Theatre is weighing in with its own "Little Women," the one adapted by Marian 
De Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what is it? The episodic narrative of the March sisters in the Civil War 
era is not the stuff of high drama. It is instead a reflective, highly 
character-driven series of frames in a tapestry of an American family, 
</P>
<P>
 Jo March is still a terrific model for young women who want to be all that 
they can be, and not a bad heroine either. But Alcott's domestic epic hardly 
fits neatly into Hollywood's three-act story structure or theater's own 
conventions. Good, large novels seldom do. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for more and more "Little Women" comes down to the need to read the 
novel once again, in a different way. De Forest's version is better than a few 
others we've seen, which either got bogged down in too many scenes, or grossly 
simplified Alcott's complex characters. De Forest retains much of Alcott's 
dialogue and is intensely devoted to Jo and her three sisters, with everyone 
else firmly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably the best strategy for a stage edition that hopes to clock in 
at under three hours. More time is saved with voice-over narration (Jo's) that 
compresses and omits long, easily skipped over passages from the book. 
</P>
<P>
 De Forest also immediately helps delineate the foursome: the independent, 
literary Jo (Candice Balish); the nice, conformist Meg (Jennifer Robbins); 
lady-in-training Amy (Monica Welton), and sickly, vulnerable Beth (Julie 
Messina). There's no overly obvious emphasis on Jo, the perfect woman writer's 
alter-ego; instead, a fair hearing is given to all the little women. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, it becomes Jo's story, as she falls for the unlikely older 
man, Prof. Bhaer (Warren Harker). In love with a Schiller scholar -- now that's 
what makes Alcott's book an enduring literary romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it has to fly on stage, regardless of all of De Forest's pruning and 
tidying. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jennifer Boudreau's cast feels uncomfortable with the 19th-Century 
talk and manners. A bad sense of let's-dress-up runs through the production, 
and it tends to trivialize Alcott's and De Forest's work. 
</P>
<P>
 These sisters, for instance, don't sound as though they've lived with each 
other's foibles. The point is that they've learned to live with and love each 
other; here, they're unnaturally commenting on each other as the script 
instructs. It's as if the actors were still rehearsing with script in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins is likable, but doesn't give Meg an identity, while Balish's Jo is too 
cool to let us feel the heat of Jo's passions. Welton has a way to go before 
she theatricalizes Amy's primness, which finally comes through in the end. 
Messina evokes Beth's physical frailty, but not really her tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those background characters are especially so here, since so few actors want 
to take charge. Jesse Swimm does as jolly family friend Laurie, but the March 
parents, played by Marc LeBlanc and Karla Abrams, don't project any sense of 
authority that makes this family survive the national turbulence just outside 
the door. Harker's Bhaer doesn't exactly command our attention, which makes us 
wonder why he commands Jo's. Nancy Noble isn't nearly nasty enough as the 
dreaded Aunt March.

ART REVIEWS; GEORGE HERMS' 'PROJECT X': RUST NEVER SLEEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California assemblage art can be thought of as a long-playing ode to rust. 
Rust is a romantic metaphor for the passing of time. It insinuates the poetry 
of use and the beauty of waste. It has lost a bit of its frisson due to 
overexposure over the years. But George Herms, whose "Project X" is now on view 
at Kohn Turner Gallery, demonstrates that certain materials, like certain 
aesthetics, never die; they merely await reincarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a surfeit of rusty things -- gas cans, silverware, car parts, mattress 
springs, muffin tins, tools and so on -- as well as old pieces of newspaper and 
discarded pieces of clothing that, by proximity, look rusty, too. These 
post-industrial discards are amalgamated into sculptural assemblages, and 
arranged in, on and above grid-like shelves -- one of Herms' favorite modes of 
display, borrowed from surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the most interesting of these assemblages are those that owe the 
greatest debt to surrealism and its attraction to peculiar juxtapositions. 
Among them is a piece titled "Appolinaire," which enshrines a chipped coffee 
cup from a restaurant named after the famous poet and a huge tangle of wire 
suspended from the ceiling like a tumbleweed floating out of a dream, studded 
with a scythe and a piece of melting glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deadbeat allure of individual pieces, the show works best as a 
whole -- as a kind of studio-cum-mindscape. What ties it all together is Herms' 
longtime signature -- the word "LOVE," stamped in capital letters with a 
backward E. "LOVE" shows up in corners, on the undersides of objects, on 
dangling pieces of yellowed paper. This word is a perfect talisman for a man 
who has never allowed his wit to compromise his generosity of spirit, and a 
perfect gift for those viewers willing to pick through the refuse to find it. 
</P>
<P>

Dec. 17. Closed Sunday and Monday.

<P>
 Jokester: In Michael Coughlan's new work at TRI Gallery, profound truths 
masquerade as dumb jokes -- maybe so successfully that when they unveil 
themselves, these truths feel like an intrusion, or a party-pooper's pieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumb jokes are fun, and it is hard not to have fun in the presence of a large, 
papier-mache mountain with glistening soap bubbles spewing from the top and 
popping delicately on their way down to earth. Equally crowd-pleasing is a 
plywood shelf, empty except for three lonely rubber worms, and a few nylon rope 
cobwebs in the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlan, however, wants to offer more than a series of quirky visuals. He 
wants to paint a wry portrait of the artist as callow youth. "Self-Portrait as 
a Small Volcano" thus is about the problem of being full of ideas whose 
transparency is evident to everyone else except you. "Still Life for the Fecund 
Ascetic" is about being cursed with a head so empty that everybody and 
everything -- except the proverbial worms -- have taken a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something winning about the capacity to operate on multiple levels. 
Like that of Dennis Oppenheim, Rebecca Horn and Jack Pierson (an idiosyncratic 
trio, yet all come to mind here), Coughlan's work is both playful and 
conceptually dense. Yet there is a flip side Coughlan must consider as he goes 
for it all. And that is the fact that it is more difficult than it looks to wed 
whimsical form to serious (if self-deprecating) content. This work is very 
promising (the titles alone are quite wonderful), but it still feels 
semi-detached, as if one or the other -- form or content -- would do just as 
nicely as both. 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: AND THEY SAID WORTHY WAS A GREAT FINISHER

 The Lakers should have expected that James Worthy would retire as soon as they 
hired Del Harris as their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Murphy, Rudy Tomjanovich, Jack Sikma and Adrian Dantley all called it 
quits while playing for Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call me 'the Great Retirer,' " Harris said. "Guys look at me and say, 'I 
must be done, I'm playing for Del.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What school was the last from the West Coast to play in the Sugar 
Bowl? Same old Bobby: Penn State's Joe Paterno and Indiana's Bobby Knight got 
together recently and the talk turned to basketball, specifically Paterno's 
ability. Paterno demonstrated his two-hand set shot, then admitted, "I was the 
worst shot." 
</P>
<P>
 To which Knight responded, "Come to my practice in the morning and I'll show 
you someone worse." 
</P>
<P>
 A critique: Norman Chad, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, says he is not a 
fan of returning instant replay to NFL officiating, nor of those who are:  
</P>
<P>
 "Leading the charge (for instant replay) is Skip Bayless, a fellow who runs a 
football newsletter out of the basement of some trailer-park home in Texas, 
talks daily to Cowboy assistant strength coaches and appears on ESPN every 15 
minutes of every NFL weekend, squawking about such critical issues as 
play-clock enforcement. This guy lingers like a bad cold." 
</P>
<P>
 It is different: Pitcher Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies isn't 
sure that William J. Usery is the right man to act as negotiator in the 
baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a guy who's dealt with strikes where people get killed," 
Schilling said. "He's not going to sit and listen to a bunch of millionaires 
who are full of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dial it in: "Laker Legends" is the name of Laker assistant coach Bill Bertka's 
radio show on KLAC and the name fits, mainly because Bertka knows all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his shows featured a long-ago taped interview with Wilt Chamberlain. 
Bertka asked which was better, the 69-13 Laker team that won 33 in a row in 
1971-72 or the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76er team that was 68-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilt, who was on both teams, said it was the 76ers. Anybody going to tell him 
he's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Coordinated: The official magazine of the Charlotte Hornets is called Sting 
and the address of the NBA team is 100 Hive Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Priorities: Ohio State basketball Coach Randy Ayers is a hard man to 
discourage. This year he lost several players, a scholarship and the right to 
recruit off campus because of an NCAA violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked me who I was happiest to see coming back this season," Ayers 
said. "And I said, 'Me!' "

 Bud on button: Tennis commentator Bud Collins scored an ace with his comment 
as Martina Navratilova faced match point in her final match with Gabriela

UCLA NEEDS LATE RALLY TO BEAT PERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA Bruins played like anything but the No. 6 team in the nation Thursday 
night, needing a late second-half rally to defeat Perth, Australia, 81-72, at 
Pauley Pavilion in their first exhibition game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perth, which lost to Pacific on Wednesday night, led at halftime, 38-36, and 
still held a two-point advantage halfway through the second half before UCLA 
pulled away behind the scoring of Ed O'Bannon, who finished with a game-high 22 
points, and Charles O'Bannon, who scored all 13 of his points in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out in the first seven to eight minutes and played very well and then 
we started subbing," said UCLA Coach Jim Harrick. "We tried to play everybody, 
but when you do that you lose some continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who have four starters back from last season along with four 
highly touted freshman, struggled offensively, making 17 turnovers and shooting 
44.3% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 A bright spot for UCLA was the play off the bench of freshmen J.R. Henderson, 
who scored 11 points, and Kris Johnson and Toby Bailey, who each scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Perth was led by former Stanford standout Andrew Vlahov, who scored 19 points 
and grabbed nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed because of two smoke bombs on the UCLA campus. Neither 
was in Pauley Pavilion.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: AUBURN AND ALABAMA WILL BE THE BEST GAME MONEY CAN 
BUY

 Don't you just hate ABC's regional college football coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 ABC gives us USC-UCLA Saturday at 12:30 p.m., which is fine, but 
Auburn-Alabama, the game of the day, nationally anyway, won't be shown here. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither will Oregon-Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least those game are available to most cable subscribers on 
pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy to say something nice about pay-per-view. The word pay right 
away tells you it is not a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of pay-per-view, those wishing to buy one or more of ABC's 
regional telecasts can do so, provided their cable system offers that option. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't tried pay-per-view college football before, be forewarned that 
many systems are limited to one game because of channel capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No question Auburn-Alabama is ABC's main game, so the A team of Keith Jackson 
and Bob Griese will call it, and it will go to about half the country. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is Michigan-Ohio State at 9 a.m. a national telecast and not 
Auburn-Alabama? 
</P>
<P>
 ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said the decision on Michigan-Ohio State was made 
before the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a longtime classic matchup involving teams proven to get high ratings, 
and we locked into that," he said. 
</P>

 Fox invasion, Part II: First, the fledgling network stole the NFL from CBS. 
Now, with its proposed golf tour, it could end up giving CBS' golf package 
minor league status. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, though, CBS has a good golf event this weekend -- the Shark 
Shootout at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's opening round will be on ESPN at 12:30 p.m. Saturday's round will be 
on CBS at 1 p.m., with Sunday's final-round coverage at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcers will be Jim Nantz, Gary McCord, Ben Wright and Verne Lundquist. 
Peter Kostis had to bow out because of an illness in his family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add golf: The Golf Channel, scheduled to launch Jan. 17, announced it will 
award $1 million to the next professional golfer to shoot a 59 or lower. Al 
Geiberger and Chip Beck are the only players to shoot 59 in a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Name change: Beginning Jan. 1, Prime Ticket will become Prime Sports, the same 
as seven other regional sports networks now owned by Liberty Sports, a division 
of TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "For identity purposes, we want all our networks to have the same name," said 
Ed Frazier, the president of Liberty Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kitty Cohen, Prime Ticket's new general manager: "At least people, 
thinking we're a ticket agency, no longer will call us trying to buy concert 
tickets. For the past nine years, a day hasn't gone by without someone calling, 
trying to buy tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Prime: The network's award-winning news show, "Press Box," goes national 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Different editions will go to different Liberty networks across the country 
every hour on the half-hour, beginning at 3:30 PST. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. edition normally will run at 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., wrapped around the 
featured event of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, "Press Box" will be expanded to one hour on weekends, airing at 7 and 10 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket is beefing up its staff to handle the increased workload. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A dead issue: Don't expect Channel 9 to change its longstanding policy on 
delaying Laker telecasts from the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The viewership goes up tremendously after 6 o'clock," said executive producer 
Susan Stratton. "We're aware some people don't like the delays, but it works 
best for the majority of people." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so a case can be made for delayed telecasts. But what about the outdated 
TV-radio simulcasts? 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotten to the point where Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz are doing mostly a 
television call on radio. It's really bothersome to listeners when they refer 
to a television replay. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Hearn and Lantz would welcome not having to worry about trying to 
please both viewers and listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if the games weren't simulcast, maybe at least the radio broadcasts 
could be live. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Foursome reunited: ABC isn't offering much of a Monday night game next week -- 
the New York Giants, losers of seven in a row, against the 1-9 Houston Oilers 
-- but Channel 7, for its postgame "Monday Night Live" program, has lined up 
the Rams' "Fearsome Foursome." 
</P>
<P>
 Merlin Olsen, Rosey Grier, Deacon Jones and Lamar Lundy are all scheduled to 
appear. Lundy is being flown in from his home in Richmond, Ind.

part of NBC's Hoop-It-Up competition Saturday at 2 p.m. . . . Last weekend's 
"special report" on NBC about Bill Murray giving up entertainment to pursue an 
NBA career was silly and not funny. During "NFL Live," Ahmad Rashad, with bated 
breath, said a big NBA announcement was coming up at halftime. NBA publicists, 
meanwhile, called reporters to warn them it was only a joke. But then what was 
everyone else supposed to think? The whole thing was ill conceived.

NBA ROUNDUP; TARPLEY RETURNS, SCORES 16 AS MAVERICKS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Tarpley, playing in his first NBA game in four years, came off the bench 
to an ovation at Reunion Arena and had 16 points and nine rebounds in the 
Mavericks' 96-94 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Thursday night at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucious Harris made an eight-foot bank shot with 59 seconds remaining to seal 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people were wondering if Roy Tarpley could still play," said Tarpley, 
who was banned by the league for violating its anti-drug regulations in October 
of 1991 and hadn't played in an NBA game since Nov. 9, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also Maverick Coach Dick Motta's first appearance against the Kings 
since he was fired by them in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 106, Chicago 83 -- The Rockets extended their opening-season winning 
streak to eight games as Hakeem Olajuwon's 29 points and Kenny Smith's 
four-of-six shooting on three-pointers led the Rockets over the Bulls at 
Houston. The Rockets are 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, who haven't won in the Summit in seven years, were led by Scottie 
Pippen's 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 81, Portland 80 -- Mark Price scored 30 points, including five 
three-pointers, as the Cavaliers handed the Trail Blazers their second 
consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler, fouled while scoring on a layup with 36 seconds to play, failed 
to make the free throw, only his second miss in 24 attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 94, Denver 92 -- The Pistons, who lost an 11-point lead in the fourth 
quarter, made all four of their free throws in the last three minutes for the 
victory over the Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars of Detroit scored 21 points to become the 124th player in NBA 
history to score 12,000 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 109, New York 100 -- Latrell Sprewell had 27 points and Tim 
Hardaway had 20 to lead the Warriors over the Knicks at Oakland. Derek Harper 
had 21 points for the Knicks, who lost three of four games on this western road 
trip.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 111, Washington 103 -- A trade that sent team leader Tom Gugliotta 
to the Golden State Warriors for Chris Webber left the Bullets shorthanded. The 
Nets took advantage as Kenny Anderson had 24 points and 13 assists to beat the 
Bullets in New Jersey. Derrick Coleman had 23 points and 13 rebounds for the 
Nets.

CLIPPERS' SEVENTH LOSS TIES FRANCHISE MARK; PRO BASKETBALL: CHARLOTTE PULLS 
AWAY, 99-83. SEASON-OPENING WINLESS STREAK WILL BE ON THE LINE IN PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Clippers are the NBA's answer to the Washington Generals, who served as 
foils to the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams must salivate at the prospect of playing the Clippers, the league's only 
winless team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers extended their season-opening losing streak to seven games, 
falling behind by 26 points in the fourth quarter and losing to the Charlotte 
Hornets, 99-83, Thursday night before a sellout crowd of 23,670 at the 
Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been in a situation like this before," Clipper forward Tony 
Massenburg said. "It's no fun losing. We're going to keep plugging away and 
we'll get better each game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who matched the 1982-83 San Diego Clippers for the worst start 
in franchise history, tonight will play the struggling Philadelphia 76ers, who 
have lost six of eight games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get a lot of respect," forward Loy Vaught said. "People write that 
we're the worst team in the NBA and that's kind of the opinion of the fans, but 
we have to believe in ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers, the second-worst offensive team in the NBA, posted 
their lowest point total of the season and tied their season high with 26 
turnovers, Coach Bill Fitch found something positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to have confidence when people are beating your brains out and when 
you miss layups and they hit 30-footers," Fitch said. "But the thing that helps 
you is when you get a group out there that plays the fourth quarter the way we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by 26 points two minutes into the fourth quarter, the Clippers 
outscored the Hornets, 24-8, in an eight-minute run to pull to 91-81, forcing 
Hornet Coach Allan Bristow to put all-stars Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning 
back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some team is going to lose to this Clipper team," Bristow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers played tenacious defense in the fourth quarter, as the Hornets 
shot only 39%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Fitch) doesn't give up," said reserve guard Randy Woods, who had three 
assists in the fourth quarter. "He'll still be coaching in the fourth quarter. 
Last year the coach (former Clipper Coach Bob Weiss) just let the last unit go 
out and play. This year Coach (Fitch) is still coaching because if you don't 
play 'D' and do the things right at the end it's going to affect your minutes 
the next game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch was also pleased with the play of center Elmore Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who has been lethargic since returning from the team's season-opening 
games in Japan, played his best game so far, scoring 12 points, 11 in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Matched against Mourning, Spencer seemed animated, calling for the ball and 
challenging Mourning on two drives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spencer didn't get any rebounds in 29 minutes as the Clippers were 
outrebounded, 48-37. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same old, same old," said Spencer as he made a quick exit from the locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 10 points at halftime, the Hornets outscored the Clippers, 21-8, in 
the first 7 1/2 minutes of the third quarter to take a 23-point lead. Johnson, 
who finished with 19 points and 14 rebounds, had seven points and four rebounds 
in the spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers did little right in the third quarter, shooting 32% and giving 
away seven turnovers. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve forward Harold Ellis played only three minutes after spraining his 
right ankle in the first half. Ellis was also playing with a sprained right 
wrist, suffered in Tuesday night's loss to the Lakers. However, Coach Bill 
Fitch said Ellis probably will be available for tonight's game at Philadelphia. 
. . . Rookie forward Eric Piatkowski had back spasms before the game, but 
played anyway, scoring five points and getting one rebound.

 Coach John Robinson, on the turnaround his team has made, having won five 
straight since a 22-7 loss to Oregon Oct. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of our young players getting game experience and everyone 
making maximum efforts on every play. When everyone has a maximum effort on 
every play. . . . That's what causes big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keith Burns, who coaches the safeties: "A lot of guys got mad after that 
Oregon loss. We noticed . . . seven or eight guys were just flying through the 
air out here (in practice). 
</P>
<P>
 "Then after the Oregon State game, it was nine or 10 guys. After Stanford, it 
was 13 or 14. Now, just about everyone is playing hard in practice and the 
games."

 There's no Rose Bowl at stake for UCLA on Saturday, but that really hasn't 
changed Coach Terry Donahue's week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't as much media attention because we can't get into the Rose Bowl, 
but the rest of it is the same," said Donahue, on his way to a Thursday night 
function, with three others scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This week, there's always several reunions and get-togethers. . . . It's no 
different if there's a Rose Bowl or a national championship or anything else at 
stake," he said.

PREP TENNIS / CITY SECTION FINALS; PALISADES TOPS TAFT IN GIRLS 4-A 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After winning the last two City Section Division 4-A girls' team tennis titles 
with young teams, Woodland Hills Taft High was favored to win the championship 
this year with a squad of seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Palisades upset the Toreadors, 6-1, at the Universal Racquet Centre 
in Studio City on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the final, Palisades Coach Bud Kling said his team had an even chance 
of winning, but he was worried how his No. 2 doubles team would play after one 
of the girls, Jennie Wilson, suffered an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Kling went to his junior varsity team for a substitute, selecting Christin 
Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cho played really solid tennis for us," Kling said. "She wasn't intimidated 
and really played aggressively."  
</P>
<P>
 Cho and Alison Fischer easily won the No. 2 doubles match, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-A final, Carson's 5-2 victory over Eagle Rock was clinched when its 
No. 1 doubles team of Jessica Quileza and Christina Banania hung on for a 6-0, 
6-7 (7-5), 6-3 victory over Jenny Gonzales and Alice Shen. GREG SANDOVAL

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RATHMAN KNOWS SAINTS 
</P>

By LONNIE WHITE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Raiders have played New Orleans only once since 1988, fullback 
Tom Rathman will be familiar with the Saints' defense Sunday. He played against 
the Saints twice a year for eight seasons while with San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing the same things that they've always done, except their 
personnel is different," Rathman said. "When I played with San Francisco, they 
had the best group of linebackers in the league, but now they are gone except 
for one." 
</P>
<P>
 That one is Sam Mills, whose Pro Bowl teammates Rickey Jackson, Pat Swilling 
and Vaughan Johnson have left over the last two seasons. In that time, the 
Saints have gone from one of the top defenses in the league to 21st. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a lot of respect for them because we used to have some battles 
over the years," Rathman said. "But you can tell that they are not as good as 
they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ten games into his first season with the Raiders, Rathman says that the 
biggest difference from playing with the 49ers has been penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders lead the league with 98 penalties for 761 yards; the 49ers have 75 
for 653 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that it's a part of football, but the Raiders get a lot of calls 
against them," Rathman said. "I mean major 15-yard penalties. You can call 
holding on every play, but we always seem to be called for it. Unfortunately 
for us, mistakes like that have killed us this season." 
</P>
<P>

 Second-year cornerback James Trapp will make his first start of the season if 
Lionel Washington is unable to play because of a deep lower leg bruise. 
Washington, who started last week against the Rams in place of Albert Lewis, 
did not practice and is listed as questionable. Lewis, who suffered a knee 
injury two weeks ago at Kansas City, will be sidelined for at least one more 
week. Safety Derrick Hoskins said he will play after sitting out one game 
because of an ankle injury. LONNIE WHITE

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; SECOND SEASON BEGINS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The high school football playoffs begin tonight with a record 203 teams 
battling for 13 divisional titles. The extravaganza concludes with title games 
Dec. 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 fans will attend tonight's first-round action. What they can 
expect in each division: CITY SECTION DIVISION 4-A 
</P>
<P>
 Carson is the defending champion, but the Colts (2-8) barely qualified for the 
playoffs after forfeiting three games for using an academically ineligible 
player. Their reward is an opening-round game against Franklin, which is 9-1, 
thanks to record-setting quarterback Jeff Deno, who has passed for 2,485 yards 
and 32 touchdowns. In what has been another down year for the City, top-seeded 
Sylmar (10-0) has been a bright spot, outscoring its opponents 436-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored championship matchup: Sylmar vs. Dorsey 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Woodland Hills Taft and Franklin. CITY SECTION DIVISION 3-A 
</P>
<P>
 The City's new playoff format reduces the importance of winning the 3-A title. 
Of the section's 49 teams, the top 16 are put in 4-A and the next-best 16 in 
the 3-A. But a championship here does provide building teams with a strong base 
for next season. Such is the case for Wilson, which finished 2-9 last year but 
has turned things around with an 8-2 record this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Wilson vs. Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Reseda and Bell. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente Bishop Amat has been the top-ranked team in the Southland and state 
all season, but the Lancers are banged up and have recently struggled on 
offense. A favorable placement in the bracket should get them to the final, but 
their opponent there, probably Los Alamitos or Santa Ana Mater Dei, could 
present problems. Los Alamitos, with its 45-game unbeaten streak, could be the 
team to beat. The Griffins' junior quarterback, Kevin Feterik, has passed for 
2,044 yards and 22 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Bishop Amat vs. Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Anaheim Esperanza and Mater Dei. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of Los Alamitos and Esperanza this season should give perennial 
challenger Newhall Hart an easier shot at the title. The undefeated Indians 
have rarely been challenged, relying on an offense that averages 390 yards a 
game. There are plenty of challengers, however, including Pasadena Muir, which 
has won six in a row since Mike Harrison took over coaching duties for Jack 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Hart vs. Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Muir and Palos Verdes Peninsula. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION 
III 
</P>
<P>
 This balanced division features six teams with 9-1 records, including 
top-seeded Westlake. The Warriors have been a scoring machine since Scott 
Spruill won a preseason quarterback battle with two other candidates. 
Montebello became a serious contender after beating previously undefeated 
Alhambra last week, 42-0, and Rowland's 7-6 victory over Chino Hills Ayala two 
weeks ago vaulted it into contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Westlake vs. Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Ayala and Sherman Oaks Notre Dame. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION 
IV 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley Canyon Springs was considered a runaway favorite before the 
season started, since the Cougars had 15 starters back from a team that lost to 
Irvine in the title game last year. They started off with a loss to Fontana but 
have won nine in a row and are top seeded. Watch out for traditional power 
Temecula Valley, however, which won the Division V championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Canyon Springs vs. Barstow.

 Top challengers: Cathedral City and Temecula Valley. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION 
V 
</P>
<P>
 This all-Orange County division figures to be a battle between teams of the 
Sea View League, one of the strongest in the section. Top-seeded Newport Harbor 
is a surprising 10-0 and is within one victory of a school record. Watch out 
for Placentia Valencia, which rebounded in the second half of the season after 
forfeiting its first three games for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Newport Harbor vs. Anaheim Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Valencia and Villa Park. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION VI 
</P>

 Covina Charter Oak was seeded second, but that may have been a mistake, 
considering the way the undefeated Chargers have been playing lately. They have 
averaged 45 points a game in the last six weeks, thanks largely to junior 
running back Michael Graham, who gained 329 yards and scored four touchdowns 
against Walnut in the Miramonte League championship last week. Top-seeded 
Claremont's only loss was to Ayala, a Division III power. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Charter Oak vs. Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Claremont and Alta Loma. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION VII 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the division's 16 teams have only one loss, including traditional 
Northern League powers Lompoc and Arroyo Grande. Surprising Culver City is 
top-seeded and defending champion Manhattan Beach Mira Costa is seeded second. 
But Covina, Fountain Valley Los Amigos and West Covina South Hills make this 
one of the most competitive divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Lompoc vs. Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos and South Hills. SOUTHERN 
SECTION DIVISION VIII 
</P>
<P>
 The story here is Bloomington, a team that struggled to a 1-9 record last 
year. The Bruins, under new coach Don Markham, are 10-0 and have outscored 
their opponents by a whopping 646-118.  
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Costa Mesa vs. Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: La Mirada and Laguna Hills. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION IX 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Santa Ynez's only loss is to Ojai Nordhoff during the second week 
of the season. The teams could meet again in the semifinals. The bottom half of 
the bracket figures to be a battle between Agoura Oak Park, North Hollywood 
Harvard-Westlake and Moorpark. 
</P>

 Favored matchup: Santa Ynez vs. Moorpark.

 Top challengers: Harvard-Westlake and Nordhoff. SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION X

 Grumbles were heard when the Southern Section awarded free-lance entry Van 
Nuys Montclair Prep an at-large berth. The 7-1 Mounties were kicked out of 
their league a few years ago and have been floating between divisions during 
the playoffs ever since. They lost in the Division VII quarterfinals last year, 
so they figure to be a factor in a lower division. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Cerritos Valley Christian vs. Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Top challengers: Montclair Prep and Ontario Christian. SOUTHERN SECTION 
DIVISION XI 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Southern Section should think about doing away with this division 
or shrink the bracket to eight teams. Because of a shortage of quality teams, 
five schools have first-round byes. Defending champion Boron returns and hopes 
to avenge its only loss in two years to Trona. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored matchup: Morro Bay vs. Boron.

<P>
 Top challengers: Trona and Linfield.

 EARLY WORK: Santa Ana Mayor-elect Miguel A. Pulido Jr. isn't waiting to take 
office before getting into the job. He spoke up at an evening public forum this 
week on gang violence and crime. . . . Says Pulido: It can't be just "the city 
addressing these problems. We have to find ways of working with the school 
district and the private sector." . . . . Pulido also told the small crowd he 
plans a bigger push for federal dollars to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S REALLY HIM? Roger Williams is hardly a household name, unless you love 
the piano. Williams charmed the crowd at the annual Buena Park Mayor's Prayer 
Breakfast on Thursday at Knott's Berry Farm with his hit piano renditions of 
"The Rose" and "Autumn Leaves." . . . Then came the unveiling of his wax 
likeness at the nearby Movieland Wax Museum -- its 487th. Williams' reaction: 
"Oh, God, it's so real. This is scary. It's like an out-of-body experience."

 DOLLAR DAYS? All the signs show more Christmas spending in Orange County this 
year. State finance experts say the county hit a first-quarter $4-billion mark 
in retail sales for the first time since 1990. Also: Jeff K. Thredgold, chief 
business economist for KeyCorp, a major U.S. banking company, predicts 
Christmas spending in the county at 7% to 10% higher than last year. . . . "For 
the first time in about four years, the California economy is growing," 
Thredgold says. "Consequently, consumers are more optimistic, which typically 
means they'll spend more." 
</P>
<P>
 MOVING IN YOUNG: Not only is the economy growing in California, the state is 
getting a new look, says New West, an Ontario-based policy research institute. 
Its findings show that for every 10 people over 30 leaving the state, eight 
people under 30 are coming in. . . . New West says in a study released this 
week: "This new work force is better educated." In Orange County, for example, 
the number of workers with college degrees is 28% -- well above the 20% 
national average. Upward Bound

 REWARD: It sure didn't take long for the Antelope Valley Union School District 
to get results from its new policy of rewarding students who snitch on their 
peers. Try one day. On Thursday, a high school junior carrying a BB-gun was 
turned in by two classmates (B1). . . . Not everyone, however, is crazy about 
the idea. "You're risking your life for $25," said freshman Angela Villa.

 HOOKED: Boys in the Valley are no different than anywhere else when it comes 
to their favorite video games -- they're big on blood. "The best game?" asks 
Encino's Kelly Mower. "Mortal Kombat II. There's fighting. There's blood." . . 
. And there's plenty to choose from. The technology keeps getting better, with 
spectacular graphics and faster action. See Valley Life! Page 10.

 WHIZ KID: Is he the next Bill Gates? Probably not, but give Northridge's Jay

pray to God that people will buy it," he says. . . . Don't worry, he has a 
life. He plays tennis and golf, and practices piano and flute. See Valley Life!

 IN THE FAMILY: Ted Iacenda will always be the little brother, but he's doing 
big things on the football field. Ted of Hart High is among the area's leading 
rushers, and a source of great pride to older brother, Andy, who also starred 
there (C8). . . . "I knew his potential," says Andy, "but when he scored five 
touchdowns against San Fernando, my mouth dropped." Michael Arkush

 JOB OPENING: Now that Richard Wittenberg, Ventura County's chief 
administrative officer, has set his sights on prospects to the north, the 
search is on for his successor (B1). . . . The county might want to settle in 
for a long haul. Officials in Santa Clara County took 14 months to decide on 
Wittenberg as their top administrator. And in the city of Ventura, officials 
have been looking for a new city manager since John Baker resigned in July. . .

the top county job.

 MOVING OUT: The tough times keep coming for libraries. . . . First, it was the

looking to move out of the facility temporarily while damage from the Jan. 17 
quake is fixed. (B4). . . . Officials had already received federal earthquake 
emergency funds to pay for the repairs. Now, they want federal money to help 
with the move to a temporary site while the building is brought up to par.

 MOCK HORROR: It all looked real enough, but that was just part of the drill 
when county emergency officials practiced earthquake preparedness during a mock 
disaster at Point Mugu (B1). . . . For some residents, emergency readiness was 
on the rise even before the Northridge disaster, said Rosemaria Coleman of 
Farsight International, an Oxnard based emergency-products firm. "There's been 
more and more awareness," she said.

 MYSTIC BENEFIT: How's this for a worthwhile, if unlikely, combination: raising 
money to find a cure for cancer while delving into mysticism -- with lunch and 
shopping thrown in for good measure. . . . The Mystic Day Luncheon, a 
fund-raiser for UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center Foundation, is set for Saturday at 
Hyatt Westlake Plaza. Mystics will offer readings at the annual event, 
sponsored by the foundation's Conejo Valley chapter. As in medicine, second 
opinions are highly sought-after. "The mystics are kept busy," said spokeswoman 
Bee-Dee Meyer.

GINGRICH ASKED TO RETAIN STATE'S CLOUT IN HOUSE; POLITICS: CALIFORNIA'S GOP 
DELEGATION MEETS WITH INCOMING SPEAKER. HIS SPOKESMAN SAYS STATE WILL BE 
WELL-REPRESENTED IN NEW LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Republican House members from California, disturbed that the state's 
traditional clout could be undermined in the GOP takeover of Capitol Hill, 
Thursday appealed to incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to make sure that 
their influence is not diminished in the 104th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hastily arranged meeting Thursday, California Republicans worried among 
themselves about plans to deny Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) the 
chairmanship of either of two committees for which he appeared to be in line, 
according to one of the participants. Also sparking concerns is a proposed new 
system of apportioning committee assignments that could concentrate more power 
in Gingrich's hands and weaken California legislators' claim on plum committee 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich sought quickly to blunt those concerns Thursday night as he met with 
Gov. Pete Wilson. Gingrich said he promised the California governor that he 
would "do all I can within the framework of my office to be helpful to 
California . . . on a wide range of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's GOP delegation anticipates at least one significant gain when 
Republicans take control of Congress for the first time in 40 years: Rep. 
Duncan Hunter (R-San Diego) is expected to be elevated to one of a handful of 
senior leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like -- with the exception of Hunter in the leadership -- most of 
our leadership is from the Mississippi (River) east," said Rep. Randy (Duke) 
Cunningham (R-San Diego) on Thursday. "And that concerns us." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham added that he and other California Republicans would ask Gingrich 
"to consider that, since we're losing some of that prestige," at least one and 
maybe two Californians win seats on a key panel that dispenses committee 
assignments. He added that Gingrich could compensate the delegation for its 
loss of Moorhead's chairmanship by naming a Californian to a deputy whip 
position, a relatively low-ranking leadership slot. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday evening, Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said several California 
legislators had brought their concerns to the incoming Speaker. "I think in the 
end California is going to be dramatically well-represented," Blankley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in the nation's capital on his way to the Republican Governors' 
Conference in Virginia this weekend, indicated that he was seeking assurances 
that the new GOP-controlled Congress would relieve California and other states 
of the burden of complying with "unfunded mandates" -- federal directives for 
which Congress appropriates no federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on assurances that Gingrich and other GOP leaders have given him, Wilson 
said, he expects Congress to "have more sympathy for our position." But it 
remains unclear, he added, whether Congress will pay for the implementation of 
such directives or withdraw the mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 On another matter of special concern to California, Gingrich said after his 
meeting with Wilson that he asked the governor to take the lead, along with 
governors of other border states, in proposing an effective plan for the 
federal government to seal off their frontiers to illegal immigration. But 
Gingrich made no commitment when asked if California would receive all of the 
$2.3 billion in federal funds it has requested as compensation for federally 
mandated assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 While Moorhead's apparent ouster from an expected chairman's berth prompted 
worries among some California Republicans, the 72-year-old Glendale native 
appeared to be taking the political blow in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you're chosen to carry the ball; sometimes you're chosen to block 
for those who are given the ball," Moorhead said philosophically Thursday after 
being passed over for the chairmanships of both the Judiciary and the Energy 
and Commerce committees, two traditionally powerful posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich named Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) to head the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) to head the Judiciary panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that I'm not mean enough," Moorhead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead added quickly that he will happily soldier on as chairman of the 
Judiciary's subcommittee on intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is very important to our area because of all our (entertainment) 
industries that depend on patents and trademarks," said Moorhead, dean of 
California House Republicans, who was first elected in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and even Moorhead's friends and colleagues in the House said his 
mild-mannered, low-key style became a detriment with the ascension of Gingrich 
and a like-minded band of GOP activists eager to press their conservative 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 More subtle than the apparent passing over of Moorhead are changes that would 
loosen California lawmakers' historic grip on sought-after committee 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, at least one seat on the Committee on Committees, which parcels 
out committee assignments to House members, has been reserved for a 
Californian. As a result, California lawmakers have been assured consistent 
membership on committees with key constituencies in the state, such as the 
House Appropriations Committee, the Armed Services panel and the Agriculture 
Committee. Under several proposals for reorganization now under consideration, 
California's assured seat on the Committee on Committees -- as well as assured 
seats for Florida and Texas -- could be abolished in favor of a process that 
would give Gingrich's followers a larger voice regardless of where they come 
from and expand Gingrich's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows the leadership to almost dominate everything in this respect," 
Moorhead told The Times Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of Congress as well, analysts noted that the reorganization proposals 
that have been circulated most widely appear to strengthen the power of the 
Speaker and consolidate many responsibilities in his hands. Gingrich, a fiery 
partisan who has won the loyalty of many younger lawmakers, appears intent on 
using that consolidation to maintain strict discipline among his new Republican 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gingrich is trying desperately to keep the Republicans in lock-step, which he 
has to (do), given that they have a very small margin," said Pam Gilbert of the 
citizens watchdog group Congress Watch. "To get the kinds of controversial 
legislation through that the House Republicans have offered, they need a very 
cohesive group of Republicans. And that generally means doctrinaire, partisan 
chairmen to lead the charge." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), who has emerged as one of Gingrich's 
inner circle of advisers, said Thursday that Moorhead's humiliation should not 
be construed as a diminution of California Republicans' influence in the House. 
"I'm very close to Newt," he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier added that he is "very sorry" about Moorhead being passed over. He said 
he made a personal but unsuccessful appeal to Gingrich on Moorhead's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Other committee chairmanship appointments made by the incoming Speaker: Rep. 
Robert L. Livingston (R-La.) to be acting head of Appropriations until bribery 
charges are resolved against Rep. Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.); Rep. Benjamin A. 
Gilman (R-N.Y.) to Foreign Affairs; Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) to Banking, Finance 
and Urban Affairs; Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Pa.) to Education and Labor; Rep. 
Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) to Rules. All of the appointments must be ratified 
later by the GOP caucus but easy approval is expected.

 British Petroleum to Pay $1.4 Billion to Alaska: The payment by British 
Petroleum's Alaska unit will resolve state tax disputes that date back to the 
time when oil began flowing through the trans-Alaska pipeline, Alaska Gov. 
Walter Hickel said. The settlement, coming after years of negotiations, is the 
largest Alaska tax deal ever, Hickel said at a news conference. Paul Laird, 
spokesman for BP's Alaska unit, said the payments will not have a material 
effect on the company's financial results or operations.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The executive chairs at Warner Bros. Records will begin shuffling Monday when 
Russ Thyrett and David Altschule are to be named to vice chairman posts at the 
Burbank label, reporting to Danny Goldberg, who takes over as chairman Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg flew in from New York this week to meet with Thyrett, Altschule and 
other Warner Bros. veterans -- some of whom have been approached recently by 
rival record corporations. Thyrett is currently senior vice president of 
marketing and promotion and has worked at Warner for more than 20 years. 
Altschule is senior vice president of business affairs and general counsel and 
has worked at the label for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Golberg has asked Warner Bros. Records product manager Steven Baker and Virgin 
Records chief Phil Quartararo to take over as presidents of Reprise and Warner 
Bros. Records, respectively, but neither has decided whether to take the jobs, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 In related news, Seymour Stein's move from Sire Records to Elektra 
Entertainment is expected to be announced soon. Sire A&R whiz Joe McEwen has 
also been offered a job at Elektra but has yet to accept. Sire managing 
director Howie Klein is expected to stay in Burbank as an executive with Warner 
Bros., where Madonna, Depeche Mode and other major Sire recording artists will 
remain.

 Cable: Tele-Communications Inc. said its board approved a plan Thursday that 
would divide the Denver-based cable TV giant into four separate companies. TCI 
Chief Executive John C. Malone said the new structure would give the company 
greater financial and strategic flexibility while still providing "synergies 
and scale economics provided by a common corporate parent."Under the plan, 
first outlined in March, TCI would divide itself into separate companies 
encompassing domestic cable operations and telephony, programming, 
international investments and technology. Shareholders would be able to invest 
in TCI or in any of the four other entities. TCI would maintain a controlling 
interest in each of the four companies, however. TCI said shareholder approval 
is expected by spring. A TCI spokesman said the plan would allow the investment 
community to "appropriately value" the assets of the company. TCI, the largest 
cable TV operator in the country, serves about 13 million subscribers. JOHN

PSYCHEDELIC SOLUTIONS?; IT WAS A LONG, STRANGE TRIP IN THE '60S AND EARLY '70S. 
BUT THE STUDY OF MIND-ALTERING DRUGS CAME TO A SCREECHING HALT. NOW, 
RESEARCHERS ARE AGAIN LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUBSTANCES MAY BE A 
KEY TO CURING ADDICTIONS AND MENTAL ILLNESS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new generation of scientists calls them antactogens, empathogens and 
entheogens -- "fantastic" drugs that could help us learn more about the mind's 
mysteries, cure psychological problems and stop drug abuse. To others, however, 
these are rightfully banned substances newly cloaked in clinical names. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people know them simply as psychedelic drugs -- LSD, ecstasy and 
hallucinogenic mushrooms, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 25 years after the federal government all but shut down psychedelic 
drug research involving human subjects, these academics are testing the 
illicit, mind-bending drugs on people -- with the approval of the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration. These researchers say the government shutdown left major 
questions unanswered -- and that America may be overlooking the wonder drugs of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like early man who says fire's too dangerous," says Rick Doblin, 40, a 
Harvard-trained social scientist who has become the self-appointed spokesman 
for the new wave of research. "We're not even at the stage where we figured out 
fire keeps you warm in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these academics were only teen-agers when Timothy Leary's '60s-era 
pro-drug proselytizing helped prompt the government to finally shut the door on 
such research in 1970. Now they sport ties and cropped hair, have new names for 
the drugs ("There's so much baggage psychedelics carries," says one), and say 
they play by the rules. "I am well-trained, and serious about these drugs," 
says Rick Strassman, who holds degrees from Stanford, UC San Diego and UC Davis 
and heads up two psychedelic drug projects at the University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But while this group of researchers is diverse, serious and seems to have more 
degrees than a protractor, the politics of this kind of study is again at 
issue.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old thing in disguise," says Wayne J. Roques, a Drug 
Enforcement Administration demand reduction coordinator based in Miami. "They 
believe they can open the door to legalization." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Bennett of Oregon Health Sciences University agrees that 
legalization is the goal. "It's about a scientific agenda -- a well-funded 
one," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illicit drugs are illicit because they're painful, they're harmful," adds his 
wife, Sandra, vice president of a group called Drug Watch International. The 
couple lost their college-age son to cocaine in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Doblin, president of the Multidisciplinary Assn. for Psychedelic Studies 
(MAPS), a nonprofit lobby tied to every new psychedelic research project 
involving humans, acknowledges that legalization is his ultimate end. His 
strategy is to support science that would prove psychedelic drugs have 
"therapeutic potential." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm up front and direct that there is a larger agenda," Doblin says during an 
interview at his Charlotte, N.C., home office. "It's a piecemeal, slow, gradual 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the researchers like being affiliated with this kind of talk, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think hallucinogenic drugs are potentially quite dangerous and should 
remain tightly restricted," says Strassman, an associate professor of 
psychiatry at the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine. Charles S. 
Grob, director of child psychiatry at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and lead 
researcher in a study of MDMA ("ecstasy"), says, "I want to be distanced as far 
as possible" from the politics. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, six studies are either under way or awaiting final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new studies involve university and private funding, some of which 
has been secured by MAPS. Two studies at the University of New Mexico, under 
Strassman, have received a total of $240,000 in taxpayer funds from the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the FDA reopened the door to studies of the potential of psychedelic 
drugs. The result is that "aboveboard research with psychedelics is becoming 
viable, respected," Grob says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of research started that way. LSD, for example, was happened 
upon in 1943 as Swiss scientist Albert Hofmann was trying to synthesize a 
substance that would help the blood circulate better. He ended up with a 
hallucinogenic drug he hoped could be used in psychotherapy. Sandoz 
Pharmaceuticals patented the drug, the CIA tested it and researchers loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Janiger, a retired Santa Monica psychiatrist, researched the effects of 
LSD by giving it to more than 1,000 people between 1954 and 1962. His subjects 
included more than a few stars -- Cary Grant and Rita Moreno to name two. Then 
the government shut down his lab. "Nobody gave us a good answer," says Janiger, 
77. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the year the White House Conference on Narcotics found that 
psychedelics were popular with "long hair and beatnik cults," writes historian 
Jay Stevens in "Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream" (Atlantic Monthly 
Press, 1987). "My colleagues," Janiger says, "were being shut down at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Leary and colleague Richard Alpert (now known as Ram Dass, the 
best-selling spiritual guru), were kicked off the Harvard faculty for their 
enthusiastic research that involved giving LSD to graduate students. Then 
people like Leary and author Ken Kesey ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest") 
preached about the drugs they had discovered -- and LSD escaped from academia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our social duty," Leary told reporters in 1966, "is to publish manuals, give 
training sessions and prepare the young to use this powerful, 
consciousness-expanding drug." 
</P>
<P>
 "The impressionable young, stimulated by the claims of Kesey and Leary, had 
begun taking it wherever and whenever they could," Stevens writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 1966, bad trips begat trips to the emergency rooms for middle-class 
kids. Citing the bad experiences, possible schizophrenia and even brain damage, 
the government halted most LSD research, and Sandoz recalled its drug and gave 
up its patent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, the federal government created "Schedule I," a category of drugs for 
which there is no legitimate use. LSD and psilocybin (a chemical that comes 
from hallucinogenic mushrooms) were included, making government approval for 
human research with the drugs rare. (UCLA researcher Ronald K. Siegel was one 
of few allowed to test LSD on humans after 1970.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's foolish to try to blame me" for the crackdown, says Leary, now 
74 and a full-time futurist, conspiracy-theorist and college circuit lecturer. 
But since he still sees the government as Big Brother, Leary says, "I would 
love to take the blame for stopping government research into drugs. I would be 
honored." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the original LSD researchers say they were close to a breakthrough. 
They say they were amassing evidence that psychedelic drugs could cure 
alcoholism, help cure mental ills and even help reform prisoners (an idea Leary 
began testing while at Harvard). "The track record in the original research had 
great promise," says Alexander Shulgin, 69, a former Dow Chemical Co. 
researcher who has published nearly 200 papers on psychedelic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say enough was discovered to conclude that LSD and psilocybin aren't 
worth our time. "The federal government supported research, Sandoz supported 
research," says Jerome Levine, who studied LSD at the National Institute of 
Mental Health in the '60s. "It certainly did have its day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority of the studies that were done turned out to be negative," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of drug abuse and AIDS in the '80s created a climate friendlier to 
new drug testing of all sorts. In 1989, the FDA established a Pilot Drug 
Evaluation staff "to do a better job of responding to the needs of the research 
community with a minimum of bureaucracy," says an FDA official who did not want 
to be named. The point was to smooth the way for drugs such as AZT, a treatment 
for AIDS, and substances that might help reduce drug abuse, the official says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the result was also that psychedelic drug research got approved, as long 
as it is done "real carefully and with a lot of people watching to make sure no 
one gets hurt," the FDA official says. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval for such research must come from the FDA. The DEA then issues a 
license to handle the drugs. NIDA sometimes funds the research and provides the 
drugs. (A drug can also be made by a licensed researcher or imported with 
federal approval.) "We really want to see scientific data that can hold water," 
says NIDA staffer Jeraline Lin. In California, additional approval has to come 
from the state's Research Advisory Panel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Psychedelic drugs vary the amount of chemicals that the mind shoots across its 
expanse, like so many E-mail messages, researchers say. The colorful 
psychedelic experience can be the result of either a lack of E-mail or an 
E-mail overload.  
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers say this process can open the mind to psychotherapy, drawing 
out true feelings, repressed memories and subconscious hang-ups. Under that 
same concept, they say, the drug can also open the mind's eye to 
psychotherapy-aided attempts to end drug dependence, for example, or help a 
criminal turn over a new leaf. "Psychotherapy is enhanced by an altered-state 
experience," Harbor-UCLA's Grob says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangers surrounding most of the drugs -- aside from disorientation and 
confusion -- are not as great as the public was led to believe in the '60s, 
says UCLA's Siegel, a longtime drug-abuse consultant to the federal government. 
Risks of brain damage and schizophrenia, he says, have been discounted. Most 
psychedelics are stimulants, and like any stimulant, they can be harmful to 
those with high blood pressure and heart conditions, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, especially in the case of LSD, the psychological effects of the 
experience can be overwhelming -- and they can linger, Siegel says. That's why 
researchers avoid giving the drug, for example, to the mentally unstable. A few 
drugs, such as MDMA, appear to be more physiologically dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first projects of new-generation research was a 1991 safety study 
of DMT -- a drug found in some trees, grasses and even in the human brain. It 
is now being studied to find out more about how the brain works. DMT researcher 
Strassman says it's too early to release any findings, but adds that it could 
"lead to possibly developing drugs that could treat bad trips in emergency 
rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 He recently started a NIDA-supported study of psilocybin and has been approved 
to study LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Baltimore researchers Richard Yensen and Donna Dryer were approved to 
study LSD -- which is not considered addictive -- with the goal of finding out 
if it can help treat addiction to other substances. The study has yet to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 In '92, Grob's MDMA project was approved. Grob and colleague Russell Poland, a 
professor of psychiatry at Harbor-UCLA, are finishing up the initial safety 
study. MDMA -- a drug first patented in 1914 -- has an effect described as a 
mix between speed and LSD. The researchers eventually want to see if the drug 
is useful in treating psychiatric disorders. Individuals on the drug "are more 
communicative about their feelings," Grob says. 
</P>
<P>
 This project seems to be the most controversial, however, because it involves 
a drug that has been known to cause brain damage in rats. "I would have serious 
reservations about administering MDMA," Siegel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Grob and Poland counter that governmental scrutiny is high, dosages are low, 
and volunteers, who must be former users, are well-informed. "If we give the 
drug to those who have taken it previously, at very low dosages, we feel it's 
very safe," Poland says. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, the FDA approved a University of Miami study of ibogaine, a 
psychedelic drug found in a rain forest shrub and used in regions of Western 
Africa as a stimulant, aphrodisiac, hunting aid and as part of religious 
rituals. The goal is to find out if the drug can be used to help stop drug 
dependence. Some anecdotal evidence says it works, but Dr. Juan Sanchez-Ramos 
says it's too early in his study to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Resurgent psychedelic drug research is supported by three groups working in 
concert. The 800-member MAPS puts out a quarterly newsletter on the latest 
research, lobbies Washington for approval and solicits money for studies. 
Leaders of the newly established Heffter Research Institute, as yet homeless, 
hope to build one of the first laboratories devoted purely to psychedelic 
study. For now, their goal is to raise an endowment to support research. The 
Albert Hofmann Foundation, based in Los Angeles and founded by Janiger, has 
been raising money to become a repository for psychedelic drug research papers. 
</P>
<P>
 MAPS president Doblin -- who says he's a nondrinker, nonsmoker and avid jogger 
-- has positioned himself as spokesman for the new wave of research. He learned 
the bureaucratic ropes in the mid '80s as spokesman for the unsuccessful 
movement to keep MDMA legal (it was included as a Schedule I drug in 1985). 
Now, he says, "I found out how to do what I want to do within the system." 
</P>
<P>
 But the real issue for the future of psychedelics, Janiger says, is not "the 
system." It's found in the past: economics. "The most important force is the 
one that is never mentioned: that Sandoz never found a medical use for LSD," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if all this research supports the medical use of LSD, MDMA and other 
drugs, the issue remains, Grob says, "What's the profit line?"

MEET THE MASTERS OF A NEW UNIVERSE; TRENDS: MEN, IT SEEMS, ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM 
THE PLEASURES OF LAUNDRY. THEY, TOO, HAVE DISCOVERED THE SPIRITUAL BENEFITS OF 
SORTING, WASHING AND FOLDING. 
</P>

 In a world of cheap pleasures, it is among the cheapest. Certainly, it is the 
cleanest. 
</P>
<P>
 From the fluttery anticipation of the pre-wash to the peaceful smoothing of 
soft, warm wrinkles, the rituals of laundry can be enormously satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 What other task in life offers such immediate and gratifying results? Dingy is 
made bright. Sour is made sweet. Chaos is ordered -- or at least sorted out by 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget missing socks and sweaters that shrink. If taken seriously, laundry 
need not be drudgery. It can be spiritual, indulgent, even personally 
empowering -- in a '90s unisex dual-career sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder then that more men are doing it -- and loving it? 
</P>
<P>
 Although women still do the bulk of the nation's wash -- 20 million women do 
laundry every day of the year compared to only 8 million men -- the 1994 Wisk 
Cleaning Census shows men are beginning to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the attitude men bring to the laundry room that most distinguishes 
washermen from washerwomen. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that men were more likely to relax while doing laundry by 
taking breaks "to nap or cuddle up with someone you love." Women were more 
likely to pass the time cooking, cleaning or ironing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day when domesticity has never been less fashionable for women, the 
survey suggests that it may just be coming into vogue for men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Bernie Roswig about why he does the household laundry and the Los Angeles 
public relations executive swells with pride. "I just have a feeling I do it 
better than anybody I know." 
</P>
<P>
 (Although he rarely speaks of it publicly, Roswig, 52, also derives special 
pleasure from pulling the lint off the dryer filter. "I always hope there's a 
lot of lint there so I can peel it off all in one big piece. If there's any one 
part of the laundry process I look forward to, it would definitely be that.") 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, the New York-born Roswig looked forward to helping his mother 
bring the laundry in off the clothesline. "We lived in the snow belt but we 
always had clean clothes and they really were clean -- outdoors clean, sunshine 
fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Roswig takes his laundry seriously and, like 32% of the men and 27% of the 
women in Lever Brothers' survey, he blames himself if something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not obsessive," Roswig says, "but I do get aggrieved when I cannot remove 
all the stains. So far, I've been fortunate in that I've never had anything 
really ugly happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That men can care deeply about laundry comes as no surprise to behavior 
experts. Several years ago, a landmark study by French social scientist 
Jean-Claude Kaufmann found that while men may dislike discussing the topic, 
they have very strong feelings about clean clothes -- and missing socks. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple interviewed by Kaufmann disagreed violently over the temperature 
that should be used for washing the family's clothes. He believed in hot, she 
in tepid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He let her do the wash, fold, and iron. Then he would sort his clothes out 
and put them straight back into the machine at high temperature," according to 
a British report on the Kaufmann study. The couple's future together, the 
scientist reported, was "distinctly uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 Such soap operas are unknown in the suburban Chicago home of Pat and Dennis 
Arkis. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hulking amateur weightlifter, former Navy SEAL and retired police 
officer proposed to Pat, it was with one caveat: "I told her no way could she 
ever touch the wash. The laundry is my domain." 
</P>
<P>
 That strict division of labor has made for a very happy marriage, say the 
Arkises, even when Dennis was doing the entire wash for the family of six. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women's work? No way," he says. "So far as my masculinity is concerned, I've 
heard some talk but this is something I take pride in. No way am I going to 
apologize to anybody for doing the laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkis, 50, spends his "down time" in the basement laundry room working out. "I 
have a mini-gym there by the washer and dryer. I'll throw my laundry in, then 
go and push weights till it's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkis' routine washes with recent findings that men experience the laundry 
process differently -- and in some ways, more positively -- that women do. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Lever Brothers pollsters, men seem to be doing more laundry 
than ever. Of 1,035 adults surveyed, 38% of men report spending four or more 
hours a week laundering, compared to 57% of women. 
</P>
<P>
 And while commercials rarely show men doing the laundry, nearly one-fifth of 
American males are washing at least seven loads a week, according to the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of men as laundry-impaired is losing its viability," says Lever 
Brothers spokesman Kenneth Hooper. "In some cases, our study found, men were 
far more savvy than women about getting out stains. Twenty-seven percent of men 
surveyed, for example, know clothes with perspiration stains are best washed in 
hot water. Only 19% of women knew that." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gomez knew that. "With sports and all, I'm used to cleaning a lot of 
sweaty stuff," says the 23-year-old Cerritos College student. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday is wash day for Gomez. But if he didn't have to plunk two quarters 
into a machine for every load, every day would be wash day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only washing my own stuff but with different water temperatures and 
colors and all, I end up with about four loads every time I go down to the 
laundry room. If I had my own washer and dryer, wow, I'd definitely do a lot 
more. I hate dirty clothes. I have actually had to not go out at night, cancel 
like my whole social life, 'cause I didn't have anything clean to wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many men, Gomez learned the basics of laundry from women -- in his case, 
two younger sisters. "They didn't say, 'Oh, let me do your laundry.' No, they 
said, 'Turn this dial here and don't wash red with anything but black.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Artist Lloyd Noonan, 36, would rather push a vacuum cleaner than do the 
laundry. Still, the Culver City bachelor washes seven or eight loads per week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only me. I don't do anyone else's wash. But I always seem to have 
something to put in the wash. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I work out six days a week so I have to wash the workout clothes. I put tarps 
over things when I paint so I have to wash those. I change my sheets twice a 
week, of course, so I'm always washing those. And then there are two towel 
loads per week, the underwear, the T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan isn't surprised by the findings of the Clean Census. "Yes, I'm probably 
that one in five who does all the laundry. But if you're a separator like I am, 
the loads can pile up. Separating is very important to me. Always has been. 
I've heard such horror stories about what happens when you don't separate the 
colors. I won't risk it. I won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I can't remember last time I did a full load. Maybe I do like 
doing the laundry more than I thought. . . ."

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: BEHIND THE MASK; PARTICIPANTS FIND THE YOUNG 
CONSERVATORY PROGRAM PROVIDES AN OUTLET FOR PERSONAL EXPRESSION THAT IN OTHER 
INSTANCES MIGHT NOT BE CONSIDERED COOL. THEY ALSO GET A CHANCETO EXPLORE HUMAN 
NATURE. 
</P>

 Huge, bulbous, red foam noses protrude from the faces of the 17 teens in the 
Young Conservatory's Monday night course. To some parents, they might look as 
fashionably amusing as green hair. But it's likely these won't catch on as the 
next fad. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting them on serves as a kind of signal among the students to let go of 
their inhibitions and become the person they had, in the last week, selected to 
impersonate. That character isn't necessarily a clown or even funny. The goal 
is that eventually they will no longer need the noses to let them assume a 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercises like these are part of the act for the 233 Young Conservatory 
participants at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa (about 70 are teens), as 
well as for thousands of others throughout the county in similar repertory 
programs and high school drama departments. 
</P>
<P>
 These young thespians share a commitment that goes beyond the experience of 
most high-schoolers. They are willing to shed social conventions and peer 
expectations. They have to study and explore human nature. And in this forum, 
where the "no guts, no glory" maxim is religiously followed, there is no room 
for introversion -- unless it's part of the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescence is all about trying on masks and finding an identity that fits. 
For these teens, role-playing is all part of the art of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "In acting there's no limits to what you can be," says Villa Park freshman 
Tracy Clifton. "And because you're supposed to be another person, it's not 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, what people don't know," confides the 15-year-old, "is it's just a 
reflection of what's within you." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy began the Young Conservatory program two years ago and has since 
integrated many of the skills she's learned into her daily life. She became 
more sensitive to why guys her age tend to talk less than girls. Having to play 
a boy one year, Tracy got from her observations that sometimes their silence 
has to do with being self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "As actors, we have to have a lot of empathy," says Tracy, who actually has 
designs on a career as a marine biologist, not as an actress ("I could better 
help the planet that way and try to save the oceans"). 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps me when I can get into their world and understand it," she says. 
"It's amazing when you do research about your world. It makes life more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy has expanded her own world since entering the theater culture by trading 
in her once shy personality for that of an extrovert. The sense of 
self-assurance even landed her a spot on the school debate team. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always have to brand everyone as shy or smart or weird," she says. "I 
learned that it was OK to break out of the brand. It's OK not to act like how 
people expect sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many teens, the theater culture assures them of an outlet for personal 
expression that in any other scene might be construed as unacceptable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Monte Vista junior Chris Friend looks like the average teen. That is, if you 
consider as average his black and blond Mohawk, multiple piercings, ripped 
trousers and worn, studded army boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris expresses himself by more than his wardrobe, however. He paints and 
sculpts. Other projects include a book he's writing and illustrating that 
resembles a children's tale, but is actually political and social satire for 
adults. He also keeps a journal of costumes he's designed.  
</P>
<P>
 A spontaneous 16-year-old who admits to "getting bored very easily," Chris 
enjoys the improvisation exercises in his YC class. It's his first semester at 
SCR and his first crack at the acting experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical challenges involved, says Chris, are what fascinate him most 
about acting. During a session, the lanky teen will throw himself down and drag 
himself along the floor without a second thought. And he'll repeat the crash 
just for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot about controlling my movements and voice and making up 
characters fast," he says. "I love creating a situation or a character from my 
head and making it real." 
</P>
<P>
 He will put the training into practice when he becomes a director: "I don't 
figure art alone will support me, so I'm looking at directing." It's no 
surprise, then, that he counts such vanguard directors as David Lynch, Tim 
Burton and Quentin Tarantino as influences.  
</P>
<P>
 Bored with high school, Chris will take an exam in the next few weeks that he 
hopes will enable him to start the spring semester full-time at Orange Coast 
College. His older brother is already studying psychology at the Costa Mesa 
campus. Chris plans to enroll in art courses, including set design and film 
editing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to take an image in my mind and make it real, tangible, like 
sculpting," he says. "Directing is another way of making an idea tangible, but 
taking it to another extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's those extremes, or at least the atypical behavior, that Molly Dorfman 
says lets "you recognize who are the people in theater." 
</P>
<P>
 A freshman at Foothill High in Tustin, Molly says the factors are subtle, but 
common among those in theater.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're more comfortable around people expressing their thoughts," she says. 
"They're just more likely to express themselves. Not that they have to be 
overly dramatic, although some of them are naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Molly is a natural comedian. Impressions have always come easy for her, and 
she especially likes mimicking characters created by other comedians such as 
Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. An only child, she says she's always been the 
family ham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather do comedy with my acting," she says. "I've always fancied things 
that are funny." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an appreciation, or "envy" as she prefers to call it, of how a person 
can take on another identity that attracted Molly to acting. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the stage, not TV or movies, to which Molly pledges allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to envy the people on TV and in the movies, but then I realized the 
true art form of acting could only be played out in theater," she says. 
"Theater is true to the original. If you mess up, you mess up. There's no 
editing or redoing it or special effects. The stage is the real challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 In class at SCR, where they are working on character development through mime, 
Molly's movements aren't grandiose. But she's definitely learned how to get 
large laughs from connecting many small actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 14, she has spent five years cultivating her skills attending YC sessions 
and participating in the program's plays as well as summer productions at OCC. 
Daily, she goes to drama class at Foothill, but despite her outside experience 
won't be able to perform in her school plays until next year. That doesn't seem 
to irk her. With about a dozen hours devoted weekly to theater, including 
classes and homework, Molly figures she's getting her fill. Besides, she needs 
time for her other hobbies: origami and computers.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, she hits every stage performance she can and prefers reading plays 
rather than novels. But Molly intends to become a neurosurgeon -- although at 
this point she is considering a double major in medicine and drama, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my acting skills will benefit me in anything I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Like her classmates, Molly figures the classes, workshops and rehearsals have 
made her more mature. "I have to be aware of everything. That makes me more 
aware of who I am and where I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Molly: "It's like life is a game and as an actor I'm a player in that 
game. And I can control where I'm going in the game."

THE GOODS; PROMISES, PROMISES; RETAILERS WILL KEEP THEIR PLEDGES TO OFFER THE 
BEST PRICE IN TOWN -- IF YOU ASK THEM TO.

 "Guaranteed Lowest Prices!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a real trust-inspirer, that guarantee, and it's everywhere -- on cameras, 
TVs, appliances, computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores are "really making two statements," says Herschel Elkins, watchdog of 
advertising claims as California's senior assistant attorney general. "The 
first is, 'We've checked and we have the lowest prices.' The second is: 'If we 
made a mistake, we'll give you the money back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't ask for more. To get it, however, you do have to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Such promises are thus half comfort, half hassle. "It means I can buy 
something and feel secure that if I find it for less, they'll refund me the 
difference," says Janet Morgan, a Los Angeles fashion wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Sony phone she bought at Circuit City was advertised at $10 less 
within the month, when she went back, the store questioned the ad and time 
elapsed before offering a partial refund.  
</P>
<P>
 "I did it on principle," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people wouldn't bother. So a store that makes the second promise can 
skimp on the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the guarantees could discourage low prices. Why offer every 
customer the lowest price in town when only some will demand it? 
</P>
<P>
 Low-price guarantees were probably a good idea originally, particularly in 
consumer electronics, where everyone sells the same brands of merchandise, 
competing mainly on price. Stores couldn't always keep up with competitors' 
rapid price changes. Consumers couldn't be sure that what they're buying 
wouldn't be priced lower next week in the same store or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The guarantee is supposed to relax shopping-weary consumers, "to make them 
happy and comfortable with what they're buying today," says Corey Polakov, 
advertising director for Adray's in Los Angeles. "We're telling them basically 
that you don't need to shop anyplace else; we guarantee we have the lowest 
price in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Store after store has jumped in, escalating their offers to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Some extend the time, first promising to beat all other current prices, then 
to beat any price over the next 30 days. Adray's now promises to refund a price 
difference for one full year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some increase the refund -- from the difference between the two prices to the 
difference plus 10%, 30%, 50% of the price difference. Last year, L.A. Tronics 
began advertising "Double (200%) the Difference." Says CEO Shawn Halimi: "We 
wanted to put the issue of price to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there are restrictions. The competitive dealer must be local, 
legitimate and established. The competitively priced merchandise must be the 
same model, brand-new, factory-sealed, and not a close-out. It must also be in 
stock at the store offering the lower price. "We couldn't compete with 
something that doesn't exist," Halimi says. 
</P>
<P>
 A customer claim must be verified -- by a print ad, a phone call or, if 
there's much at stake, a visit to the competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 A competitive price is often accepted without question. Sometimes, one dealer 
says, "you'll see (salesmen) verify it on their computer." 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be that hard to be the lowest. Around L.A., for example, there 
are only half a dozen big electronics and appliance vendors, all heavy 
advertisers. They all claim, moreover, to comparison-shop. "We're shopping the 
competition at all times," says Circuit City spokesman Paul Rakov at its 
Richmond, Va., headquarters, "and we'll adjust our prices accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 But they can't know everything. We shouldn't be surprised, for example, that 
the Good Guys kept selling the Olympus Zoom camera for $199 when Target was 
heavily advertising it for $189. (Good Guys met the price when asked.) Or that 
Adray's had a Hotpoint refrigerator marked $485 when L.A. Tronics was 
advertising it at $399. 
</P>
<P>
 What about when Adray's itself was advertising that Hotpoint for $399? Yes 
indeed, the salesman said, it was $485, just as the sign said. But when a 
customer produced Adray's ad, he accepted $399. 
</P>
<P>
 He "may not have known it was on sale," the store manager says. Everybody knew 
now, but two days later, still advertised at $399, the floor model was still 
marked $485.  
</P>
<P>
 They "should have gone and put the sale price on the item," says Adray's 
advertising director Polakov. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not guaranteed that stores adjust a posted price when they learn it's 
lower elsewhere, although "they're supposed to," Polakov says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, when someone comes in with an ad, they usually re-mark the price," 
says Keith Fox, spokesman for the Good Guys, "but it's not policy that they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Often it's just a one-day sale, " says Circuit City's Rakov. "It's a lot of 
trouble to adjust it for one day and then adjust it back up. We would give it 
if someone asked." 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest price in town isn't guaranteed to everybody -- just to those who 
know it.

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; PROGRAMS TAKE FLIGHT INTO YESTERYEAR 
</P>

<P>
 This year's Comdex -- the gargantuan computer trade show -- is brought to you 
by the letter P. PENTIUM! is the cry heard from many venues in the 2.5 million 
square feet of exhibition space. POWER PC! is shouted from others as the two 
big computer systems battle it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Also present are lots of Peripherals! PDAs! Pen computers! And, of course, as 
night falls here at the spiritual home of the pocket protector set, parties! 
</P>
<P>
 But in a lonely corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, one of three 
centers used for the weeklong show, there is a computer set up to show a "P" 
program that is not attracting much attention. That's a shame, because for all 
the high-tech wonders being touted at Comdex, this is the one that has the 
ability to transport its users back to a quieter, more idyllic time. 
</P>
<P>
 This P stands for Paper airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paper Planes," a new CD-ROM for both Macintosh and Windows from WordPerfect 
(list price is $29.95), shows you how to make a variety of gliders and stunt 
planes out of ordinary sheets of paper.  
</P>
<P>
 You might be wondering why a computer program would be needed to make one of 
the most low-tech of all playthings, but if, like me, you have problems folding 
a cloth napkin in a decorative fashion let alone a paper airplane, this type of 
program is a delight. 
</P>
<P>
 To use "Paper Planes," you choose which of the planes you want to make and 
then the program demonstrates on the screen, step by step, how to do each fold. 
I pick something called the "Extended Nakamura," described as a "great 
indoor-outdoor glider" that can be made with 25 folds. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm doing fine until about Step 17, when I am supposed to make a rather 
complex fold that seems easy when shown on the animated diagram. 
</P>
<P>
 My Comdex buddy Peter also tries the fold repeatedly without success. Finally, 
we follow the rest of the steps as well as we can and then Peter walks about 10 
feet away to gently launch our "Nakamura" toward me. 
</P>
<P>
 A lead weight could not drop faster. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, if not my execution, of "Paper Planes" is wonderful, though, and 
luckily there are two similar programs to be seen at Comdex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knowledge Adventure booth is showing, among other educational titles, 
"Aviation Adventure." This brand new CD-ROM for Windows teaches kids the 
principles of flight through animation, documentary footage, graphics and 
games. It includes a 12-model paper-airplane section. 
</P>
<P>
 Its folding animations are far easier to use than the WordPerfect version, and 
after a few moments, I'm ready to launch an odd-looking glider that looks more 
like a sugar scoop than an aircraft. Upward it flies, making a graceful little 
loop and then smoothly landing on a large model of an aircraft carrier set up 
inside the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Elation is too mild an adjective. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best is yet to come. At a small party that night, I see a 
demonstration of "The Greatest Paper Airplanes," the first product from 
Tucson-based KittyHawk Software. This floppy-disk, $29.95 program now available 
in Windows (the Mac version is to be released shortly) can be ordered by 
calling (800) 777-5745. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes with 25 paper-airplane models categorized as darts, gliders, jets, 
supersonic transports and star ships.  
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration sequences are nothing less than elegant in design and are 
completely controllable, allowing you to watch a fold not only from different 
angles, but at different speeds and in close-up or long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, in the convention pressroom, I load the program into an IBM 
to make a rather complicated model called the "Albatross," described as an 
"all-purpose glider (that can) float or be made to do acrobatics." Several 
fellow members of the press, all of whom seem far more versed in high-tech 
wizardry than I, gather around my screen to play with the program and ensure my 
folds are carefully rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 We head out to a hallway to try out our creation. 
</P>
<P>
 I launch it gently and the Albatross sails upward to the "aahs" of the small 
crowd. Then it banks slightly to the left, goes over a partition and heads 
downward out of sight into a meeting room. We quickly push open the door to 
find the Albatross face up in the middle of a bowl of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, whatever meeting was in the room was over and no one was there. We 
quickly retrieve the plane and head back to the press room to make more. 
</P>
<P>
 We now had more reason than ever to be excited about Pentiums and Power PCs. 
They can give us back a bit of our childhoods.

R S V P; CARING MADE BENEFIT A HIT

<P>
 The "Night at Sardi's" theme provided a friendly and intimate setting as the 
ballroom of the Regent Beverly Wilshire was transformed Wednesday night into a 
replica of the famous New York restaurant for the third annual Alzheimer's 
Assn. of Los Angeles benefit dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests passed under a doorway decorated with caricatures of the show-biz 
elite. Numbered baseball cards designated the tables in keeping with the 
entertainment, a zippy rendition of songs from "Damn Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the sense of care and understanding shared by family members and 
their friends, drawn together by the effects of the disease, that was the most 
winning element of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those present were Lorraine and Sid Sheinberg; Mike Farrell and his 
wife, Shelley Fabares; Vincent Sardi; Stuart Roth, chairman of the National 
Alzheimer's Assn.; Larry Varnes, president of the local chapter, and the 
evening's co-chairwoman Laurie Burrows Grad, whose family, including her 
director-brother James, had saluted her in the program with the appropriate 
slogan, "Whatever Laurie wants, Laurie gets!" 
</P>
<P>
 What she got was a good time for all, despite the underlying sorrow of the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In her welcoming remarks, Fabares, whose mother, Elsa Rose, died of the 
illness in 1992, quoted former President Ronald Reagan's letter, which revealed 
his Alzheimer's diagnosis and mentioned his concern for the toll it would take 
on his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "His courage in coming forward is deeply appreciated, and we cannot help but 
identify because our organization's motto is 'Someone to Stand by You,' " the 
co-star of "Coach" said as she introduced the evening's honorees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has really been a transforming moment for us," said the association's 
executive director, Peter Braun, referring to the attention created by the 
Reagan revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an illness which affects the entire family -- the patient is silent, 
the care-giver overwhelmed -- but we, as a network, can help to ease the 
burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Underwritten by Home Savings of America, the evening's program included awards 
that reflected the family-support theme. Isabel Sanford spoke of her sister 
Emma Kelly's "smile, her helping hand, her ear to always listen and her warm 
embrace," as she made the presentation of the Professional Care-Giver Award to 
Kelly, who was director of the Alzheimer's day-care program at the Assistance 
League's Hollywood Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Film director Donald Petrie was honored for his work on the movie "Grumpy Old 
Men," deemed a respectful and affectionate depiction of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportscaster Tim Ryan, whose wife, Lee, has Alzheimer's, made the presentation 
to baseball great Keith Hernandez, whose mother, Jacquelyn, died of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to watch his mother disappear before his eyes," said Ryan, referring 
movingly to "the long goodby" loved ones experience as they watch the disease 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the board of directors of the National Alzheimer's Assn., 
Hernandez said, "This is my first award for something I've done to give back. 
As a baseball player I had no peripheral vision. This work has opened up my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time for the ex-Met to say, "Let's play ball," and to savor the 
fun of watching a spirited cast, which included Hal Linden, Charles Nelson 
Reilly, Patrick Cassidy, Phylicia Rashad, Gloria Loring and Jerry Van Dyke sing 
songs from "Damn Yankees," including, of course, "You Gotta Have Heart."

<P>
 William Gaddis' scathing and humorous examination of a litigious America, "A 
Frolic of His Own," has won the 1994 for fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement Wednesday marked the second time Gaddis, 71, has captured the 
prestigious prize. Eighteen years ago, he won for his second novel, "JR." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaddis gave a self-deprecating acceptance speech, thanking the judges for 
selecting a book that "I've been told is not reader-friendly." At a news 
conference, he said he had spent six years working on the novel, his fourth, 
which is written in dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It chronicles the woes of a college professor who has an accident and embarks 
on a series of legal actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonfiction winner was Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland's "How We Die: Reflections on 
Life's Final Chapter," a meditation on death and the choices it poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuland, 63, teaches at Yale University and has written books on medical 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The poetry prize was awarded to James Tate, a University of Massachusetts 
professor, for his collection, "Worshipful Company of Fletchers." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the book awards carries a $10,000 prize.  
</P>
<P>
 In a separate presentation, poet Gwendolyn Brooks received the 1994 National 
Book Foundation Medal for "distinguished contribution to American letters." 
</P>
<P>
 Finalists in the fiction category included "Moses Supposes," by Ellen Currie; 
"White Man's Grave," by Richard Dooling; "The Bird Artist," by 1987 finalist 
Howard Norman, and "The Collected Stories," by Grace Paley, a 1975 finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nonfiction category, much of the interest centered on "Strange Justice: 
The Selling of Clarence Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
 The book by Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer discusses Thomas' appointment to the 
U.S. Supreme Court despite sexual harassment allegations by his former aide, 
Anita Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nonfiction finalists included "The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story 
From Early America," by John Demos; "Fatheralong: A Meditation on Fathers, 
Sons, Race and Society," by John Edgar Wideman, and "In Pharaoh's Army: 
Memories of the Lost War," by Tobias Wolff. 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry finalists were "Hinge & Sign: Poems," by Heather McHugh; "An Altogether 
Different Language," by Anne Porter; "Study for the World's Body: New and 
Selected Poems," by David St. John, and Richard Howard's collection, "Like Most 
Revelations."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: CHANNEL 2 STEPS UP TO THE DEFENSE STAND AFTER 
ITO IS CRITICIZED FOR INTERVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Deep thinkers . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not that some stations would ever pretend their anchors are something they're 
not or anything, but the following memo recently went out to KCBS-TV Channel 2 
news writers: 
</P>
<P>
 "When scripting questions for anchors to use in interviewing guests . . . 
please write the questions on the left side of the script . . . not the right 
side! Anchors prefer to have the questions on their hard copy . . . on the left 
side of the script . . . not in the prompter on the right side." 
</P>
<P>
 Where in-studio guests possibly would be able to observe for themselves that 
these anchor intellects are reading questions written by others? 
</P>
<P>
 If only some anchors had TelePrompTers in their brains when they did attempt 
to ad-lib. Or was 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. KCBS anchor Michael Tuck reading from a 
script Tuesday when -- injecting his own opinion into what is labeled a 
newscast -- he raised the sour grapes issue concerning a Los Angeles Times 
editorial critical of Judge Lance A. Ito for agreeing to an exclusive interview 
with Tritia Toyota that was run this week on Channel 2? Tuck wondered aloud 
whether The Times would have taken its condemning position had it been the 
recipient of Ito's generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems to have eluded Tuck is that no one has slammed Channel 2 for doing 
the interview -- there's hardly a news organization around that wouldn't have 
wanted to question Ito outside the courtroom -- only the judge for making 
himself available to the station after being so publicly critical of media 
excesses regarding coverage of the Simpson-Goldman murder case. By helping feed 
the whipped-up frenzy, Ito, not Channel 2, was the one straddling a double 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
 In further rebuttal, Tuck weighed in with another unlabeled commentary 
following Wednesday's taped Ito interview segment. "The judge has criticized 
the media for irresponsible or erroneous reporting," he said (or read) to 
Toyota and his co-anchor, Ann Martin. "This (the interview) is not 
irresponsible or erroneous. What do you say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and Toyota murmured their agreement, apparently satisfied that they had 
demolished the detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Again, they just don't get it. Infinitely more windblown than the segmented 
interview itself -- consisting mainly of benign musings unrelated to the 
Simpson-Goldman case -- has been Channel 2's rhetoric in promoting it. By 
week's end, Ito had come face to face not only with the low-key Toyota but also 
with November ratings sweeps madness. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in fact, Ito indicated he was having second thoughts about the 
interview after a prospective alternate juror he was quizzing in the 
double-homicide case mentioned seeing one of the full-page newspaper ads 
Channel 2 bought to promote it. He wouldn't have agreed to the interview, Ito 
said, "if I had known they were going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He should have known, given the record of Channel 2, a station that not only 
has made some horrendous gaffes in its own Simpson-Goldman reporting but also 
continues to air and heavily advertise syndicated programs dedicated to 
sensationalizing the case, such as "Hard Copy" and "Geraldo." 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding Tuesday's 4 p.m. "Action News," for example, was a "Geraldo" episode 
that featured a computer-generated, "blow-by-blow" depiction of the murders of 
Nicole Simpson Brown and Ronald Lyle Goldman, plus "graphic blood evidence" 
allegedly linking O.J. Simpson to the murders. And oh yes, there on the set was 
a white Ford Bronco like Simpson's famous one that has become an integral part 
of the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, though, for "Geraldo" had promised to start the program with a 
warning to Simpson jurors and any other potential viewers "who are at all 
squeamish" to turn off the show immediately. When it comes to exploitation, 
there's nothing squeamish about Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of talk shows and interviews, if Katie Couric's questioning of 
David Smith on Tuesday's "NBC Dateline" and Wednesday's "Today" programs 
weren't sad enough on their own merits, NBC News did its best to massage 
viewers' tear ducts by deploying sorrowful music with funeral and home-movie 
footage of the two tots that accompanied Couric's chat with their remarkably 
composed young father, whose estranged wife is charged with the South Carolina 
murders of their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Where have all the standards gone? There was a time when applying music to 
news coverage was a no-no because its purpose -- like an editorial -- was to 
manipulate the responses of viewers rather than allow them to judge the 
material on its own merits and come to whatever conclusions they saw fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Music plus news equals show business, something that too many newscasts 
increasingly rely on. Alas, the music will stay, as will self-serving 
ratings-sweeps stunts disguised as news, such as Thursday's and today's cynical 
relocation of "Today" co-hosts Couric and Bryant Gumbel to the Los Angeles set 
of their network's hit medical series, "ER." And while in the neighborhood, 
these kids managed to find time to drop in on NBC's hit comedy "Friends." 
</P>
<P>
 One morning Couric and Gumbel are doing legitimate news, the next shilling for 
their employer's entertainment series. 
</P>
<P>
 And hey, on "CBS This Morning," is that a penetrating interview that host 
Harry Smith is doing this week with David Letterman ("How's your mother?") or 
what? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's increasingly routine for news-driven morning shows to become display 
windows for programs that their networks want to sell to viewers. Thus, because 
it is a ratings sweeps period, Charles Gibson, co-host of ABC's "Good Morning 
America," this week interviewed Ted Koppel, host of ABC's "Nightline," about 
the latter's weeklong series on prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically "A Night on Cell Block H," Wednesday's program tracking Koppel's 
overnight stay at Central Prison in Raleigh, N.C., while armed with only his 
tiny Super 8 minicam. Among other things, Koppel mentioned to Gibson that the 
prisoners he interviewed were "forthcoming." Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Any peek at a forbidden universe is interesting, no matter the circumstances. 
Plus, Koppel is a real smart guy who's been around. And give him credit. When 
most TV reporters venture inside the Big House wearing a denim shirt during 
ratings sweeps, it's Charles Manson they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 But think about it. If you're incarcerated, just how candid are you going to 
be when chatting with a famous TV journalist who's toting even a teensy-weensy 
camera? 
</P>
<P>
 Early in my own career, I did a series of articles from inside Joliet State 
Prison in Illinois and thought I really had something. Nevertheless, a veteran 
prison chaplain there ridiculed my naivete in believing that what I had heard 
from inmates during my two days at Joliet in any way approximated reality. He 
noted that because I was interviewing men with their own agendas in a 
controlled, cocooned, unnatural environment, I would come away with impressions 
that would be mostly valueless, if not downright distorted and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I was too heady to heed him at the time, he was correct about my 
foolishness, and I recalled his words while watching "Nightline" Wednesday 
night. I didn't see the rest of the Koppel series, and perhaps the other 
evenings were crammed with remarkable insights. But Wednesday? 
</P>
<P>
 One inmate with whom Koppel chatted said he agreed with Dan Quayle about a 
need for more family values. "That's what's wrong with this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I are not big guys, right?" Koppel said to another inmate, a young, 
nice-looking fellow with long brown hair. "Guys who want sex pick on a little 
guy, right? That ever happen to you?" After hemming and hawing, the man said it 
hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Another inmate insisted to Koppel that he was Elvis Presley. "Does a man have 
to play a fool to survive?" Koppel asked with the same earnest but stiff 
demeanor he displays with U.S. and world leaders. When Elvis responded with a 
quizzical look that seemed to ridicule Koppel, the ABC anchorman replied, 
"That's a serious question." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it was. But where was Henry Kissinger when Koppel needed him? 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, "Nightline" didn't play "Scarface" music during the 
prison interviews, and no one had to ghostwrite Koppel's questions.

LENO CONTINUES TO CLOSE GAP WITH LETTERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Letterman still hasn't lost in the ratings to Jay Leno, but Leno 
continues to close the gap. Last week his "Tonight Show" on NBC was only 
one-tenth of a point behind Letterman's "Late Show" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This marks the closest competitive position between the two shows ever with 
original telecasts," NBC said Thursday.

COMEDIAN GETS ON THE FAST TRACK WITH HIS MAC ATTACK; COMEDY: CHICAGO'S BERNIE 
MAC SPICES HIS ROUTINES WITH AN R&B BAND AND DANCERS, ALL PART OF HIS GOAL TO 
PROVIDE FULL-SERVICE ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the crowded, clamorous arena of stand-up comedy, it's often difficult to 
make enough noise to get yourself noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago comic Bernie Mac has discovered that it doesn't hurt to back up the 
punch lines with a nine-piece R&B outfit and a clutch of comely dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mac is now commanding theater stages during his national "Who Ya Wit" 
tour, which comes to the Wiltern Theatre tonight. The show mixes Mac's ribald 
observations and character routines with an exuberantly flashy vaudeville-style 
stage show. It's put the hard-working, 37-year-old comic finally, undeniably, 
at the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working in clubs for 21 years, but I got the feeling that the 
comedy world was at a standstill," the affable Mac, taking a break from 
rehearsals in an L.A. hotel room, says with a shrug. "I wanted to get back to 
the basics of entertainment, when audiences were so excited about what they 
were going to see. The lights go down, the curtain opens up, and it's 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mac credits a good deal of his inspiration to the old-school comics that he 
watched as a novice. "When you put Moms Mabley, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx and 
Dick Gregory up on a stage, you saw very strong, very different styles. You 
didn't forget who you were looking at. Now, you get the same act from a bunch 
of different people, and nobody's really being entertained. Some of the comics 
say the audience is dumb, but those people out there aren't stupid. When they 
see something unique and exciting, they wake up."  
</P>
<P>
 A conversation with Mac has to make room for a full cast of characters -- 
stern preachers, slick show-biz sharks, Frank Sinatra and Bill Clinton all have 
their say as Mac speaks.  
</P>
<P>
 He says that moving his characters and material from club bills into a 
full-blown theatrical revue was not a particularly daunting challenge because 
he felt he'd had plenty of practice.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been in me. Since I was 4, I wanted to be an entertainer, and I 
ran the 'Bernie Mac Show' in my house as soon as I could convince my brothers 
and sisters to do it. I was tough too," he says with a laugh. "They had to come 
up with new songs and new jokes every time or they couldn't be in it."  
</P>
<P>
 The young Mac made a neighborhood name for himself entertaining at church 
functions, school talent shows, and in any park or alley where he could get a 
crowd together. Eventually, he broke into Chicago's club circuit, and his 
career began to soar in 1990, after he won a national comedy competition. Soon, 
he was opening shows for the likes of Dionne Warwick, Natalie Cole and Barry 
White. Film parts followed, with Mac contributing small comic turns in "Mo' 
Money," "Who's the Man" and "House Party 3." Most recently, he scored his first 
non-comedy role as a broken-down ballplayer in "Above the Rim."  
</P>
<P>
 Mac also spent a summer as host of the touring version of the Def Comedy Jam, 
but he's quick to put distance between himself and many of the show's younger, 
raunchier comics.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use four-letter words for the sake of using them," he says, "and I 
don't use them in conversation. I might do a bit here and a bit there to 
attract your interest, but what I've got to say is what I'm proud of. There's 
got to be some love and care and respect in the message behind the words. Some 
guys go overboard with the raw language, because that's all they've got." Mac 
discovered just how well his earthy comedy could carry a heartfelt message five 
years ago, when he was a roaring hit at the unlikeliest of places -- his 
grandfather's funeral.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big man, and everybody respected him. At the funeral, nobody knew 
what to say or how to act. It was just too sad. I got up and went straight to 
the microphone and said, 'This is what I remember about Dad.' I told a story 
about him and did his voice and gestures. People were trying to fight back 
laughs -- they didn't know if it was OK. Then my auntie screamed, 'That's him!' 
and all the laughs came out. I ended up doing an hour and a half."  
</P>
<P>
 That emotionally charged performance opened up an odd new circuit for Mac. 
"Everybody kept calling me up," he says with a smile. " 'Hey, Bernie, my mother 
died. Can you come over?' 'You remember my cousin, don't you? Can you come 
over?' I wouldn't say no. It was deep, because it meant so much to people. I'd 
do it again."  
</P>
<P>
 Creating comedy that means a great deal to the people it entertains is a part 
of what Mac calls his KISS system. "Keep It Simple, Stupid," he explains. "When 
you put pressure on yourself to come up with extravagant material and you take 
yourself too seriously, you run into problems. Keep it simple. Funny is funny. 
And I'll make anybody laugh. Just give me the mike. It's simple -- I'm going up 
on that stage for an hour, and I guarantee that before I leave it, I'm going to 
make you laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bernie Mac performs at 8 p.m. today, Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd. 
Tickets $30.50, available through Ticketmaster, (213) 480-3232, or at the 
Wiltern box office, (213) 380-5005.

'ED WOOD' GIVES REPRISE TO ED WOOD PAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conrad Brooks, whom the New York Times once called "the John Gielgud of 
B-movies," stands in the center of the Nuart Theatre lobby beside a folding 
card table stacked with memorabilia. He's peddling publicity stills of his 
appearances in Ed Wood Jr. films for $5 a pop -- "These are rare shots," he 
tells prospective buyers -- and trying to interest patrons in a video titled 
"Deadly Amazons" -- "My latest starring role," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks is the guest of a midnight screening of Wood's transvestite opus, "Glen 
or Glenda," a movie even less coherent than his most famous work, the legendary 
(if awful) "Plan 9 From Outer Space," and is loving every minute of it. He 
compares the appearance to the days, back in the '40s, when stars such as the 
Dead End Kids and the Three Stooges would make barnstorming runs on movie 
houses across the country: "People would love that, to have a celebrity appear 
in town." 
</P>
<P>
 He's even given the opportunity to introduce the movie, and field questions 
from the scattered filmgoers. One woman asks, was Bela Lugosi really an addict? 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks semi-dodges the question, not wanting to speak ill of a colleague, no 
matter how dead he might be, before answering. "Yes, but he was very cool about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman poses a more philosophical query: Why have Wood's films achieved 
their cult status? His reply is purely pragmatic: "Because people keep coming 
to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 A man asks Brooks' opinion on "Plan 9," in which Brooks played a befuddled 
policeman. "I was paid for what I was doing, so it was fine by me," he answers, 
like a true Hollywood professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Burton's recent biopic, "Ed Wood," has given Brooks, now 64, a renewed 
cachet, however modest, around town. Before the Nuart gig, Brooks spent several 
weeks with his card table and stills at the Los Feliz Theatre, selling 15 to 20 
photos on a good weekend. Had the film been more of a success -- critical 
adulation couldn't bring it much more than $5 million at the box office -- he 
might be doing even bigger business. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose Los Feliz because of its proximity to the location where he, at age 
17 in 1948, first met Wood, near the auteur's home by the Vista Theater. Over 
tea at a diner near his Atwater Village apartment, Brooks recalls that 
momentous encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He considered himself a movie producer even then -- even though he hadn't 
made a movie, he's telling us how important he's gonna be," Brooks says, with 
the amiable, almost nervous laugh that frequently punctuates his conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 That first day, Wood revealed to the teen-age Brooks and his brother Henry how 
he enjoyed being a girl. "We went into his apartment, and he went to the 
washroom, and came out as a woman," Brooks recalls. "We were from Baltimore, 
and he figured that we were a couple of Eastern boys, and we could understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood was eventually evicted from his Los Feliz-adjacent address, and Brooks 
headed back to Baltimore, only to return to Hollywood and run into Wood again 
in 1952. Wood was then preparing to shoot "Glen or Glenda," and cast Brooks in 
a variety of small roles in the film -- a newspaper reporter, a banker, an 
accuser in the dream sequence, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed told us the rushes were great, that Paramount was gonna buy the picture," 
Brooks remembers. Of course, that didn't happen, and Brooks was assigned other 
roles in other Wood fiascoes before finding work in other low-budget efforts: 
Recent entries on his resume include "Bikini Drive-In" and "Misfit Patrol." He 
also makes the rounds of sci-fi conventions, keeping the Wood myth alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks calls Wood "a classy guy, very classy" and "a star-maker," but recalls 
the filmmaker's later years, the descent into skin flicks and alcoholism, with 
a sense of wistfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have these minor heart attacks," he says, adding that he would 
spring for Wood's booze and cigarettes. "I was there. I'd say, 'You gotta go to 
the doctor,' and he'd say, 'No, just pour me a glass.' He'd take a shot of 
liquor and be OK a few minutes later. But I thought he'd go right then and 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks loves Burton's film -- he has a cameo as a bartender, and says, "After 
40 years, it's the first good film I've ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, he's enjoyed the chance to parlay his association with Wood 
into an opportunity to meet his public. "People come and see me, and they're so 
excited. . . . Some of 'em don't know what to say, they're kind of shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Wood -- and "Ed Wood" -- have given Brooks a renewed purpose in his life. 
"People ask me questions, and give me a chance to talk," he says. "Now I feel I 
really did something in Hollywood."

CAMARILLO BALKS AT PAYING FOR BALLPARK; STADIUM: CITY LEADERS SAY THEY CANNOT 
AFFORD AN EVEN THREE-WAY SPLIT OF THE $15.6 MILLION FOR A MINOR LEAGUE FIELD IN 
VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Although Camarillo has grudgingly joined neighboring cities in an ambitious 
plan to put a minor league ballpark in Ventura, city leaders say they do not 
intend to pay one-third of the $15.6 million needed for the project, and may 
not contribute any money at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to keep Camarillo involved in the plan, members of the tri-city 
committee that originated the stadium idea have suggested splitting costs on a 
per-capita basis -- a plan that would benefit the much smaller Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, Ventura and Oxnard would have to pay the bulk of the costs 
for the 5,500-seat ballpark, or the project would die altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The three cities expect to vote in the next six weeks on whether to form a 
joint-powers authority that would own and operate the stadium and share its 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the baseball committee, made up of council members and staff from 
the three cities, had previously agreed to split the costs of the ballpark 
evenly. Each city would have spent about $600,000 a year for 20 years under 
that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see if we can come to any agreement on a (joint-powers authority) now," 
said Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose, a committee member. "There are certainly many 
ways to change the formula of how much each city pays, and that is probably the 
direction we are going to have to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom said the committee will probably present the 
cities with a proposal for a per-capita funding plan under which Camarillo 
would pay only about $330,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "While everybody is still in the game, we are trying to work on an agreement 
that would be fair to everybody," Tingstrom said. "If we can do this jointly, 
that is the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said he would never support funding the ballpark 
on a per-capita basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can forget about that as far as I'm concerned," Lopez said. "That always 
surfaces when it comes time to fund things . . . I don't think anyone (in 
Oxnard) would vote for that." 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-hour debate Wednesday night, the Camarillo City Council voted 3 
to 2 to support the location of the proposed Class A baseball stadium in a 
field near the Ventura Auto Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But three of the five council members made it clear that they would not spend 
public funds on a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote for this," said councilman Mike Morgan, who changed his 
mind and cast the deciding vote on Wednesday. "But I'm telling you now: If this 
means spending public money, I'll vote against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gose and Tingstrom said the cities would not have to put up $15.6 million if a 
joint-powers authority is approved, because the committee is planning an 
aggressive fund-raising campaign that hopes to net a substantial portion of the 
needed millions.  
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said the fund-raising effort will target ordinary residents, as well 
as the county's major corporations and wealthy citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've raised $4.5 million in property over the last two months, and we 
weren't doing too much," Tingstrom said. "We're trying to make this thing 
happen without too much public money."  
</P>
<P>
 The three cities have been cooperating since the spring when Joe Gagliardi, 
president of the California League, promised to bring a Class A team to the 
county if someone built a stadium. The cities have spent $85,000 to study the 
idea.

DEBATE ON REPLACING WITTENBERG BEGINS; GOVERNMENT: SOME FAVOR A LOCAL SEARCH 
FOR THE COUNTY'S NEXT CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR, BUT OTHERS SAY IT SHOULD BE 
NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after Ventura County's veteran chief administrator announced he is 
leaving to take a new job, officials were already debating when to begin the 
process of finding a replacement for Richard Wittenberg -- and how far to stray 
in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the officials who will hire Wittenberg's successor said Thursday 
that the search should be nationwide, others favored hiring a local candidate 
whose credentials are known and not wasting any time. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was clear that some local candidates already had strong backers among 
the county supervisors who will hire a new chief executive after Wittenberg, 
the county's top manager for 16 years, leaves for Santa Clara County on Jan. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial reaction is to hire a research firm to conduct a nationwide 
search," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. "I'd like to cast the net as wide as 
possible to make sure we have the best candidate we can find." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor John Flynn said he favors looking for a replacement within the 
county before launching a more extensive search. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some outstanding city managers here in the county and people 
internally who could fill the position superbly," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn suggested Simi Valley City Manager Lin Koester and Thousand Oaks City 
Manager Grant Brimhall as candidates. "Those two have great capabilities," 
Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others mentioned by officials as potential replacements for Wittenberg 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Penny Bohannon, county lobbyist and legislative analyst; 
</P>
<P>
 * Pierre Durand, administrator of Ventura County Medical Center; 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Hirtensteiner, county assistant administrative officer; 
</P>
<P>
 * James McBride, county counsel; 
</P>
<P>
 * Marty Robinson, county deputy administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of them are very capable people who have done outstanding jobs where they 
are now," Kildee said. "But I'd still like to look at other chief executive 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn cited advantages in selecting a local applicant for the job. "They would 
be familiar with the issues, and we would know them and their capabilities," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, recruiting a new county manager may not be so easy. Santa Clara 
County, for example, had been courting Wittenberg for 14 months before he 
agreed Wednesday to become that county's top executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of people who want to work in county government," Santa 
Clara County Supervisor Ron Gonzales said. "Counties are being squeezed 
financially, so the jobs tend not to look so attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high cost of housing here and continuing budget problems, Ventura 
County has some qualities that could make recruiting easier, Kildee said. 
"Ventura County is an attractive place to live, and I think it has a reputation 
for being a well-run county," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee said the county should hire a search firm as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Susan Lacey said the board should wait until two newly elected 
supervisors who take office Jan. 3 -- Frank Schillo and Judy Mikels -- are 
sworn in. And she favors a candidate with county experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running a city and running a county are two different critters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Mikels split on the scope of the search and whether it should 
begin right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the search should be nationwide but should not begin until 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems appropriate that the five people who will make the final decision 
have some input on setting the parameters" for hiring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she would like to consider local managers first and that the 
search should begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Flynn, she said Simi Valley manager Koester would be an ideal candidate. 
He was director of the county's Resource Management Agency from 1971 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next question is, would he be interested?" Mikels said.  
</P>
<P>
 Koester did not rule out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a general interest," he said. "But it's too premature to throw my hat 
in the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 For Koester or Brimhall, the reason for moving to the county would not be 
financial, officials said. They are already the highest-paid city managers in 
the county, with base salaries comparable to Wittenberg's $123,600 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be more of a career incentive," Mikels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohannon said she will apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did apply for a CAO's job in Solano County," she said. "But Ventura County 
is home." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said Hirtensteiner may be asked to serve as Wittenberg's 
temporary replacement. But he would not comment on his own prospects for the 
job.

TEMBLOR TEAMWORK; RESCUE CREWS FROM ACROSS COUNTY PRACTICE QUAKE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the dust settled, Point Mugu firefighter Harry Kengen lay sprawled on his 
back in a dark tunnel, half-buried beneath a pile of chipped concrete blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just waiting to be discovered," he said, brushing himself off after 
being dug out. "The dogs finally found me." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't an emergency situation Thursday. But for the 50 or more firefighters 
from throughout Ventura County, it might as well have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of search-and-rescue workers used a simulated earthquake to brush up on 
training, break in equipment provided by the federal government and learn how 
to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding out it's going to take more than one agency to do the job," 
Point Mugu firefighter Derek Harper said. "If we ever have another earthquake 
in the county, we'll have to put this training to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a Point Mugu building scheduled to be demolished this year, 
search-and-rescue workers constructed a disaster scene that included collapsed 
walls, buried victims and dense thickets of concrete and wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews used electronic listening devices, trained dogs and hand-held 
cameras to seek out victims, then practiced rescuing them from beneath piles of 
wood- and concrete-laced rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is built to simulate how an apartment building would collapse," Ventura 
County Fire Capt. Gary Smith said of the earthquake training scene, which took 
weeks to construct. "You have to tunnel vertically to find your victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Although such devastation was not abundant in Ventura County after the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake, emergency officials learned a valuable lesson: They need 
training to save people like the residents of the Northridge Meadows apartment 
building, where 16 people were crushed to death when the first floor of the 
three-story complex collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disaster-management community has been telling us for years that old 
brick and masonry buildings are one of our big hazards for loss of life," said 
Gordon Hildreth, an emergency coordinator for Ventura County's team, a group of 
volunteers that more often responds to reports of lost or injured hikers than 
of earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong training session Thursday, which included response crews from 
Ventura, Oxnard, Point Mugu, Camarillo State Hospital and Ventura County, also 
gave firefighters a chance to put to work a series of tools provided to the 
county by the federal government as surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The package includes a mobile compressor, air chisels, drills and hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want this stuff at my house if there was an emergency," said Sandi 
Wells, the Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer George Taylor of the Ventura Fire Department said the training effort 
would help the various departments better coordinate their response in the 
event of a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope we never have to use it, but that's why we're working with the other 
agencies," Taylor said. "The biggest thing is it's a logistical nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand Thursday were three dogs trained to sniff out humans buried deep 
beneath piles of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, an Airedale terrier that had been put to work at the Northridge Meadows 
complex on Jan. 17, helped locate Kengen after a half-hour wait in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "These dogs have real good noses on them," said Dan Lindsay, a captain with 
the Ontario Airport Fire Department who manages a trained-dog program. "They're 
real good workers."

SCHOOL OFFICIALS SIT OUT PROP. 187 COURT BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS and TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Proposition 187 now stalled in the courts, Ventura County school 
officials said they are relieved someone has asked state and federal judges to 
decide the measure's legality. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are glad it's not them. 
</P>
<P>
 While three of the state's largest school systems -- Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and Sacramento -- have sued the state over the proposition, smaller 
districts in Ventura County and elsewhere in California have mostly stood back 
from the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically spectators at this time," said Jeffrey Baarstadt, assistant 
superintendent for the Hueneme district. "And I think we're very content to be 
spectators." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local school officials said they are only too happy to have courts take 
on the burden of deciding whether to allow the measure's enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This takes the politics out of the hands of the local district and gets the 
emotion out" of the debate at local schools, said Don Hodes, superintendent of 
Oxnard's Ocean View School District, where junior high school students joined 
some of the walkouts prior to the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Because students know school officials have no influence on the court 
decisions, Hodes said, "it lessens the tension in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The only link local school districts have to the legal battle is that most 
happen to be members of the California School Boards Assn. Education Legal 
Alliance, a group that joined the suit by the big-city school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Ventura County school officials -- even those who publicly opposed 
Proposition 187 before the election -- are staying out of the spotlight now 
that the measure has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are out of the spotlight, they are also not taking the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, by contrast, the school board 
president faces a possible recall effort because of the district's suit 
challenging the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the lawsuits over Proposition 187 argue against public agencies 
spending taxpayers' money to fight an initiative approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But local school officials said they will be grateful for the courts' 
interpretation of whether the proposition can stand up as law. Whatever the 
outcome, officials said, they will follow the direction of the state Department 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 As Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Bill Studt said: "We've been 
directed to hold tight." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after the election, a state Superior Court issued a temporary 
restraining order barring public schools from implementing the measure until at 
least Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Then this week a federal district judge in Los Angeles issued yet another 
temporary restraining order that blocks immediate enforcement of nearly all of 
the proposition's bans on health care, education and social services for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 To reassure worried families, Ventura County school officials this week are 
sending letters to parents of all 119,000 public school students in the county 
advising that enforcement of the measure is at least temporarily on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically out of our hands right now," Simi Valley school board trustee 
Debbie Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District is likewise encouraging all 
students to enroll for the spring quarter that begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were some students out there who thought, 'I don't know whether I 
should enroll or not,' we just want to let them know that nothing has changed," 
college district spokeswoman Barbara Buttner said. "We still want them to come 
and sign up for their classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will change at Moorpark, Ventura and Oxnard colleges, Buttner said, 
until the courts give the state's community college system direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the matter to the courts and to the agencies engaging in the lawsuits 
also allows local schools to get on with what they do best. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the very point of time the court issued their restraining order, our 
folks were on to other business," said Jerry Gross, superintendent of the 
Conejo Valley Unified School District. "We have school to run."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DEADLINE NEARS FOR SCHOOL TRANSFERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents in the Oxnard Union High School District who want to take advantage of 
a new state law on school choice have until Wednesday to apply to transfer 
students to a different school within the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which took effect early this year, school officials must allow 
students to transfer to any school in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school must have room for additional students and the transfers must 
not cause major shifts in the school's racial balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of crowding in the Oxnard district, some of the five high schools have 
only limited space for transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested parents should call the district office at 385-2500, or visit one 
of the school offices to get a brochure explaining the transfer process. MAIA

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; IS CRA THE BEST PATH FOR 
QUAKE VICTIMS?

 Proposals to create redevelopment project areas for earthquake-damaged 
neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley are coming before the Los Angeles City 
Council for deliberation, sparking controversy over whether redevelopment is an 
appropriate tool for rebuilding efforts. The strongest protests, thus far, have 
come from Sherman Oaks, where about 40 demonstrators paraded in front of 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's field office Monday to oppose a 900-acre project 
proposed for Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours of angry testimony during a Tuesday public hearing then delayed a City 
Council decision on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay signaled an uphill battle for five additional redevelopment area 
proposals for "ghost town" communities throughout the Valley and in Hollywood, 
as residents and City Council members expressed concerns over the Community 
Redevelopment Agency's poor reputation in managing previous projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Is redevelopment an effective tool for earthquake recovery? 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Schmidt, president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce: 
</P>
<P>
 "Many multifamily dwelling owners in the 'ghost town' areas of Sherman Oaks 
cannot obtain adequate financing to restore their property. If (the buildings) 
just sit there, they'll be occupied by vagrants or become a nuisance. The CRA 
is one of the many ways to rehabilitate property. There will be at least $12 
million available. The whole agenda is to restore the neighborhood to what it 
was on Jan 16. Why discard a financial resource to help get us back there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Epstein, co-chairman of the CRA Investigative Committee in Sherman Oaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spoken to at least 1,000 home and business owners about redevelopment, 
and maybe a dozen support it. The Sherman Oaks plan allows the CRA eminent 
domain, which gives them authorization to go in and seize property, putting 
them in the real estate business. Once they own the property, the (developer 
bidding process) requires an agency to have prior experience with 
redevelopment. This excludes private investors and favors major contractors. 
The CRA reports that there are 800 multifamily residential units and 200 
commercial buildings in need of assistance in Sherman Oaks. Our own survey 
determined 47 multifamily units and seven commercial buildings await repairs. 
Numbers shouldn't be exaggerated to cause hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry B. Coleman, co-chairman of the North Valley Property Owners Coalition: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have documented at least 55 different federal and state options 
communities can explore before they need to look to redevelopment areas. I 
challenge anyone to find one person with quake-damaged property that cannot 
benefit from one of those 55 agencies. By definition, redevelopment is a term 
to be used as a last resort."  
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gaines, board member, Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sherman Oaks plan denies the CRA any power over land-use zoning or 
entitlements in the area, and it only allows them to have eminent domain powers 
in special cases, with heavy restrictions. Condominium owners say eminent 
domain would be helpful. If the CRA could take over those (condo) units not 
complying with a site's rebuilding efforts, they would get those efforts on 
track faster. They would only have authority when property owners (seek) 
assistance. The CRA also must put an acquired property back in private hands 
within six months and would not be able to join any two properties together."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; GIRL TESTIFIES IN TRIAL OF TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo teen-ager testified Thursday that she willingly engaged in sexual 
conduct with her church teacher but stopped short of intercourse because of her 
fear that she would become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old girl testified for a full day in the child molestation trial 
of Robert C. Rose. She cried at times as she described how their relationship 
developed from friendship to romance, starting with a kiss exchanged in the 
recreation hall at St. Mary Magdalen Church. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Rose, 49, was director of the church's youth religion education 
program. He is charged with 10 counts of child molestation for incidents 
alleged to have occurred between January and April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified that she met Rose in September, 1992, and became 
increasingly fond of him as he took an interest in her life. Soon he was 
calling her on the phone four times a week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was more like a teen-ager," she said, when asked by Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Saundra T. Brewer what she thought of Rose. "He was an adult that we could 
understand and that we could talk to in our way." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said that on three occasions, Rose parked his car behind a building 
while giving her a ride home from church and they fondled each other. She 
testified that she did not resist Rose's sexual advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what was happening," she said. "I never thought it was wrong." 
</P>

 She said she finally got scared when Rose drove her to his work, undressed her 
and himself, and began kissing and touching her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't ready to go further," she testified. "I felt like it might have gone 
(further), and I wasn't ready."

 Superior Court Judge Ken W. Riley adjourned court early after concluding that 
several hours on the witness stand had tired the girl. She is scheduled to 
resume her testimony Tuesday. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMAN ALLEGES THAT DEPUTIES BEAT HER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cabrillo Village woman has filed a claim against Ventura County alleging 
that two sheriff's deputies beat her earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Cabrera, 38, claims that Deputies John Duffner and Charles MacDonald 
injured her arm and caused her mental stress after responding to reports of a 
fight June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies called to the fight in the river bottom near Cabrillo 
Village that Tuesday night watched as 15 to 20 men scattered upon their 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 They followed one suspect to the front porch of Cabrera's home, where 
MacDonald said in his report that Cabrera became angry and jumped on his back. 
She was arrested for resisting arrest, but that charge was later dropped for 
lack of evidence, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 In her claim, Cabrera also alleges that the county knew that Duffner had a 
record of using excessive force in dealing with some members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Duffner nor MacDonald could be reached for comment. The claim is being 
reviewed by county attorneys, who declined to comment until they have 
investigated it in more detail. 
</P>
<P>
 County attorneys have 45 days to accept or reject the claim. If it is 
rejected, Cabrera has six months to file a lawsuit against the county, 
Assistant County Counsel Frank Sieh said. JEFF McDONALD

 A teen-age boy stole an undisclosed amount of money from the Bank of A. Levy 
branch on Harbor Boulevard in Ventura on Thursday, marking the 22nd bank 
robbery in Ventura County this year, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth quietly handed a bank teller a note demanding cash and threatening 
that he had a gun, said Larry Dick, an FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The teller complied, and the robber walked out of the bank to a waiting car 
parked in a nearby residential neighborhood, Dick said. The suspects then fled 
the area.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SHOW THAT STRENGTH IS 
IN THE CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembling quadrilaterals, triangles and octagons, the students in Tom Baker's 
ninth-grade geometry class were desperately attacking their class assignment: 
how to build an 11-inch tower with index cards and a few staples that could 
support a 10-pound brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker sprang the assignment on his Moorpark High School students after a few 
days of discussing what shapes are structurally the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the assignment more intense, he charged the students an imaginary 
dollar for every card they used, every fold they made and every staple they 
required, making sure no one spent more than $1,000. And then he limited them 
to just 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the kind of personality that can take a lot of stress," said 
14-year-old Charity Katz, who with three fellow students struggled to come up 
with a design that would work. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Baker's latest lesson in a long series of innovative hands-on 
teaching techniques. The author of two books on weather experiments for young 
students, Baker said he liked to challenge his math and geometry students with 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could give them a book and have them look at a lot of numbers, but would 
they learn anything?" he asked. "This is fun and challenging. You'll be amazed 
at what they come up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the towers were short on function but long on style, collapsing 
immediately as the weight of the brick was placed on them. Others looked like 
they would be a challenge to knock down. 
</P>
<P>
 Using about 300 index cards doubled together and folded into scores of 
triangles, Mike Lawrence and Duy Nguyen, both 14, built a tower that supported 
a brick along with about half a dozen books and a heavy spiral notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sit on it even," said Duy as he demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Chavez, 14, whose group put together the most efficient tower, said 
the exercise achieved its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I think we learned something," he said. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WINDS MAY PROTECT CROPS FROM FREEZING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As nighttime temperatures dip into the 30s across Ventura County tonight and 
this weekend, county agriculture officials hope strong winds will protect crops 
from freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we are going to have a problem," said county Agricultural 
Commissioner W. Earl McPhail."The wind machines will kick on, but we're not 
expecting any damage." 
</P>
<P>
 A cold weather system from Alaska combined with gusty winds is creating chilly 
conditions throughout the county, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daytime temperatures are expected to remain in the low 60s, while nighttime 
temperatures drop into the upper 30s in the valleys and into the teens in the 
mountains, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it is going to be windy and cold along most areas," said Stuart 
Seto, a forecaster for the National Weather Service. "This is going to continue 
for a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong winds, which are expected to gust between 15 and 25 m.p.h., are 
expected to protect county crops since air circulation keeps fruit from 
freezing, forecasters and agricultural experts explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that hurts," Seto said, "is when the cold air comes in and sits."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROPOSAL WITHDRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to developers' wishes, the Moorpark City Council backed away from an 
ambitious plan that could have eventually required 15% of homes built in almost 
all new developments in the city to be for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 With estimates showing the city in need of more than 2,000 affordable units, 
the council decided a year ago to make home construction for low-income 
families a top priority.But the council has since cooled to the idea, voting 
Wednesday to send the proposal back to the committee that took a year to 
develop the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked a lot about this issue during my six years on the council," 
Councilman Scott Montgomery said. "I don't know if an ordinance is necessary 
right now. We're moving on a lot of different fronts, and we're successful on a 
lot of fronts."  
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery cited city plans to use redevelopment money to build 50 low-income 
homes at Gisler Field in the city's downtown area. Montgomery also agreed with 
developers' complaints that the proposal was too onerous for developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, modeled after one in Carlsbad, would have exempted developments 
of seven homes or less, but would have required those smaller developers to pay 
into a low-income housing fund. Montgomery estimated that in the smaller 
developments the requirement could have added as much as $20,000 to the cost of 
the other homes in the development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Bernardo Perez, who served on the committee that drew up the 
plan, said objections to the specific numbers in the proposal were premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were simply trying to craft an ordinance right for Moorpark," he said. 
"These were beginning numbers. Nothing was meant to be definite. These were 
points that we could have built on." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; PANEL BACKS PLANS FOR ZOO, GOLF COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposals to build an endangered species zoo and two 18-hole golf courses near 
Moorpark have been approved in concept by the county Parks and Harbor 
Commission, which recommended that the Board of Supervisors allow developers to 
draw up plans for the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission recommended Wednesday that the supervisors allow developers to 
lease county-owned Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park and draw up plans for the 
golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors also will consider allowing a five-year lease by the zoo, a 
separate project that would be built at another county park between Moorpark 
and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the board allows the lease options to be signed, then the applicants will 
start developing their plans," said Robert Amore, lease manager for the parks. 
"But the projects will still have to go through the specific plan process, and 
environmental review. This is still very preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Moorpark have complained that both projects have been 
developed without any comment from them. "We have two projects that are just 
outside our border and the county is saying we're going to do it our way," said 
Councilman John Wozniak. "Frankly it's a slap in the face to everybody in 
Moorpark." 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course developer, Ralph Mahan, would have to pay at least $25,000 as 
part of the lease option on the property, even if the golf courses are not 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease option for the developers of the zoo, the nonprofit Endangered 
Species Zoological Society, requires that organizations pay $1,000 each year of 
the lease and show that they have raised enough money to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to discuss the projects Dec. 6. SCOTT 
HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CHAIN'S DAILY PAPERS TO GET NAME CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Newspapers announced Thursday that the company is changing the 
name of its three daily newspapers and two zoned editions -- a move aimed 
partly at attracting a larger advertising base.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Star-Free Press will drop "Free Press" from its masthead to 
become the Ventura County Star beginning Tuesday, said publisher John P. 
Wilcox. Two zoned editions of that paper will be called the Oxnard Star and the 
Camarillo Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other papers published by the group, the Simi Valley Enterprise and the 
Thousand Oaks News Chronicle, also will undergo name changes, Wilcox said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley paper will become the Simi Valley Star & Enterprise and the 
Thousand Oaks News Chronicle will be published as the Thousand Oaks Star & News 
Chronicle, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark Mirror, a weekly newspaper published by the group, will not 
change its name and will continue to be published weekly, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're changing the dailies. We're not doing anything with the weekly," he 
said. "It's more of a community newspaper exclusively, as opposed to the others 
that are moving toward being more complete newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said a possible switch to morning publication of the afternoon Simi 
Valley and Thousand Oaks papers is "not part of this program at all. . . . We 
haven't firmed up when and really if that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 By including "Star" in the masthead of its daily newspapers, Ventura County 
Newspapers will appeal to advertisers who prefer a name that is identifiable 
throughout the market area, Wilcox said. He said that surveys of readers showed 
"no real concern" about a name change. 
</P>
<P>
 The name "Free Press" has been part of Ventura County's newspaper history for 
119 years. The Ventura Free Press was founded in 1875 by O.P. Hoddy, said 
Charles Johnson, librarian at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Pinkerton started the Ventura County Star in 1925. Eleven years later, the 
Star acquired the Free Press, and in 1938, began publishing as the Ventura 
County Star-Free Press. All the papers in the Ventura County Newspaper group 
are part of the Ohio-based Scripps Howard chain. KAY SAILLANT

2 MEN HELD AFTER YOUTHS FIRED UPON IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men suspected of shooting at a group of Simi Valley youths were in custody 
Thursday at Ventura County Jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauricio Donoso, 19, and Cory Pohlmeier, 20, both of Simi Valley, were 
arrested earlier this week, Sheriff's Lt. Mark Layhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect was arrested, but was released after questioning, Layhew said. 
Investigators believe a fourth man was involved in the incident but have not 
identified him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the shooting, which occurred at 3:28 a.m. Sunday, Layhew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Mathis Smith, 18, of Simi Valley was sitting in a car in the 1800 block 
of Charing Court with two juveniles from Simi Valley when the suspects walked 
up to the vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoso allegedly pulled a handgun and fired at the youths in the car, police 
said. The window shattered, but no one was hurt, Layhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pohlmeier hurled a bottle at the car as the suspects fled on foot, police 
said.

RENO POLICE NEARLY SHOT THORNTON, JURY TOLD; TRIAL: OFFICER SAYS THE MAN 
ACCUSED OF KILLING A WESTLAKE NURSE LUNGED FOR A WEAPON DURING A SHOWDOWN IN A 
CASINO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers Thursday described the dramatic arrest of accused Thousand 
Oaks murderer Mark Scott Thornton inside a crowded Reno casino last year, 
saying they came close to shooting the armed defendant as stunned gamblers 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers closed in on Thornton at the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino on 
Sept. 19, 1993, the suspect was carrying a revolver and at first refused to 
surrender, Reno Police Officer Jim Duncan testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton decided to lay his gun on a nearby counter, but suddenly lunged for 
it -- even though Duncan and several other officers had their guns trained on 
him, the officer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him if he touched it, he was going to be shot," Duncan told the 
Ventura County jury deciding whether Thornton killed Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan five days before the casino showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher told the jury in opening statements 
that Thornton, 20, was considering provoking the officers into killing him at 
the time of his arrest and that he only surrendered after deciding he did not 
want to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if Thornton is convicted of 
first-degree murder in connection with the 33-year-old nurse's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thornton shot O'Sullivan once in the chest and twice in the 
back in the Santa Monica Mountains. He is accused of stealing the woman's truck 
and using it to kidnap his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton and the girl, Stephanie Campbell, wound up five days later at the 
casino in Reno about midnight Sept. 19, 1993, after traveling around Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who has testified that Thornton vowed to kill her if she tried to 
escape from him, said she was able to walk away as he played video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Circus Circus security guard Jeff Howell said he spotted Campbell standing 
near the midway. Campbell appeared nervous, so he approached her, Howell said. 
Campbell told the guard she had been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that I had to hide her," Howell testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno police were called for backup, and security officials closed in on 
Thornton about 30 minutes later as he stood at a house phone on the ground 
floor of the casino, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, gamblers were playing the slot machines, and Howell said he tried to 
steer as many of them as he could from danger after seeing Thornton point his 
.38-caliber revolver at the approaching officers. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when Duncan issued his first warning to Thornton, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said twice, 'Drop it or you're dead, man! Drop it or you're dead!' " 
Howell testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan testified that he recalled Thornton pointing the pistol in the air 
before dropping it and then trying, suddenly, to pick it back up. After he was 
handcuffed, Thornton tried to break free from the officers several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has neither admitted nor denied the charge of murder, but has 
acknowledged that Thornton was driving O'Sullivan's truck when he took Campbell 
at gunpoint from her Thousand Oaks home hours after the nurse's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thornton told them he found the truck with the keys in it, and 
that Campbell was free to leave Thornton any time during their five days 
together.

PLAN TO RELOCATE EARTHQUAKE-DAMAGED LIBRARY GAINS SUPPORT; THOUSAND OAKS: THE

<P>
 The main branch of the Thousand Oaks Library may move temporarily to the 
recently vacated city hall while work crews replace ceiling panels, lighting 
fixtures and sprinkler pipes damaged during the Jan. 17 earthquake, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians and some City Council members said Thursday that they strongly 
favor the relocation plan and have already applied for added federal disaster 
assistance to fund the move and pay for one year's rent at the old city offices 
on Willow Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it's the best way to deal with our construction problems," 
library Director Marvin Smith said. "If we don't move it will place a serious 
strain on our staff and on the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the city began considering the move when officials learned it would 
take 18 months to complete earthquake repairs while the library remained open 
to the public. Work would need to be parceled into five stages and would create 
dust, noise and safety problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving temporarily, project manager Ed Johnduff said crews could undertake 
all the repairs at once and finish much sooner, perhaps within nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have already endured a number of inconveniences at the library. 
Contractors have spent the past four months repairing the library's leaky roof, 
a problem blamed on flaws in the building's design. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to April, library-goers were sent to the smaller Newbury Park 
branch to give officials time to assess quake damage, clean up fallen ceiling 
panels and treat water damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of trekking back across the city with boxes full of books is less 
formidable to Steve Brogden, library deputy director, than staying at the Janss 
Road building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It beats being around here until June of 1996 with all this construction 
going on," Brogden said.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they would support any plan that would speed the latest 
repair project, so long as it did not increase the city's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Thousand Oaks want their library back," Councilwoman Judy Lazar 
said. "Everybody considers the library to be one of our greatest assets and 
they are anxious to see all the work completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Some federal emergency assistance has already been awarded toward the 
estimated $2.5 million in earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other instances when a move is required due to a disaster, Johnduff said, 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has offered assistance with those 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials said Thursday they had not been contacted by the city on the 
possibility of the move and did not know whether such requests for additional 
aid are traditionally granted. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the move would require all of the library stacks and books to be 
relocated to the first floor of the Willow Lane building, Johnduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason that site came up was because there are few other places in the 
city that are the proper size to house the library's collection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The old city hall site is about 35,000 square feet, contrasted with the 
59,000-square-foot library, Johnduff said.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the space would be adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have contacted Amgen Inc., the corporation that owns the 
building. Although Amgen officials could not be reached Thursday, Smith said 
the bioengineering giant has been receptive to the proposed move. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said the matter could come before the council 
as early as next week. She said she would support the move if it did not 
require added expense for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner the move happens, the better, as far as library officials are 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make a decision on this fairly quickly," Smith said. "We don't 
want to waste any time."  
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the ceiling tiles and earthquake repairs is scheduled to begin 
after the roof work is completed. Those repairs should be done by the end of 
this month, Johnduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chronically leaky roof of the $9-million building has caused library 
officials to periodically close the facility, most recently during a two-day 
storm in October that dropped two-thirds of an inch of rain in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, workers have been replacing inadequately sized drainage pipes 
and increasing the pitch of the roof in some places. During each rainy season 
since the building was finished in 1982, rain has collected in pools around the 
skylights, then gushed into the library's interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the earthquake damage occurred when metal ceiling panels collapsed, 
rupturing sprinkler pipes and crashing down on books and shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly the entire children's collection was lost, and Smith, the library 
director, said book damage alone will cost the library $1 million.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: ALARCON ALLIES MORE THAN WILLING TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED

 THE BOYS ON THE BUS: A Los Angeles City Council meeting this week to consider 
a plan to use redevelopment programs to rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley attracted a surprisingly large number of 
supporters. In fact, the gallery seats at the council chamber were all but 
filled with backers of the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the council got around to discussing the issue, half the crowd 
vanished -- all at once. About 60 people filed out of the chambers and into 
waiting buses. But before they left, Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents 
the communities proposed for the redevelopment area, asked those in the 
audience to stand so the council could see the community's support for the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials later acknowledged that the "supporters" were bused into the 
meeting by Neighborhood Empowerment & Economic Development Inc. (NEED), a North 
Hills-based nonprofit group that was hired by the city to educate northeast 
Valley residents on the redevelopment plan. Alarcon's ties to the group are 
well known in City Hall. James Acevedo, chairman of NEED's board of directors, 
was Alarcon's campaign manager last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the bused-in supporters, about half were Filipino war veterans from 
Alarcon's district whom the councilman had honored earlier in the meeting for 
their heroism during World War II. The others were transported from a drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation center in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way out, one of the men from the center told a reporter that he knew 
little about the proposed redevelopment program but rode a bus to the meeting 
at the request of one of the center's administrators. Hector Briones, NEED's 
executive director, said his agency organized meetings with the veterans and 
the "leadership" of the rehab center to discuss the redevelopment plan. Asked 
about the supporters, Alarcon said later that he was not involved in organizing 
the bus trip. But he added: "They may not all know every particular about the 
redevelopment plan but some definitely support the plan." A decision on the 
plan was delayed until a second hearing Nov. 29.

 SPEAKING OF TRIPS: No, Mayor Richard Riordan has not been mixing it up with 
the City Council. Blame his bike for his battered look. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old chief executive plummeted from his mountain bike last Sunday 
while riding with several friends on a dirt road in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
He fractured several ribs, chipped his collarbone and bruised his nose and 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a really hard fall," said Noelia Rodriguez, Riordan's press 
secretary. "It knocked the wind out of him a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred after the narrow ledge Riordan was riding on gave way 
and he fell about five feet. He managed to ride out of Sullivan Canyon and make 
his way to Santa Monica Hospital's emergency room. Despite some tenderness, he 
carried on a busy week in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first fall for this avid cyclist, who has pedaled his way 
across Europe numerous times and dons the latest in skin-tight bikewear. While 
zipping down a steep hill last year, he struck a speed bump and flipped over 
several times before landing on the pavement. His shoulder was separated and 
had to be surgically repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Riordan has learned is to wear his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 He caused a stir shortly after he took office, when word got out that he 
regularly cycled without any protection on his head. Numerous helmet 
manufacturers responded by sending their wares to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 After the latest fall, however, the mayor is wondering whether he may need 
another piece of equipment. When asked about his injuries, he quipped to 
reporters: "We're passing the hat around to buy me some training wheels."

 BURNING ISSUE: What a difference an election makes. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the purging of Democrats on the Hill, Congress' most vocal critic 
of cigarette smoking, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), will probably be 
replaced as chairman of the health subcommittee. Overseeing that body will be 
one of the tobacco industry's closest allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Thomas Bliley (D-Virginia), tapped to chair the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, does not mince words when it comes to support for the right to light 
up. He has compared Waxman's investigations of the tobacco industry to former 
Sen. Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 A pipe smoker whose district includes the Philip Morris headquarters, Bliley 
has accepted more tobacco-industry contributions than any other member of the 
House -- nearly $100,000 -- and last week publicly declared an end to Congress' 
war on tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospect has local cigarette foes fuming -- even after they defeated a 
tobacco-industry-sponsored initiative in California last week that would have 
invalidated several hundred local anti-smoking measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, a former smoker who leads the 
anti-smoking crusade in Los Angeles City Hall: "I will continue my battle 
regardless, but I will miss Henry Waxman as a strong soldier in the fight 
against the tobacco lobby." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman says he has no intention of giving up the fight although he 
acknowledges that he will no longer set the agenda on his committee, which 
gained notoriety earlier this year by hearing testimony from a panel of tobacco 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of Bliley with a gavel in his hand has prompted some critics to 
allege -- with sarcasm thick in their voices -- that Bliley has an inherent 
conflict of interest. Not only would his congressional district benefit from an 
end to the war on cigarettes, they say, but so would his former profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming a politician, Bliley was a funeral director.

 VOICES OF THE VALLEY: The calls have been coming in fast and furious. Voters 
angry over the Los Angeles Board of Education's attempts to block Proposition 
187 are lighting up the switchboards at school district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Mark Slavkin, whose district stretches from the west San 
Fernando Valley to Westchester, received the most attention. "The calls have 
been overwhelmingly unanimous," Slavkin said. "People are upset that we are 
taking a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, target of a recall effort by the backers of the 
anti-illegal-immigration measure, said his office is "constantly receiving 
angry phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 And where are those voters calling from? "More from the Valley than anywhere," 
Slavkin said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 FALSE START: Roberta Weintraub, a former Los Angeles school board member and 
now a candidate for the City Council seat being vacated by Zev Yaroslavsky, got 
her race off to a bad start. Not the race for the council post, but the 
10-kilometer run at the Universal Studios back lot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub was chosen to be honorary starter of the run, past the "Bates Motel" 
from "Psycho" and other sites. With more than 1,000 cold-but-energized runners 
primed at the starting line, Weintraub flubbed her lines. "Ready! Set! . . . 
Wait a minute," she said into the microphone. A loud groan rose from the 
flustered crowd. It turns out she had begun too fast, not allowing enough time 
to prepare the pace car -- an electric golf cart carrying an actor in a Fred 
Flintstone costume. 
</P>
<P>
 In her second attempt she got it right, but by that time the damage had been 
done: Weintraub may have scuttled her chances of winning the runners' vote.

HANDGUNS OKD FOR RANCHO SIMI PARK RANGERS; CRIME: THE THREE OFFICERS MAY START 
PACKING PISTOLS NEXT YEAR. A SMALL SURVEY OF VISITORS REVEALS OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Afraid that criminals from Los Angeles County will spill over into Simi Valley 
parks, the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District board voted Thursday to arm 
park rangers with handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-1 vote the board directed park district staff members to "pursue and 
develop a program for arming the park rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 All three supporters said the district's parks in Simi Valley and Oak Park 
already attract enough troublemakers that rangers are sometimes put in danger, 
and they predicted that the situation will only get worse in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want them to be law enforcement officers and want them to be up with 
the times, then it's unfair not to arm them," board member Don Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second board member, Bonnie Carpenter, said unarmed rangers could be "in 
grave danger" even now, when they are by themselves in remote areas of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's three rangers probably will begin packing pistols next year 
after the parks agency spends about $7,000 to alter its insurance policy, buy 
guns and purchase time at firing ranges, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rangers, all retired Los Angeles police officers, had asked for guns so 
they could confront dangerous criminals without having to back down and call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the board voted Thursday night, Simi Valley resident Carolyn Anderson, 
whose son was fatally wounded this year in Los Padres National Forest, pleaded 
with the trustees to crack down on crime in parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do what you have to do to make our parks safe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Meredith, the board member opposing the change, said he had polled 70 
park users and found only three who thought it was a good idea to arm rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith has argued that giving guns to rangers might increase the risks of 
violent confrontations with troublemakers who see the weapons as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith also argued that park security problems have been overstated. Last 
year, there were 45 arrests in district parks; there were 1.2 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of arming the rangers dominated the recent park district election. 
Board member Mark Johnson was ousted in favor of ardent pro-gun candidate Gene 
Hostetler, a Simi Valley police detective. Hostetler will be sworn in next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who voted with the majority Thursday, has applied for appointment to 
the board, replacing a board member who recently resigned. But there are 
several other applicants, and the board has made no decision.  
</P>
<P>
 Some state and national park rangers are armed locally, as are Port Hueneme 
park rangers, who are part of that city's police department. No other special 
district, city or county rangers in Ventura County are armed.

<P>
 The NHL's fast-shrinking schedule was reduced for the third time during the 
owners' lockout as the league canceled 10 more games per team Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely expected move means the number of games canceled for each team has 
reached 24.The breakdown of lost games is 11 home, 11 road and two at neutral 
sites. As in previous cancellations, the league made no announcement as to 
which games will be canceled, saying the revised schedule will be released if 
and when the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the NHL and the players' union met for seven hours in Boston and 
plan to negotiate again today. It is the first time since Oct. 4-5 that the 
parties have negotiated on consecutive days. Neither side would comment on 
Thursday's discussions. LISA DILLMAN

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I GIRLS' TENNIS; CORONA DEL MAR DEFEATS DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Second-seeded Dana Hills was expected to give third-seeded Corona del Mar a 
tough match Thursday, especially since it had defeated the Sea Kings this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills also expected to win at least four singles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dolphins' three freshman singles players didn't meet expectations, and 
Corona del Mar's No. 3 singles player Alissa Scott surpassed hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? A lopsided 12-6 victory by Corona del Mar in the Southern Section 
Division I girls' semifinals at Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I'd win all three sets," Scott said. "I don't have a lot of 
confidence in myself. I was pretty nervous, especially against their No. 1 
player (Lara Spica.)" 
</P>
<P>
 But the nerves didn't show. Scott, whose sister Danielle plays on the women's 
pro tennis tour, won her sets with ease, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really picked up her game," Corona del Mar Coach Julie Slattery said of 
Scott. "She played a lot of tournaments over the summer and she's peaked toward 
the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said she owes her improvement to a story she read about Irvine's Sarah 
Denson and the mental side of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I read that article, I realized playing tennis was a lot more mental 
than anything," she said. "I started working hard on my mental game." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's other two singles players, No. 1 Nina Vaughan and No. 2 Megan 
Wachtler, were also on top of their mental games. Vaughan won, 6-1, 6-3, 6-2, 
and Wachtler won, 6-2, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their singles players seemed to be a little more match tough," Dana Hills 
Coach John Stephens said. "We played tight and the inexperience created a lot 
of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills' points came in doubles, three of them from the No. 1 team of 
Michele Johnson and Katie Tierney, who won, 6-4, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The points won't come as easily for Corona del Mar (17-4-1) in Tuesday's 9 
a.m. final at the Claremont Club against Palos Verdes Peninsula (23-0), which 
has won three consecutive Division I titles and has five nationally ranked 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't have their full lineup, it could be close," Slattery said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Peninsula 17, Woodbridge 1 -- As expected, top-seeded Peninsula 
dominated visiting Woodbridge, which finished the season at 18-5.

its upset of No. 1-seeded Hemet Thursday in the Southern Section Division III 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The match ended in a 9-9 tie, but the Golden Hawks, who lost in last year's 
semifinals to North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, won on games, 82-75. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyrus, a former football coach, gave a brief speech to the girls before they 
took the courts and used the Golden Hawks football disqualification from the 
Southern Section playoffs, for using an ineligible player, as motivation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our football team . . . overcame a lot of things this season and they had it 
all taken away," Cyrus told his team. "It's not fair. So let's do this for the 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
 The match came down to the final two sets, with the scored tied, 8-8, and El 
Dorado ahead in games 71-66. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado's Linda Surapruik rallied in her final set against Jennifer Barnes, 
winning four consecutive games for a 6-3 victory that gave the Golden Hawks a 
9-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado's No. 1 doubles team of Susan Surapruik and Brittany McMillan forced 
Hemet's Kristen Barnes and Ellen Cheeseman to a tiebreaker, where Barnes and 
Cheeseman were able to get the victory for the Bulldogs (20-3), but Surapruik 
and McMillan gave the Golden Hawks the games needed to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Surapruik and McMillan gave the Golden Hawks (21-5) two of their three 
victories in doubles with scores of 6-3, 6-2, 6-7.  
</P>
<P>
 In singles, Michelle Weisz easily swept her sets, 6-2, 6-0, 6-1, and Linda 
Surapruik also swept, 7-5, 6-1, 6-3, for El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado will face Pasadena Poly in the Southern Section final at 10 a.m. 
Tuesday at the Claremont Tennis Club. MELANIE NEFF

SOUTHERN SECTION VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS; HUNTINGTON BEACH CAN'T STOP MIRA COSTA 
</P>

 Huntington Beach's run in the Southern Section Division I girls' volleyball 
playoffs came to an abrupt end Thursday night when the Oilers lost to 
second-seeded Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, 15-3, 15-8, 15-6, in a semifinal 
match at Redondo Union High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Oilers (16-4) appeared to be overmatched from the start, and 
held only two leads in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mira Costa's defense) never really let us get going," Huntington Beach Coach 
Rocky Ciarelli said. "Our defense was not very good. Usually you can key on one 
player, but they have five girls who can hit the ball, which makes them tougher 
to match up with." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 2-2, the Mustangs went on runs of seven and six 
consecutive points to put the first game out of reach. The Oilers recorded only 
three kills in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 After Huntington Beach pulled out to a 3-1 lead in Game 2, the Mustangs (29-1) 
ran off the next six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa did not let up, scoring eight of the last nine points in the game. 
Junior Rochelle Esparza had seven kills and Lori Garber added six, giving the 
Mustangs a two-game edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach fell behind early in Game 3 and never recovered. Esparza's 
match-high 17th kill finished off the Oilers. JON CLIFFORD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's Adalberto Sanchez, who posted the best time at last 
weekend's preliminaries, heads the field Saturday at the Southern Section 
cross-country championships at Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
 Races, which begin at 8 a.m., will be held in each of four divisions for boys 
and girls. Two section championships (A and AA) will be awarded in each 
division based on schools' enrollment figures; however, the top four teams (and 
top five individuals not on one of the top four teams) in each race advance to 
the State championships Nov. 26 at Woodward Park in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' Division I race begins the day's competition and features Sanchez, 
El Toro's Martin Pennell and the team from Orange, ranked No. 10 in the state, 
battling Thousand Oaks, the top-ranked team, among others for the I-A title. 
Santa Ana Valley has to get past second-ranked Palos Verdes Peninsula to win 
the I-AA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' Division II competition, No. 4 Mater Dei is expected to duel No. 
5 Palmdale for the II-AA title. Vying for the II-A championship will be Mission 
Viejo, Edison, Katella, Laguna Hills and Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' competition in Division I features No. 5 Esperanza and Santa Ana 
Valley battling No. 7 Peninsula for the I-AA championship. Going for the I-A 
title against top-ranked Thousand Oaks will be No. 3 Irvine, No. 4 El Toro, No. 
9 Los Alamitos and No. 10 Dana Hills. San Clemente's Nancy Dollar will be 
seeking her second consecutive State championship berth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' Division II race, defending State champion Edison, ranked No. 2 
in the state, will battle Laguna Hills, Katella and No. 7 La Puente Bishop Amat 
for the II-A title. The II-AA championship will be up for grabs between No. 3 
Trabuco Hills, No. 6 Yucaipa, No. 9 Agoura, No. 10 Aliso Niguel and Mater Dei. 
Individual runners include University's Meisha Wilson and Marina's Heather 
Cuthbertson. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' Division III competition, No. 5 El Modena, No. 9 La Habra, No. 8 
Santa Margarita and Newport Harbor will battle for the III-AA title. No. 4 
Corona del Mar figures to battle No. 2 Ojai Nordhoff for the III-A 
championship. . . . Brethren Christian senior Brendan Pacheco and St. 
Margaret's Ryan Downey are the individual representatives in the Division IV 
race. . . . El Modena, ranked fourth, No. 7 Foothill and No. 8 Santa Margarita 
are among the field eligible for the girls' Division III-AA title. 
Second-ranked Lake Elsinore Temescal Canyon, No. 3 Ojai Nordhoff and No. 10 San 
Marino figure to give Corona del Mar stiff competition for the III-A 
championship. Buena Park freshman standout Heather Garritson will run in this 
race. . . . Orange Lutheran, ranked seventh, Laguna Beach and St. Margaret's 
will compete in the Division IV race, which concludes the morning's competition 
at 10:20 a.m. MATT FARMER

PETERSON SUSPENDED FROM TITAN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Winston Peterson, Cal State Fullerton's top returning player, sat out the 
Titans' exhibition game Thursday night against the Blue and Gold Fleet for 
disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, a 15-point scorer last year, was suspended for the one game by Coach 
Bob Hawking, who declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve guard Danny Robinson, also a senior, was not suited up and is 
ineligible until at least Dec. 17 because of academic problems last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 If Robinson regains his eligibility, he will be available for the team's Big 
West Conference opener Dec. 17 against Nevada Las Vegas, but he definitely will 
miss the Titans' first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson will be available for the exhibition game Tuesday against the 
Townsville Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans won Thursday night's exhibition, 111-100. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard James French led the way with 27 points, including three three-point 
baskets. Chuck Overton, a transfer from a community college in Salt Lake City, 
added 22 and Ali Nayab and John Williams each had 11 points. Nayab led the team 
with seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans led by 10 at halftime and shot 60% from the field in the second 
half to maintain the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy McCoy had 20 points and Sly Hunter and Al Lewis each had 18 for Blue and 
Gold Fleet.

NO. 1 NEWPORT HARBOR BEATS EDISON; VOLLEYBALL: MAY HAS 33 KILLS; SCHUTZ HAS 16 
KILLS AND FIVE BLOCKS AS SAILORS WIN IN FOUR GAMES.

 Newport Harbor, the state's top-ranked girls' volleyball team, shifted into 
playoff mode in Thursday's semifinal victory over Edison at Fountain Valley 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edison won Game 3, the Sailors, top-seeded for the Southern Section 
Division I playoffs, finished the match with a flurry posting a 15-10, 15-5, 
14-16, 15-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty May had 33 kills and 13 digs and Melissa Schutz had 16 kills and five 
blocks to lead the Sailors (22-1), who advanced to Saturday's final at Cypress 
College to play Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (29-1), a three-game winner over 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't looking toward Saturday," Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said. "We 
were ready for Edison and they battled us. We beat a very good team tonight and 
we're excited to be in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as if the Sailors would cruise to the final after victories in Games 
1 and 2, but Edison made them sweat a little. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Chargers (17-2), champions of the Sunset League, trailed 
15-14 in Game 3 but fought back. After holding off two match points, two blocks 
by Edison's Kelli Liniger and a hitting error by May gave the Chargers the 
game, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison outside hitter Erin McCown had eight of her 13 kills in Game 3 and 
Shelby Clemens posted five of her 11 kills in the game. Kari Hogancamp (16 
digs) and Clemens (15 digs) also sparked Edison with some good defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newport Harbor had too many weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 When May wasn't bombing away, Newport Harbor setter Jenny Hecker, who had 61 
assists, had plenty of other options. Schutz, Sara Fairborn (11 kills) and Tina 
Bowman (seven kills and two blocks) helped keep Edison honest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairborn also had a team-high 18 digs, underlining the overall strength of the 
Sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their defense is what makes them so good," Edison Coach Dave Mohs said. 
"You've got to play error-free to beat them and we didn't do that."

 The Warriors are supposed to be rebuilding after surprising everybody by tying 
Sonora for the league championship (as well as being the only league team to 
beat Sonora). But Hardeman sounds as if he expects Troy to make another run at 
the Raiders. And why not? Hardeman had only three returning players on last 
year's squad, and Troy was supposed to be rebuilding then, too. "My philosophy 
is if you're a younger kid on the varsity, you'll play a lot," Hardeman said. 
"And unless you're in my top eight by your junior year, you're not going to be 
on varsity." He will have four returning players in the mix--one of them, Sand, 
is an all-league performer. Troy loves to shoot from outside; the Warriors hope 
to make the three-point shot a weapon, and will do it from a spread-offense 
formation that is designed to negate their smaller size and take advantage of 
their speed. "We can go inside, but there we have to be patient," Hardeman 
said. Still, Hardeman said, defense will ultimately determine the Warriors' 
standing. That, and finding a way to beat Sonora again SCHEDULE

 Fair brings an interesting resume to the Indians, having coached professional 
teams in New Zealand and England before accepting the Fullerton job. Fair also 
spent time at Pacifica, but resigned in 1986. He is known for being fiery and 
passionate on the sidelines, but also knows winning, having been a member of 
the Corona del Mar team that won a 1977 CIF championship. Fair is not 
predicting such results immediately for Fullerton but he is determined to make 
the Indians into a playoff contender. "Our goal is to be the most fundamentally 
sound team out there," Fair said. "If we are that, the wins will come." Fair 
goes on to praise his club's intelligence and desire; whether they can 
compensate for Fullerton's lack of overall height is the big question. Another 
question is how quickly expected leaders Schatz (9.4 points) and Young (3.0) 
fit in once the football season ends. But Fair is undaunted. "This is a school 
and community with tradition," he said. "I think we can build something 
special." SCHEDULE

 Last year, Pierce spent the better part of his maiden season weaning the 
Lancers from the zone defenses and controlled offenses of predecessor Steve 
White. This year, there is a new goal. "I want us to be the highest-scoring 
team in the league," Pierce said. "I'm not going to be happy until we score 
100, although I'll be satisfied with 60-70." To reach that goal, Pierce will 
depend on either a passing offense of a 1-4 alignment to draw post players 
outside and post up the guards. How that works depends on the passing and 
decision-making of Granillo, whom Pierce will play at point guard, and whether 
Sunny Hills can make its outside shots with some regularity. Another key is 
whether Nicolas (13 point average) can at least duplicate his all-league season 
of a year ago. Without size--their tallest player, Christensen, weighs only 170 
pounds--Sunny Hills is not going to dominate the boards. It is certain, 
however, that the Lancers plan to run at every opportunity and won't dawdle if 
forced into a set offense. Not if they want to make that 100. SCHEDULE

 The Coyotes are expected to be one of the league's most improved teams. Even 
without a senior in the starting lineup, Buena Park had an excellent summer 
league, winning 20 games, which helped wipe away the taste of last season. "We 
learned that we could win," Matillo said. Smith (11.1 point average) and Oliver 
(10.0) will shoulder the offensive load, with help from Gasso (8.0). The 
Coyotes are not big, but they can move and are now experienced with seven 
returning lettermen. Guard is the deepest position, with nine of the 14 roster 
players playing there. In addition to seeing a wide open league after Sonora, 
Matillo believes an above-.500 season and a playoff spot is within reach. "We 
have the talent to do that," Matillo said. "Now we have to establish ourselves 
and see if we can make a move." SCHEDULE

BOYS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995: FREEWAY LEAGUE; CLARK READY TO LIVE UP TO HIS 
POTENTIAL FINALLY; BASKETBALL: 7-FOOT SONORA SENIOR HAS MATURED, AND WANTS TO 
ASSUME LEADERSHIP ROLE EXPECTED OF HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Be warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Clark does not bring any tattoos, flashy nicknames or gold jewelry with 
his initials on it to the 1994-95 basketball season. But he will have an 
attitude about his game and the kind of year he believes the Sonora Raiders are 
in a position to have. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-foot, 250-pound senior does not want to share the Freeway League title, 
as the Raiders did last year with Sunny Hills. He won't say it loudly, but with 
all the starters back from last year's 23-6 squad, Clark is expecting bigger 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Is a Southern Section championship within reach? "Definitely, if we work 
together as a team," Clark said. "And I think we'll be ready when the season 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has maximized his preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already signed his letter of intent, agreeing to attend San Joe State. 
"I was really impressed when I went up to the campus. But I also wanted to get 
it over with before the season so I could concentrate on the season. I had 
eight schools I was considering." 
</P>
<P>
 His summer was no vacation, playing with several all-star teams, including 
those run by Nike and L.A. Gear. When he wasn't on the court, Clark was either 
in the weight room or working with personal trainer Eric Marino in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the memory of losing in the semifinals to Servite -- on two foul 
shots with no time left on the clock -- provides a motivation, Clark has other 
feelings to cleanse; feelings that were charred earlier in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the perception that tall men automatically gravitate toward the game, 
and Clark was saddled with the burden of great expectations the first day he 
arrived at Sonora. The problem was he was not particularly skilled or graceful 
early, and the jibes rattled harder than a two-handed slam. 
</P>
<P>
 He still keeps a copy of a Times newspaper story where the writer claims Clark 
will "only look good in a uniform." It is a reminder of his struggles, when he 
wasn't good enough to make the Raiders' freshman team. Even last year, when he 
averaged 13 points and 12 rebounds, Clark often felt like an ice skater on 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times I didn't think I could be a good player, when things got 
overwhelming," Clark said. "I knew I was expected to be like this from my 
freshman year. But . . . sometimes it takes big men a longer time to mature and 
grow into their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summer I made my biggest strides in my power. Last year, I was more a 
finesse player. But I built myself up during the summer; I put close to 20 
pounds on my upper body. I have more confidence now. I think I can power past 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to, I can shoot it outside, but I'd much rather be inside. But I 
can run the floor; I think I got my quickness up a lot from last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora Coach Mike Murphy has noticed the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I think we're going to be able to cash in with him," Murphy said. 
"It's been painful in the past, sometimes, to play him, but this year I think 
he's going to be the dominating player we hoped we would be. He's got great 
hands, and at seven-foot if he can catch it, that's half the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy is quick to point out that Clark does not have to strap the Raiders 
on his back and carry them all season. He's got a complement of all-league 
players in Sergie Hernandez, Nathan Mirth, Chad Fister and Josh Lein. And when 
Clark needs a rest, there's 6-8 center Devin Downs to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Craig will get the boards and we've got four great athletes to go 
with him," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is OK with Clark. But he also would also like to leave Sonora fans the 
vision of living up to a potential as enormous as his height. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm ready," Clark said, "but I really doubt I'll be the only one 
depended upon." 1993-94 / IN REVIEW

 League MVP Greg Abbott, who averaged 18 points, helped Troy win the league 
title for the first time since 1986. But the Warriors were eliminated in the 
first round of the Division II-A playoffs, losing to La Mirada, 50-48. Guard

and had two all-league players, Sam Mankiewicz and Ryan Schatz. . . . Sunny 
Hills junior Ben Nicolas, an all-league selection, helped the Lancers win four

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER TO START AGAINST 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Chandler's sprained left ankle was still too sore to practice Thursday, 
and Coach Chuck Knox named Chris Miller the starting quarterback for Sunday's 
game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox is still undecided on who Miller's backup will be -- Chandler, Tommy 
Maddox or Jamie Martin, whom the team re-signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler wouldn't rule out being the backup Sunday, but it appears the ankle 
will keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting better but it's too sore to do anything with it," Chandler said. 
"Chuck said he was going to start CMil. If I'm not ready to start, I want to 
take the time to get it completely right." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler played catch with trainers during practice, backpedaled and tripped 
over an orange construction cone at the edge of the field. He jokingly faulted 
trainer Jim Anderson "for not telling me it was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler reported no injury, but was a little embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like this thing might be a big deal tomorrow," he said. MIKE

A MOST VALUABLE PLAYER; RAMS WANT TO SIGN PHIFER BEFORE HE BECOMES A FREE AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams want to move, and quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roman Phifer won't let them. 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer, an outside linebacker who has displayed star qualities while becoming 
one of the team's most productive performers, has ignored the team's persistent 
overtures to sign a new deal before he becomes a free agent at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the Rams didn't go ahead and pay the man when they had the 
chance," Ram defensive end Robert Young said. "It was probably a dumb move on 
their part. I just hope we don't lose him." 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, both Phifer and Young were unsigned. Each player was 
beginning his fourth year with the team, and while they were restricted from 
going elsewhere, at the conclusion of 1994 they would be free to negotiate with 
29 other NFL teams, including the two expansion franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took Young off the market with a three-year, $3.6-million contract, 
but they elected to gamble with Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gotten hurt or had a down year, but I really had no option," 
Phifer said. "They didn't throw out any number and there wasn't really any 
negotiation, so I had to accept what they offered." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were required to offer Phifer at least $649,000 or lose him to 
another team in exchange for a third-round draft pick. Phifer had to accept the 
$649,000 offer or look for another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rams announced his signing last summer, they suggested the one-year 
deal would buy them a few weeks to work out a long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clearly expressed that we wished to do something during the season," 
said Ram senior vice president Jay Zygmunt, who is also working to extend 
center Bern Brostek's contract. "Our interest remains the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer's agent, Los Angeles-based Marvin Demoff, however, has shown an 
unwillingness to discuss his client's future with the Rams, and now months 
later with the free-agent deadline approaching, the Rams are left to wonder if 
they will lose one of their top defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a possibility," Ram president John Shaw said. "We were hopeful 
of getting something done, but it appears we're now on his timetable." 
</P>
<P>
 Demoff, who did not return a phone call to discuss Phifer's situation, also 
represented former Ram linebacker Kevin Greene. The Rams told Greene and Demoff 
they wanted to re-sign him, and the Rams were told they would have the 
opportunity to make their best offer should Greene be courted elsewhere. Greene 
signed with Pittsburgh, and the Rams were the last to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be in Roman's shoes; he's going to break the bank," said Shane 
Conlan, who surprised the Bills two years ago by signing with the Rams. "I'm 
sure the team wants him back, but it's smart on his part not to sign. He should 
go out and test it and see what his worth is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a blow to our defense to lose him, a big blow. He does a lot of 
things for our defense. He's our best cover guy, he's just a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carolina Cougars and Jacksonville Jaguars will be looking to stock their 
rosters with good athletes, and they will have the money to boost the bidding 
on certain players. A personable 26-year-old outside linebacker with Carolina 
roots might get an offer he cannot refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had family members talking about Carolina all the time," said Phifer, 
who grew up in Pineville, N.C. "It's been kind of joke. . . . my loyalties 
right now are with the Rams, and that's all I'm concerned with at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer, a second-round draft pick from UCLA, has shown the versatility to 
remain on the field in all defensive situations. He led the team in tackles a 
year ago, and had the Rams enjoyed more success, he might have made the Pro 
Bowl. He has played with a hyper-extended elbow this season but continues to be 
one of the team's most aggressive players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I really had to come hard last year because my contract was up, but 
now it's the same type scenario," Phifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference this year, however, is that Phifer has the leverage. A year ago 
the Rams had it, and used it to their advantage in paying Phifer almost $1 
million less than Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what Robert got, and I looked over there a few times knowing he had 
the money in his pocket," Phifer said. "I was happy for him, and I'm sure he 
doesn't have any stress now wondering what's going to happen this year. For 
whatever reason my situation was different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's a little anxiety in me. I love my teammates and the coaches here, 
but this thing could take so many turns, it's crazy. Will the Rams make me an 
offer? Will I be here? Will the Rams be here or playing in St. Louis next year? 
There are a lot of things going on right now, and for the time being I have no 
control. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of weeks, however, ultimate control swings to Phifer. And if the 
Rams wish to regain control of the situation, they will pay, and probably pay 
handsomely.

MIKE PENNER: TITAN SOCCER ESCAPES THE SECOND DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sign hanging in the Cal State Fullerton student food court isn't much, 
just a plain white rectangle bearing a simple message in blue block letters -- 
"Congratulations Titan Soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's first-round NCAA soccer playoff game between Fullerton and 
the University of San Diego at Titan Stadium isn't expected to draw much, maybe 
2,000, meaning 8,000 bleacher seats won't be occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Franchino is also there, and that may be the best gauge when it comes to 
measuring just how far these little steps have taken Fullerton's soccer 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchino, a freshman midfielder who has played every minute of every match he 
has been eligible, is the type of player Fullerton Coach Al Mistri used to 
admire only from afar. Top 130 in the nation as a high schooler. Experienced on 
the junior international level. Invited to try out for the U.S. national 
under-21 team. A candidate for the 1996 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, too rich for Fullerton's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was the place you went if UCLA didn't want you. Or if you couldn't 
pass the admissions exam. Mistri's program was known in soccer circles as Cal 
State Hand-Me-Down. The Bruin Reserves. Can't make the grade in Westwood? Then 
you get relegated to the second division on the corner of State College and 
Nutwood. 
</P>
<P>
 But was before the 1993 Final Four convened in Davidson, N.C., last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Present and accounted for was Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuous by its absence, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchino, then a senior at Damien High School in La Verne, noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw those guys on TV last year," Franchino says, "it was just, like, I 
wanted to be there. Do whatever it takes to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, St. Louis University, 10-time NCAA champion, was knocking on 
Franchino's door. Perennial West Coast contender Fresno State and Nevada Las 
Vegas offered scholarships. Santa Clara. UCLA, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA didn't talk to me till the end," Franchino says. "They came later. I 
told them I'd already made up my mind. I told them I was signing with 
Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
 Franchino's letter of intent "represents the turnaround we've had here," 
according to Mistri. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey is the first . . . I've got to be careful how I say this. OK, Eddie Soto 
(Fullerton's All-American forward) has received a lot of accolades, and he's 
done very well by our situation. But when the chips were down, a lot of 
universities did not want him, for whatever reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA had the chance to get him; he would've loved to have gone there, and 
they didn't want him. I think a number of other places, SMU and what not, could 
have gotten him, but they didn't go after him hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey was highly sought after. I mean, Santa Clara, St. Louis, UCLA would've 
wanted him, up to the very end, and he opted to come here. That's a very strong 
statement right there. Up to the very last moment, when he signed the letter of 
intent, these other places would have loved to have him go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri sounds as if he still can't believe it. What an embarrassment of riches 
this is -- a second consecutive invitation to the NCAA tournament, a first NCAA 
playoff game at home, a top 15 national ranking . . . and Joey Franchino, to 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've finally arrived at the point where I believe we can be one of 
the top 10 programs in the nation constantly," Mistri says. "Getting players of 
Joey's caliber. The stadium. People finally getting behind the program. We're 
there. We're there." 
</P>
<P>
 And Franchino has become the symbol of the new status. Look what we got -- 
it's a 1994 Franchino! Mistri nearly giggles as he ticks off the assorted 
features and options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey and Al Partida, who we got the year before, have been asked to 
participate in the Olympic tryouts," Mistri proudly reports. "Now, when you're 
asked to participate, it's somewhat different than going to try out, if you 
read between the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timo Liekoski, the Olympic coach, came up to me and says, 'I want those two 
guys to come and try out.' That's what he told me, straight-forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Liekoski, and U.S. national coach Bora Milutinovic, spoke to Mistri after 
watching Fullerton upset top-ranked Indiana three weeks ago. The Titans trailed 
Indiana, 2-1, at halftime before Mistri assigned Franchino to Brian 
Maisonneuve, Indiana's All-American midfielder. Maisonneuve didn't score again 
-- he barely managed another shot on goal -- and Fullerton rallied to win in 
overtime, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri displays a 1994 college soccer player of the year ballot. His ballot. 
Highlighted in green marker is Mistri's selection: Brian Maisonneuve, Sr., 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best player I have seen, by far," Mistri declares, "and Joey marked 
him all half. Shut him down. Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I did," Franchino says, "was stand him up and keep his back facing our 
goal. Because as soon as he turns and comes toward you, he's going to kill you. 
As long as I kept his back to our goal, he would have to play the ball back and 
outside the net." 
</P>
<P>
 The end result, Franchino believes, "was the turning point of our season. 
Because if we don't win that game, I think our season would be over right now." 
</P>
<P>
 To tell the whole truth and nothing but, Franchino didn't quite finish the 
Indiana game. With 10 minutes left in overtime, Franchino received his second 
yellow card for kicking the ball out of bounds -- "trying to kill a little 
time," as Franchino puts it, or "delay of game," as the referee put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stupid on my part," Franchino says. "I shouldn't have done that. My mistake, 
I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that didn't stop two coaches called Timo and Bora from jotting down 
the name "Franchino" for future reference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have many goals, you know," says Franchino, who has scored just once 
in 19 games, "and if a coach like that sees you play and likes the way you 
play, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bora was there, Mistri says, "because he goes where the good players are." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, where the good players are. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri wasn't sure he'd ever see the day. But it's there.

GOLDEN STATE SENDS WEBBER TO WASHINGTON; PRO BASKETBALL: WARRIORS GET 
GUGLIOTTA, THREE NO. 1 PICKS IN EXCHANGE FOR LAST SEASON'S ROOKIE OF THE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Completing his bizarre journey south in the standings and any direction that 
led him away from Coach Don Nelson, Chris Webber forced the Golden State 
Warriors to trade him to the Washington Bullets on Thursday for Tom Gugliotta 
and three No. 1 draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber thus left the Warriors, an up-and-coming team that won 50 games last 
season, for the Bullets, who won 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? He wanted to get away from Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber, 21, had also complained at one time or another of having to play 
center instead of power forward and of the trade of his friend, Billy Owens. He 
told friends he wanted to play in a bigger city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, smaller than the Bay Area, he will at least rejoin his old 
Michigan teammate, Juwan Howard, who had been unsigned until Thursday, to start 
their own Fab Two. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber now has only to persuade the Bullets to trade for Denver's Jalen Rose 
and draft current Wolverine seniors Ray Jackson and Jimmy King and the 
audacious, cocky, fashion-setting, critic-defying Fab Five will be together 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a happy day for us," a somber Nelson said at a news conference in 
Oakland. "This is not the way we anticipated the Chris Webber situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were building a championship team and Chris Webber was a part of that, but 
circumstances didn't turn out that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Warrior owner Chris Cohan, who had met last weekend with Webber: "He was 
up front. It was not a money issue. He wanted to be happy and he wasn't going 
to be happy with the Warriors. He said it was mostly due to Don. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a coach and a boss. If you can't work for him, there are 
other opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-10, 250-pound Webber, the NBA's rookie of the year last season, had 
exercised an option, terminating his 15-year, $74-million contract and making 
himself a restricted free agent. He then sat out the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber asked for a new contract with another "out" in two seasons, which would 
have made him an unrestricted free agent by the summer of 1997, free to leave 
Nelson if he so desired. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Warriors refused, Webber blasted Nelson, telling Mitch Albom of the 
Detroit Free Press: 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, I've had coaches that were absolute jerks. I mean, they screamed at 
us all the time. But you still have to respect people. You don't yell at them, 
'Why did we draft you?' in front of little kids in the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a screamer, has a reputation as a players' coach who enjoyed a good 
relationship with them away from the floor. But when he blew up at Webber in a 
game at Charlotte last season, so did their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some major problems that I didn't know about," Nelson said last 
week. "(Webber) said he wants to leave because of me. He says there's a problem 
between us.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't tough on Chris at all. There were a few times, a few disagreements, 
but I've been tougher on other players." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson had insisted, since reports of last season's differences, that he would 
leave before running a star player out of town. When Webber's comments were 
reported, Nelson, who is also the Warriors' general manager, repeated his 
pledge to move into the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber called Nelson's offer phony. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's being childish," he said last week. "I think he did that to play on 
fans' emotions, cause sympathy for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows he's not going to quit and he knows I don't want him to quit. All I 
want to do is talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Webber, with permission, met with Bullet owner Abe Pollin, then signed a 
contract with the Warriors on Wednesday amid reports that a trade had already 
been agreed to -- a common, if technically illegal, practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the deal was announced less than 24 hours later. The Washington Post 
reported that Webber agreed to a one-year contract with the Bullets for $2.08 
million with the option of becoming a restricted free agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 If Gugliotta, 24, is no physical match for the gifted Webber, he is a good 
player with no history as a head case. A 6-10, 240-pound power forward known 
for his all-around game, he averaged 17 points and nine rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors will also get the Bullets' No. 1 picks in 1996, 1998 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the NBA office has said it will investigate the deal to make sure no 
rules were broken. 
</P>
<P>
 If any were, Webber and Nelson may yet be together again, if briefly.

TONEY-JONES TITLE FIGHT COULD BE A BELL-RINGER; BOXING: CONTRAST IN STYLES ADDS 
INTEREST TO WHAT EACH SUPER-MIDDLEWEIGHT REGARDS AS HIS MOST IMPORTANT AND 
POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE FIGHT TO DATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grudgingly, sparingly and only in mumbles when the other is well out of 
earshot, these two proud and preening fighters acknowledge respect for one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Jones Jr. and James Toney are as talented as the boxing world offers and 
menacing in their separate ways, but neither is a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 For the winner of tonight's fight at the MGM Grand Garden, what lie beyond the 
bout are future riches and influence not reached by a non-heavyweight since the 
middleweight days of Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, the reigning and raging International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight champion, is a bruising counterpuncher and old-school 
technician. He predicts a knockout victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is giving up his IBF middleweight belt to move up eight pounds and 
challenge for Toney's title, is sly and smoothly confident. He says he expects 
to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 But, when they meet in boxing's most anticipated and stylistically intriguing 
match of the year, each has made it clear that this is the biggest fight of his 
career -- with big consequences, big possibilities and big risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "James Toney, he's a good fighter," said the 25-year-old Jones, who is 
considered the more athletic, fluid, and faster-fisted boxer. "I'm not saying 
he's not. I'm just better. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the least of the risks is the money. Neither fighter is guaranteed a set 
figure. Toney will receive 45% of the pay-per-view gross and Jones will get 
35%. If the fight does well, they will collect more than the $2.5 million and 
$2 million, respectively, they would have earned with guarantees. If the fight 
does not do well, they could wind up with far less. 
</P>
<P>
 Risk and reward, rivalry and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, 26, allows that Jones (26-0, 23 knockouts) might look better in the 
early going, when Toney is stalking, assessing Jones' footwork. 
</P>
<P>
 But Toney (44-0-2, 29 KOs) is a fighter known for his ability to adjust to his 
opponent, wear him down, then pounce in the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can adjust to any style," Toney said. "And once I do, it gets bloody. I 
will catch him. I ain't no pretty boy, so I'm not worried about being ugly. I'm 
not scared to get hit. But he's going to take some shots to try to get his, 
I'll tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do all that flashy stuff, maybe impress the judges for a few rounds. 
But when I start cracking him in the gut, it's over. I'll knock him out in the 
seventh round if he runs. If he doesn't, it'll be in the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest question heading into this fight is Jones' taste for the heavy 
inside action Toney is sure to give him, and his ability to recover from shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who scores his knockouts at the ends of devastating flurries, had to 
eat his way up to the 168-pound super-middleweight limit, while Toney bounces 
around at more than 200 pounds between bouts, struggles to get down, then 
surges back up in the 30 hours between weigh-in and fight. At the weigh-in, 
Jones was 168, Toney 167. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the one taking the risks, who has to come up in weight, give up my 
title," Jones said. "I'm the one who has to make all the sacrifices. I've 
stepped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney has beaten Michael Nunn, Mike McCallum -- in a rematch after a 12-round 
draw -- Prince Charles Williams and Iran Barkley. Jones' career, in contrast to 
Toney's, has been dotted with periods of inaction and inattention, punctuated 
here and there with brilliant knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have beaten better fighters than Roy," said Bill Miller, Toney's trainer. 
"This is just another big fight. Roy has to show more to me than beating Thomas 
Tate and Bernard Hopkins." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones laughs off comparisons of their opponents -- suggesting that Toney has 
struggled against many of the top names -- and says he will not be lured into 
bombing with the heavier man. 
</P>
<P>
 Alton Merkerson, whose arrival as Jones' trainer last year seems to have 
brought more focus to his talents, says that a clean punch by Jones will send 
anybody at any weight to the floor, but the Jones camp is not planning a 
slugfest. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller does concede that Jones' maneuverability could give Toney some trouble 
-- until Toney catches up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My key for James is, he's got to hurt him early, let him know he can hurt him 
and from there he can dominate," Miller said. "His speed doesn't mean anything 
if all he's doing is running. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few fighters can knock you out on the run. And Roy Jones is not one of 
them. Roy Jones, he doesn't do too much jabbing. His best punch is his left 
hook. So you take the left hook away from him, he doesn't have anything."

NOW THE SHOOTOUT BEGINS; GOLF: UPSTART WORLD TOUR TO TAKE ON PGA. NORMAN SAYS 
RESPONSE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The World Golf Tour arrived Thursday, a little uncertain of its prospects off 
the tee. Will the venture be a shot straight down the fairway or an ugly snap 
hook? 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at Sherwood Country Club, where the Franklin Funds Shark 
Shootout begins today, Greg Norman and John Montgomery announced an 
eight-event, $25-million tour for the top 30 players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Tour probably will begin next March, although it already has drawn 
fire from golf's Establishment, the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, formerly of Executive Sports, a Florida event management firm, is 
the new executive director of the World Tour. He credited Norman as the 
visionary behind the new tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say?" Norman said. "I think it's fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, it's lucrative. Fox Television bought television rights to 
the World Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for each of the eight events to have $3 million in prize money, 
$600,000 for the winner. Last place in the field will be good for $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The player of the year on the World Tour will receive a $1-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, each player who commits to the new tour will receive a $50,000 
travel allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, who said the new tour is not ego driven, made a point of the financial 
rewards built into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you have the word professional in front of your name, if you are the 
best, you deserve a reward," Norman said. "People out there do not realize what 
it takes to be at the top of your sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The SONY rankings, a three-year sliding scale of points awarded for 
performance on certain events, will determine the top 30 players. 
</P>
<P>
 World Tour event sponsors can give 10 exemptions to make up a field of 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he has spoken with Jack Nicklaus and that Nicklaus plans to 
play on sponsors' exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the money distribution, few details of the new tour were made public. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it has no sponsors, no schedule, no sites and no players, except for 
Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response has been overwhelming," said Norman, who did not identify any 
players who had committed to the tour, but read a message of support from Jose 
Maria Olazabal of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said the World Tour is fielding offers from many prospective 
sponsors and sites but that any further announcements aren't likely for 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for four World Tour events to be played in the United States and 
one each in Canada, Scotland, Spain and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial scheduling is for World Tour events to be played the week before major 
tournaments. Norman said the first event is being planned for before the 
Masters, which is April 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
 That would put the World Tour event opposite the Freeport-McMoRan Classic at 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said Fox telecasts of the World Tour would run in the same time 
period of the PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price said he stands behind Norman, but with reservations. His reaction 
seemed fairly typical of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has my total support, as long as my position on the PGA Tour isn't 
challenged," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's influence is vital to the new tour because of his stature. He was the 
leading money winner on the PGA Tour this season with $1.49 million. He won six 
tournaments and also is No. 1 in the SONY rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said Norman was impulsive and wished that Norman had spoken with PGA 
Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem before going public with the World Tour plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said his main concern is "what (the) repercussions from the tour could 
be," he said. "I made that clear to Greg." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanny Wadkins said the World Tour must take into account the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't sit there and just . . . on the people who supported you all 
those years and put you there to begin with," said Wadkins, the Ryder Cup 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think the public has seen enough greed out of athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Price said, the PGA Tour has not taken the lead in 
accommodating international players and said that was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when the PGA Tour had the top 30 players in the world, but 
that's no longer the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem released a statement Tuesday in which he said the PGA Tour would not 
permit member players to play on the World Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem spoke out, hoping to soothe nervous sponsors staring at the prospect 
of the top players skipping their events.

CHAMPIONS OF CHAPEL HILL; ANSON DORRANCE NURTURES DYNASTY OF WOMEN'S SOCCER AT 
NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Along Tobacco Road, in the shadows of the monstrous and shiny Dean E. Smith 
Center, there is a gray concrete hut, its shingles falling off. 
</P>
<P>
 It stands apart from the other buildings, like some kind of antique, and bears 
a wooden sign that modestly proclaims, "North Carolina Soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 As if 11 NCAA women's soccer championships in the last 12 years were something 
to be modest about. 
</P>
<P>
 This three-room cottage is the thinking space of Anson Dorrance, women's 
soccer guru and coach of arguably the most dynastic team in any college sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back room, past the piles of awards, beyond the stacked 
coach-of-the-year plaques, Dorrance sits behind a desk piled high with papers. 
The phone is ringing. He is smiling. He knows why the reporter has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters always come to ask about the winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since North Carolina made women's soccer a varsity sport in 1979, Dorrance has 
led the Tar Heels on a tear unprecedented in college athletics. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 92-game winning streak, which was ended Oct. 2 when Notre Dame held 
the Tar Heels to a scoreless tie in St. Louis, is an NCAA soccer record. 
Although the NCAA lacks adequate records to accurately rank this streak in the 
scope of all sports, it is often compared to the 88-game streak by the UCLA 
men's basketball team. That was ended in 1974, also by Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 101-game unbeaten streak, which came to an end this season in a 3-2 
overtime loss at Duke on Oct. 19, is the second-longest in college soccer 
history. Who holds that record? Who else? The Tar Heels went 103 games without 
a loss from 1986 to 1990, when they dropped a game to Connecticut before 
starting the second streak. They have lost only two games in the last nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The only time North Carolina missed the national championship in the last 
12 years was in 1985, when it lost at George Mason. North Carolina's 11 
national championships are more than any other Division I women's team in any 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels are in a slightly unusual position in this season's NCAA 
semifinals, which will be played today at Portland, Ore., because they are 
underdogs, having finished the season ranked second, behind Notre Dame. North 
Carolina (23-1-1) plays sixth-ranked Connecticut (19-3) and Notre Dame (22-0-1) 
plays fifth-ranked Portland (16-5). The winners will play for the championship 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless how the Tar Heels fare this weekend, people will still seek out 
Dorrance, just as they still go to John Wooden, hoping to learn the secret of 
building a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorrance has been asked for it, oh, maybe a thousand times, but he patiently 
discusses it again in typical coaching style -- get some good soccer players, 
blend in a few other good athletes and train them well. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Dorrance continues, he digresses into the politically dangerous 
territory of female competitiveness. It becomes clear that although Dorrance 
also coached the North Carolina men's team from 1976-1988, he has spent years 
hammering out a theory on the female psyche and using it to get the most from 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, Dorrance says women need to be taught to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women don't have a natural aptitude to beat the hell out of their friends 
like men do," he says. "Men don't take direct confrontation personally, so you 
can play against your best friend in a one-on-one basketball game in the back 
yard and just mangle him for 45 minutes and there's no sort of . . . 
relationship problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women . . . don't really enjoy that sort of bashing the heck out of their 
best friend; it's more of a personal issue. And what we try to do here for the 
young women we bring in is to get them to accept the fact that it's OK to win. 
It's OK to be the best. It's OK to go after your best friend. All this is going 
to make you and her a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels' intense practices have been called "a caldron of 
competitiveness." Every drill is recorded, every play an opportunity to be won 
or lost. In a short, 1 1/2-hour practice, there is more yelling of 
encouragement, more sprints to the ball and more bodies flying through the air 
than many teams would see in several games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorrance said he believes women can compete as fiercely as men. His younger 
sister, Maggie, used to beat him in every sport when they were kids. And his 
mother used to beat his father in golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never really brought up with the mentality that women were inferior 
athletes to men," he said. "In fact, for the first 12 years of my life, I 
thought they were superior." 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that women handle competition differently from men came to 
Dorrance when he recruited April Heinrichs in 1983. Heinrichs was named the 
player of the decade in the 1980s by Soccer America after leading North 
Carolina to three NCAA championships and becoming the NCAA's all-time scoring 
leader with 225 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was tormented by jealous teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "(April's situation) convinced me that even though women can compete 
effectively, they don't improve their popularity by being this competitive," 
Dorrance said. "It was still important for April to have our support and the 
support of her teammates, so I learned a lot about how women want to play for 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Dorrance learned how to get his players to accept competing against each 
other in practice, he was on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tisha Venturini, the latest North Carolina superstar, the competitive 
atmosphere is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone goes after one another and it's not personal at all," she said. "And 
that's what you just have to figure out and deal with, here, is that nothing's 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
 For Venturini, a senior midfielder from Modesto, the loss to Duke was the only 
one in her college career. She is a three-time first-team All-American and 
could become the second player in the sport to earn the honor four times. U.S. 
national team player Kristine Lilly, who led North Carolina from 1989-92, was 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturini is the latest in a long line of Tar Heels on the national team, 
which until August was also coached by Dorrance. He retired from that to spend 
more time with his family and his Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Dorrance, the U.S. women won the first FIFA women's World Championship 
in China in 1991. A week earlier, with Dorrance and his two stars, Lilly and 
Mia Hamm, in China, the Tar Heels had won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Including Lilly and Hamm, nine Tar Heels were members of that World 
Championship team. Many of them still train at North Carolina, playing pick-up 
games on a field adjacent to where Dorrance conducts the Tar Heels' practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I catch myself watching them during practice because they are so 
good," Venturini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamm, the national player of the year in 1992 and 1993 for the Tar Heels -- 
she is one of four North Carolina players to have been named national player of 
the year twice -- serves as a volunteer assistant for Dorrance while she trains 
for next summer's World Championship in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have someone who will go out and work out with you," Hamm said. 
"All you have to do is pick up the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 There is another reason Dorrance's players stick around.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing for him," Venturini said. "I've never enjoyed playing for 
anyone more and I don't think I ever will. He's basically my main source of 
motivation, every game. I look to him and he says something, or just looking at 
him makes me want to go after it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorrance, however, believes he got the better end of the deal by teaching 
women how to go for the jugular in athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The players) have taught me, basically, how to relate and communicate more 
effectively. Basically, how to care," he said. "I think what I have gained from 
them is a heck of a lot more valuable than what they have gained from me."

BASEBALL OWNERS PUT A NEW PLAN ON THE TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league baseball owners presented the players' union with a new 
bargaining proposal Thursday designed around a payroll tax plan similar to that 
rejected by the locked-out hockey players as the equivalent of a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we feel good that they came in with a proposal on the taxation 
wavelength, but we have to look at it and see if it is something we can live 
with," Milwaukee Brewer pitcher Bob Scanlan said after a four-hour meeting in 
Herndon, Va. "It's tough to tell where the middle ground is." 
</P>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery asked the two sides not to discuss the 
102-page document that union economists went to work on Thursday night, but 
sources said it calls for an accelerating tax above a specified payroll 
ceiling, eliminates salary arbitration, as the owners' salary-cap proposal did, 
and provides for earlier free agency under the right of first-refusal 
restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax concept puts the owners and players on the same philosophical footing, 
but the severity of the tax -- believed to climb above 100% -- works in the 
same manner as a cap and might make a compromise difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clubs have a greater entitlement to tax payrolls and revenues than they 
do to ask for a salary cap," union lawyer Eugene Orza said. " . . . (But) there 
are obviously features of the proposal we don't like. It's not much different 
from the (rejected) hockey proposal in terms of rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have indicated they will implement the salary-cap proposal in early 
to mid-December unless an agreement is reached. The new proposal incorporates 
the revenue-sharing formula that the owners linked to a cap and technically, in 
management's view, keeps the cap on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us a revised salary-cap proposal that contains certain provisions 
necessary to understand their tax proposal," Orza said. "The clubs' strategy is 
to put both on the table, but what we discussed today was the taxation 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that there is a second proposal, the union does not believe the attempt to 
implement the cap will withstand scrutiny by the National Labor Relations 
Board, but sources said it did not raise that issue in Thursday's meeting.

FORMER BAYLOR COACH, ASSISTANTS INDICTED ON MAIL FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury Thursday indicted fired Baylor basketball coach Darrel 
Johnson, three former assistants and four others on mail and wire fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments came one day after Johnson was fired by school administrators 
who determined the men's basketball program had broken school and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges accuse Johnson and assistants Gary Thomas, Kevin Gray and Troy 
Drummond of conspiring with junior college officials to commit postal and wire 
fraud to gain eligibility for incoming recruits for the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Also indicted were officials at junior colleges in Hillsboro, Tex.; Kansas 
City, Kan., and Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment alleges the coaches and college officials conspired to help 
athletes cheat on correspondence courses at Southeast College of the Assemblies 
of God in Lakeland, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals were recruited to provide the students with answers to some final 
examinations and term papers prepared by others, the indictment alleges. Once 
the students received their grades, transcripts were sent by mail and fax to 
and from Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending transcripts via mail or fax containing fraudulent material is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson could not be reached for comment. David Cherry, his lawyer, said his 
client has done nothing wrong.

NHL'S SEASON SHRINKS YET AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL's fast-shrinking schedule was reduced for the third time during the 
owners' lockout as the league canceled 10 more games per team Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely expected move means the number of games canceled for each team has 
reached 24.The breakdown of lost games is 11 home, 11 road and two at neutral 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous cancellations, the league made no announcement as to which 
games will be canceled, saying the revised schedule will be released if and 
when the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the NHL and the players' union met for seven hours in Boston and 
plan to negotiate again today. It is the first time since Oct. 4-5 that the 
parties have negotiated on consecutive days. Neither side would comment on 
Thursday's discussions. LISA DILLMAN

SECODA LEADS VALENCIA'S SECOND CHANCE; FOOTBALL: AFTER FORFEITS ALMOST RUIN 
TIGERS' SEASON, QUARTERBACK/FREE SAFETY RALLIES THEM INTO THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Secoda stood before his Valencia teammates and gave an impassioned 
pre-game speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen up you seniors," he told them, "this could be it! 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get back in the league race. Everybody, we have to play our 
hardest. Don't leave it on the field!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was moments before the Magnolia game. Valencia already had forfeited two 
victories and a tie, and was winless in two Orange League games. The Tigers 
were 1-5-1. There was no way they could finish the regular season with a 
winning record. If they were going to qualify for the playoffs, they had to do 
so legitimately -- by finishing first, second or third in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
 And that night, Secoda passed for 257 yards and two touchdowns, and Valencia 
won, 28-7. And the next two weeks, the Tigers defeated two teams that were 
unbeaten in league, Western (24-7) and Brea-Olinda (10-7). And Valencia reached 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda and his coach, Mike Marrujo, agree on one thing: Secoda's greatest 
asset is his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 One need only look to Secoda's other sports to see how apparent his leadership 
and athletic skills are: In basketball, he's a point guard; in baseball, he's a 
shortstop and pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the football field, Secoda is the quarterback and free safety. Not only 
did he pass this season for 10 touchdowns, with only four interceptions, but he 
also intercepted a county-high eight passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only kid we've ever had that we let play quarterback and defense," 
Marrujo said. "He's such a good athlete, and he did so well last year at safety 
that we hated to not use him. We couldn't afford to not have him back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda has 16 interceptions in two seasons. He would have played varsity 
during his sophomore year, but was too young -- only 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda turns 17 on Saturday, the day after Valencia opens the Southern Section 
Division V playoffs against Westminster. The Tigers are the Orange League's No. 
2 entry because it held the tie-breaker advantage over Brea. And it beat Brea, 
10-7, because it got a 38-yard field goal and 53-yard scoring run by Secoda. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second time in 12 seasons that Valencia didn't win the league 
title, but the prospect of not making the playoffs was even worse. It would 
have been the first time in 15 seasons the Tigers had failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "That put a little more pressure on us," Secoda said. "There's something at 
Valencia -- they've found a knack for winning." 
</P>
<P>
 They've found that knack because they've found players like Secoda, whose 
importance on this team can't be overstated. In addition to being quarterback, 
free safety and kicker, he also punts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing quarterback and free safety helps," Secoda said. "I can read the 
quarterback and I can read the safety because I know what I would be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But his value goes beyond his physical skills; his first-hand insight is 
complemented his knowledge of the playbook and scouting reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "He calls the offense and knows everybody's position," Marrujo said. "I tell 
the kids, if you ever panic and don't know where to be, just ask Joey. On 
defense, he can get everybody where they need to be. He's that sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can put everyone on the field in the right position; it makes all the 
difference. It's just like having a coach on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 And Secoda knows it. He is book smart and football-savvy, and it has come 
together in a nice little season for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the football banquet last year, my dad and I were talking to Coach 
Marrujo and he said I was going to be able to play both ways," Secoda said. 
"(Being a quarterback), that made me feel special, like I could do it, and it 
gave me a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains is the happy ending.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NATION; NCAA PROBATION FOR 
MISSISSIPPI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of Mississippi football program was put on four years' 
probation and had its scholarships halved Thursday in what the NCAA called "one 
of the most serious cases" heard recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels will not be allowed to play postseason games in 1995 and 1996 and 
cannot appear on television in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time in less than 10 years that the Mississippi football team 
will serve probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest case, Mississippi was charged with a lack of institutional 
control over the football program, including allegations that recruits were 
offered cash and cars. The NCAA said the charges were similar to those in a 
1986 case that led to two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 David Swank, chairman of the NCAA Committee on Infractions, said the reason 
for the severity of the penalties stemmed from the earlier case and the 
university "seemingly not correcting those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The school has until Dec. 1 to appeal the findings or penalties, but 
university attorney Mary Ann Connell said an appeal was highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming Athletic Director Pete Boone said the television and bowl ban could 
cost the program more than $2.5 million next year alone -- about $1.9 million 
in television revenue and at least $600,000 in bowl revenue from the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone assumes the position full-time on Jan. 1. He was hired in September to 
replace Warner Alford, who resigned after 16 years on July 11, a day before the 
school fired head football coach Billy Brewer after 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Swank said the sanctions would have been more severe had personnel changes not 
been made.

 Wisconsin tailback Brent Moss, the most valuable player in last year's Rose 
Bowl game, issued a public apology after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor 
charge of possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, suspended from the team after his arrest Nov. 9, was put on two years' 
probation and given a $250 fine that can be worked off in community service at 
the rate of $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss pleaded guilty after a possible felony charge was reduced to a 
misdemeanor by Dane County Dist. Atty. Bill Foust, who said he was convinced 
the drug was obtained for personal use, not delivery to anyone else.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; FERRARA EQUALS TRACK RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ferrara, a colt bred by the late Don Ameche and now racing for the actor's 
son, Don Ameche Jr., has raced twice since returning from an injury, and the 
results have been fast and faster. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 22, Ferrara ran six furlongs in 1:08 3/5 at Santa Anita, and on 
Thursday he won by three lengths over Isitingood at Hollywood Park, tying the 
track record for 6 1/2 furlongs with a clocking of 1:13 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrara was a promising 2-year-old for trainer Gary Jones a year ago, running 
third in the Del Mar Futurity and the Norfolk at Santa Anita, but he cracked a 
bone in a hind leg early this year. Ferrara scored his victory at Santa Anita, 
by a half-length, also over Isitingood, in his first start in almost 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden again Thursday by Chris Antley, Ferrara took the lead on the turn and 
hit the wire in the same time that Arches Of Gold posted in setting the track 
record in 1992. Ferrara paid $6.20 as the second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis was unseated by his mount, Make Your Call, at the start of the 
third race. The jockey suffered a cut on his left hand and took off the rest of 
his mounts after complaining of dizziness. BILL CHRISTINE

MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW / CAL LUTHERAN; RIDER PLANS TO GO DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there life after Mike Dunlap? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal Lutheran men's basketball team will be searching for the answer 
tonight when the Kingsmen open their season against UC Santa Cruz in the Menlo 
College tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap compiled an 80-55 record during his five seasons at Cal Lutheran before 
taking a head-coaching position with the Adelaide 36ers of Australia's National 
Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
 During Dunlap's final season at the helm, the Kingsmen (25-3) had a 
school-record 15-game winning streak, won a share of their third consecutive 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title and advanced to 
the third round of the NCAA Division III playoffs. Still, first-year Coach Rich 
Rider says he feels no pressure to match those accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about that," he said. "We just want to be the best we can be 
with the players we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 6-foot-4 forward Derrick Clark (15.9 points per game, 7.6 rebounds), 
6-6 center Paul LaMott (6.7, 4.0) and 5-9 point guard Dave Ulloa (9.3, 4.3 
assists) are returning starters, the Kingsmen have lost the other four members 
from last season's seven-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Damon Ridley (20.6 points, 5.2 rebounds), the SCIAC player of the year, 
and Paul Tapp (12.5 points) used up their eligibility last season. Forward 
Rupert Sapwell (13.1, 7.0) had another year of eligibility remaining, but chose 
to return to his native Australia after completing his requirements for a 
bachelor of arts degree. Swingman Jason Smith (9.0, 4.7) has transferred to 
Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those losses, depth could be Cal Lutheran's greatest asset this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen have 13 players on their roster and Rider won't be surprised if 
each gets plenty of playing time during the first five or six contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go with at least a 10-man rotation and maybe more than that," 
Rider said. "We can go small or we can go big, depending on what the situation 
calls for." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fenton, a 6-6 senior forward, and Mark Heerema, a 6-2 junior guard, saw 
limited playing time last season, but are expected to join seniors Clark and 
LaMott, and junior Ulloa in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pletsch, a 6-8 senior center-forward, Nick Athanassakis, a 6-6 junior 
forward from Glendale College, and Christian Dunbar, a 6-foot junior guard, 
head the list of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Pletsch, a 1990 graduate of Antelope Valley High, is the most-improved player 
on the team, according to Rider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice when you can say that about a guy who's 6-8," he said. "Normally, 
it's the 5-5 point guard who's shown the most improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran will play its home opener against UC Santa Cruz -- the second of 
three games against the Banana Slugs this season -- on Nov. 26 and begins SCIAC 
play at home against Redlands on Jan. 11.

ALEMANY'S GYM IS ON THE BUBBLE; EARTHQUAKE: WINTER SPORTS FACING LIFE ON THE 
ROAD AS PROBLEMS PLAGUE INFLATABLE STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is not enough light, or heat, or seating capacity or even entrances to 
the thing. It leaks, water seeps in through the floor when it rains, and high 
winds Wednesday tore holes in the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, things are just fine with Alemany High's inflatable domed 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we solve a problem, a new one comes up," Athletic Director Dudley 
Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to post-earthquake life at the Mission Hills campus, where dilemmas 
are as commonplace as pencils and the sustained sound of hissing air comes from 
its real-life bubble that is slowly bursting. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending more than $150,000 on the structure, at least $40,000 more in 
repairs and alterations, and untold hours trouble-shooting, the dome is nowhere 
near ready for the Indians' winter sports teams. "I feel like a nomad," girls' 
basketball Coach Melissa Hearlihy said. "But if we're going to stress out over 
the gym in the beginning of the year, it's going to be a very long year. We'll 
just deal with it and go on from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the boys' and girls' basketball teams still hope to play at least some 
of their home games in the facility, both squads already have found alternate 
sites. Last season, the teams played all post-quake games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an annual tournament, sponsored by the highly successful girls' 
basketball team and that routinely generates $1,500 for the athletic 
department, has been canceled. The Alemany girls were 30-1 last season and won 
the Southern Section Division II-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't recommend that type of a dome for use as a gym," Father Robert 
Milbauer, Alemany's principal, said on Thursday. "It's too hot in the summer 
and too cold in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 The state architect's office -- saying there was no code for such a building 
on school grounds -- recently rejected Simi Valley High's plan to erect a 
similar dome to replace its earthquake-damaged gym. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Alemany is a private school, it didn't need such approval. And 
though the dome seems like a giant boondoggle, school officials haven't yet 
given up on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, workers installed additional banks of lights on poles standing 
outside the gym. The lights illuminate the court by shining through the white, 
vinyl-like exterior, which covers the hardwood floor and is inflated with a 
large fan. The existing lamps haven't provided sufficient lighting.  
</P>
<P>
 But even if the new lights solve that problem, they can't heat the dome's 
chilly winter air. "We've got an electrical contractor looking at that," Rooney 
said. "We're not sure how we're going to solve that." 
</P>
<P>
 How about the puddles that formed during the first rain? "A contractor dug a 
trench under it, which we hope will solve that," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
 And the leaks? "We're in the process of patching them." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany's old gym -- along with most of the school's buildings -- was rendered 
unusable by the Northridge earthquake Jan. 17. Students attend classes in a 
nearby seminary. A decision to repair the buildings or raze them and rebuild is 
expected by late December. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, playing home games depends on the state of the dome. Portable 
NBA-style backboards arrive today. Indoor/outdoor carpeting has been installed, 
as has a sound system, emergency exits and handicap access. 
</P>
<P>
 Seating capacity is 400, but the only real entrance is through a stubborn 
revolving door. "That would take forever," Milbauer said. "We'll probably have 
to open up the emergency doors to let students in for games. Oh! That reminds 
me. The material around the emergency doors was ripping in the high winds 
yesterday. I'm going to have to call someone about that."

 The stream of excited Taft High fans was coming down to center court to

Alpert of Palisades, 6-2, 6-2, to extend her three-year unbeaten string in team 
competition to 47-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Feldman could get off the court for the flurry of hugs and kisses, 
an explosion of screams and cheers occurred two courts down. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades players rushed onto the court to mob Carolyn Lee, who had just 
defeated Taft's Alicia Whelan, 7-5, 6-0, to clinch the City Section 4-A 
Division team championship at The Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins routed the two-time defending champion Toreadors, 6-1. Feldman, 
the Valley's best player and the section's No. 2-seeded player in the upcoming 
individual tournament, made dazzling shots in earning Taft's only point. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taft (15-1) was hoping for more. Coach Marvin Jones split up his 
undefeated No. 1 doubles team of Whelan and Ravid Levy (12-0) to beef up the 
singles. Jones was hoping to sweep the four singles matches or win at least 
three and steal a victory in one of three doubles matches. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Shana Miller, at No. 2 singles, handed Levy (30-1) the first loss of her 
varsity career, 0-6, 6-0, 6-4. Whelan suffered the clinching defeat, and 
Marissa Parker was handled by Brenda Moore at No. 4 singles, 6-1, 6-1. As far 
as stealing a victory in doubles, Taft's closest match was a 6-4, 6-3 setback 
by Jodi Cohen and G-Won Shin to Alison Fischer and Christin Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a real good chance to sweep the doubles when (Jones) moved 
Whelan and Levy to singles," said Palisades Coach Bud Kling, whose Dolphins 
(14-1) had beaten Taft for the title seven years in a row before the Toreadors 
broke through in 1992. "But I also thought we would have won two, three and 
four singles, regardless." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Taft player who wouldn't be beaten, Kling figured, would be Feldman, 
who attacked Alpert with powerful ground strokes and athletic shots at the net. 
"I didn't have a very good day, but, within high school, nobody serves and 
volleys like this," Alpert said. "I'm just glad we won." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, who said Alpert (10-2) was her toughest opponent of the season, was 
reluctant to give herself credit. "My net game was off and on," she said. "But 
when it was on, I thought it was pretty good. I surprised myself a couple 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-A final, Carson's 5-2 victory over Eagle Rock was clinched when its 
No. 1 doubles team of Jessica Quileza and Christina Banania hung on for a 6-0, 
6-7 (7-5), 6-3 victory over Jenny Gonzales and Alice Shen.

HAND-ME-DOWN; IACENDA WEARS BROTHER'S JERSEY AND POSITION WELL AT HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each Friday night, Andy Iacenda squirms in his 50-yard-line seat while 
watching his little brother run, catch and carry the football across the goal 
line for Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Ted Iacenda is among the area's leading rushers and pass 
receivers. With 31 touchdowns in 10 games and 186 points, Iacenda leads the 
area in scoring. He reaches the end zone every 6.4 times he touches the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a bruising 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior with soft hands and nimble feet. 
Coaches who have seen him play agree that Iacenda is the complete package -- a 
can't-miss Division I talent. 
</P>
<P>
 He was once known as Andy's kid brother, a boy nearly eight years younger who 
had no interest in football. Now he's "Touchdown Teddy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He amazes me, he has so much natural ability," said Andy, a former Hart 
standout who played one season of college football. "I knew his potential, but 
when he scored five touchdowns (in the 1994 season opener) against San 
Fernando, my mouth dropped." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ted runs free on the field, Andy's emotions run wild in the stands. He 
fears for his brother's health when he gets hit hard, beams with pride whenever 
Ted shows compassion by pulling an opposing player off the turf, gets 
sentimental whenever Ted scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy, 24, watches Ted and he sees himself, sometimes regretting the fact that 
he came home after one semester at Vanderbilt, where he played football as a 
true freshman but never played again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to find a semipro league around here," Andy said. "He inspires me 
when I see him dominate. Football's in my heart. I love the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted, who turned 17 last week, has dazzled his brother and everyone else at 
Hart by lighting up the scoreboard. He has 51 touchdowns in two seasons, having 
scored 20 times as a sophomore. He is averaging 3.1 touchdowns per game this 
season. "All the stats are nice," Ted said. "You like to look back and say, 
'Wow. I did this?' But going 14-0 means more to me than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 If Hart (10-0) reaches the championship game of the Southern Section Division 
II playoffs and Iacenda maintains his scoring pace, he would finish with 43 
touchdowns. Should Hart play 14 games next year as well and Iacenda maintain 
the same pace, he would finish his career with 104 touchdowns and 624 points, 
thereby making a run at the state career record, which stands at 574, set last 
week by Bakersfield's Steve Wofford (1992-94). 
</P>
<P>
 That's a big if , but Iacenda has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, who play Torrance (5-5) tonight at 7:30 p.m. at College of the 
Canyons, are seeded No. 1 in the division and don't rely solely on Iacenda. 
They have the area's second best offense (382.8 yards per game), the highest 
rated quarterback in Steve McKeon (186.13 using the NCAA rating system) and a 
host of reliable receivers in a run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody has been able to stop Iacenda, who has rushed for 1,127 yards for 
23 touchdowns and caught 33 passes for 540 yards and eight scores. In two 
seasons, he has rushed for 1,777 yards and 37 touchdowns, averaging 6.3 yards 
per carry. He has caught 74 passes for 1,010 yards and 14 touchdowns, averaging 
13.6 yards per reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do it all," Hart offensive coordinator Dean Herrington said. "He knows 
how to play the game. He's a great runner. He's one of the best pass receivers 
we've had here at the school. He does a good job blocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's caught our eye this year is his acceleration. Last year, if he got 
into the secondary he was going to get tackled. This year he can break the long 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda has played tackle football only three seasons, but brother Andy has 
helped him develop quickly. Andy tells Ted to hold a football in his hands 
whenever he can, so the feeling becomes familiar. He also tells Ted never to 
give in when he gets near the end zone. "It's just a frame of mind my brother 
talked to me about when I was little," Ted said. "When you're that close, why 
not finish it off? I can sense when I'm going to score. Something clicks inside 
of me. It's a rush. I don't feel like I can be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seems to fade away when you get close. You're not tired. You don't 
feel anything. It's just you and the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy rushed for 928 yards and 19 touchdowns in 1986, his senior year at Hart. 
Ted, who wears Andy's No. 46, was living with his mother near Houston and never 
saw Andy play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I really knew he was playing football," Ted said. "Now I kind 
of wish I had watched him. Sometimes I look back on some of his game films, and 
it's not really the same. I wish I could have been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited by Stanford, Rice, Washington and Arizona, Andy took a scholarship 
at Vanderbilt. He gained 130 yards in 33 carries and had five receptions for 34 
yards as a freshman. He scored his only touchdown -- a three-yard run -- in a 
nationally televised, 48-15 loss in front of 79,500 fans at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 He withdrew from Vanderbilt after that semester, homesick and missing his 
girlfriend. Andy then bounced from Glendale College to Columbia University to 
Valley College to Arizona State and back to Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent three weeks at Arizona State's fall camp but came home when the Sun 
Devils didn't offer him a football scholarship. Vanderbilt Coach Watson Brown 
took Andy back in the spring of 1989, and Iacenda had a good spring camp while 
alternating at starting fullback. But he was behind on credits and needed to 
scramble to get the units necessary to become eligible for what would have been 
a redshirt junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 After he took summer classes, school officials told Andy he was three units 
short. He withdrew from school and came home again. He now works as a campus 
supervisor at La Mesa Junior High while taking classes at College of the 
Canyons. He also lives at home with Ted and their father, Andy Sr. Ted relishes 
the fact that he's living with his brother after the two lived apart for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that he's around," Ted said. "He's someone I can talk to. He 
teaches me a lot. In certain regards he's told me to look at him and learn from 
him and not make the same mistakes as he did. But he has also told me not to 
follow him, to be my own man. I'm going to try to not get myself in the same 
circumstance and not get homesick." 
</P>
<P>
 A sibling rivalry has developed between the two, sparked by Ted's success. "I 
always tell him I'm better than him," Ted said. "He always tells me, 'Until 
you've accomplished what I accomplished, Ted, don't come bragging to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But there is an occasional undercurrent of regret in the banter.  
</P>
<P>
 Andy, who was in the same Southeastern Conference freshman class as NFL 
running backs Emmitt Smith, Rodney Hampton and Reggie Cobb, is left to wonder 
what he would have accomplished had he never left Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scratch my head when I watch (Smith, Hampton and Cobb) on TV," he said. "I 
wonder what would have happened if I worked harder. I was wrapped up (by 
homesickness) and that pulled me back. I was a lazy player. I didn't want it 
that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Ted) works hard. He's exceeding all expectations, and he's just maturing. 
He's going to get bigger and stronger and he's going to gain speed just with 
the muscle he puts on. He runs about 4.6 (in the 40-yard dash) now, and (his 
time is) going to be dropping." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years from now, Ted should be playing in college and Andy will probably 
have a ticket on the 50.

UKRAINIAN COWBOY; OVERCOMING OBSTACLES, CHIGRIN GETS HIS FIRST START FOR CANYON 
HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Quit" might never make its way into the ever-expanding vocabulary of Canyon 
High defensive tackle Konstantin Chigrin. 
</P>
<P>
 Chigrin, a native of Ukraine who moved to Canyon Country two years ago, has 
toiled through weeks of football practice -- even though he has spent the 
season academically ineligible and has yet to strap on a set of shoulder pads 
on a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He might just as well have walked away. Several Canyon players have this 
season. But Chigrin, whose academic struggles can be attributed in part to the 
language barrier, continues to suit up and sweat each day, just as he continues 
to improve on his halting enunciation of English. 
</P>
<P>
 Quit now? Nyet on his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why go all the way to the 10th week and then quit?" Chigrin said. "Those guys 
who want to quit, seriously, I don't understand that. If I go, I'm going all 
the way to the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he will get his chance. Chigrin, who gained academic eligibility this 
week, is scheduled to start tonight when Canyon travels to Torrance High for a 
7:30 game against Peninsula in the opening round of the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon (3-5-1) finished third in the Foothill League at 2-2 to squeeze into 
the playoffs in what has been a disappointing and tumultuous season. Seven 
players quit after a 13-13 tie against Alemany. Four returned within days. This 
week, tight end Rob Varnon quit for the second time, tailback Jeff McKinley was 
declared academically ineligible and backup quarterback Brian Bialas was voted 
off the team by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But attrition is not the reason Chigrin will play. Ability is. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the best defensive lineman on the team," assistant coach Paul Gomes 
said. "No question. That's why he is going to start." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-feet-9, 175 pounds, Chigrin has impressed coaches and confounded blockers 
with his quickness and tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys can't block him," Coach Larry Mohr said. "So, (Peninsula) shouldn't 
be able to stop him, either. He is just relentless." 
</P>
<P>
 In what has become the highlight of afternoon practice, Chigrin squares off 
with senior tackle Mark Manskar (6-7, 250), who is ranked among the nation's 
top 10 high school linemen by USA Today and is on every major college's 
recruiting list. Chigrin gives as good as he gets in the matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knocks the . . . out of me sometimes and I hear it from the guys," Manskar 
said. "He's short and solid and he hits like a rock. And he's quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined and opportunistic might be better adjectives to describe Chigrin, 
18. He left his father and a steady girlfriend in his native Kiev to join his 
mother, who was divorced from his father when he was 13 and moved to Southern 
California in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw opportunity here for a better life," he said. "Some people just don't 
understand how good they have it here." 
</P>
<P>
 Academic shortcomings notwithstanding, he has made marked strides in learning 
English. Upon arrival, he could barely utter a word. Today, he sprinkles his 
conversations with bits of Southern California slang. "Some people here work 
really hard," he said. "And others are just kicking back in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former soccer player, Chigrin naturally gravitated toward the school's 
athletes. He was surprised to learn Canyon had a football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a couple of games on TV," he said. "I didn't really understand it, but 
it was interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 That led him to approach former Coach Harry Welch about a tryout. "He walked 
up to me in the weight room with a pocket dictionary sticking out of his 
jockstrap and said, 'I play football,' " Welch said. "What he meant was, 'I 
want to play football.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chigrin: "I didn't care that it was hard and we practiced five hours a 
day. I played because it was fun to hit someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Chigrin made the team, but spent most of last season on the bench, playing 
sparingly on special teams. Confused by nuances of the game, he failed at 
tryouts at running back and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to be fullback, but I didn't learn the plays," he said. "What's this 
34 left or 35 right? I kind of got pushed to the defensive line. It's easier. 
Your role is just, 'Get the guy with the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Matters have been more difficult in the classroom. Last spring, Chigrin failed 
two classes -- one an English course -- and his grade-point average dipped 
below the 2.0 required of student athletes. He dropped out of the school's 
program designed to assist students with native languages other than English. 
"I didn't feel like it was helping me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chigrin attempted to make up the grades during summer school but fell short. 
This fall, he finally made the grade. "I just wanted to play so bad," he said. 
"That's why I was keeping myself in shape. I was thinking, 'I'm going to to 
play.' I'm going to play.' "

A HOLLYWOOD SPIN ON A HORROR SCRIPT; O'CONNOR DIRECTS DOWNTRODDEN FOOTBALL 
PROGRAM INTO POSTSEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob O'Connor has authored a virtual library of college textbooks, but it is 
the latest chapter of his football coaching career that has many taking note. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, he will lead Hollywood High, a longtime laughingstock, into the City 
Section 3-A Division football playoffs in the team's first postseason 
appearance since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of overhauling an unsuccessful high school football program usually 
falls to some 22-year-old right out of college with boundless enthusiasm and a 
dire need to build a resume. 
</P>
<P>
 So why would O'Connor, 62 -- who has written 22 books, coached in Europe and 
built his own three-story mountaintop dream house -- take take on a 
$1,400-a-year project many would consider impossible? 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to do it for love," said O'Connor, in his third season with the 
Sheiks. "I gave up (coaching) 'forever' to build the house in 1964. Two years 
later, I was back. There's a pull there." 
</P>
<P>
 That pull has led him through four high school head-coaching positions, 
including one at Taft. Throw in a duffel-bag full of assistant positions and a 
stint as athletic director at Pierce College, and the last thing O'Connor needs 
is another line on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Connor took over a woebegone Hollywood program during the first week of 
the 1992 season, he was greeted by seven players. 
</P>
<P>
 The team lost all its games that season, and did the same in 1993. The streak 
reached 19 games before the Sheiks won the second game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They finished 5-5 and will meet Washington tonight at Banning High in the 
first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we've got it turned around," said O'Connor, who resides in Agoura 
Hills. "These guys are so surprised to be where they are right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially considering from where they have come. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 15 years since the Sheiks last won a league championship and their 
only City title came in 1927, the same year Al Jolson's "Jazz Singer" hit 
Hollywood theaters as the first talking motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987 to 1989, Hollywood was winless, dropping 27 consecutive games. Add 
to that the recent 19-game skid and you've got a real Hollywood tear-jerker. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Connor and his Hollywood team are now drawing rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been so much spirit with the team," Hollywood Principal Jeanne 
E. Hon said. "We've received letters from people commending us on the team. 
They're impressed with the sportsmanship and manner of the team. It's been a 
long time since we've received one of those." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheiks may be seeded 12th in the 16-team 3-A playoffs, but don't bet 
against O'Connor. He loves longshots. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he attempted to lure a professional football franchise to Pierce as 
part of an effort to build a 70,000-seat stadium on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded in recruiting the Steve Young-led L.A. Express of the United 
States Football League to play its final game of the '85 season in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a success, drawing an overflow crowd of 8,200 to Pierce's 
5,000-seat stadium. The Express, however, folded soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 Young went on to star in the National Football League, while O'Connor tackled 
other challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest undertaking is a book co-authored with Seattle Seahawks Coach Tom 
Flores titled "Football: A Violent Chess Match," the third published by the 
pair. The others are instructional books on coaching.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had an idea for a book and he had the name," O'Connor said of his first 
contact with Flores. "I cold-called him and he said, 'Let's have a meeting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor's other writing ventures have included college textbooks on physical 
education and health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't written a word of that stuff since the season began, though," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But O'Connor, who teaches physical education at Hollywood, already 
has begun composing the next chapter in his coaching story. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, he will coach Norway's national football team in the European 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not be O'Connor's first football foray overseas. He has coached at the 
club level in Europe, and as athletic director at Pierce, he arranged for the 
Brahmas to play an exhibition in Finland during the summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, when the season ends in Norway, O'Connor might stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a small chance I may come back to Hollywood," he said. "This 
has been a great experience."

SIDELINES; FOR FOUR MUSKETEERS, PLAYOFF DUEL NO. 2 WILL BE KIDS' STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Moorpark High's football team loses at Atascadero in tonight's first round 
of the Southern Section playoffs, the four-hour bus ride home won't be so long 
for J.P. Dolliver, Juan Barron, Kevin Smyres and Chris Sedik. 
</P>
<P>
 Football season will continue the next morning because these four Musketeers 
coach a playoff-bound team of seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolliver might be drawing up plays on the ride home; he's the offensive 
coordinator of the Moorpark Packers (7-1), who have a home playoff game against 
Port Hueneme at 11 a.m. Saturday. The Packers are champions of the Pacific 
Youth Football League Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the kids, especially the group we're with this year," said Dolliver, 
who for three years has assisted his father Brad, the head coach. "I really 
enjoy it. It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolliver, a junior quarterback who backs up junior Bryan Paul, has attempted 
only two passes this season, completing none. But coaching, he said, has made 
him a better player. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday choices: Zack Hernandez is Christmas shopping . . . for colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The former All-Southern Section quarterback from L.A. Baptist High announced 
this week he will leave Cal Lutheran to play at a junior college, and his top 
choices so far are Valley or Glendale, Hernandez said. He said he might also 
consider Pierce or Moorpark. He expects to take a month or so to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who redshirted his freshman season at Division III Cal Lutheran, 
said he wants to play at the junior college level in hopes of earning a 
Division I scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go to a junior college I can eliminate the fact that I went to a small 
high school," he said. "I want to push myself to see how high I can go." 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs 'em?: Canyon High Coach Larry Mohr has seen his program receive more 
notoriety for losing players than winning football games this season. The 
Cowboys, who have had six players either quit, become academically ineligible 
or be voted off the team by teammates, have won only three games but qualified 
for the playoffs with a 2-2 Foothill League record. Still, Mohr is angry at the 
negative image. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are writing about kids that quit or can't stay eligible and not giving 
credit to the kids that stick with us," he said. "I don't feel negative 
publicity is good for 16- and 17-year-old kids. But if a kid wants to get his 
name in the paper, he should just quit." Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Travis Hall and receiver David Romines played both ways in Cal State 
Northridge's 60-7 loss to Northern Arizona and were twice rewarded by their 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, who started at safety, and Romines, at cornerback, were named the team's 
co-offensive and co-defensive players of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Vaughn, a safety who intercepted two passes to tie the school 
single-season record of nine, shared the defensive award. Vaughn had 10 tackles 
and has won or shared team defensive honors four times. Mike Greslie and Ken 
Freitas shared special-teams honors. 
</P>
<P>
 MVPs: Linebackers Troy Tuck of Valley College and Justin Simo of Moorpark were 
named Western State Conference defensive co-players of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck, a freshman from Moeller High in Cincinnati, made seven unassisted 
tackles and intercepted a pass in a 43-6 victory over Compton last Saturday. 
Simo, a freshman from Newbury Park High, had eight solo tackles and returned an 
interception 28 yards for a touchdown. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the area's top high school quarterback? Statistically speaking, state 
your case. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the playoffs, Brian MacLean of Granada Hills High leads area 
passers with 2,146 yards. However, Dave Lins of Crespi, who ranks second with 
1,883 yards, has a higher completion percentage (65.4%) than MacLean (58.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McKeon of Hart ranks third with 1,832 yards, but his completion 
percentage (63.9) is better than MacLean's and he has thrown more touchdown 
passes (19) than Lins (13). 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Gamboa of Poly, who ranks fourth with 1,760 yards, has thrown 16 
interceptions -- twice as many as Lins. Yet, statistically, one could argue 
that Gamboa is better than Lins. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusing? Perhaps that's why statisticians rely on a complex 
efficiency-rating system to determine whose statistics are best among NCAA and 
NFL quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the NCAA rating system, here's how the area's top four passers compare: 
McKeon (186.13), MacLean (153.7), Gamboa (130.27), Lins (128.78). 
</P>
<P>
 Adjusting the numbers: After further review, Valley College statisticians 
determined that Monarch quarterback Jim Arellanes passed for 639 yards two 
weeks ago against Bakersfield, five yards fewer than originally reported. 
Either way, it still is a state junior college single-game record. Things to Do 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, 1:30 p.m., UC Santa Barbara swim facility: Agoura and Royal face the 
top water polo teams in Division IV of the Southern Section in back-to-back 
semifinal matches. Royal will play No. 2 Santa Barbara, followed by Agoura 
against No. 1 San Marcos. One other regional team, Crescenta Valley, will play 
in the semifinals Saturday. The Falcons will meet La Serna in a Division III 
match at 2 p.m. at Caltech.

DE LA HOYA TAKES AIM AT RUELAS; BOXING: MATCH 'SET' FOR MAY 6, BUT FIRST HE HAS 
TO BEAT CARL GRIFFITH TONIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 Even as Oscar De La Hoya makes his last preparations for tonight's undercard 
fight against Carl Griffith, his long-awaited matchup against Rafael Ruelas -- 
potentially the biggest bout involving Los Angeles-area fighters in decades -- 
is moving swiftly toward realization. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum, who promotes both fighters, says the De La Hoya-Ruelas grudge match 
is "as set as anything can be in boxing," and is scheduled for May 6 in 
conjunction with the Cinco de Mayo weekend at the MGM Grand here. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arum has begun negotiations with the Forum, which represents World Boxing 
Assn. junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez, to try to add another L.A. 
spotlight fight to the bill: a unification bout between World Boxing Council 
junior-lightweight champion Gabriel Ruelas and Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya (14-0, 13 knockouts) first must defeat Griffith (28-3-2, 12 KOs), 
who has had drug problems recently, then Johnny Avila in December at the Grand 
Olympic Auditorium, then possibly either Azumah Nelson or John-John Molina on 
HBO in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, has a 
title defense scheduled Jan. 28 at the MGM, and his brother also is set to 
defend on that card. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former heavyweight champion Michael Moorer, who announced his retirement 
Wednesday night on a Detroit radio station, said Thursday that he was in a bad 
mood at the time and didn't mean it. "I was the first southpaw to win it and 
I'll be the first southpaw to get it back," said Moorer, 27, who lost the 
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. titles to George Foreman 
two weeks ago. "I will not retire."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW / CAL LUTHERAN; SIZE COULD GIVE LA KOSE'S TEAM REGAL 
LOOK THIS YEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Second-year Coach Tim La Kose has reason to feel optimistic as his Cal 
Lutheran women's basketball team heads into Saturday's opener against Simpson 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Diana Cortez (5-foot-5) and senior center Kelli McCaskill (6-0) 
are returning second-team All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez finished sixth in the nation among Division III players with 161 
assists in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaskill averaged 15.7 points and 9.9 rebounds last season. The Regals were 
8-15 last season, 4-8 and sixth in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Six players return from last season and five players are 6 feet or taller. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior guard Nicole Albert (5-5) has recovered from an abdominal strain that 
hampered her much of last season, and sophomore guard Melissa Wood (5-9), who 
averaged three three-pointers a game last season, provides long-range shooting 
for Cal Lutheran. Rounding out the starting lineup is 6-1 sophomore Evi 
Orologas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having size and our shooting ability are going to be our strengths this 
season," La Kose said. "I think that we will be in the thick of things this 
year." BRYAN RODGERS

ROUNDUP; LA REINA GIRLS ADVANCE TO TENNIS TITLE MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The La Reina High girls' tennis team, led by doubles players Vicki Hull and 
Katie Nelson, and Catherine Chien and Heather Szabo, defeated South Hills, 
12-6, in a semifinal match of the Southern Section Division V playoffs at North 
Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull and Nelson, the Regents' No. 1 doubles team, and No. 2 Chien and Szabo 
each swept their doubles matches against South Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the fifth in a row and 14th in the last 15 matches for La Reina 
(15-3), which will play Nordhoff in the championship match at The Claremont 
Club on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be La Reina's second appearance in a section final. The Regents lost 
to Mayfield, 13-5, in the 1-A Division final in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In other girls' tennis playoff matches: 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff 10, Rim of the World 8 -- Sarah Blaine and Cara Dunstan, Nordhoff's 
No. 3 doubles team, defeated No. 1 Amanda Scopen and Andrea Prince of Rim of 
the World, 6-2, to clinch the Rangers' victory in the final match of the 
Southern Section Division V semifinal at Ojai Valley Racquet Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the sixth in a row for Nordhoff (14-6) and propelled the Rangers 
into the section final for the first time since 1978, when they lost to 
Westlake, 11-7, at the 1-A Division level. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 16, Calabasas 2 -- The Coyotes' upset streak ended with a 
semifinal loss to the top-seeded team in the Southern Section Division II 
playoffs. The match was started at Alta Laguna Park in Laguna Beach, then moved 
to Laguna Beach High because the courts there have lights. MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Geneva (Pa.) College 0, The Master's College 0 (Geneva wins, 4-1, in 
shoot-out) -- Geneva connected on all four of its kicks in the overtime 
shoot-out to win the semifinal of the National Christian College Athletic Assn. 
championships at Lee College in Cleveland, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Lee was the only Master's player who scored in the shoot-out as Patrick

CLOWN PRINCE PLAYS IN THE KING'S COURT; GOLF: MATCHED WITH PALMER, JACOBSEN 
KEEPS FANS IN STITCHES IN SHARK SHOOTOUT AT SHERWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like everyone else in the tournament field, Peter Jacobsen banged around a few 
golf balls on the practice range at Sherwood Country Club before teeing off in 
chilly conditions early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't waste any time getting the rest of his game warmed up, either. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of Jacobsen's amateur partners blasted a tee shot almost out of 
sight, Jacobsen didn't miss the chance to chime in with one of his 
characteristic wisecracks. He rarely does. 
</P>
<P>
 "You out-drive me one more time and I'm walking back in," Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fan-friendly event like the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout, effervescent 
guys like Jacobsen are a definite boon. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleries at the 54-hole event, which runs today through Sunday, are 
restricted to 5,000 fans daily. Fans are so close to the action that they 
literally can reach out and touch the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stodgy pros might prefer that this was not the case. Jacobsen is clearly 
a guy in his own element. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers dubbed the posh course Sherwood because the "Robin Hood" movies used 
to be filmed in the area. Jacobsen qualifies as one of the merry men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it comes naturally for me," said Jacobsen, a former network golf 
commentator. "I'm pretty talkative." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Jacobsen work a crowd -- or in this case, mug for the members of his 
pro-am foursome -- is something to behold. If a PGA Tour popularity contest was 
held, Jake would finish in the lead pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best, as far as I'm concerned," said Mike Cowan, Jacobsen's caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently. Cowan has worked for Jacobsen the past 16 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Peter likes people, can't you tell?" Cowan said, Jacobsen's cumbersome bag 
slung over his shoulder. "You don't have to be anybody special for him to care 
about you." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't always the norm. Many pros participate in pro-am events because it 
is required. Real sticks in the mud, some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen, on the other hand, practically adopts his playing partners as 
children. He takes time to learn their names -- and has no choice but to learn 
their games. Some of those amateurs are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 In pro-ams, the pro and his amateur teammates post a combined score. While 
many pros are aloof, Jacobsen was reading putts, soliciting advice, giving 
playing tips and chewing on their collective ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, if any amateurs in the field got their money's worth -- each donated 
$20,000 to charity for playing privileges -- it was Jacobsen's crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing partner Mike Karsner of Westlake Village, more often than not, was 
Jacobsen's foil. At one point on the front nine, Jacobsen gave the amateur a 
spontaneous lesson after the latter hit a sweeping duck hook into the 
boondocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn the hips. 
</P>
<P>
 Finish the swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit through the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pair strode down the fairway a heartbeat later, Jacobsen, well, changed 
his tack. Karsner almost doubled over with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jacobsen: "Aw, to hell with it, just hit the . . . ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the pistol, Pete. Jacobsen kept the banter alive with talk of 
basketball, the Rose Bowl hopes of his alma mater, Oregon, and just about every 
other conceivable topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a funny guy," Karsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't breaking news. Galleries warmed up to the affable 40-year-old a 
long time ago. On the tour, where performance and personality don't always go 
hand in hand, Jacobsen is the whole package. He's about as colorful as they 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence: Not everyone on the Tour has an alter ego. Jacobsen and some pals 
recorded an album five years ago under the name Jake Trout and the Flounders. 
Jacobsen and PGA mainstays Payne Stewart, Larry Rinker and Mark Lye were among 
the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen and Lye took a handful of old tunes, like "Sittin' on the Dock of the 
Bay" and Soul Man," and reworked the lyrics and titles. Horrific as it sounds, 
a cassette with "Hittin' on the Back of the Range" and "Golf Fan," actually 
found an audience. Presumably the same folks who still buy plaid golf slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which also featured legendary blues musicians Steve Cropper and 
Duck Dunn, has sold almost 30,000 copies, Jacobsen said. The Flounders even 
performed live a few times, with Jacobsen hamming it up on guitar and vocals. 
"Huey Lewis is a big fan," Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and his band recently released an album of old rhythm-and-blues 
standards. Jacobsen is a pretty good mimic, too. In fact, he can flat duplicate 
the swing of dozens of PGA players. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody with a recognizable swing quirk -- Ray Floyd, Chi Chi Rodriguez, 
Arnold Palmer -- has seen it replicated by Jacobsen. Fans love it and players 
don't even seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 His imitation of Palmer's teeth-chattering rip looks like a mirror image. It's 
uncanny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done it right in front of him a hundred times and he's never said a 
word," Jacobsen said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer has been Jacobsen's partner in the tournament portion of the Shark 
Shootout since the event's inception in 1989. Partners Greg Norman and Nick 
Price, the top players on the globe, always draw a huge throng. Palmer and Pete 
aren't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen, not to mention the fans, could care less that the pair has finished 
last at the Shootout two years in a row. As far as Jake is concerned, "The King 
and I" is a play that will never close. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask whether Arnie can play," Jacobsen said. "Let me tell you, he can 
play. He drives the ball as well as anybody on either tour. Heck, I'm flattered 
that he wants to play with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Jacobsen can play with just about anybody. He has rolled up 
$3,472,507 in career earnings to rank 36th on the all-time PGA list. Sure, 
there's more money to be won on tour these days, but Jacobsen has carted off 
more green than some serious luminaries, such as Miller, Weiskopf, Palmer, 
Player, Casper and Barber. 
</P>
<P>
 On the course, though, he is more of an everyman. The approachable guy. 
Somebody people can talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't bite their heads off," Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laugh their heads off is more like it. During his round, Jacobsen signed 
autographs, posed for pictures, teased members of the gallery, yakked it up 
with course marshals. Just another entertaining day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 What the heck, it doesn't hurt to be nice, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important in all professional sports to represent yourself well, 
to try to be a strong role model," he said. "Charles Barkley says he isn't a 
role model, but he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe every once in a while, all athletes should have to walk through the 
fans like we do, not just have them (sitting way back) in the stands."

MILLIKAN GIRLS GET PAST HARVARD-WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Long Beach Millikan High girls' volleyball team stood stunned 
at the end of the first game of their Southern Section Division II semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who entered the match seeded first in Division II, had been outhit, 
outdefensed and outplayed by unseeded Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the near-flawless play of Westlake in the opening game came undone as 
Millikan turned the tables to rebound to a 7-15, 15-9, 15-8, 15-7 victory at 
Lakewood High on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan (18-2) advanced to the Division II final for the first time while 
Westlake lost in the semifinals for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's mistakes continued to the end. Match point was awarded to Millikan 
when Carolyn Miller illegally substituted for Jamie Kantrowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The point ended a match that began with promise as Westlake played some of its 
best volleyball of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (15-5), led by middle blocker Amanda Selby, controlled the 
opening game from the first serve. The 6-foot-2 Selby used her size advantage 
for four kills and four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 After jumping out to a 5-1 lead in the second game. Westlake was plagued by 
serving errors and net violations until the end. Westlake was called for 14 net 
violations, Millikan for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just started making a lot of blocking and passing mistakes," Selby said. 
"They were more consistent and that's why they won." 
</P>
<P>
 Selby finished with 15 kills and 13 blocks but virtually disappeared in the 
third game. Selby had one kill and two blocks as Millikan grabbed an early 8-2 
lead and held on. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's Christine Bohle had 12 kills and Lesley Coben added nine.

DIGEST: EXPOS NAME BENEDICT TO MINOR LEAGUE PITCHING POST

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Chatsworth High and Valley College baseball player Jim Benedict has 
been named minor league pitching coordinator for the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict, 33, succeeds Herm Starrette, who is now the pitching coach for the 
Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict, who for the last four years worked as a scout for the Texas Rangers, 
pitched three seasons in the Kansas City Royal and Atlanta Brave organizations, 
advancing to the double-A level. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget-conscious Expos traditionally have relied on younger players 
brought up through their own system. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the intriguing part of this job," Benedict said. "We have good young 
pitching and we build from within." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict has also coached at Valley College, Loyola Marymount and Chapman.

 Birmingham High football Coach Chick Epstein said he will resign after 17 
years as the Braves' mentor at the conclusion of the City Section 3-A Division 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been great," said Epstein, 52. "It's a noble profession, but I wanted a 
chance to enjoy my home life and my family. I'll let somebody young take over." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein will continue to teach and coach golf at the Van Nuys school.  
</P>
<P>
 The Braves, who play a first-round playoff game tonight at Reseda, earned 
playoff berths six times during Epstein's tenure. His career record there was 
75-82-4. KENNEDY COSGROVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior Chris Brown, the nation's top three-point shooter last season, and 
junior transfer Michael Tate, who has been getting rave preseason reviews from 
UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker, have been suspended from Anteater exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who averaged almost five three-pointers a game last season and led the 
team with a 17.4-point scoring average, will miss Irvine's game against Five 
Star Sports at 7:30 tonight in the Bren Center because he missed team study 
sessions.Baker has yet to determine Brown's status for Tuesday night's 
exhibition against Cairns, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, a 6-foot-4 forward from Ventura College, will miss both exhibition games 
for "failure to adhere to team rules," according to Baker, who would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, 23-63 in three seasons at Irvine, is counting on Brown and Tate to play 
key roles if the Anteaters are to rebound from last season's 4-14 Big West 
record. JOHN WEYLER

ANGELS LEAVE MEETINGS THE WAY THEY CAME IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels came to baseball's general manager meetings with every intention of 
making a trade, doing something, anything, to blur the memories of the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi and assistant Tim Mead packed their 
cars Thursday morning, and by 11:30, were headed home with the same team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good that we were able to learn what people think about our club," 
Bavasi said, "and we talked about a lot of possibilities with a lot of teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was not good that we were not able to strengthen our club. We really 
wanted to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels talked with every team, and even thought they might have a trade 
lined up, but it fell though Thursday and they have doubts it can be 
resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had another club been able to make a deal," Bavasi said, "then we could have, 
too. But we got shut down. Who knows what will happen now?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels made it clear during these meetings that they have plenty of folks 
available. Center fielder Chad Curtis, third baseman Spike Owen, first baseman 
J.T. Snow, right-handed starter Phil Leftwich and relievers Joe Grahe and Mike 
Butcher can all be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll listen to proposals for left-handed starter Chuck Finley, but unless 
they're completely overwhelmed, Finley will stay. Oh, yeah, and they're willing 
to give away left-hander Joe Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of us found out we're in the same boat," Boston Red Sox General 
Manager Dan Duquette said. "Things were starting to move beyond the mating game 
for everyone today, but it was too late. Usually, you go through the mating 
dance at the World Series, so we're all behind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, whose $24.5-million payroll budget in 1995 prevents them from 
seeking high-priced free agents, have been scrutinizing the free agent market. 
They would like Steve Ontiveros or Kevin Gross for their rotation. They'd love 
to be able to afford bullpen stopper Lee Smith. And center fielder Darrin 
Jackson or first baseman Mickey Tettleton would be welcome additions to their 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless they're able to reduce their payroll by trading away a high-priced 
player such as Curtis, the Angels' desire may be nothing more than a delusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels filed their 40-man roster with the league office Thursday. They 
added pitchers Erik Bennett, Ken Edenfield and Shad Williams from triple-A 
Vancouver; pitcher Jeff Schmidt and Bill Simas from Class-A Lake Elsinore; and 
outfielder Marquis Riley from double-A Midland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who had a deal worked out in July for Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder 
Andy Van Slyke, say they're no longer interested in acquiring him as a free 
agent.

 The overwhelming choice to win the title has an added incentive. "We talk 
every day about the fact that every team, especially in our league, we can make 
their season by upsetting us," Sonora Coach Mike Murphy said. "And the loss in 
the semifinals to Servite has really motivated our kids to work hard because we 
want to get to the next step. These seniors have been on varsity for three 
years. They think this can be a special year." Murphy is playing a pat hand, 
but it's a full house led by Clark. The Raiders can play it any way you 
want--big, small, uptempo, half-court--and play it better than most. Since they 
tower over the rest of the Freeway League heightwise, Murphy's biggest problem 
may be to keep Sonora motivated until the playoffs. "I think our league is 
really balanced; everybody is pretty good," Murphy said. Perhaps, but there 
isn't a Freeway coach who wouldn't swap teams with Murphy if he had the chance.

INS TO TRY TO SETTLE BIAS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under intense fire over charges of racial discrimination in her agency, 
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner agreed at a 
congressional hearing Thursday to negotiate a settlement to a huge class-action 
suit originally brought by African American employees of the Los Angeles INS 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which encompasses about 900 employees nationwide, spotlights 
longstanding problems with hiring and promoting blacks within the INS. It also 
contends that blacks are subjected to a racially hostile work environment and 
forced to endure derogatory comments and unequal imposition of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS anticipates making a settlement offer in the next week, spokesman Eric 
Berryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a substantive proposal is brought forward, this could be a major step in 
finally settling this very large class-action suit," said David L. Ross, the 
Los Angeles attorney representing the plaintiffs. "But they've been telling us 
this for six months. As far as I'm concerned, talk is cheap. Until I see 
something in writing, it doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross is seeking back pay and damages that could total $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner was called to testify by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of 
the House Government Operations Committee and the only member of Congress 
present in the vast committee hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Conyers, a strong backer of the the plaintiffs' lawsuit who will lose his 
power to call hearings to the GOP in the next Congress, said racial 
discrimination within the agency was "unambiguous, bold and unashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of discriminatory employment practices have long been illegal, 
but the INS seems to be operating in some kind of time warp," Conyers said. "I 
am deeply disturbed that any government agency -- but especially a part of the 
Justice Department of all things -- is this far out of control in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed on behalf of more than 500 African American INS 
employees in September, 1991, and certified as a class-action complaint in 
January by Administrative Law Judge Jane Goodman in Los Angeles. It has since 
expanded to cover more than 850 INS employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, three House committee chairmen, including Conyers, turned up the 
heat under Meissner, urging her to settle the case expeditiously. But, 
according to Ross, INS officials missed several deadlines for making settlement 
proposals, the latest being Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's hearing during a brief aside, Meissner announced her intention 
that the INS attempt to settle the class-action suit, but an INS spokesman 
afterward seemed surprised by the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said she "very much regretted the underrepresentation (of blacks) and 
the hostility" and listed a number of measures that she has taken to address 
the deep-seated problems that she inherited when she took over the agency two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She has revised evaluation criteria to create more fairness in promotions and 
pushed for more racial diversity in hiring and recruiting. She has also 
overseen a special task force to improve the equal employment practices, 
promoted four blacks to senior level positions and required managers and 
supervisors to receive training in manager accountability and cultural 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Conyers was not appeased. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're making me believe there was no reason to hold this hearing . . . this 
won't be fixed by sensitivity sessions (to supervisors) who don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
 Black INS officers have cited 14 years of alleged discrimination, including 
workplace harassment, unequal discipline and bias in promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans represent more than 11% of the INS's 17,000 full-time 
workers, but they hold fewer than 6% of the best-paying positions. Fewer than 
50 blacks serve in the nearly 5,000-agent Border Patrol, where complainants say 
the most virulent discrimination occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS bias case began when 19 Los Angeles-based criminal investigators filed 
a complaint. Several testified at Thursday's hearing.

SAFE HARBOR NO MORE; INS CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DIVIDES CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For hundreds of illegal immigrants, tiny Santa Catalina Island has been a 
tranquil sanctuary from the crime and confusion of America's big cities -- a 
place to work, raise a family and hope one day to own a home. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even here, 22 miles off Los Angeles' coast, can Californians escape 
the raging debate over illegal immigration -- and this time it has nothing to 
do with the passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of Catalina's municipal officials, immigration authorities have 
begun a yearlong crackdown on businesses that employ illegal immigrants. The 
crackdown -- part of a strategy the INS has used elsewhere for years -- is 
intended to force illegal immigrants to leave Catalina out of economic 
necessity. However, some on the island of less than 3,500 argue that illegal 
immigrants are critical to the island's economy because many toil long hours in 
low-paying jobs that citizens often refuse. Others oppose the crackdown because 
they have developed strong friendships with the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 After Avalon Mayor Ralph J. Morrow Jr. announced plans for the crackdown last 
month, a handful of angry residents pelted his home with eggs and limes. Then, 
dozens canceled their subscriptions with Morrow's cable company. 
</P>
<P>
 Many immigrants are predictably nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what will happen to me," said Jose, an illegal immigrant from 
Mexico who has scraped out a peaceful living on Catalina for three years, each 
day going to the island's seaside restaurants to scrub dishes among the 
tourists, margaritas and tired renditions of Jimmy Buffet songs. He declined to 
give his last name, saying he fears deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Island officials estimate that several hundred illegal immigrants live there, 
and although residents say some come from Europe, most are from Latin America. 
Of the island's residents, 40% are Latino.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to split up families and create a lot of hardships," said 
Avalon barber Lolo Saldano. "These people work hard and pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 "In this community, we don't just know our employees," said one manager. "The 
people who work for you become family." 
</P>
<P>
 But others insist that immigration laws must be enforced. They say it is 
unfair that Avalon businesses employing illegal immigrants have an advantage 
over law-abiding employers who must pay minimum wage. And some complain about 
the immigrants' cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem here is they all speak Spanish," said former Avalon City 
Councilman George Scott. "It's like little Mexico here." 
</P>
<P>
 Others allege that groups of male illegal immigrants harass women strolling 
through town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the ladies in town have come to me and said they're afraid to walk 
down the street," Morrow said. "We don't want anyone to feel they're not safe 
and cozy in Avalon. We have to make doggone sure the condition that we have 
here remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of high housing costs, many illegal immigrants live in cramped hotel 
rooms or tiny apartments, sleeping in shifts. And some camp out in the hills 
behind Avalon.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, INS officials dealt with the issue by conducting occasional raids 
on the island, but the sweeps had little effect, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, several INS agents met with more than a hundred employers and 
members of a city committee to discuss the latest approach. Based on tips from 
locals, agents review the hiring records at businesses, then order employers to 
determine whether questionable workers are on the island legally and fire ones 
who aren't.  
</P>
<P>
 If employers do not comply, agents will obtain a search warrant and arrest the 
illegal immigrants. If a business knowingly employed illegal immigrants, the 
employer can be fined up to $2,000 for the first offense and more for the next. 
</P>
<P>
 That is tough news for many on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these illegal immigrants are great people," said Raul Alvarez, who 
came to Catalina illegally from Mexico eight years ago to find work, has 
obtained legal residency and now owns his own business. At first, Alvarez slept 
in the hills with only a blanket and a strip of cardboard. Shivering on cold 
spring mornings, he hiked down to public showers near the beach before 
searching for work. 
</P>
<P>
 One night he fled his camp after wild pigs stomped across his legs. "You think 
God is punishing you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez eventually found work washing dishes in restaurants, where many owners 
vehemently oppose the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to know who is legal," one restaurant owner said. "It's tough 
enough just getting someone to show up for work on time." 
</P>
<P>
 All seven members of a Hispanic Relations Committee, organized by the council 
in June to improve ties with Latinos, oppose the crackdown, said Norbert Reyes, 
the committee chairman, who owns two gift shops in Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
 To enforce the law, INS agents will visit the island at least once a week. 
Officials plan to spend time in City Hall to answer residents' questions about 
immigration laws, and to make their presence felt on the island for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In spring, when businesses begin hiring for the summer tourist season, they 
are likely to get inundated with phony citizenship documents, officials say, 
and the INS wants to ensure that employers do not hire more illegal immigrants. 
"We want to be there," said John Brechtel of the INS. "They will be getting 
fake documents and we don't want to go back to square one."

LAWYER RIPS MANEUVER BY ATTORNEYS FOR SIMPSON; HEARING: DETECTIVE MARK 
FUHRMAN'S LAWYER CALLS DEFENSE TEAM'S RENEWED INQUIRY INTO HIS BACKGROUND A 
'DESPERATE' ATTEMPT TO DIVERT ATTENTION. COCHRAN SAYS ACTION IS 'APPROPRIATE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman's lawyer Thursday denounced the 
latest efforts by O.J. Simpson's attorneys to probe into his client's past, 
calling them "the desperate acts of desperate lawyers who have no case." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert Tourtelot was reacting to news that Simpson's lawyers hope to 
question a police captain Monday to determine whether she ever investigated 
allegations of wrongdoing by Fuhrman. Because that captain, veteran LAPD 
Officer Margaret York, is married to Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, the 
hearing will be before another judge to avoid any possible conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 York has volunteered to testify at that hearing, scheduled Monday afternoon 
before Superior Court Judge Curtis Rappe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tourtelot said Thursday that he planned to fight any inquiry into 
Fuhrman's background, which he said was irrelevant to the case and merely an 
effort by Simpson lawyers Robert L. Shapiro and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. to 
distract attention from their client's guilt. Simpson is charged with the June 
12 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tourtelot said York and Fuhrman "had some disagreements" during the 
time that Fuhrman worked under her command -- a recollection not shared by 
others who have spoken with York -- the lawyer said York never accused his 
client of wrongdoing. Tourtelot also derisively compared Shapiro and Cochran to 
a famous magician and said they were willing to do anything to distract 
attention from the evidence against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call these guys the Blackstone twins," Tourtelot said. "They're diverting 
everyone's attention while they steal your watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Tourtelot's comments, Cochran replied: "What does he know? He hasn't 
been down here. I don't think he's familiar with what's going on. . . . We're 
just doing what we think is appropriate under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman, who testified during the preliminary hearing that he found a bloody 
glove behind O.J. Simpson's Brentwood mansion, has come under steady attack by 
defense attorneys for months. They have accused the detective of racism and, in 
one motion, called him a "dangerous officer with a propensity to create false 
information against African American defendants." 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster that claim, they sought Fuhrman's military and police personnel 
records. But Ito denied the request for military records, and after reviewing 
the police files, determined that there was nothing in them relevant to the 
Simpson case. He then denied the defense lawyers' request to read the police 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Simpson's defense team has continued to probe Fuhrman's past and sought 
the hearing next week as part of that effort. Simpson's lawyers have declined 
to comment on the subject of the hearing, except to say that they are trying to 
determine whether York ever investigated Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources say Fuhrman came under scrutiny during the early 1980s as part 
of an internal LAPD investigation into a group at the West Los Angeles police 
station known as MAW, short for Men Against Women. No complaint against Fuhrman 
was sustained involving that inquiry, sources have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a newly promoted lieutenant, York was assigned to West Los Angeles in 
1985 as that investigation was concluding, and Simpson's camp apparently wants 
to determine whether York was part of the Internal Affairs investigation. If 
she were and were to be called as a witness in the Simpson case, it could force 
Ito to recuse himself from the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Police Department sources say she was not part of that inquiry, which was 
handled by the Internal Affairs Division and the LAPD's Office of Operations. 
According to law enforcement sources, York was questioned later about sexual 
harassment at the station but did not identify Fuhrman as a perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, York was generally complimentary of Fuhrman's work, said retired 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who assigned York to West Los Angeles and later 
transferred her back to the chief's office to work directly for him. 
</P>
<P>
 While attorneys squabbled outside court, the judge and lawyers moved forward 
with jury selection, proceeding under Ito's newly imposed time limits on 
questioning, which have markedly speeded up the sometimes laborious process. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers and Ito have been questioning prospective alternate jurors for 
more than a week, and so far have cleared 28 candidates for possible selection 
to the alternate panel -- including seven people originally among those 
questioned to serve on the actual jury. Outside court Thursday, Shapiro said 
Ito had told the lawyers that he planned to stop the questioning when 46 
prospective alternates have been found. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each side is allowed up to 15 peremptory challenges, so finding 46 eligible 
people would ensure that even if both sides exercised all the challenges 
available to them -- which they did not do in picking the original panel of 12 
jurors -- at least 15 alternates would remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two prospective alternates questioned Thursday were allowed to 
remain on the panel after stating that they had little knowledge of the case or 
its issues. On the question of DNA evidence, which figures to play a prominent 
role in the trial, one prospective juror, a 63-year-old legal secretary, said: 
"I don't know much about DNA. I'll have to study up on that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't," Ito interjected. 
</P>
<P>
 Also retained Thursday was a retired Marine who said he had admired Simpson 
and who agreed with Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark when she asked, "Would you 
agree that image is not everything?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the man responded. "He has no more rights than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was her turn to be questioned, a Compton postal worker said she was 
eager to be picked as an alternate. Asked by Cochran why she wanted to serve, 
that woman responded: "Anyway I can get out of working for the post office, I'd 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 That woman said her father had abused his wife and children -- domestic abuse 
could play a role in the Simpson case because prosecutors may seek to introduce 
evidence that Simpson beat his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cochran told the prospective juror that Simpson vehemently denies ever 
abusing Nicole Simpson -- despite a 1989 case in which he pleaded no contest to 
battery and a 1993 emergency call placed by Nicole Simpson in which she pleads 
with a dispatcher to send help as a man she identifies as her ex-husband rages 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 As the questioning of prospective alternates has dragged on in recent days, 
Ito has urged lawyers to move more quickly and the two sides have become less 
aggressive about asking that jury prospects be removed for biases or knowledge 
of the case. Thursday, an articulate UCLA graduate student was retained even 
though he said he had studied DNA and had discussed it at length with a friend 
who is a biochemist. 
</P>
<P>
 That same man, a 27-year-old Japanese American who lives in Westwood, said his 
girlfriend was intensely interested in the case. After news of the 
investigation began appearing in the press, the man said he took his girlfriend 
to the scene of the crime on Bundy Drive and to Simpson's nearby Brentwood 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man added that he and his girlfriend have stopped talking about the 
case since he received his jury summons and added: "If Mr. O.J. gets found not 
guilty, I hope he gets compensated in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, sitting nearby, smiled, pumped his fist in agreement and exclaimed: 
"I wish."

SQUIRREL SKIRMISH; DEFYING STATE, WOMAN HIDES HER AILING, BUSHY-TAILED PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A South Pasadena woman who has spent 12 years rescuing sick and injured 
squirrels is really going out on a limb this time for the bushy-tailed 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Drake is defying state Fish and Game officials intent on hauling her 
into court for misappropriating state property: the squirrels themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Game wardens ordered her to release 18 squirrels she is treating at her home 
by today, allegedly warning that if she does not, they would seize them and 
could kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 No way, responded Drake, whose do-it-yourself squirrel rescue work has gained 
worldwide attention -- not to mention the admiration of local humane workers 
and veterinarians who have referred hundreds of injured animals to her. 
</P>
<P>
 She hired a lawyer and helped launch a petition campaign asking clemency from 
Gov. Pete Wilson. In the meantime, she filed for a wildlife rehabilitation 
permit that the Department of Fish and Game says she must have to do her work.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she has quietly squirreled her tiny friends away -- out of the reach 
of game wardens who had vowed to return to her house today. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're at safehouses," Drake says of the squirrels, some of them blind or 
partially paralyzed and unable at this point to survive on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, Fish and Game administrators in Sacramento backed off. 
Officials pledged to postpone any raid of Drake's house until they decide 
whether to grant her a rehabilitation license. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game officials say they were merely upholding the law last week when 
they went to Drake's home on Kolle Avenue to investigate a complaint that wild 
animals were being illegally kept there. 
</P>
<P>
 Squirrels are considered wildlife. As such, they are the property of the state 
and subject to rules that prohibit their domestication. 
</P>
<P>
 But Drake says she had assumed her dozen years of work was sanctioned by 
authorities. So she said she invited a game warden inside her house, which is 
decorated with hundreds of squirrel paintings and knickknacks. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she showed him each of her 18 red tree squirrel patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake was promptly cited for having prohibited animals on her premises and for 
operating a wild animal rehabilitation program without a permit. She was 
ordered to remove the squirrels by today and to answer misdemeanor criminal 
charges Dec. 6 in Pasadena Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, John Meyers of Century City, said he plans to fight the charges -- 
which are unaffected by Thursday's Fish and Game action. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake's squirrel rescue work -- profiled in 1992 by The Times and afterward by 
newspapers and magazines around the world -- has never been a secret, Meyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Drake, the decision to put her squirrels in "safehouses" was made 
after the game warden threatened to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he could put me in handcuffs and take me to jail. He said he could 
destroy the animals on the spot," Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 squirrels are too fragile to be released into the wild, she said. Some 
are disabled from being hit by cars, others can barely wobble around because of 
a variety of ailments that they are receiving treatment for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to tell the warden that this one is a full-blown epileptic and that 
one has a vestibular problem. He said, 'I don't understand a word you're 
saying.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game Warden Frank Milazzo could not be reached for comment. But a 
department spokesman said he doubts that Milazzo would kill the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was going to have a rehab center take them," said Patrick Moore of 
the agency's Long Beach office.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Weir, assistant deputy director of the agency, said Thursday evening that 
officials will ask Drake to relocate the squirrels to a Humane Society shelter 
until they can verify her animal-handling qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be breaking down any doors," Weir said. "We're planning to 
let the steam simmer off the pot. We don't want everything escalated to the 
point of no return." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake remained wary, however. "I'm very skeptical," she said, vowing that the 
squirrels would remain hidden for now.  
</P>
<P>
 Drake said she has been consulted on up to 4,000 injured squirrels by 
veterinarians, shelter workers and others who have called her over the last 
dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has directly treated about 500 squirrels since a friend brought 
her an orphaned baby that a boy had found. Drake has kept some severely injured 
squirrels for years. One named Rambo -- suffering internal injuries, a broken 
back and paralysis after being hit by a car -- underwent four operations, 
steroid therapy and 152 visits to the veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambo lived six years, becoming a big football and basketball fan, she said. 
"He watched games on TV. He'd turn his back or go get a drink or some nuts when 
the commercials came on. He'd come back when the game started again." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake has painted some of her long-term patients' names on the mailbox out 
front, the one near the regulation-size traffic sign that reads: "Squirrel 
Crossing." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and Drake's five grown children have contributed to tiny bank accounts 
that the squirrels have in their own names. That money, along with a newly 
established "Squirrel Defense Fund," will be used to defray legal costs for the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're little fur people," Drake said.

MOORHEAD BYPASSED FOR TOP COMMITTEE POST; CONGRESS: SENIORITY WOULD HAVE GIVEN 
THE GLENDALE REPUBLICAN EITHER OF TWO POWERFUL CHAIRMANSHIPS. BUT HOUSE 
SPEAKER-DESIGNATE NEWT GINGRICH DOESN'T FEEL HE'S AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After waiting 22 years for the Republicans to control the House, Rep. Carlos 
J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) thought last week's election results presented him 
with a congressman's dream -- a choice between two powerful committee 
chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, the 72-year-old dean of California's Republican 
congressional delegation received grim news: Despite the GOP's good fortunes, 
Moorhead was being bypassed for both committee posts because House 
Speaker-designate Newt Gingrich did not consider him aggressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 11 terms in the House of Representatives, Moorhead became the 
ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee and was the 
second-ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, behind retiring Rep. Hamilton 
Fish (R-New York). 
</P>
<P>
 "For two years, we talked about his ranking position on these committees and 
how he might be chairman someday," said Peter Musurlian, Moorhead's district 
director. "On election night he was ecstatic. He was choosing between the two." 
</P>
<P>
 And while other Republicans returned to Washington immediately after Election 
Day to press their cases with Gingrich, Moorhead relied on the seniority system 
and went on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never doubted the traditions of the House, that seniority is not 
bypassed," Musurlian said. "You've been there, you've paid your dues and you 
get the chairmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Moorhead's colleagues apparently agree. Fearful that bypassing 
Moorhead damages California's clout, some of the state's House Republicans 
protested the move Thursday in a closed-door meeting with Gingrich on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is style rather than ideology that divides Moorhead from the incoming 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a loyal Republican, Moorhead has been rated the most conservative 
lawmaker in the House. Yet he is also considered a soft-spoken conciliator 
eager to reach compromise, a far cry from Gingrich's more combative style. 
</P>
<P>
 During the election campaign this year, Democratic challenger Doug Kahn 
criticized Moorhead as a tool of the gun lobby, an abortion opponent and so 
ineffectual that only one of his measures has been passed by Congress in 10 
years -- a resolution to proclaim July 13-19 of 1987 "Snow White Week." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, a proven fund-raiser who easily outdistanced Kahn, responded that 
Republicans were lucky to push anything at all through the Democrat-controlled 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Grappling with his lack of ascension this week, Moorhead did receive some 
consolation: He probably will be named chairman of a subcommittee handling 
copyright and trademark issues, which are essential to the state's 
entertainment and high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet being bypassed for a top job means Moorhead -- who represents Burbank, 
Glendale, Pasadena and Sunland-Tujunga -- may end his long career in Washington 
without ever having reached his goal of chairing a committee. The perks that 
chairmanship brings will not come his way either -- expanded office space, 
additional staffers and control over the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, returning to Southern California on Thursday, could not be reached 
for comment. But he put the best possible spin on the events in discussions 
with his staff, telling them that he is discouraged but still intent on 
accomplishing important work on the subcommittee and working with the 
Republican leadership to push his party's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos is disappointed," said Moorhead's legislative assistant, David 
Joergenson. "I don't think he feels it was the right thing to do, but he 
recognizes that the young Turks have taken over and they have certain criteria 
that apparently he doesn't fit into. . . . He says, 'I'm disappointed, but I'm 
still a chairman of an important subcommittee.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After mulling over which post he preferred, Moorhead had decided on Energy and 
Commerce, a body that handles legislation affecting virtually every industry in 
America and one of the key House committees devising alternatives to President 
Clinton's health reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead's appointment would have been an important plus for California, which 
has seen some of its senior Democratic lawmakers -- including Reps. Howard 
Berman (D-Panorama City), Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) -- stripped of their clout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican leadership tapped Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) to chair the 
Judiciary Committee, a move Moorhead supported. Then Gingrich and his aides 
stunned Moorhead by bypassing him for Energy and Commerce, instead choosing the 
second-ranking Republican, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley (R-Virginia). 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos decided not to fight the issue in either case because, with Gingrich 
calling the shots, he didn't think he would win," Joergenson said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; COLLEGE 
OFFICIAL FIRED FOR ALLEGED CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cerritos College trustees have fired an administrator who was accused of 
requiring foreign students to send their transcripts to an evaluation firm that 
he owned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees voted 4 to 2 Wednesday to dismiss Viet Be, vice 
president of student services, after an extensive conflict-of-interest 
investigation.Trustee Dorothy Carfrae, Be's fiancee, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Be was placed on paid leave Oct. 9 after it was revealed that he owned 
International Service Center, a Woodland Hills company that charged foreign 
students as much as $120 for transcript reviews. Be also authorized the 
college's purchase of two computers from International without disclosing his 
stake in the company, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Be did not refute the claims, he criticized administrators of the 
Norwalk college for openly discussing his case. "You wanted to take away my 
dignity by spreading rumors and speaking publicly about me," he told the board.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; CITY 
COUNCILMAN TO SEEK DANA'S SUPERVISORIAL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Douglas S. Drummond, a Long Beach city councilman since 1990 and currently 
vice mayor, announced Thursday that he will run for the 4th District 
supervisorial seat to be vacated by Deane Dana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana, a supervisor for 16 years, announced this week that he will retire when 
his term expires in 1996 and endorsed his chief deputy, Don Knabe, to be his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said he set his sights on the supervisor's seat because he has 
enjoyed public service and because problems in the county pose "serious 
challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has not done a very good job of economizing; they have not made 
enough cutbacks to deal with economic realities," Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond, 57, was in the Long Beach Police Department 29 years before retiring 
at the rank of commander in 1988.

CHIEF PEKEROL SUSPENDED WITH PAY

 Pasadena Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol, who was appointed in 1981, has been 
suspended with pay by City Manager Philip A. Hawkey. 
</P>
<P>
 City spokeswoman Ann Erdman announced the suspension Tuesday but declined to 
give details because it is a personnel matter. Hawkey is to meet Tuesday with 
Pekerol to determine whether further action will be taken, Erdman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pekerol was the target of criticism this year when his department was cited by 
state safety officials for failing to provide firefighters with protective

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EZELL 
PLANS TASK FORCE TO STUDY ALLEGED VOTING FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claiming that voter fraud is "a major problem," Proposition 187 co-author 
Harold Ezell said Thursday that he and others are launching a task force to 
investigate the extent of voting irregularities in California and to make 
reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 At news conferences in Los Angeles and Sacramento, Ezell said the task force 
will conduct computer cross-checks of voter registration lists and solicit 
volunteers to determine whether the registration information is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is too lax," Ezell said, complaining that no effort is made to 
verify voter registration information. He further criticized a new federal 
voter registration law soon to go into effect and said that if reforms are not 
forthcoming, the task force will pursue a state initiative to address the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ezell offered no concrete evidence of voter fraud, he cited a list of 
duplicate registrations in Los Angeles County.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ICE CREAM VENDOR'S 
SLAYING WOUNDS A NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For five years Refugio M. Garcia and his wife, Carmen Osorio, sold ice cream 
to the children in an Inglewood neighborhood where residents say violence and 
gunfire are common. This week the harshness of the violence was on display once 
more. Garcia, 44, was shot in the chest by a robber Tuesday while standing in 
the front section of his ice cream truck, moments after he sold a chocolate ice 
cream treat to a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood police Sgt. James TenBrook said Garcia fell out of the truck, 
mortally wounded, into the street in the 3400 block of Lawrence Street. The 
robber drove the truck away with Carmen Osorio, 42, still inside.  
</P>
<P>
 Less than a mile away, the robber stopped and shot Osorio in the arm. He tried 
to shoot her in the chest, but the gun jammed, police said. Finally, he grabbed 
her purse and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old girl who witnessed the incident said the wounded Garcia -- 
known on the street for occasionally giving free ice cream to children who 
could not afford to pay -- pleaded with the assailant not to take Garcia's 
wife, but the robber ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran into the house because I was scared," said the girl, asking that her 
name not be used for fear of retaliation. "I've never seen anybody shot 
before." She then called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia died at Centinela Hospital Medical Center less than an hour later. 
Osorio is recovering from her wounds, police said. The suspect is still at 
large.  
</P>
<P>
 The young girl said the violence frightened but did not surprise her. She said 
she recognized the gunshot as a .22-caliber, and said she can distinguish 
between the sounds of different weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear it all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials could not confirm what kind of weapon was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Street vendors and ice cream truck drivers have long been easy targets in 
crime-ridden neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, according to the girl's older brother, another ice cream 
vendor was beaten by neighborhood youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the girl's parents have forbidden her to go out for ice cream. Her 
parents, she said, have volunteered to drive to the store for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go to the ice cream truck anymore," the girl said. JON GARCIA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DISNEY HONORS LONG 
BEACH TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMELYN CRUZ LAT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huong Tran Nguyen, who arrived in the United States as a student at the height 
of the Vietnam War, remembers a college instructor's admonition at the time 
that Nguyen would never measure up to her white peers as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Nguyen, a Long Beach high school teacher, was named outstanding 
teacher of 1994 by the Walt Disney Co. She accepted the award Wednesday night 
during ceremonies in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 41, said the college instructor's disparaging remarks served as the 
primary motivation for her to pursue teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was precisely this remark that drove me to pursue a teaching career and to 
be the best I can be for my students," Nguyen wrote in her application for the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined to prove to her and to myself that there was not a goal I 
could not reach if I put my mind to the task. This is the message that has led 
me to want to make my students believe they, too, can experience success in the 
'real' world." 
</P>
<P>
 An instructor at Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, Nguyen works with 
students who have limited English skills. She was one of 12 teachers nationwide 
honored for their "teaching skills, rapport with students and ability to 
inspire." 
</P>
<P>
 A Westminster resident, Nguyen has been teaching in the Long Beach Unified 
School District for 11 years. She serves as a role model for students, 
particularly non-English speaking students, as well as faculty members at Poly 
High, where she established and now heads the school's language program for 
students with limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very resourceful in engaging students in learning," said Dick van der 
Laan, school district spokesman. "I think something she instills in the 
students is that no matter what the obstacles are you can make something of 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Long Beach, Nguyen spent five years in the San Diego area, 
teaching elementary and high school students. She also taught reading to older 
students for the San Diego Job Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Cabil, of John Muir Junior High School in Los Angeles, was one of the 36 
finalists for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and her high school each will receive an honorarium of $25,000. The 
Long Beach school district will receive $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual American Teacher Awards ceremony was aired live Wednesday 
evening and will be aired again Dec. 2 on the Disney Channel. EMELYN CRUZ LAT

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STUDENT 
CAMPUS DRUG OFFENSES RISE 46% IN YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of Los Angeles Unified School District students caught with drugs 
increased 46% during the summer of 1994, compared to the same period last year. 
Between July 1 and Sept. 30, 83 students were caught with drugs by school 
officials, compared to 57 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say some of the increase may stem from the fact that more 
junior and senior high students are attending year-round schools this year, 
which meet during the summer. But they also say that the increase mirrors a 
nationwide trend toward more drug use among teen-agers. Reports of marijuana 
and cocaine possession on Los Angeles Unified campuses have been increasing 
steadily over the past 18 months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district crime report, released Thursday to board members, showed 
that overall campus offenses decreased 10%. Campus police took 1,835 crime 
reports this summer, compared to 2,046 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the rise in drug offenses, assaults with deadly weapons rose 8% 
during the three-month period, from 40 last year to 43 this year. But weapons 
possessions decreased 8%, from 140 last year to 129 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 129 weapons seized by school police and administrators, 42 were guns, 
51 were knives and 36 were other types of weapons, including screwdrivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crimes at school campuses dropped 13%, from 1,538 last year to 1,331 
this year. Battery also declined 17%, from 84 cases last year to 70 this year.

FIREFIGHTERS ACCUSED OF THEFT FROM QUAKE-HIT APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 After the Northridge earthquake severely damaged the historic Sea Castle 
apartments, the Santa Monica Fire Department helped former tenants recover 
their belongings. But now authorities are investigating whether firefighters 
also helped themselves to tenants' property. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials received complaints that seven to 20 firefighters stole and 
perhaps sold tenants' belongings after a September cleanup of the red-tagged 
structure at 1725 The Promenade, on the Santa Monica oceanfront. Fire officials 
are expected to conclude a monthlong internal investigation next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Fire Chief Ettore Berardinelli declined to provide any details about 
the case. "When the inquiry is complete, the fire chief will make a 
recommendation to the city manager if further investigation is warranted," 
Berardinelli said. Fire Chief Richard Bridges, who was hired earlier this year, 
was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter could be turned over to the Santa Monica city attorney for 
prosecution if the city manager finds evidence of criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Castle was sealed off after the January earthquake caused major 
structural damage. City officials temporarily shored up the building last 
summer and gave each former tenant a four-hour slot during two weeks in 
September to recover belongings under the supervision of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many tenants said they didn't have enough time to finish the job and had to 
leave appliances, collectibles and potted plants, among other items. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have time to get in there and pack anything," said former tenant 
Stephen Brown, who now lives in a two-bedroom house in Mar Vista with another 
former Sea Castle resident. "It was all willy-nilly, no organization, 
catch-as-catch-can." 
</P>
<P>
 Berardinelli was quoted by a suburban newspaper this week as saying that the 
theft allegations may have resulted from confusion over the status of abandoned 
property. Firefighters, believing that whatever property was left in the 
building after the cleanup was unclaimed, removed some belongings with the 
intention of donating them to local charities, Berardinelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants signed a waiver that gave firefighters the right to remove any 
hazardous materials left after the cleanup. But former residents argued that 
the form did not give the Fire Department the right to take or give away their 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army and the Venice Boys and Girls Club were enlisted to receive 
donations from tenants during the two weeks that firefighters permitted 
property retrieval. But since then, officials of both groups said they had 
received no donations from the Fire Department.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HILTON, CAESARS JUMP ON DEAL SPECULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Takeover talk is again riling the stocks of the two biggest casino companies 
based in Los Angeles. But investors who've played at this table before may 
sense that the odds of closing a deal soon are no better than even. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Hilton Hotels Corp. officially put itself up for sale again, a 
move that had been rumored all year but that still sparked a buying rush in the 
stock. Hilton shares rocketed $10 to $67.875 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Caesars World Inc. shares jumped $1.625 to $43.75 after rival 
gaming firm Bally Entertainment Corp. confirmed that it wants Federal Trade 
Commission approval to buy as much as 15% of Caesars' stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton, in its brief announcement, said it has hired investment banker Smith 
Barney "to undertake a study and make recommendations to management and the 
board of directors for strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton said its alternatives "may include a sale of the entire company in one 
or a series of transactions, spinoff of one or more of its businesses, 
recapitalization, business combination, share repurchase program or similar 
transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the breadth of that options menu suggests that Chairman Barron 
Hilton may have already been approached, if informally, by potential buyers and 
is now on the defensive. The stock surged in September on rumors that an 
investor group wanted to buy the company and break it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Though shares owned by Barron Hilton and by his late father's foundation 
account for 34% of the company's outstanding stock, many Wall Streeters believe 
that a strong bidder offering a high enough price could force the Hilton family 
into a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran Hilton watchers also note that this is the second time in five 
years that Hilton has said it might sell out. The first go-round, in 1989, sent 
the stock rocketing to $115 -- only to collapse soon afterward when the junk 
bond market imploded and takeover mania crested. The flurry of bids that Barron 
Hilton expected in 1989 never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most analysts agree that the Hilton assets -- 240 hotels enjoying 
surging occupancy and a highly profitable gaming business -- are 
extraordinarily attractive. The issue is whether Barron Hilton, at 66, is 
really ready to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent gaming analyst Marvin Roffman in Philadelphia argues that Hilton 
has effectively been for sale for so long that Barron Hilton hardly needed to 
hire Smith Barney to flush out possible buyers. "If anybody was interested, 
they'd be calling Barron," Roffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Thursday's announcement could mean that Barron Hilton is mulling a 
defensive move -- a recapitalization or spinoff that would boost the stock by 
unlocking "hidden" value in the firm but leave the Hilton family in control. 
"He may just want to position the company better for sale later," said Jim 
Schmitt, a Hilton watcher at WestCountry Financial in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Wall Streeters suggested that Hilton could partially spin off its 
Nevada gaming operations or sell a trophy property such as the Waldorf-Astoria 
in New York and use the proceeds to buy back stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Sold or restructured, Schmitt and other analysts have argued that Hilton's 
true value is more in the $90-a-share range -- about a third more than the 
current price. But the caveat is that Barron Hilton is unpredictable. What's 
more, one analyst contends, "he's going to look out for his interests -- not 
necessarily for other shareholders.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Caesars World, meanwhile, is another example of a very attractive franchise 
that has long been considered a prime takeover candidate. Caesars' premier 
asset is its Las Vegas hotel-casino, which by virtue of its cachet and its 
location (in the center of the Strip) makes it one of gambling's crown jewels. 
The company also owns resorts in Lake Tahoe; Atlantic City, N.J., and in 
Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, but they are considered much less important to 
a potential buyer than the Vegas property and the franchise name itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Most larger gaming firms have long been considered possible bidders for 
Caesars, including ITT Corp. (owner of Sheraton hotels), Mirage Resorts and 
Promus (which owns Harrah's). 
</P>
<P>
 But Bally Entertainment, which owns hotel-casinos in Vegas, Atlantic City and 
Mississippi and now says it may buy up to 15% of Caesars' stock, isn't taken 
seriously as a bidder for the entire Caesars franchise. Bally, analysts note, 
is heavily indebted, much smaller than Caesars and has plenty of other pressing 
issues to deal with, including the proposed spinoff of its health-and-tennis 
clubs division. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is Bally CEO Arthur Goldberg up to with Caesars? Last summer he 
announced plans to buy stock in stumbling casino rival Circus Circus, 
accumulated a small stake, then sold out at a profit. Many analysts are 
suspicious that he's planning to do the same with any Caesars stake he buys. 
Caesars had no comment on Bally's FTC request on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible, of course, that Goldberg's implied threat could compel ITT or 
other, bigger firms to finally decide whether they want Caesars. Any bid is 
expected to be closer to $60-a-share than the current $43.75. But as alluring a 
franchise as it is, analysts warn that Caesars Chairman Henry Gluck seems to 
have no interest in selling and that he has armed the company with formidable 
poison pills that could dissuade any potential buyer from stepping up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some analysts say the Hilton and Bally announcements may at least 
refocus investors on the value in some of the gaming giants' stocks. Fear of 
casino saturation in some regions (like Mississippi), and Wall Street's general 
loss of fascination with the industry, have pulled the stocks down in 1994 to 
levels that may be attractive to long-term investors who figure gaming's 
popularity worldwide is far from peaking. Hailing Caesar 
</P>

 Shares of gaming company Caesars World, a perennial takeover candidate, have 
swung widely over the past two years but are no higher today than in January, 
1993. Monthly closes, except latest:

STATE FINES HMO $500,000 IN CASE OF GIRL WITH CANCER; MEDICINE: REGULATORS SAY 
ADEQUATE TREATMENT WAS NOT PROVIDED. TAKECARE CALLS THE ACTION UNJUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State regulators, in an extraordinary action, on Thursday fined a Northern 
California health maintenance organization $500,000 for failing to provide 
adequate medical care to a 9-year-old girl with a rare childhood cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine against TakeCare Inc. is the biggest financial penalty ever levied 
against a health plan by the California Department of Corporations, which 
regulates HMOs. Corporations Commissioner Gary S. Mendoza called the TakeCare 
case "particularly egregious" and said the health insurer's actions "put the 
patient's life in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 The enforcement action was applauded as an important victory by medical and 
consumer groups that have been increasingly critical of the HMO industry's 
efforts to drive down medical costs -- an effort they contend can jeopardize 
the quality of patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those same groups have also complained of what they see as the state's 
lax regulation of HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a message to the industry that they need to pay attention to more 
than just the bottom line," said Judith Bell, co-director for the San Francisco 
office of Consumers Union, a watchdog organization.  
</P>
<P>
 Steven Thompson, a vice president for the California Medical Assn., the 
state's largest physician organization, said the fine sends a message to HMOs 
that "before you deny treatment, make sure that the denial is based on good, 
sound medical advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Ria Carlson, spokeswoman for FHP International Corp., a Fountain Valley-based 
HMO that acquired TakeCare earlier this year, called the fine unjustified, but 
she said FHP will "work very closely with Corporations to resolve" the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The state alleges that TakeCare failed to provide Carley Christie of Woodside 
access to a qualified pediatric surgeon when she was diagnosed in January, 
1993, with a rare form of childhood kidney cancer known as Wilms' tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also alleges that the Concord-based health plan "retaliated" against 
Carley's parents, Harry and Katherine Christie, when they decided to go outside 
TakeCare's network of authorized physicians to find a surgical specialist with 
experience in Wilms' tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 After the successful surgery at Stanford University Hospital, TakeCare refused 
to cover the $57,000 medical bill, saying the Christies violated their HMO 
agreement in going outside the network without approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christies have contended that in the traumatic few days after their 
daughter was diagnosed with cancer and then scheduled for surgery, they had 
insufficient time to get the proper authorization. Moreover, they didn't want 
their daughter's surgery to be performed by a physician who lacked experience 
with Wilms' tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Carley, now 11, has since recovered from her surgery and subsequent cancer 
treatment. She is "an active young woman" who plays on her sixth-grade soccer 
team and takes jazz-dance and piano lessons, said Harry Christie, an electronic 
equipment salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God we made the decision we did, because we know Carley got the best 
medical care to ensure her survival," Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christies have been waging a battle with TakeCare and state regulators for 
nearly two years to get compensation in their case. Earlier this year, an 
independent state arbitrator ruled in favor of the Christies and ordered 
TakeCare to reimburse them for their medical and some legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fine was a record for state regulators, some HMO members, 
however, have won multimillion-dollar damage awards in treatment-denial cases 
that have been decided in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, who has ruffled the feathers of health insurers since taking over the 
Department of Corporations' top job a year ago, said his decision is an attempt 
to "make certain that the quality of patient care is not compromised in this 
era of cost containment." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said his department receives about 2,000 complaints a year from HMO 
members, a small figure when compared to the many millions of Californians who 
belong to such plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Consumer Union's Bell says that figure doesn't necessarily represent 
the true number of HMO complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of complaints, but consumers either don't know they can file 
with the Department of Corporations or they don't think the agency will do 
something," she said, noting that few people are as persistent as the Christies 
in pursuing claims.

SAFETY BOARD REJECTS ERGONOMICS PROPOSAL; WORKPLACE: CALIFORNIA'S ACTION IS 
EXPECTED TO SLOW NATIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT CUMULATIVE TRAUMA DISORDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an action expected to slow national efforts to combat rapidly spreading 
workplace injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, California's occupational 
safety standards board Thursday rejected what would have been the country's 
first comprehensive ergonomics program. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-0 vote against the regulations surprised even some of the proposal's 
ardent critics. It means that officials will almost certainly miss a year-end 
deadline imposed by the Legislature for adopting a program to curb the painful 
ailments known as cumulative trauma disorders, or CTDs.  
</P>
<P>
 Jere W. Ingram, chairman of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards 
Board, said the board vetoed the proposal because "there is virtually no 
agreement among the affected groups on a means to effectively regulate the 
prevention of cumulative trauma disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram added that the proposed regulations, which would have set a standard 
applying to every employer and employee in the state, were "overly broad and 
would have imposed a costly regulatory burden on a vast number of employers 
where the occurrence of cumulative trauma disorders have not been identified." 
</P>
<P>
 The California proposal had encountered blistering criticism in recent months 
from employers expressing such concerns. They also argued that it would be 
premature to impose an ergonomics standard when there is still little 
scientific evidence showing how CTDs, the nation's No. 1 occupational illness, 
are caused or how they can be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Julianne A. Broyles, director of insurance and employment issues for the 
California Chamber of Commerce, said she was "extraordinarily pleased to get a 
unanimous vote. It shows that the standards were not of benefit to anyone, to 
labor or management." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor groups, on the other hand, complained that the final proposal from the 
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- a toned-down 
version of an earlier plan -- was riddled with loopholes. Still, the groups 
expressed frustration that they could not win approval of even a softened 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do need to have tough standards, and we're concerned that it's going to go 
by the wayside," said Pat McConahay, spokeswoman for the California State 
Employees Assn., a union of government workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal OSHA and OSHAs around the country have been looking to California to 
see what we would do," she said. "We think California needs to lead the way on 
this. . . . We're concerned that business always seems to be taken into account 
and not the needs of workers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal/OSHA board's vote in San Diego comes as federal OSHA regulators have 
become bogged down in an effort to draft a national ergonomics standard. Many 
observers said the California decision is likely to make federal officials more 
reluctant to come out with a strong proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph A. Dear, director of federal OSHA, said he will not be deterred by 
the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
 "Carpal tunnel syndrome and other cumulative trauma disorders are still the 
fastest-rising occupational diseases in America," he said Thursday. "OSHA will 
continue working to determine how it can best help employers and workers to 
reverse this trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor's disappointment was shared by state Sen. Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), 
who was co-chairman of the legislative panel that imposed the year-end deadline 
for an ergonomics standard as part of a workers' compensation reform package. 
CTDs are a major source of costs in workers' compensation injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Establishing standards may be as difficult as defining pornography, but the 
job ought to be pursued in order to reduce the incidence of workers' 
compensation claims that are bad for everyone," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has stepped back from its responsibility and said nothing is better 
than something," he said. "I would urge that the effort go forward and 
incrementally build ergonomic standards into the fabric of our regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Johnston said it is very unlikely that the Legislature will impose a 
new deadline, given the probable opposition, particularly from Republicans. 
Further, he dismissed the idea that anyone could force the Cal/OSHA board to 
act by suing the agency to meet the existing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt a judge would want to supervise the writing of an ergonomics 
standard," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, labor leaders are expected to take the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the California standard would have required employers to 
train all workers to alert them to the early symptoms of CTDs. For employers 
with workers experiencing such problems or in danger of developing CTDs, 
remedial measures would have been required. However, the employers would have 
had a relatively free hand in coming up with solutions, which in some cases 
would have been as basic as providing longer rest breaks or stepped-up 
training.

DREAMS ON MARKDOWN; MEDIA CITY CENTER MALL HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE 
CITY OF BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, Burbank leaders were thrilled with the great deal they had 
just closed that would finally bring a major shopping mall to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 25 years, nearly $229 million in sales, property and hotel taxes would 
be collected from operations of Media City Center and surrounding properties, 
officials projected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Burbank officials exulted, developer Alexander Haagen agreed to 
split 50-50 with the city the net operating profits from the mall. With Haagen, 
the operator of dozens of shopping centers in Southern California, at the helm, 
another $52.7 million would roll into city coffers in those 25 years, officials 
happily announced. 
</P>
<P>
 How things have changed. Officials now say the mall, which opened in 1991 and 
in which the city invested $120.7 million, won't produce a dime in profit for 
the foreseeable future. But they say they have made another great deal, 
salvaging $10 million -- which Haagen promises to pay in the future -- while 
forever surrendering the taxpayers' right to half the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Public records and interviews with former and present city officials show that 
the partnership between Haagen and the city, working through its redevelopment 
agency, was beleaguered from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost since the beginning, the Manhattan Beach developer has repeatedly made 
financial demands on the city, records show. And until last June, the city 
complied, hoping that one more concession would finally make the mall flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, much of the money generated by the shopping center -- millions of 
dollars in tax revenue the city counted on five years ago to make good on its 
investment -- has been diverted to Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Those now in positions of power in Burbank, including Mayor Bill Wiggins, say 
they are generally satisfied with how the project has overcome the California 
recession and a sagging retail market. They point proudly to a revitalized 
downtown centered on the mall, which draws strong weekend crowds and has 
generated new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a phenomenal success to have taken 50% of our profits, which, because 
the economy changed, was tantamount to zippo, and to translate that into $10 
million of guaranteed hard, cold cash is an absolute coup," City Manager Bud 
Ovrom said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 That upbeat view is not shared by those who first made the deal with Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad Haagen didn't want City Hall, or the City Council would be meeting 
in a tent," said Al Dossin, a former Burbank mayor who helped select the 
developer in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of a snide remark, don't you think?" said Haagen, 75, who has 40 
years of experience in real estate development. "I think our reputation has 
been impeccable. If you look at the results rather than the comments, the 
results of what we did are rather impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen said sour grapes are behind the negative comments. "The city was as 
much a participant as we were," he said. "We have been a productive entity for 
years. I went to Burbank because the city asked us to." 
</P>
<P>
 The city refused requests by The Times to examine records of negotiations 
until after the final deal becomes effective Nov. 26. But other sources show 
that key changes in the project and its revenue include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Haagen could not arrange for the construction of four office buildings and a 
300- to 350-room hotel near the mall, buildings the city considered crucial to 
the success of the project. While the city planned on receiving revenue from 
the projects, the original agreement allowed Haagen not to build without 
defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both Haagen and the city wanted an upscale anchor store. In hopes of luring 
Bullock's, Burbank in 1989 and 1990 borrowed $51.5 million to pay for the 
building and a new parking structure to be used exclusively by the store. 
Haagen, who loaned the money, required the city to pledge 80% of the property 
taxes from the entire mall, and all of the city's share of sales taxes from 
Bullock's and 34 of 149 mall stores, records show. Haagen has agreed to forgive 
any amount remaining on the loans after 2016. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Ovrom in 1989, a senior officer with Alexander Haagen Co. 
warned that the city risked the chance of never attracting a top anchor store 
if it did not quickly agree to the terms of the Haagen loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Under another agreement in April, 1993, the city gave Haagen all of its 
share of sales taxes generated over 10 years by Office Depot, Circuit City and 
a restaurant, all built on land once reserved for office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to do so after claims from Haagen's company that the money was 
critical for the overall success of the project, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of tax revenue to be transferred to Haagen from those businesses is 
projected to be $300,000 this year, according to Fred Bruning, senior vice 
president for Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year, Haagen threatened to leave the mall project unfinished if the 
city interfered with his plans to raise new capital by taking his company 
public and offering shares for sale, according to public records. The city 
eventually consented, and Haagen has raised $374 million by selling 10 million 
shares of the new firm, Alexander Haagen Properties Inc., since last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen owns 55,000 shares of the new firm and serves as chief executive, 
president and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just six months later, Haagen had another demand. He asked the city to allow 
him to pledge all of Media City Center as collateral for a $75-million line of 
credit he said he needed. The city owns the land on which the mall was built, 
and Haagen has the right to stay for 99 years at rent of $1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be the last straw, ending a partnership in a way few at City 
Hall could have imagined when it began. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask mall tenants how business is doing and the answers are as varied as the 
merchants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agree that the Northridge earthquake and subsequent closure of major 
shopping centers in the San Fernando Valley helped bring more people to Media 
City Center. Prior to January, some said, business was "dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly slow, but we're still ahead 150% of last year in sales," said 
Manager Shawn DeCloedt of Expressly Portraits. "It may take getting more 
established. It just seems this mall needs a couple of more years." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Haagen's prospectus for the stock offering listed the mall's loss 
at $3.9 million for 1992 and $5.5 million for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen has had troubles with other municipal partners. He angered officials 
with the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency earlier this year by trying 
to end a partnership that helped open the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Plaza. Both 
sides recently settled the dispute by agreeing to go their separate ways in 
1996, with a minimum payment of $1.35 million from Haagen to the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the Burbank buyout agreement, Haagen must pay the city a 
total of $10 million during 1995 and 1996. In exchange, he obtains the right to 
develop two remaining parcels that were reserved for a hotel and office tower. 
The city loses its half interest in any profits, public documents show. Haagen 
maintains the right to rent the mall for a total of 99 years at $1,000 annually 
in rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the city wanted, I did," Haagen said. "If you look under the rocks, 
there was nothing but good intentions. We created things no one else has 
produced. Certainly, we didn't produce a bad shopping center." Media City 
Center Revenue Diversions 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Redevelopment Agency and Alexander Haagen Properties Inc., the 
partners who built the Media City Center shopping mall, have agreed to split 
up. In a deal that will become final Nov. 26, the city will surrender to Haagen 
its right to half the profits from mall operations in return for $10 million. 
But in a series of earlier agreements, the city has already diverted to Haagen 
millions of dollars in tax revenues generated by the mall. CASH TRANSFERS

 Matsushita Relocating Facility to San Diego: Matsushita Television Co. of 
Japan will move its Franklin Park, Ill., headquarters office for North American 
research and engineering early next year. Matsushita's move to the new 
110,000-square-foot facility in the Otay Mesa area near the U.S.-Mexico border 
will bring 120 high-paying jobs to San Diego, city officials said.The Japanese 
consumer electronics giant has several TV plants employing 3,000 workers in 
Tijuana, where it primarily manufactures Panasonic sets. The company, which had 
announced earlier that it was looking at sites in Southern California, said it 
was attracted by San Diego's strategic location for Latin American and Pacfic 
Rim trade and by financial incentives -- mainly fee waivers -- valued by Mayor 
Susan Golding at about $150,000.

 Coca-Cola to Invest $1.5 Billion in Mexico: The company said it will pump $500 
million a year into Mexico over the next three years, according to Argentine 
state news agency Telam."In Argentina we will invest $200 million a year for 
the next three years, and in Mexico, $500 million," Coca-Cola Co. President 
Douglas Ivester said after he met with Argentine President Carlos Menem. "Our 
system -- that is, the bottlers and Coca-Cola -- will probably invest around a 
billion dollars a year in Latin America," Ivester said. Coca-Cola has spent 
$800 million on new equipment and Technology in Argentina over the last five 
years, Ivester said.

 Bond yields headed higher again Thursday, taking the stock market down. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite new reports suggesting economic moderation, the 30-year Treasury bond 
yield jumped to 8.15% from 8.09% on Wednesday, after nearly reaching 8.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrial average fell 17.15 points to 3,828.05 
after being down as many as 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market was far weaker, with declining issues outnumbering advancers 
by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the bond market simply couldn't get a rally going, even though 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of regional business 
activity and index of prices fell in November, a sign of moderating growth. 
Regional surveys are often watched for first clues to the national economy's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, investors focused on the Philadelphia survey's finer points, such as 
increases in employment and the average workweek, which could foreshadow higher 
wage inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also failed to take any comfort in the government's report that housing 
starts fell 5.2% in October, the first drop in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market participants said major sellers of U.S. government bonds included 
large holders of mortgage-backed securities seeking to hedge, or offset, 
potential losses with gains from Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact we couldn't rally on good news forced traders to sell into continued 
weakness," said Eric Hamilton, market analyst at Technical Data. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also traced the market slump to a "calendar effect." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a horrible year, and over the past several weeks money managers 
have been raising cash and lessening exposure to the market, so they are simply 
not responding to good news," said Ward McCarthy, managing director of Stone & 
McCarthy Research Associates. "They want to end the year in a defensive 
posture." 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market tracked bonds because stock investors fear further increases 
in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board if inflation concerns 
remain high, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the Fed's in your face and there's no sign of a peak in rates, 
stocks really can't make a major move on the upside," said Larry Wachtel, 
market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "But so long as the economy's good enough to support profits, there will be no 
major move on the downside, either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Banking and financial stocks fell as analysts worried that rising interest 
rates could squeeze margins. Citicorp fell 1 1/8 to 44, BankAmerica declined 
3/4 to 40 3/8 and NationsBank lost 1 to 46 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks and many cyclical issues lost ground on the premise that higher 
interest rates could choke off economic growth. Chrysler fell 1 1/4 to 49 3/4. 
General Motors slid 1 1/8 to 38 1/2 and Ford lost 3/8 to 28 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas stock markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo rose 0.2%, but the 
DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.4% and London's FT-SE fell 0.60%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lumber prices retreated from recent sharp advances, pressured by an 
unexpectedly large drop in housing starts last month and the prospect of even 
higher mortgage rates. The lumber market had jumped 15% in the past week.  
</P>
<P>
 January lumber fell $4 to $349.50 per thousand board feet at the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, retracing part of this week's $47 rally.

GM FILES LAWSUIT TO BLOCK RECALL OF 6 MILLION PICKUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. filed a lawsuit Thursday to block U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena from ordering a recall of pickup trucks that have 
sidesaddle gasoline tanks that are allegedly unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court here, comes a month after Pena 
made an initial ruling that there was an "unreasonable risk" of fatal injury in 
side-impact crashes involving the 1973-87 Chevrolet and GMC pickups. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks to short-circuit further regulatory action in the case and take 
it directly to the federal courts for resolution. GM also is likely to seek an 
injunction to stop a Dec. 6 public hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Gottschalk, GM general counsel, said the pickup trucks meet side-impact 
safety standards established by the National Highway Transportation Safety 
Administration and are as safe as most other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Pena has agreed that GM's pickups met the safety standards of fuel 
system integrity, he said, "there is no basis for any further proceeding 
against these trucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mintz, spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said the GM 
lawsuit is premature. "We haven't made a final determination (on a recall) and 
haven't closed the door on any option at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But GM said Pena has already made up his mind. The company notes that Pena 
overruled the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's technical 
staff, which recommended that the safety investigation be closed without a 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The government began its investigation two years ago after consumer groups 
raised questions of safety about the vehicles' design with twin gas tanks 
located outside the steel frame of the chassis. Pena said the design was a 
factor in 150 deaths and that 32 more could be expected from collisions 
involving the 6 million pickups still on the road.

OHIO INDEMNITY ACCUSED OF 427 RULE VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said Thursday that he is charging 
Ohio Indemnity Co. with 427 violations in claims settlement that, if confirmed, 
could bring a record $4.27 million in fines and a one-year suspension of the 
auto insurer's California license. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi accused the Columbus-based company of imposing coverage limitations 
not clearly expressed in the policy language, demanding that policyholders 
submit unnecessary forms and documents, and of other violations of the state 
law regulating claims settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dispute many of the facts asserted (by Garamendi) and will vigorously 
defend against this," said Dick Barger, a Los Angeles attorney for Ohio 
Indemnity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that we are interpreting our contracts properly," Barger added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio Indemnity, with 44,721 policyholders, is California's 46th-largest auto 
insurer. It sells limited policies covering physical damage to vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger said Ohio Indemnity's California claims are handled by Alamo Claims 
Services, an independent contractor. An Insurance Department spokeswoman said 
Alamo will not be charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is an administrative hearing at which Ohio Indemnity will be 
asked to show cause as to why the fine should not be imposed. The commission 
will then render a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the charges, Garamendi noted that Ohio Indemnity was the 
worst-rated auto insurer in the department's annual consumer complaint survey, 
released Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's regulations on claims settlement practices carry penalties of up 
to $5,000 per violation and up to $10,000 for "willful" violations.  
</P>
<P>
 If the maximum penalty of $4.27 million is assessed, it will be the largest 
such fine in California history, exceeding the $1.1 million assessed in March 
against Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. for violations in marketing life 
insurance policies.

HOUSING STARTS DECLINE THROUGHOUT THE NATION; ECONOMY: SLIPPING DEMAND FOR NEW

 Construction of new homes slumped in every region of the country in October, 
the Commerce Department said Thursday, as sharply rising mortgage rates put the 
brakes on building activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that before the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to 
boost short-term interest rates for a sixth time this year, building activity 
was already losing steam, prompting charges that the Fed overreacted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said the annual rate of starts on new homes dropped 
5.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million units -- the first 
decline in four months -- after a revised rise of 2.3% in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The decrease in home building was entirely for single-family homes, which 
plunged 7.4% to a rate of 1.14 million -- the lowest since February -- as the 
impact of stiffer monthly mortgage payments on consumers' budgets came into 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, construction starts on new multiple-unit apartment buildings 
increased 4.8% in October to a rate of 282,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage interest rates have risen about three percentage points since hitting 
bottom in October, 1993, enough to add about $300 a month to the payment on a 
typical $100,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the rate for a 30-year 
mortgage rose this week to 9.12%. That compares to 6.74% in October, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Those rates are headed still higher after the Fed's move this week to boost 
short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point -- raising 
the cost of money to banks and prompting them to swiftly push up their business 
lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Building was weaker last month in every region. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing starts fell 6.3% in the West to an annual rate of 356,000. They were 
off 6.1% in the Northeast at 123,000 and dropped 9.6% in the Midwest to 
300,000. In the South, they fell 2.1% to a rate of 640,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Permits to build new homes, often a barometer of future activity, also fell in 
October, by 1.7% to a rate of 1.4 million a year after rising 5.2% in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs Thursday that other economic sectors remained robust despite 
earlier rate increases: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of regional business 
activity fell to 30.5 from 33.2 in November. But the survey indicates increases 
in employment and the average workweek, and most indications of future economic 
activity rose. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment benefits fell 
5,000 last week from a week earlier to 327,000, but the closely watched 
four-week average crept up to a two-month high. California, however, reported 
the largest increase, with 13,571 new jobless claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Assn. of Realtors said a strong economy helped boost prices of 
existing homes 2.7% to $111,000 in the third quarter, with the largest gains in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, however, prices declined from the same period in 1993. San 
Francisco again had the most expensive market for existing homes in California, 
averaging $250,200, down 1.5%. In Los Angeles, the average price was $189,000, 
down 2.9%, and Anaheim had an average price of $217,000, a drop of 0.8%. San 
Diego's average price fell 0.6% to $175,400 and Riverside fell 4.9% to 
$175,400. Housing Starts

 Lloyd's Will Reportedly Increase Names Offer: Insurer Lloyd's of London plans 
to offer $1.7 billion to loss-strapped investors in an effort to halt 
litigation, the Guardian newspaper reported today in London. "It is understood 
that the ruling council of Lloyd's will discuss the offer at its monthly 
meeting in early December," the newspaper said. If the deal is approved, an 
offer could be made before Christmas to the 22,000 "names," the people who 
support the insurance market with their personal wealth.

 Crash Fallout Continues to Hurt USAir: More than two months after its latest 
plane crash, the airline continues to lose ticket sales from worried fliers and 
says its fourth-quarter results will be hurt significantly.Passenger traffic 
has been depressed to the point where fare discounts can't attract enough new 
passengers to offset price cuts, USAir said in a quarterly filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. USAir spokeswoman Andrea Butler said that, 
based on advance bookings, a full recovery isn't expected until January. Two 
USAir crashes this year raised doubts among some travelers about the carrier's 
safety.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Institute for Injury Reduction has released its annual Toy Safety Report 
alerting parents and other gift buyers to the hazards of some toys on sale 
during the holiday season. The dangers include small parts that can choke a 
child, strings longer than seven inches that can strangle, sharp edges that can 
cut and toys that shoot piercing objects.The report lists 25 hazardous toys, a 
one-page toy safety checklist, a list of toys that were recalled in 1994 and 
relevant legislation and proposed regulations. It also urges parents to look 
for warning labels and age recommendations; avoid toys that look, smell or 
taste like food; check labels for warnings about lead in painted toys, and 
carefully examine items such as sleeping bags and comforters, which are not 
subject to government flammability standards. In 1993, emergency care was 
required for an estimated 165,000 toy-related injuries, 25 of which were fatal. 
A free brochure titled "The Safe Toy Project" is available by contacting the 
Institute for Injury Reduction at (301) 261-0090.

 Spirited Fight Over Margaritas: Heublein Inc., the U.S. importer and marketer 
of Jose Cuervo Tequila, is suing distilled liquor giant Seagram Beverage Co. 
and E&J Gallo Winery for "deceiving the public" by producing versions of 
margaritas made with beer or wine instead of tequila. Heublein said tequila is 
the vital ingredient in a margarita and should not be optional.In lawsuits 
filed in U.S. District Court in New York, Heublein alleged that Seagram and 
Gallo are violating federal law through "false and misleading commercial 
advertising and promotion and unfair competition." In a separate action, the 
company asked the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to amend its 
regulations to prohibit any spirits label from referring to margaritas unless 
the product contains tequila, the strong Mexican liquor distilled from the 
agave plant. Heublein's petition to the ATF cites independent research showing 
that consumers believe that alcoholic beverages labeled as margaritas contain 
tequila.

 New Alcohol-Free Beer: Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch Inc. introduced a new 
nonalcoholic brew, Busch NA, in selected markets this week.It should be 
available nationwide within the first few months of 1995. Busch NA is brewed 
with the same ingredients as Busch and Busch Light, but the alcohol is removed 
through an evaporation process at the end of the brewing cycle. Busch NA 
contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume, the maximum allowed by the 
government for this product category, said St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, the 
world's largest brewer.

 Cosmetics Line Expanding: Maybelline Inc. said this week that it will 
introduce seven products in February, including two in its Revitalizing line 
for women 35 and older. Robert Hiatt, president and chief executive, said 
Maybelline is trying to "accelerate the 'class to mass' trend in cosmetics, as 
more consumers turn away from higher-priced department store brands for the 
convenience and affordability of high-quality mass-market products."The 
products include mascara, an oil-free cream foundation, eye shadow, eyeliner 
and blush. Maybelline said the two products in its Revitalizing line are 
Revitalizing Alpha Hydroxy Make-Up and Revitalizing Alpha Hydroxy Intensive 
Night Cream. Sales of the Revitalizing line of cosmetics and skin care, which 
was launched in February, have been slower than expected both by analysts and 
the company. Memphis, Tenn.-based Maybelline sells its products in most 
drugstores, discount stores, supermarkets and cosmetics stores.

 Year-End Score Card: The Federal Trade Commission said this week that its 
antitrust unit has brought 33 enforcement actions against alleged 
anti-competitive corporate behavior in the past year, the most since 1980. It 
also said its consumer protection unit was the most active it has been in 
years, bringing 233 actions for fraud and other matters in the fiscal year 
ended Sept. 30.The FTC said that of the 33 antitrust cases, 20 involved 
allegedly anti-competitive mergers in industries including drugs, defense, 
telecommunications, financial services and consumer goods. The other 13 
involved allegedly anti-competitive behavior by, among others, medical 
professionals, automobile dealers and cable television systems, the FTC said. 
On the consumer side, the agency said it focused on consumer scams that 
involved emerging technologies.

 On the Other Hand . . . Consumers are losing out on "tens of millions of 
dollars" because the Federal Trade Commission is not collecting and 
distributing all of the consumer refund judgment money from fraudulent 
companies, the Consumer Federation of America charged in a report. The group's 
analysis of FTC records found that consumer refunds occurred in just 28% of the 
consumer redress cases.The FTC had no immediate comment on the report. The 
agency's consumer redress program assesses and collects money from businesses 
that have been found to have committed unfair or deceptive trade practices; it 
then returns the money to eligible consumers. The report details several flaws 
in the FTC program, including failure to maintain accurate records on judgments 
and collections, failure to audit those who administer redress programs, and 
the lack of a central office to oversee collection and distribution of consumer 
redress funds. The consumer group is asking Congress to request a Government 
Accounting Office audit of all the records of consumer redress and civil 
penalty cases.

COMPANY TOWN; HONG KONG MOVIE COMPANY'S IPO DRAWS INVESTOR GOLD RUSH; FILM: 
MOGUL RAYMOND CHOW RAISES $29 MILLION IN THE OFFERING FOR GOLDEN HARVEST 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAGGIE FARLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Chow is too modest a man to say so himself, but he has lots to boast 
about these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who introduced kung fu star Bruce Lee to America and transformed 
Jackie Chan from an actresses' stunt double to a millionaire martial arts 
performer has another hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial public offering of stock in Chow's Golden Harvest Entertainment 
Ltd. was a smash last week, with many eager investors shut out as the offering 
was 52 times oversubscribed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow raised $29 million in the offering. Investors are expected to quickly bid 
up the stock's 25 cents-per-share offering price when trading begins on the 
Hong Kong Stock Exchange next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock is popular because Golden Harvest is well positioned to sate Asia's 
hunger for entertainment. In this fast-developing region, a movie ticket is 
something most people can afford, and despite the growth of cable and satellite 
TV, the theater provides an escape from crowded households and steamy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kongers see almost as many movies as Americans -- at least six a year -- 
and cinemas in Golden Harvest's key markets of Singapore and Malaysia are in 
the world's Top 10 moneymakers per screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe that the leisure sector is going to take off in Asia, this is 
the sort of company you want to bet on," says Nikhil Srinivasan, a vice 
president at Baring Securities in Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts give the company good ratings for its regional network, established 
reputation and exclusive distribution agreements with several of Hollywood's 
major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie moguls in Hong Kong only half-jokingly refer to the territory as 
"Hollywood East." Hong Kong holds second place in the world for movie exports, 
and it cranked out 276 films for domestic distribution last year. Golden 
Harvest controls more than a quarter of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The company boasts the kind of vertical integration that American studios 
grudgingly gave up in the 1920s and 1930s because of antitrust regulations. 
Different arms of the company produce films, then distribute them to 
company-owned theaters. Golden Harvest also handles distribution in Hong Kong 
and Vietnam for Universal Studios, MGM and Paramount, whose movies make up a 
third of Hong Kong's foreign film market. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't any other large-scale, well-organized film distribution 
company with a regional network," Chow says. The closest competitor is Shaw 
Bros., which Chow worked for until he broke loose in 1970 to found the tiny 
family-owned company that has become a regional powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow, the 67-year-old chairman of Golden Harvest, learned from Bruce Lee how 
to break boards with his feet. It takes that kind of finesse and tenacity to 
establish a pan-Asian network -- and to deal with its pitfalls, from piracy to 
government monopolies and censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Harvest plans to use most of the money raised in the initial offering 
to build more multiscreen theaters in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam 
and someday China. China's 1.2 billion people may represent the biggest 
potential audience, but the nation also represents the biggest challenge 
because of government control. It is also among the most risky for piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Theaters in Chinese cities will split a cinema in half, show a 
government-sanctioned film on one side and a pirated laser disc on the other. 
"It's multiplex in its crudest form," says Steve Stine, an analyst for Kagan 
World Media. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Harvest and Time Warner are the only foreign companies allowed in 
China. The terms are strict, and profits are "nothing to brag about," Chow 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Chow doesn't shy away from any particular pictures, he says his people 
know how to pick what will be popular and how to anticipate problems. "I don't 
believe in slipping politics into films," says Chow, noting that the American 
government's hands-off policy has resulted in some of the world's best movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Harvest distributes some American record setters such as Steven 
Spielberg's "Jurassic Park," but overall, Chinese-language movies are the most 
popular. Action comedies with titles such as "Drunken Master" "Justice, My 
Foot" and "Fight Back to School" beat out American hits like "Terminator II" 
and "Basic Instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Golden Harvest is keeping the volatile film production arm and its 
coveted Chinese movie library private.

 Amid all the turmoil in the executive ranks of the music industry, Columbia 
Records Group Chairman Don Ienner has been dramatically changing the look of 
his leadership team. Ienner recently named former Virgin U.S. heads Jeff 
Ayeroff and Jordan Harris to head a new West Coast label for Columbia, 
following the collapse of the duo's impending deal at the rapidly changing

POSITIVE MESSAGE PUTS PENNYWISE IN THE MONEY; POP MUSIC: PUNKERS ARE SUPPOSED 
TO THRIVE ON NEGATIVISM, BUT THE HERMOSA BEACH BAND IS DOING WELL AFTER A 
RATHER VIOLENT BEGINNING. 
</P>

<P>
 Punk rock has been on the attack ever since Johnny Rotten started sneering 
about anarchy, no future, and how the queen ain't no human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in opposition and suckled on bile, most punk bands come naturally to 
mockery, ire and scorn. Like good guard dogs, they are inclined by breeding to 
greet whatever comes their way with a snarl and a show of fangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing like a tuneful chain saw, the band Pennywise has established solid 
credentials and impressive sales tallies on the hard-core punk scene, where the 
body-slamming aficionados like their music fast and frenzied. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its message, the band from Hermosa Beach is more like Ben Franklin than 
Johnny Rotten, dispensing earnest words of advice that are less concerned with 
tearing down enemies than with inspiring fans to find a positive, self-reliant 
path through life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly a primrose path. The songs on Pennywise's two albums confront the 
souring of Southern California life ("Homesick"), the hatred and mindlessness 
unleashed in the Los Angeles riots ("City Is Burning") and the anguish of 
seeking, but not finding, the key to a meaningful life ("Nothing"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But at every turn, singer Jim Lindberg, who shares the lyric writing with 
bassist Jason Thirsk, can be heard urging listeners to stay alert and engaged 
with life, to think independently and to avoid despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Pennywise's advice to a morose slacker in "Give and Get," from the 
1993 album, "Unknown Road": 
</P>
<P>
 Get with the program, there are so many fun options  
</P>
<P>
 Waiting outside your front door.  
</P>
<P>
 Think of what you have, not what you don't  
</P>
<P>
 'Cause in the end there's no one who really gives a (expletive) any more.  
</P>
<P>
 What you give is what you get  
</P>
<P>
 And what you've been giving, you've been getting.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg, Thirsk, guitarist Fletcher Dragee and drummer Byron McMackin -- who 
headline Saturday at UC Irvine's Crawford Hall -- became punk fans in the early 
'80s listening to the irate hard-core work of such home-grown South Bay bands 
as Black Flag and the Circle Jerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking recently in a phone interview from his house in Manhattan Beach, 
Lindberg, at 29 the oldest member, said he sees the value in punk bands that 
instinctively tear down targets rather than trumpeting positive ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both approaches have merit, and they both have their place," he said. 
Pennywise's decision to accentuate the positive "relates to the type of people 
we are. The band was originally called P.M.A., which stands for Positive Mental 
Attitude."  
</P>
<P>
 "To some it can sound pedantic, as if we were preaching to people. Although 
we're an easy target for cynics, I don't think there are enough bands out there 
on the positive tip." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg joined Pennywise in 1989; at about the same time, he received his 
bachelor's degree in English at UCLA. He cites Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry 
David Thoreau as influences on his thinking; Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not 
Taken" is credited as the inspiration for the title song on "Unknown Road."  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lindberg cites the influence of Bad Religion, the 
long-running Los Angeles punk band known for its melodic hard-core style and 
didactic lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say we were heavily influenced by them, and it's true to an extent," 
Lindberg said. "I'd never heard a punk band with lyrics like that that are kind 
of heady. You'd have fast, pulsing rhythms with lyrics that are pretty 
thought-provoking. (Bad Religion's) lyrics opened my eyes as much as any 
literary hero." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It all sounds high-minded, but nothing is clean and simple with such a 
contradictory and volatile art form as punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg says that Pennywise, for all its positive preaching, became a magnet 
for some of punk's worst demons as it gained popularity after the release of 
its self-titled 1991 debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were labeled a white-power band," Lindberg said. "It goes to show you how 
stupid people are. We had a logo with a 'p' and a 'w,' and they said, 'That 
stands for white power.' We made it very obvious in our shows that people 
should take pride in who they are, not because of their skin color. Hate is so 
diametrically opposed to everything we stand for, but that kind of thing is 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said that small but disruptive groups of racist and violence-prone 
punks began frequenting Pennywise's shows during 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole violence scene around this style of music got too much for me. We 
played a horrendous show in Hollywood, and the place got (trashed). It just 
turned into a big fight, with one or two guys yelling, 'white power.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a look at myself and said, 'What am I doing here? I have such an 
(aversion to) this type of behavior, violence and hatemongering, and I'm stuck 
in the middle of it as if I'm the spokesperson for it.'  
</P>
<P>
 "It happened at more than one show," he said. "It was becoming a trend, and we 
got slapped with this reputation that every time we play a riot was going to 
break out." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg quit the band. Besides the mayhem from outside, the singer was also 
unhappy with what he saw as a lack of seriousness and commitment from within. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wanting everything to sound perfect, and practices would end up as big 
beer fests. Twenty to 30 people would show up bringing cases of beer, and we 
could never get anything done. I knew we had the potential to be a great punk 
band and it (angered) me . . . when I wasn't getting the same dedication from 
the other members." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said a tour of Europe, with Dave Quackenbush of the Vandals as the 
replacement singer, helped the other members see the same possibilities he did: 
"It galvanized them. They'd have 1,000 people at shows. When you see you have 
worldwide acceptance, it hits home: 'We could make something of this if we give 
it a shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pennywise began working on "Unknown Road" in 1992 with Thirsk switching to 
vocals, and One Hit Wonder's bassist, Randy Bradbury, coming in as a session 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg, who had had a hand in writing the songs, liked the players' musical 
development, which led to sharper melodies and more varied song structures than 
on the debut. They, in turn, thought his singing could do the songs more 
justice than Thirsk's. So a reconciliation was reached, and Pennywise returned 
to its original lineup, although bass tracks Bradbury laid down were used on 
all but two of the songs on "Unknown Road." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Pennywise's albums have sold more than 100,000 copies, according to a 
spokesman for the band's label, Epitaph -- a total that until punk's commercial 
explosion of '94 would have qualified as a mega-hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennywise was the first of several Epitaph bands, including the Offspring, to 
forge links with surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding fans by getting its 
music used on the soundtracks of popular films and videos on those sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennywise's current tour, which includes stops in Southern California beach 
towns, as well as dates in Hawaii and Florida, continues a mutually beneficial 
relationship with film director Taylor Steele, whose new wave of surf movies 
use punk as a sonic backdrop. Steele's new film, "Focus," is being premiered at 
the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The thug factor at shows has declined, Lindberg said: "When you play large 
venues, the potential for that is less, and the element that was haranguing us 
have moved on to other bands to torment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the band works on its third album, which Lindberg says is about 
half-written, Pennywise is well aware that the commercial possibilities for 
punk have increased more than tenfold since the release of "Unknown Road." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last winter, Pennywise was the headliner on a joint tour with label-mates 
the Offspring, whose subsequent album, "Smash," has sold more than 2 million 
copies and set records for a punk or alternative release on an independent 
label. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (the Offspring's success) is going to (induce) any Epitaph band 
to write a radio-friendly album," Lindberg said. "People know exactly what 
they're getting from an Epitaph band -- melodic hard-core -- and that stuff 
catches on. The band's aren't going to change their style; nothing's going to 
change on our end. If the music industry and radio comes around, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lindberg said, there may be a natural evolution toward 
sounds that are more accessible -- the same sort of progression the Offspring 
made before striking it big on its third album.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just the factor of playing so much that you become tighter and 
better musicians," he said. "We've always had a pretty good sense of melody, 
and as the albums continue I think you're going to get a stronger sense of 
melody and song structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg admitted there is a contradiction at the core of Pennywise's music: a 
clash between the furious hard-core sound, with its rage-filled traditions, and 
Pennywise's attempt to harness the thunder and make it a medium for uplifting 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a crapshoot" whether the messages get through, Lindberg said. 
"But I get unbelievable letters that show we are getting across. People write 
me saying, 'Your band and your lyrics helped me get through one of the most 
difficult parts of my life.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To be in New Jersey and have a kid come up to me and say -- and this has 
happened on more than one occasion -- that he was down and depressed and he 
wanted to kill himself, and a song I wrote helped him recover -- I could have 
sold just (that) one album and it would have made me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Pennywise's lyrics are edgy enough to provoke debate. One of the band's key 
themes is the Nietzschean idea that people should live by their own rules 
rather than bowing to handed-down codes of belief. That can be tricky even in 
the hands of good-willed people; it has been disastrous in the hands of some of 
this century's self-proclaimed Zarathustras. 
</P>
<P>
 And when, in "Side One," the band's call for punker solidarity holds up 
"homogeneity" as a value, one can't help shudder thinking of the horrors 
wreaked in the name of homogeneity of blood and homogeneity of creed. From 
here, the song sounds like a hard-and-fast "Tomorrow Belongs to Me." If racist 
punks crept unwanted into Pennywise's picnic, maybe it's because "Side One," 
from the 1991 album, "Pennywise," smelled like their kind of morsel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said the band's follow-your-own-rules advice is all that seems 
logical to some of today's disaffected youth: "As far as looking to other 
people for your solutions, you had divorced parents and the whole 'me 
generation.' All these neglected kids out there had no idea where to go for the 
answers, and they have to start from scratch. It's a way of saying you have to 
start over and look to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lindberg welcomes the prospect of debate being stirred by the 
pronouncements in Pennywise's songs. "The good thing about all of it is that 
maybe we're provoking discussion among all these kids who have been holding it 
in.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they were to open up to their friends and discuss things more, they'd have 
a better time dealing with it, rather than keeping it in because they're going 
to be perceived (he mimics a stoner's dismissive drawl): 'Oh, you're so deep, 
man.' "

CLOWN AS METAPHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay punk band Pennywise named itself after the clown-guised demon from 
Stephen King's story "It." But the band members weren't trying to garb 
themselves in commonplace horror-rock trappings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a metaphor," said Jim Lindberg, the group's singer. "The clown 
in the book would turn into whatever scared you the most. In order to 
eventually kill the entity that was Pennywise, they had to confront their 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the hate in people is based in fear and jealousy," said Lindberg, 
who, with bassist Jason Thirsk, also writes most of Pennywise's lyrics, which 
stress maintaining a positive attitude over the nihilism that typifies the punk 
genre.  
</P>
<P>
 "For us, (the Pennywise character) was a great metaphor for the band: here's a 
band that's loud and scary and full of what sounds like venom, but it's 
bringing you a change, something to bring yourself up, instead of something 
loud and scary, and that's all it is." MIKE BOEHM

DANA PARSONS: AN AMERICAN REVIVAL WITH THE REV. GINGRICH IN THE PULPIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The esteemed Mr. Gingrich from Georgia believes the voters rescued the 
Republic last week. Apparently we were all headed for godless communism -- if 
such a thing existed anymore -- but our national slide has been arrested. We'll 
all be on the straight and narrow now, with a man named Newt as our spiritual 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
 The ringleader of our demise was that classic Marxist himself, Bill Clinton, 
from that hotbed of Marxism, Arkansas. Forget that the liberal wing of the 
Democratic Party has been flogging Mr. Clinton as if he were a galley slave for 
not rowing fast enough in their direction. Forget that, and you might be able 
to accept intellectually that Gingrich's argument makes sense. Otherwise, 
you're left to ask how someone can be pounded both from the left and the right. 
Someone's view of reality must be skewed. 
</P>
<P>
 My vote goes to Gingrich. The hunch here is that his gripe with Clinton is 
much more philosophical than personal. Not personal in the sense that he hates 
him; personal in the sense that he resents him and, who knows, may be jealous 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The tip-off came shortly after the election when Gingrich referred to Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary, as "counterculture McGovern-niks." I never attributed 
hipness to Gingrich before, but to be so far behind the curve as to coin that 
phrase said more to me about his psyche than it did his politics. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who have either forgotten about or never heard of him (which 
accounts for 99.9% of the American public), George McGovern ran for president 
in 1972. He lost. He was a historical footnote by 1974, not to mention 1994. 
It's safe to say that he is not exactly in the pantheon of 20th-Century 
Democrats. If Gingrich were looking for relevance, he might just as well have 
cited the Mugwumps as his political reference point. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Gingrich felt the need to remind us of McGovern and the 
"counterculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Why is that? Why the obsession with a concept as dated as the 
"counterculture"? 
</P>
<P>
 I think I know. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember a lot of Gingrich types in college, guys railing against the 
"counterculture" of the late 1960s and early '70s. In those days, being 
counterculture meant protesting the war in Vietnam, having long hair, maybe 
doing some drugs and, if you really knew what you were doing, getting lots of 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gingrich types came from good families and were taught to follow blindly 
what any authority figure told them. No matter how overwhelming the evidence 
may have been that authority could be abused, these personality types wouldn't 
budge. Following foolish or evil authority figures was always preferable to 
challenging them. In the '80s and '90s, these people all became homeowner 
association board members. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm convinced the Gingrich types from my college days hated the 
"counterculturists" because they thought they were having all the fun. Oh, the 
Newt Gingriches of the 1960s wanted that kind of fun, too, but they just 
couldn't bring themselves to go after it. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the resentment you could build for someone after seeing him coming 
back to the dorm at 2 in the morning, laughing and disheveled, while you were 
pulling an all-nighter for a biology exam. Imagine the hatred toward someone 
who constantly talked about how many girlfriends he had, while you were still 
dating the same girl you'd met in junior high. Imagine listening to someone's 
tales of mind-altering drug trips, while you were disgusted at the thought of 
someone spiking the punch with ginger ale. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know the type. Not content with doing what their consciences told them, 
they had to bother you with it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought the country had had its fill of these behavior watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do the names Bakker and Swaggart leap forth as if from some long-forgotten 
bad dream? Are we back already to being in the clutches of people like Charles 
Keating, who led anti-pornography crusades in their spare time while wiping out 
the financial futures of senior citizens during regular business hours? 
</P>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich has made it clear he expects to lead a fight to restore virtue 
and values to society. I could count on one hand the number of people who don't 
want virtue and value in their society, but Newt Gingrich? 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, Nellie. Isn't this the Newt Gingrich who barely won his congressional 
seat in 1990 and barely won his own party's primary in 1992? Suddenly, he's our 
spiritual Sherpa guide? 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks but no thanks, Newt. Your politics may be one thing, but don't give me 
any sermons on morality. At least not until you've provided me with a complete 
psychological work-up on you and your buddies who seem to relish the notion of 
telling the rest of us how we should live.

MATH ERROR INFLATED VENTURA BLVD. COST; TRAFFIC: MISTAKE MADE IN 1991 ADDED $74 
MILLION TO WIDENING AND BEAUTIFYING THE STREET. BUT ANOTHER GOOF CUT THE 
EXPENSE A BIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers and some community leaders say they've known for years that a city 
master plan for the San Fernando Valley's "Main Street" was out of whack. The 
city, they claim, was charging developers exorbitant fees to fund a 20-year 
plan for improvements to Ventura Boulevard that seemed doomed from the start 
because of its shaky funding structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city has admitted for the first time that the critics were at least 
partially right. 
</P>
<P>
 City Department of Transportation officials acknowledge they are responsible 
for an arithmetic error that inflated the cost of the Ventura Boulevard 
Specific Plan by one-third. The mistake added $74 million to the budget for 
beautifying the boulevard, driving the total up to $222 million, they concede. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the reasons city planners are now trying to replace that 1991 
plan with another, which would cost only about $76 million if it is approved by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 plan was to be funded in large part by controversial "trip fees" 
imposed on a one-time basis on developers, based on the number of auto trips a 
new development was expected to generate. The newly proposed plan would be 
funded instead by project impact assessments, much lower fees based upon a 
development's square footage. 
</P>
<P>
 The new $76-million proposal takes into account another error made by the 
city, when it failed to include $8.8 million in the budget for the cost of 
moving public utilities such as telephone poles and fire hydrants to make room 
for intersection widening. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Allyn Rifkin, chief transportation planner for the Department of 
Transportation, the city discovered the smaller error while investigating 
budgetary problems raised by community activist Jeff Brain, who discovered the 
larger error. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin said that in a sense, the two plans are similar because both are 
founded on the principle of developers' paying fees to reduce traffic problems 
that their projects create. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand," he said, "the reduced (project impact assessment) fee and 
easier payment procedure, we hope, will be an incentive to bring some 
development to the boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders expressed mixed reaction to the news.  
</P>
<P>
 Longtime critics of the plan predicted that, even with the more-realistic 
price tag, the proposed plan's funding mechanisms would not generate enough 
money to pay for the envisioned improvements; that is, street-widening, 
landscaping and more parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Other community leaders said the correction would make the plan work better 
and the discovery of the error did not detract from the plan's main concept -- 
to assess developer fees as a way to manage growth and make infrastructure 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good that they corrected the math error, but there are still problems 
that need to be addressed," said Brain, chairman of the plan's citizens review 
committee and an announced candidate for the City Council seat being vacated by 
Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the (Project Impact Assessment) fee revenue "is still overestimated, 
private business and commercial property owners are having to pay for a 
disproportionately high share of the improvements, and when they started 
cutting from the budget, they took from areas such as parking and community 
shuttles, which are very important improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is still fatally flawed," said Fred Gaines, a Sherman Oaks attorney 
who has successfully represented several developers who appealed their trip 
fees. "Even with this reduction in the overall budget, the fees are still 
excessive when you look at the market on the boulevard. It still creates a 
tremendous disincentive for people to put in development along Ventura 
Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 But other community activists said that the correction would make a good plan 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The finding of this error is positive in that it allows for a budget based on 
reality," said Tony Lucente, a member of the citizens committee and president 
of the Studio City Residents Assn. "What we went through is just a review and 
correction process." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, a member of another citizens committee that advised the city 
as it drew up the plan in the 1980s, suggested that the city try to get its 
money back from the consulting firm that developed the original plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they made a gross mistake of that magnitude, that smacks of gross 
incompetency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain said he discovered the mistake about 18 months ago as he was studying 
the details of the plan's budget. The community leader said he raised the issue 
with Transportation Department officials, who at first refused to acknowledge 
that they had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rifkin, the mistake was made when the consulting firm that worked 
on the plan, Barton-Aschman Associates of Pasadena, double-counted the amount 
of land that would have to be bought and improved for intersection widening. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain explained the error this way: If the city decided to widen each side of 
a road by 10 feet over a stretch 370 feet long, engineers could calculate the 
land needed by multiplying 10 times 370 and doubling the result. Or, they could 
arrive at the same result by multiplying 20 by 370. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the consulting firm made a mistake that was the equivalent of 
multiplying 20 by 740, doubling both figures before multiplying them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin confirmed that this is the essence of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consultant did it, but I would have to take responsibility for not having 
caught that," Rifkin said, adding that he has not decided what action to take 
against the consultant, if any.

YAROSLAVSKY SAYS HE WILL BACK QUAKE RECOVERY PLAN; CITY HALL: COUNCILMAN 
ANNOUNCES HIS SUPPORT FOR USING REDEVELOPMENT POWERS TO REBUILD DAMAGED PARTS 
OF SHERMAN OAKS AND STUDIO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky ended weeks of speculation 
Thursday by announcing that he will support a controversial plan to use 
redevelopment powers to rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods in Sherman Oaks and 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to appease strong opposition to the idea, Yaroslavsky said he 
will recommend that the city immediately implement a recovery plan for damaged 
condominiums but delay other elements of the redevelopment program for 10 
months, giving the council an opportunity to abort the effort later. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his plan, a citizens redevelopment committee appointed by Yaroslavsky 
could also oppose certain elements of the plan and the decisions of the panel 
could only be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to be responsive," he said. "The thing is I do not want to walk 
away from a tool that could make a difference between financial ruin and 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, a redevelopment zone in Sherman Oaks and Studio City would 
include commercial and residential blocks along Ventura Boulevard and adjacent 
neighborhoods. It would divert property taxes to provide $18.8 million in 
residential and commercial loans and money to rebuild streets and public 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's vote is critical because other council members have said his 
decision will strongly influence their vote when the plan goes before the 
council for a final decision Tuesday. Some of Yaroslavsky's colleagues, 
however, said his proposal was a way around making a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the proposal was mixed, with some critics saying they are willing 
to consider the new idea and others continuing to oppose any use of 
redevelopment powers in the hard-hit communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said his group 
has opposed a previous plan for an emergency redevelopment zone but is now 
willing to study Yaroslavsky's new plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal is worth looking at because there is no question that the 
condominium owners are the most affected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Close said he still does not trust the city's Community Redevelopment Agency 
to solve the problems in Sherman Oaks and Studio City but is willing to allow 
the agency to act as a lender of last resort for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Epstein, a Sherman Oaks resident and vocal opponent of the idea, was not 
appeased. He said Yaroslavsky's idea of launching only one element of the 
recovery plan was "like letting just a little of the cancer into the body and 
hoping it doesn't spread." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other opponents, Epstein said he doesn't trust the CRA, saying it 
has proven in other redevelopment projects to be unresponsive to the opinions 
of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You let these guys in there and it's going to be a free-for-all," he said. 
"It's an absolute disaster waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fred Gaines, a Sherman Oaks attorney and supporter of the current 
redevelopment proposal, supports Yaroslavsky's new plan. He criticized 
opponents of the idea, saying most have been unwilling to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea," he said. "Those of us working on it have been 
trying at every turn to accommodate people's concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky unveiled the plan Wednesday night at a meeting of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. He said he made an "emotional plea" to the group but felt that 
many were still not sold on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said the plan would provide immediate help for condominium owners 
because many cannot make repairs to common facilities in a complex after other 
condo owners have abandoned their units. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would allow the CRA to buy abandoned condominiums and make repairs so 
the units can be resold. For condominium owners who have not abandoned their 
units, the city's housing department already offers low interest loans of up to 
$35,000 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The other elements of the program -- the sale of bonds to provide residential 
and business loans -- would be delayed until at least October, 1995, under 
Yaroslavsky's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is leaving his post Dec. 5 to take a seat on the Board of 
Supervisors, Yaroslavsky said he wanted to provide his replacement an 
opportunity to pull the plug on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the full program is in effect, the appointed citizens committee could 
vote on any CRA action related to the project. The panel could also vote 
whether to keep the programs limited to condominiums or expand it to the other 
programs. Once all the elements are in place, the committee could also vote on 
whether to extend the five-year plan to 10 years. If the committee votes 
against any such matter, the council could only overturn the decision with a 
vote of 10 of the 15 council members.

FUROR ERUPTS OVER KLAN JOKE ON SET OF 'E.R' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN and VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversy is swirling around "E.R.," TV's hottest new drama, after one 
actress complained that racist remarks were made on the set, but others -- 
including the actor to whom the remarks were allegedly made -- denied that 
anything offensive was said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thea Perkins, an extra hired to be in the background of a scene in the series 
broadcast by NBC, complained that one of the show's stars joked about the Ku 
Klux Klan during a break in filming at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank on Oct. 
28.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on Perkins' allegations, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith sent 
a letter to the show's producer demanding an explanation and threatening action 
under the federal Civil Rights Act. The Screen Actors Guild, to whom Perkins 
also complained, has made inquiries as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Bagliotti, spokeswoman for Burbank-based Warner Bros., which 
produces the program, said Thursday that a preliminary investigation of the 
incident by the studio's legal department has shown "that there is no substance 
to these allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said she saw George Clooney, who plays Dr. Douglas Ross on the medical 
drama, pretending to be a member of the KKK and making a defamatory remark to 
Deezer D., an African American actor who plays an orderly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clooney, Deezer D. and the studio deny that such an incident happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say it," Clooney said through his publicist, Stan Rosenfeld. "I 
couldn't have. It goes against everything I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Deezer D. said it was he, not Clooney, who mentioned the KKK in an attempt at 
humor. Clooney, he said, was clowning on the set and pulled a burn mask -- a 
yellow hospital gown used to protect burn victims -- up over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Who are you supposed to be, the (expletive) KKK?' " Deezer D. said. 
"I joked around with it, and Clooney said nothing. It wasn't anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Shubi Kay, an Indian-born actor who plays a doctor on the program, confirmed 
Deezer D.'s account. 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney "was assuming different accents, mimicking actors in old movies, doing 
a running gag for about 10 minutes," Kay said. "We were all laughing heartily 
at it. In the midst of all, this there was one sequence, 10 to 20 seconds tops, 
in which, as he was horsing around, he sat on this wheelchair and raised his 
gown." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Kay said, Deezer D. remarked that Clooney looked like a 
Klansman. 
</P>
<P>
 "George laughed it off, and he went on to another act altogether," Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins stuck by her story, saying that Clooney pulled a hood over his face 
and made an extremely ugly racist suggestion to Deezer D. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood there, and I couldn't believe it," Perkins said. "I walked outside, 
came back in and said, 'This is ridiculous. There's no way I can put up with 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Defamation League spokesman Randall Steinberg said his organization is 
continuing to investigate Perkins' allegations. Bagliotti said the studio plans 
to make all of the approximately 40 people who were on the set available to the 
civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg wrote to John Wells, the show's executive producer, that the alleged 
conduct by Clooney and the crew "created a hostile and intimidating environment 
for Ms. Perkins, who is African American, and others. Please contact me 
immediately to describe what actions you propose to take to ensure that future 
incidents of intolerance do not occur on the set of your television show."

INS CHIEF TO TRY TO SETTLE RACIAL BIAS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under intense fire over charges of racial discrimination in her agency, 
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner agreed at a 
congressional hearing Thursday to negotiate a settlement to a huge class-action 
suit originally brought by African American employees of the Los Angeles INS 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which encompasses about 900 employees nationwide, spotlights 
longstanding problems with hiring and promoting blacks within the INS. It also 
contends that blacks are subjected to a racially hostile work environment and 
forced to endure derogatory comments and unequal imposition of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS anticipates making a settlement offer in the next week, spokesman Eric 
Berryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a substantive proposal is brought forward, this could be a major step in 
finally settling this very large class-action suit," said David L. Ross, the 
Los Angeles attorney representing the plaintiffs. "But they've been telling us 
this for six months. As far as I'm concerned, talk is cheap. Until I see 
something in writing, it doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross is seeking back pay and damages that could total $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner was called to testify by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of 
the House Government Operations Committee and the only member of Congress 
present in the vast committee hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Conyers, a strong backer of the the plaintiffs' lawsuit who will lose his 
power to call hearings to the GOP in the next Congress, said racial 
discrimination within the agency was "unambiguous, bold and unashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of discriminatory employment practices have long been illegal, 
but the INS seems to be operating in some kind of time warp," Conyers said. "I 
am deeply disturbed that any government agency -- but especially a part of the 
Justice Department of all things -- is this far out of control in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed on behalf of more than 500 African American INS 
employees in September, 1991, and certified as a class-action complaint in 
January by Administrative Law Judge Jane Goodman in Los Angeles. It has since 
expanded to cover more than 850 INS employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, three House committee chairmen, including Conyers, turned up the 
heat under Meissner, urging her to settle the case expeditiously. But, 
according to Ross, INS officials missed several deadlines for making settlement 
proposals, the latest being Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's hearing during a brief aside, Meissner announced her intention 
that the INS attempt to settle the class-action suit, but an INS spokesman 
afterward seemed surprised by the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said she "very much regretted the underrepresentation (of blacks) and 
the hostility" and listed a number of measures that she has taken to address 
the deep-seated problems that she inherited when she took over the agency two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She has revised evaluation criteria to create more fairness in promotions and 
pushed for more racial diversity in hiring and recruiting. She has also 
overseen a special task force to improve the equal employment practices, 
promoted four blacks to senior level positions and required managers and 
supervisors to receive training in manager accountability and cultural 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner gave her personal commitment "to ensure that INS has a diverse work 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 But Conyers was not appeased. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're making me believe there was no reason to hold this hearing . . . this 
won't be fixed by sensitivity sessions (to supervisors) who don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
 Black INS officers have cited 14 years of alleged discrimination, including 
workplace harassment, unequal discipline and bias in promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans represent more than 11% of the INS's 17,000 full-time 
workers, but they hold fewer than 6% of the best-paying positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 50 blacks serve in the nearly 5,000-agent Border Patrol, where 
complainants say the most virulent discrimination occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS bias case began when 19 Los Angeles-based criminal investigators filed 
a complaint. Several testified at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 John T. Wills Jr., a special agent in the INS Los Angeles office, described 
being verbally abused and threatened by fellow agents, who later received mild 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills said he thought his life was in danger. "I don't fear the criminals as 
much as I do the people inside," Wills said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; UP TO 190 HOMES SOUGHT IN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake Village's land-use committee today will hear a tentative proposal by 
a developer to build as many as 190 homes on a 23-acre tract in an area north 
of the Ventura Freeway known as Westlake North. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Kaufman & Broad, is negotiating with the owner of the land, the 
Resolution Trust Corp., to purchase the land, said Bob Theobold, planning 
director for the city of Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at 2 p.m. in City Hall council chambers, 4373 Park Terrace 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-acre site is part of a 130-acre parcel that was acquired by the RTC 
from Westlake Village Associates, a consortium of three savings and loans, 
after two of them failed, Theobold said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 130 acres have been appraised at $30 million, and the government agency 
wants to sell the land to recoup some of the government's funds used to bail 
out the failed savings and loans.  
</P>
<P>
 The RTC has asked the city to change its master plan to allow 720 housing 
units on the parcel, Theobold said.  
</P>
<P>
 It also wants to reduce the commercial component of the property from 1.4 
million square feet -- as permitted in the city's Westlake North Specific Plan 
-- to 680,000 square feet. The plan, drawn up in 1989, allows offices, hotels, 
business parks and retail stores in that area, Theobold said. It also allows 
for the construction of up to 250 condominium units. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kaufmann, a representative of Institutional Property Resources of Santa 
Monica, which manages the property for the RTC, said that under the current 
zoning "there is basically no market for the property." 
</P>
<P>
 All parties involved stressed Thursday that the proposal is just a concept and 
that no action will be taken at today's meeting. "We're just throwing out 
ideas," said Pat Parker, who is in charge of land acquisition for Kaufman & 
Broad's office in Woodland Hills. "It's an informal meeting. We just want to 
see what people think." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept calls for as many as 190 detached, single-family homes, he said. 
Lot sizes would range from 3,000 to 4,000 square feet, "depending on hat the 
city wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Theobold said the city is considering the proposal, which is undergoing 
environmental review. The results should be available in a few weeks, he said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; WILLOW SCHOOL'S ART COURT CONCEPT COPIED 
ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A visit to Willow Elementary School's art court may inspire a new trend after 
being used as a model by Red Oak Elementary School, where it is being visited 
by administrators and teachers from other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the outdoor art court at Red Oak in Ventura County's Oak Park 
looks like a semicircular patio with a counter and sinks.  
</P>
<P>
 But Principal Jeff Hamlin wants people to see what he sees -- a place where 
the creation of art becomes a tool to excite students and help them become 
lifelong learners. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin said he and a parent committee visited Willow School in Agoura Hills to 
observe its art court before adopting the concept, which is now being seen by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very strong philosophy about the infusion of the visual and 
performing arts into all areas of the curriculum," Hamlin said. "It helps 
children to connect with the content and subject matter." 
</P>
<P>
 To explain the process, Hamlin points to most people's early learning 
experiences. Most, he said, remember the classroom store that helped hone math 
skills, the second-grade garden project, or the models of missions built during 
the study of California history.  
</P>
<P>
 The information learned during those hands-on activities, he said, is 
recalled, but not many remember the name of their math book. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at the art court, fifth-grade teacher Joni Chancer used the 
painting of desert and mountain scenes to help students learn to write about 
comparisons and contrasts of ideas. Not only did students create their own 
contrasting works of visual art, but they also used words to create a similar 
contrast in their writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin said the creative works in the art court are only part of the process 
of teaching children to make critical decisions about what is important and how 
pieces of information fit together. 
</P>
<P>
 The manipulation of data is another way to assess performance and determine 
what the students have learned. For example, Hamlin pointed to a new project in 
which students will be asked to prepare a video tape, write a song or a play to 
illustrate what they have gained from California history lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin said he believes his school's approach can be successfully transplanted 
to other districts. Hamlin acknowledged, however, that at Red Oak, the 
availability of technology and the support of the school's Parent-Faculty Assn. 
-- which raised nearly $50,000 for the school last year -- offers an 
opportunity to put into practice the philosophy of using the arts to enhance 
all areas of the curriculum. RAY PATTERSON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WINNETKA; SCHOOL USES GRANT TO OPEN PARENT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Marian Reimann, assistant principal at Sutter Middle School, was asked if 
her school might be interested in a $50,000 grant from the W.K. Kellogg 
Foundation, she said she was glad that she was sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
 With the grant, the school created a Parent Community Resource Center at an 
abandoned agricultural site at the edge of the Winnetka campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter also was able to hire a full-time nurse with the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's seed money," said Reimann, explaining that the money will help germinate 
a host of programs for school children, their parents and members of the 
community, who may not necessarily have kids of their own at Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake devastated the neighborhoods around Sutter, the 
middle school became something of an emergency center where food and clothing 
were distributed to the community: a function that Reimann and others at Sutter 
thought should be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Reimann and the president of the Sutter PTA, Ellen Eckard, said they do not 
know exactly how the resource center, which opened this week, will serve its 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 But they've got lots of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is having the Winnetka Chamber of Commerce hold its meetings at the 
center and encouraging the members to start programs or workshops there. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckard said she also expects classes in first aid, self-defense and foreign 
languages to be taught at the center. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PUBLIC HEARING SET ON GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas will hold the first of several public hearings Dec. 1 on 
a long-awaited final version of the community's first General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall. Copies of the plan are 
available for public review, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which incorporated in 1991, began work on the plan in the fall of 
1992. The initial draft invoked the wrath of some local landowners, who 
objected to a provision that would have allowed for the construction of one 
house for each 160-acre, undeveloped, undivided parcel of land. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised version allows one house for each 40-acre parcel that has not been 
subdivided. The revised plan also allows up to one house for each 10 acres, as 
long as the parcel is not in hazardous areas that are prone to fires or 
mudslides, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest version allows for the construction of 900 more homes than was 
originally called for, or a total of 2,400 new homes over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, the plan also recognizes the danger of developing 
near hilltops and in other areas where landslides could occur and endanger 
lives and property. "The whole philosophy is to avoid the areas that are 
expensive to build on, or that are environmentally sensitive," said Steve 
Harris, the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also attempts to ease the concerns of residents who fear that the 
area is becoming overdeveloped. The plan, for example, suggests that Las 
Virgenes Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard -- both designated as feeder roads 
for the Ahmanson Ranch project -- be left as they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co., which plans to build a 3,050-home development in the Simi 
Hills, wants to extend Las Virgenes Road 15 feet to the Ventura County line and 
widen Thousands Oaks Boulevard from two to four lanes. The project, approved by 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, is vehemently opposed by many 
Calabasas residents.  
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan is vague when it comes to the proposed Calabasas Park Centre, 
a 1.5-million-square-foot office and retail center at Calabasas Road and 
Parkway Calabasas, which had already been approved by Los Angeles County when 
Calabasas incorporated. The developer wants to revise the project to include 
more retail space, a move that must be approved by the Calabasas City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 While some opponents say the project is far too large, the General Plan makes 
no mention of acceptable scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to get them to reconsider on the Park Centre," said Ted 
Rosenquist, a member of the General Plan Advisory Committee. "We would like the 
Planning Commission to scale back the size of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan stresses preserving the character of Old Town, and calls for 
keeping Calabasas Road two lanes, instead of four lanes as suggested to ease 
traffic in the area. The plan does not discuss parking, which has been a 
problem in the Old Town area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm generally comfortable with the plan," said David Brown, an 
environmentalist and a member of the Planning Commission. "We have fixed a lot 
of problems with it." FRANK MANNING

EPA REJECTS PERMANENT EVACUATION OVER DDT; POLLUTION: AGENCY SAYS TESTS SHOW 
TOXIC LEVELS ARE LESS THAN FEARED. BUT ANGRY RESIDENTS WANT TO BE RELOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After months of testing, federal officials told a South Bay neighborhood 
Thursday night that they have found no reason residents should be permanently 
moved from a street where chunks of buried DDT were found last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the residents lashed out at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
maintaining again that their neighborhood is contaminated with chemicals from 
two nearby toxic sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal testing has turned up traces of DDT and another pesticide in household 
dust inside 25 homes along West 204th Street near Torrance, and more tests are 
needed to determine if the pesticides pose a health risk to residents, the EPA 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But after months of sampling soil, air and tap water, agency officials say 
they are encouraged that chemical contamination on the street is less than 
residents feared. 
</P>
<P>
 "EPA believes it's pretty good news that we're coming back to the community 
with," EPA Section Chief John Blevins said as he summarized the results of the 
$1.7-million of tests this summer and fall in the neighborhood near two toxic 
chemical sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Cynthia Babich vehemently disagreed, contending that the EPA 
deliberately is downplaying the test results. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should condemn this neighborhood and relocate the residents, and stop 
spending all that money testing. They've tested enough," Babich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were begun after buried chunks of DDT were uncovered last spring 
behind the homes of Babich and a neighbor on the modest working-class street, 
alarming residents who have complained of nausea, rashes and dizziness that 
they fear are caused by chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, 33 families from the street have been living in cramped hotel 
rooms and rented homes at federal expense while the EPA excavated the buried 
DDT and investigated for further chemical contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The street is flanked by two toxic sites: the former Montrose Chemical Corp., 
once a major DDT manufacturer and now a federal Superfund site, and the Del Amo 
Study Area, once home to a synthetic rubber factory and now a federal Superfund 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 The test results included the discovery of DDT and another pesticide, benzene 
hexachloride (BHC), in dust in 25 of the 28 homes tested. 
</P>
<P>
 More tests are needed to determine the pesticides' concentrations and whether 
they pose a health hazard, Blevins said. After investigating further, the EPA 
will decide whether to sample dust in other homes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Too little is known to say if the DDT came from the Montrose plant or another 
source, such as legal pesticide use, Blevins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The DDT chunks found in two yards last spring were found mixed with fill that 
officials once feared could extend under a number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But soil testing along the street has found that similar fill may exist in 
only four other yards, and more investigation of the six properties is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 More study is also planned to determine why indoor air tests turned up benzene 
at higher than normal levels in two homes. The EPA says it has no information 
connecting the benzene to either the Montrose or Del Amo sites.

COUNTYWIDE CRACKDOWN ON DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County's largest-ever coordinated effort to get intoxicated 
motorists off the road, a coalition of law enforcement agencies will 
simultaneously stage drunk-driving checkpoints at 24 locations tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 Police expect to nab between 500 and 1,000 drunk drivers from Malibu to Long 
Beach, starting after sundown. The efforts will be dedicated to the memory of 
La Habra Police Officer Michael Osornio, who was killed when a drunk driver 
plowed into his police car on Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to put the message out that if you are going to drive under the 
influence, there is a high likelihood you are going to get arrested," said 
Alhambra Police Chief Russ Siverling, president of the Los Angeles County Peace 
Officers Assn., which is organizing the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Siverling said his group, armed with a $230,000 state grant, started planning 
the event months ago. However, in the wake of Osornio's death, the group 
figured the crackdown would also be an appropriate way to honor the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, checkpoints are done by each agency individually; this is the first 
time they have been coordinated across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio, 26, a former contractor who joined the La Habra Police Department 
last year, was fatally injured Oct. 31 when a drunk-driving suspect ran a red 
light and smashed into his cruiser, demolishing it and pinning the officer 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, who has been charged with gross vehicular manslaughter, 
was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 0.18% -- more than twice the legal 
limit of 0.08%. Osornio was the first officer on the city's police force to be 
killed on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law enforcement community is like a family," Siverling said. "When 
someone's life is taken needlessly, you find that the family comes together to 
support one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio's father, Rafael, lauded the efforts. "Maybe we can get someone else 
off the streets and prevent another tragedy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we are doing for all victims of drunk driving," said La 
Habra Chief Steve Staveley. 
</P>
<P>
 Siverling said police picked tonight for the massive show of force because it 
falls on the weekend before Thanksgiving. "People consume a lot more over the 
holidays," he said. "We are trying to get the message out before then." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was organized with the assistance of Jan Nichols, a police 
department volunteer whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver in 1981. 
Nichols said he wrote to the state last year to secure the $230,000 grant to 
fund the checkpoints and other activities to get drunk drivers off the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured, why not start the holidays with a bang?" Nichols said.

KOREAN GROUPS BACK WORKERS; LABOR: A COALITION IS PRESSING THE L.A. HILTON'S 
OWNER NOT TO LET A MANAGEMENT FIRM DISPLACE HOTEL STAFF, MOST OF WHOM ARE 
LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of Korean American organizations has come to the aid of union 
workers, predominantly Latinos, who could lose their jobs if the owner of the 
Downtown Los Angeles Hilton & Towers changes management firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is exerting pressure on the South Korean owner of the hotel not 
only because "it is the morally correct thing to do, but because (the 
company's) decision can have a negative impact on the local Korean American 
community," said Paul S. Lee, a community organizer with Korean Immigrant 
Workers Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who takes over the management of the hotel, owned by Hanjin 
International Corp., the union contracts should be honored "out of a sense of 
justice and dignity" for hundreds of loyal employees, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month 575 hotel workers, most of whom perform housekeeping or kitchen 
duties, were notified that their employment would be terminated Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, according to the notice from the hotel's general manager, is the 
Dec. 31 expiration of the contract between Hanjin and the Hilton Hotels Corp., 
which has managed the facility since Hanjin acquired it in 1989. Hanjin is a 
subsidiary of one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates, which also owns 
Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hanjin spokesman said it is premature for workers to worry about losing 
their jobs because the company and the Hilton are trying to work out an 
agreement. He said that the management contract has been extended through Jan. 
31 while the two sides continue their talks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday about two dozen hotel workers, union representatives and their 
supporters went to City Hall to talk with council members who are expected to 
adopt a resolution urging Hanjin to retain the hotel employees at their current 
positions and wages, which for most range from $7 to $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The involvement of the Korean company in a dispute involving mostly Latino 
workers set off alarms among Korean American activists who have been 
concentrating on improving relations with other ethnic groups since the Los 
Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became concerned that the situation could turn into a racial issue, and 
negatively impact our community," said Roy Hong, executive director of Korean 
Immigrant Workers Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong was instrumental in enlisting the support of other Korean American 
organizations. His group and the Korean American Inter-Agency Council, a 
consortium of nine organizations, have participated in news conferences and 
other events publicizing the case. Last Saturday union members and their 
supporters demonstrated in front of the Korean Air terminal at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Skurnik, campaign coordinator for the Hotel Employees & Restaurant 
Employees Local 11, said Hanjin officials should not even consider terminating 
the employees. "Don't they know that workers in this city will not put up with 
that? Hilton workers fought for (their) jobs and benefits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Grossman, a Hanjin spokesman, said the company has gone out of its way 
to be accommodating to the hotel employees. To alleviate the fears of workers, 
he said, Hanjin sent out a memo informing workers that in the event the 
management contract with Hilton is not renewed, Hanjin plans to "rehire all or 
substantially all" of the current employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Grossman said, even though the company is not legally obligated, 
it has agreed to recognize all five unions involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Maria Elena Durazo, president of Local 11, who enlisted the help of the 
local Korean organizations, said she wants promises from the company in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanjin's Oct. 28 notice states that rehired employees would be "subject to an 
application and interview process and . . . a brief introductory period." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Pierson, a bell captain, complained after 25 years of working there, he 
should not be treated like a new employee. "I don't like their attitude," 
Pierson said. "They're treating us like chattel." 
</P>
<P>
 Felisa Quisora, a housekeeper at the Hilton, said she was "so sad" when she 
got the termination notice. "After working so hard for all these years -- we 
don't deserve this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the Koreana Co. of South Korea bought the former Hyatt 
Wilshire Hotel and fired 150 union employees, Local 11 joined the Asian Pacific 
American Labor Alliance and other Asian community groups in fighting the 
company. Union members picketed the hotel for almost a year before the 
dismissed workers were rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest coalition is the first significant effort by Korean American 
community organizations to create a multiethnic group to support workers.

PAROLE OF RAPIST TO COVINA DRAWS OUTRAGE FROM OFFICIALS; CRIME: REGINALD DONALD 
MULDREW IS SUSPECTED OF MORE THAN 200 SEXUAL ATTACKS DURING THE 1970S. A 
PROTEST RALLY IN CIVIC CENTER PARK IS PLANNED FOR MONDAY.

<P>
 A convicted rapist suspected in more than 200 sexual attacks in Los Angeles 
during the 1970s is scheduled to be paroled in Covina, raising a cry of protest 
from city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Donald Muldrew, 46, convicted in 1978 of four counts of rape with 
force, two counts of oral copulation with a child, one count of assault and 
several counts of burglary and robbery, is scheduled to be released from 
Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City in December, said California 
Department of Corrections spokeswoman Christine May. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew is "a violent rapist who is dangerous to the community," Covina 
Councilman John M. Wilcox said. "He doesn't belong in a civilized society, and 
he doesn't belong in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Before his release Dec. 4, Muldrew must pass a psychiatric examination, May 
said, adding that Muldrew has no history of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina Police Chief John Lentz, who said he was notified Tuesday about 
Muldrew's parole into Covina, said he is urging residents to write letters of 
protest to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that (Muldrew) should not be released," Lentz said. "I 
believe he will pose a threat to society." 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was dubbed the "Pillowcase Rapist" because he covered his victims' 
faces with pillowcases, blouses or scarves. He sometimes put knives to their 
throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was convicted of four rapes, Muldrew was a suspect in more than 
200 in which the victims had pillowcases placed over their heads, as well as 
150 burglaries from 1975 until his arrest in 1978, May said. Victims lived in 
Compton, Southwest Los Angeles and the Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 He has served time in several state prisons, including San Quentin. He was 
sent to Pelican Bay on Jan. 17, 1990, because of his involvement with a prison 
gang, Pelican Bay State Prison spokesman Lt. Al Deines said. There, he was 
placed in the security housing unit where he spent 22 1/2 hours of each day in 
isolation, Deines said.  
</P>
<P>
 Covina city officials said state authorities told them that Muldrew had been 
convicted of raping 29 women in all. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a suspect in the 1971 murder of a San Quentin prison guard but was not 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina Mayor Tom M. O'Leary said he has sent a letter on behalf of the city to 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The security of our female residents is in jeopardy," O'Leary said. "You're 
talking about an individual whose prodigious life of crime has been against 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said there will be a protest rally in the Civic Center Park at 7 p.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lentz said he did not know why Muldrew was being paroled to Covina but said 
that state law dictates that parolees must be paroled to the county where they 
were convicted. Lentz said he thought the placement might be related to a 
recent law that says convicted rapists cannot be released within 35 miles of 
their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 This marks the second time this year that a serial rapist has been scheduled 
for release in the San Gabriel Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar case, serial rapist Christopher Hubbart failed a psychiatric exam 
on the day of his scheduled parole to Claremont in March. Hubbart, 43, who had 
raped 43 women, was driven straight to a parole office after his release from 
prison, where he was evaluated by a psychiatrist that morning. By that 
afternoon, Hubbart was back behind bars.  
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1977 determinate sentencing law, rapists and most other offenders must 
be released on parole at a specified time rather than having to go before a 
state parole board for clearance.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN HONORED FOR TEACHER EDUCATION

<P>
 Cal State Northridge is one of four public universities nationwide honored for 
outstanding programs in teacher education by the American Assn. of State 
Colleges and Universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The university won the Christa McAuliffe Showcase for Excellence Award for its 
work with the Los Angeles Unified School District to create the Comprehensive 
Teaching Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute prepares teachers to work in urban, multilingual, multiethnic 
elementary and secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher who died in the Challenger 
space shuttle explosion, the award was presented Wednesday at the association's 
annual meeting in Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards spotlight model programs that have improved the teaching 
profession. In 1992, the Washington-based higher education association issued a 
call for reform that culminated in a national conference, Teach America, in 
which goals for improvement of teacher education programs were set. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards recognize successful programs that emphasize at least one of five 
areas, such as promoting diversity in the teaching profession and connecting 
teacher education programs with their communities.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Cal State Northridge, the 1994 McAuliffe Awards recognized 
teacher education programs at East Texas State, East Carolina and Southeast 
Missouri State universities. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's Comprehensive Teacher Institute targets minority, bilingual and 
talented university students for recruitment into the teacher eduction program. 
Key parts of the program include early teaching assistant positions and 
internships, support from retired teachers during the first year of teaching 
and mentoring programs organized by district. TIM MAY

 Imagine throwing a housewarming party without any place to warm the food. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Habitat for Humanity is prepared to dedicate an eight-unit 
condominium building Saturday as its first project built for needy families in 
the San Fernando Valley, many basic comforts of home are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight families will be housed in the condominium complex, located near San 
Fernando High School at 11133 O'Melveny St. 
</P>
<P>
 A ceremony will be held at the school's southeast athletic field at 1:30 p.m. 
to welcome the families. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the families, the public is being asked to donate the following needed 
appliances: eight refrigerators, eight range ovens, eight range hoods, seven 
washers and dryers (side-by-side) and one stackable washer-dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 Each family who will move into the new condos gave 500 hours of "sweat equity" 
toward building their homes. Habitat for Humanity is a Christian-based housing 
organization whose objective is to eradicate the cycle of poverty worldwide.

abused and neglected children who reside at the Hathaway Children's Services 
residential campus in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift is part of an annual charitable program that targets needy children 
in Southern California communities.The eye care and glasses will be 
administered at Lens Crafters locations in Northridge and Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "This gift is a tremendous help to us," said Peggi Preston, development 
associate for Hathaway Children's Services, located on a 300-acre residential 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is home to 120 children, ages 5 to 18. Cecil B. DeMille once owned 
this land that overlooks the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children are all wards of the court who've been removed from their 
homes," Preston said. "They've been sexually abused, physically abused and, in 
many cases, simply abandoned. Most of them have never had the money to afford 
proper eye care." 
</P>
<P>
 Preston said Hathaway children have a continuous need for donations of health 
services, including eye care and corrective lenses.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STORIES DRIVE CSUN IMMIGRATION FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To address issues of immigration and immigrant culture in Los Angeles, Cal 
State Northridge is holding a public forum Dec. 1 centered around three short 
stories written by authors representing the Latino, Asian American and African 
American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist, poet and television host Ruben Martinez will lead a panel 
discussion, "So What Brings You Here? Three Stories of Los Angeles Immigrant 
Communities." 
</P>
<P>
 John Swift, professor of English at Occidental College, and Timothy Fong, 
professor of Asian American studies at CSUN, also will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories -- Chester Himes' "Lunching at the Ritzmore," Helena Maria 
Viramontes' "Cariboo Cafe" and Kim Ronyoung's "Clay Walls" -- will be used as a 
means to stimulate dialogue about immigration and race. 
</P>
<P>
 Free copies of the stories are available by calling CSUN's School of 
Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have a distinct lack of understanding. We kind of talk behind these 
kinds of barriers," said Mark Rocha, associate dean of humanities at CSUN and 
the forum's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the thing that is different about this is that we are encouraging 
participation within the university and outside the university," Rocha said, 
adding that he has contacted local bookstores and libraries about the forum and 
distributed free copies of the stories to them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the forum was being planned by CSUN's Northridge Faculty Study Group for 
Intercultural Understanding before the passage of the controversial Proposition 
187, Rocha said the event will be timely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously need to do some things toward healing rather than this sort of 
divisive kind of rhetoric that we keep throwing at each other," he said. MAKI 
BECKER

COMPLAINTS LODGED OVER DEEJAY'S CALL FOR KILLING HOMELESS; PROTEST: GROUPS 
OPPOSED TO RADIO HOST'S REMARKS FILE OBJECTIONS WITH THE FCC AND STAGE 
DEMONSTRATION AT KFI-AM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Advocates for the homeless Thursday staged a demonstration and filed a 
complaint with the Federal Communications Commission against a local radio 
station whose early morning talk show host called for the extermination of 
street people.  
</P>
<P>
 "If homeless people cannot survive on their own, why shouldn't they be put to 
sleep?" was the question KFI-AM (640) "shock jock" Emiliano Limon posed to 
listeners this summer, adding that he was not trying to boost ratings but truly 
believes the homeless should be killed because they are "a burden . . . a waste 
of space." 
</P>
<P>
 One caller agreed, voicing the Nazi salute " Seig heil " and suggesting: 
"Let's start building the ovens, baby." To which Limon responded: " Mach 
schnell (right away)." 
</P>
<P>
 Limon, 26, a novice broadcaster who earns $140 a week for hosting the Sunday 
morning show, said Thursday that he regrets using the German phrase and did so 
only in jest without knowing what it meant. But Limon's limited apology fell 
short of demands by homeless advocates, who say his attitude is symptomatic of 
a growing national intolerance toward the plight of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups filed complaints Thursday with the FCC -- the Los Angeles County 
Commission for Public Social Services, an advisory group appointed by the Board 
of Supervisors, and the Los Angeles Coalition to End Homelessness, a private, 
nonprofit organization. About 25 members of the coalition also staged their 
second protest demonstration outside the radio station on Armore Street near 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition called on the FCC to force the station to provide equal time on 
the air for contrasting opinions and for an early review of the station's 
license. The commission's complaint sought no specific remedy from federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as it is well-established that free speech does not entitle one to yell 
'fire' in a crowded theater, so too must journalists avoid invitations to 
murder or other forms of violence," the commission stated in its FCC complaint. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But the station and several anti-censorship groups defend Limon's right to 
voice his opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe these are the kind of statements, bankrupt as they may be, 
that the government should have a role in suppressing," said Terry Francke, 
executive director of the California First Amendment Coalition. "The First 
Amendment, after all, is not intended for the expression of pleasantries, but 
precisely to protect expressions that people find repugnant." 
</P>
<P>
 KFI program director David Hall agreed: "We're sorry if Emiliano offended 
anyone, but we stand behind his right to say what he wants."  
</P>
<P>
 Milton Gross, chief of the FCC's political branch in Washington, said the 
station is not required to provide equal time to the coalition or any other 
group, because the rule known as the Fairness Doctrine was repealed seven years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hall said the radio station will broadcast Limon's show live this 
Sunday from a homeless shelter "somewhere in Southern California" to give 
homeless people a chance to contradict the host's opinions. Limon has been a 
volunteer worker there for the past three weeks, shelter officials confirmed, 
but Hall asked that the shelter location not be revealed because he is 
concerned about Limon's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelter operators will pick the homeless people Emiliano will interview 
so it doesn't look like we're stacking the deck," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Erlenbusch, the coalition's executive director, said allowing Limon to 
confront the homeless will not satisfy the group's demands for equal time. 
Pointing out that Limon compared homeless people to unwanted dogs, Erlenbusch 
said, "He owes 50,000 homeless people an apology. It is particularly important 
to draw attention to this when the mood of the country is . . . for ripping 
kids out of their mothers' arms and putting them in foster care or orphanages 
in the name of welfare reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Erlenbusch acknowledged that the coalition has received more than $120,000 in 
donations from another radio station, KROQ-FM (106.7), since the coalition 
criticized it for a disc jockey's comments mocking the homeless. But Erlenbusch 
said the group is not using the Limon incident as a vehicle to solicit money 
from KFI. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of principle only," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limon said his experience as a volunteer at the shelter has made him realize 
that some homeless people who fall on hard times indeed deserve compassion. But 
his new solution to the problem is unlikely to satisfy homeless advocates. 
Rather than exterminating those "who don't want to improve their situation," 
Limon said he now believes that they should be herded into camps "out in the 
desert."

DEAF COUPLE SUE HOTEL OVER FIRE WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deaf couple who were left sleeping in their beds during a hotel fire last 
year in Pismo Beach filed a lawsuit Thursday against hotel operators for 
failing to provide emergency warning systems for the hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 David and Jodie Gardner were on a weekend vacation at the Sea Venture hotel in 
Pismo Beach last November to escape the fires surrounding their Westlake 
Village neighborhood when they awoke to the smell of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think anything of it at first," David Gardner said. "We had the 
windows open, and thought it was campfire smoke (that) was coming up from the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
 When David Gardner left the room to investigate, he found the hotel hallway 
smoky and drenched with water. A firefighter -- who was reportedly shocked to 
find anyone left in the building -- immediately evacuated the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which burned for two hours, had been extinguished for an hour by the 
time the Gardners were found, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kidd, spokesman for Western Inns, a hotel management company 
affiliated with the Sea Venture, said the firm had not yet been served with any 
legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is there was not a single injury in this fire, not to anyone, 
not even a burn," Kidd said. "Honestly, that is all you can pray for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Venture is set to reopen "any day now," according to Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the fire, a hotel spokesperson reportedly told a local 
newspaper that the hotel was not aware the couple was deaf. But the couple 
maintains that they informed the hotel of the fact upon check-in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardners charge that the hotel failed to comply with the accessibility 
guidelines in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. A hotel with more 
than 50 rooms, about the size of the Sea Venture, must provide three rooms to 
accommodate hearing-impaired patrons, according to Kathleen Wohn of the Western 
Center for Disability Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The special accommodations are supposed to include a fire alarm that flashes 
light bright enough to wake a sleeping person, a special telephone, a doorbell 
with a flashing light, and a specially designed alarm clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, all of the things needed to make a room accessible to the 
hard-of-hearing are portable devices, so they could be installed as they are 
needed to make almost any room accessible," Wohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardners are being represented by Wohn and civil rights attorney Alexis 
Kashar, who has handled several cases alleging ADA violations. These have 
included cases filed this year against Burger King, Weight Watchers and the 
Burbank Police Department, all for failing to provide interpretation for the 
hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to know why we were missed by the firemen," said Gardner. "We 
felt embarrassed, scared, shocked. The anger came later." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner says he has traveled to many other hotels since the fire and found 
many of them out of compliance with ADA guidelines. Often, he said, managers 
have never even heard of the required devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main goal is to wake up the hotel industry," said Gardner. "In my case, I 
was very lucky, but there are 21 million deaf and hard-of-hearing people in 
this country. We have to prevent this from happening again."

CAMPUS DRUG OFFENSES RISE 46% IN SUMMER '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The number of Los Angeles Unified School District students caught with drugs 
increased 46% during the summer of 1994, compared to the same period last year. 
Between July 1 and Sept. 30, 83 students were caught with drugs by school 
officials, compared to 57 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say some of the increase may stem from the fact that more 
junior and senior high students are attending year-round schools this year, 
which meet during the summer. But they also say that the increase mirrors a 
nationwide trend toward more drug use among teen-agers. Reports of marijuana 
and cocaine possession on Los Angeles Unified campuses have been increasing 
steadily over the past 18 months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district crime report, released Thursday to board members, showed 
that overall campus offenses decreased 10%. Campus police took 1,835 crime 
reports this summer, compared to 2,046 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the rise in drug offenses, assaults with deadly weapons rose 8% 
during the three-month period, from 40 last year to 43 this year. But weapons 
possessions decreased 8%, from 140 last year to 129 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 129 weapons seized by school police and administrators, 42 were guns, 
51 were knives and 36 were other types of weapons.

BOYS SAY THEY SET YOUTH ON FIRE AS PRANK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers who set another boy afire as he waited in a high-school 
cafeteria lunch line said their actions were intended as a prank, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths were behind Benjamin Goldhammer in line on Wednesday at Agoura 
High School when one boy ignited Goldhammer's shirt with a cigarette lighter, 
said Lt. Jim Glazar of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin, 15, suffered second-degree burns to his back and buttocks and was 
recovering Thursday at his home, Glazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole family is in shock, it's so horrible," said Irene Goldhammer, 
Benjamin's grandmother. "I am broken up by it. He is a good kid, he is an 
above-average student and he doesn't hurt anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys accused in the attack are 16 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Principal Jim Christianson said that although he was unaware of any 
previous scuffles between the boys on campus, he had been told that there was a 
history of animosity between Benjamin and one of his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazar said sheriff's deputies are considering whether to file charges of 
felony assault against the two boys. They were released to the custody of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been suspended from school until the Board of Education convenes 
a hearing to determine whether to expel them, Christianson said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEPUTIES PLAN CHECKPOINTS TO CRACK DOWN ON 
DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to discourage drunk driving during the holiday season, sheriff's 
deputies will set up sobriety checkpoints tonight in Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies discussed their plans for the crackdown during a news briefing 
Thursday in Palmdale, which has had a sharp increase in fatal traffic accidents 
this year. Many of those accidents involved intoxicated drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials would not say where today's checkpoints will be located, 
hoping residents will think twice about drinking and driving anywhere in the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to focus on safety throughout the holiday season," Palmdale Mayor 
Jim Ledford said. "When people see the sobriety checkpoints, they know the 
sheriff's deputies are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Stubbings, the city's community relations officer, urged drivers to be 
extra cautious during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to remind people to drive defensively because there are other people 
on the road who have been drinking," she said. "We want people to be following 
posted speed limits and driving according to road and weather conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale, 18 people have died in 17 traffic accidents so far this year, 
compared with eight fatalities in 1993, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Lancaster, 10 people have died in nine traffic accidents so far 
this year, slightly below last year's figure, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Antelope Valley Freeway and in the county areas outside the two cities, 
23 people have died in 21 collisions, slightly below last year's figure, CHP 
Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the fatal accidents in Palmdale this year, seven involved drivers who were 
impaired by alcohol or drugs, said Sheriff's Deputy Mike Rice. Also, seven of 
the people killed in Palmdale were not wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most of those cases, (wearing) seat belts would have likely prevented 
death," said Rice, a traffic investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the rise in traffic deaths, deputies assigned to traffic 
enforcement in Palmdale have been issuing significantly more tickets in recent 
months instead of letting drivers off with a warning, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drunk-driving arrests are up 30% over 1993, and tickets for failing to wear a 
seat belt are up 70%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies hope to make more drunk-driving arrests at the sobriety checkpoints, 
which will operate from 8 a.m. today until about 2 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most drivers will be stopped for 30 seconds or less, but if a deputy suspects 
intoxication, the driver will be asked to pull over for a field sobriety test.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CRASH KILLS WOMAN, 25, INJURES SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old woman was killed and her 18-month-old son slightly injured 
Thursday when the vehicle in which they were riding veered off the road and 
flipped over in a remote desert area east of Lancaster, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Hauser of Palmdale was driving north on 150th Street East, near Avenue 
J about 9:30 a.m. when her 1978 Jeep drifted onto the right shoulder, 
California Highway Patrol Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman turned sharply to the left to get back on the road, but the vehicle 
continued across the roadway to the opposite side and flipped over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeep's removable hardtop came off and Hauser was thrown out of the vehicle 
even though she was wearing a lap belt, the officer said. Her son, Kurt Hauser, 
was secured in a child seat and remained in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother and son were taken by helicopter to Antelope Valley Hospital, where 
Hauser died at 11:07 a.m., Siordia said. Her son was treated for bruises and 
scrapes but was not seriously injured, the officer said.

SONY TAKES A $2.7-BILLION HIT ON STUDIOS; HOLLYWOOD: FIRM CALLS WRITE-OFF A 
NECESSARY MOVE, BUT SOME OBSERVERS SAY IT'S A CRUSHING BLOW THAT MIGHT FORETELL 
SALE OF THE STUDIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After five years of defending its costly foray into Hollywood, electronics 
giant Sony Corp. announced Thursday that it has taken a staggering $2.7-billion 
write-off on Sony Pictures Entertainment, on top of a $510-million operating 
loss on the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The news, which amounted to the Japanese version of a mea culpa , shook the 
entertainment industry and raised new questions about Sony's long-range 
commitment to Hollywood. Although some analysts saw it as a necessary move to 
clean up the company's books and curtail future losses, other analysts called 
the announcement a crushing symbolic blow that might foretell a bid to sell the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures is the parent of Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures. After 
producing hits such as "The Prince of Tides," it has been plagued by failures 
such as the infamous "Last Action Hero." Its most recent box office 
disappointment is "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony, disclosing the write-off in its regular quarterly financial report, 
blamed it on slower than expected growth and higher than expected costs of 
running the studio. The Japanese corporate powerhouse refused to elaborate on 
its formal announcement, but said that absorbing the losses will improve its 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't do it once and for all now, we would continue to face losses on 
our entertainment business," Executive Deputy President Tsunao Hashimoto said 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The write-off was included as part of a change in accounting methods. Sony 
reported that its loss for the six months ended Sept. 30 was $3.1 billion on a 
consolidated basis, compared with a profit of $578 million for the same period 
a year before. Despite the fierce financial blow it absorbed, Sony said it 
expects to report full-year profits next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the company said other actions could follow the announcement. 
One unconfirmed report had Sony conducting a Tokyo-based investigation of 
accounting practices at the studio, which has been known for spending lavishly 
on everything from executive contracts to the renovation of its Culver City 
studio facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have these kinds of losses, they have to investigate," one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sony of America denied that there is an investigation. One executive said 
the parent company's routine request for financial documents may have touched 
off unfounded fears of an inquest. 
</P>
<P>
 In its formal announcement Thursday, Sony blamed the $510-million studio 
operating loss on "a combination of unusual items, such as abandoning a large 
number of (unidentified) projects in development and providing for settlement 
of outstanding lawsuits and contract claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Those claims are said to include the contract buyout of former Sony Chairman 
Peter Guber, who left two months ago. Sony is also believed to have recently 
paid more than $100 million in executive bonus pool compensation to Guber and 
his former co-chairman, Jon Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although entertainment analysts such as David Londoner of Wertheim Schroder in 
New York defended the write-down under the circumstances as a common-sense 
business move, the announcement added to an already cynical view of Sony's 
stewardship of the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind this write-off is the admission by Sony that the Columbia investment 
was a failure," Kunihiko Kawada, an analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd. in 
Tokyo, was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony became a major Hollywood player in 1989 with the purchase of what was 
then known as Columbia Pictures Entertainment. Other Japanese investors, 
including MCA/Universal owner Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., followed Sony 
into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the published price tag paid by Sony was $3.4 billion, analysts said 
debt and other considerations drove the actual cost to more than $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the social and political environment of the 1980s, Sony also came under 
criticism in some quarters for participating in what was perceived as a 
Japanese takeover of American business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sony replied that it was actually saving an American landmark that had 
fallen on hard times, and Guber and Peters followed through on that pledge by 
raising production at the studio to include such big-budget film projects as 
"Hook" and "The Prince of Tides." 
</P>
<P>
 The early momentum faded after Peters left in a dispute with the Japanese and 
a steady succession of movies failed, climaxing with last summer's "Last Action 
Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 In its limited breakout of entertainment figures, Sony reported that motion 
picture revenue declined 13.7% for the six months ended Sept. 30. The music 
group was up 6.6% and is said to be reporting record profits, thanks to 
releases such as the "Forrest Gump" soundtrack. Sony noted in its report that 
the dollar's devaluation against the Japanese yen also depressed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures' combined market share is less than 11% so far this year, 
compared to more than 19% last year. Sources say the studio is also essentially 
living hand to mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The write-off prompted credit rating company Standard & Poor's to give notice 
that it might downgrade its current "single A" debt rating of Sony. Meanwhile, 
Merrill Lynch & Co. downgraded its recommendation for Sony shares traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange to "sell" from "neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's American shares tumbled $3.25, to $55.25. Its share price plunged in 
heavy Tokyo trading this morning, dropping 8.1% on volume of 2.6 million 
shares. The market's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average also took a hit, falling 
137.33 points, or 0.71%. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's news puts added pressure on Sony of America President Michael P. 
Schulhof to turn the business around. Schulhof has come under criticism for 
presiding over continuing entertainment losses. Some observers contend that his 
job is in jeopardy, but Schulhof's defenders say he is already taking steps to 
improve entertainment results. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year he named Jeffrey Sagansky, who led CBS to the ratings crown, 
as his second in command. Sagansky is said to be pursuing strategic 
partnerships and financing deals for the company. Schulhof also put Sony 
Pictures President Alan J. Levine in control of the studio after Guber's 
departure. Levine and motion picture chief Mark Canton have since moved to step 
up production and shore up morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony has also pared its thick management ranks, partly by consolidating the 
distribution and marketing functions at Columbia and TriStar. Schulhof, in a 
prepared statement, said the write-off was another step in the restructuring 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "That strategic analysis has already led to a number of steps designed to 
strengthen management and realign operations," he said, adding that "Sony's 
enthusiasm and commitment to its motion picture, television and video business 
is undiminished."

TOBACCO INDUSTRY LIGHTS UP AT MENTION OF CHINA MARKET; CIGARETTES: NATION HAS 
MORE SMOKERS THAN U.S. HAS RESIDENTS. BUT STATE KEEPS MUCH OF THE TRADE FOR 
ITSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Viewed from the embattled perspective of the American tobacco industry, the 
People's Republic of China is a pipe dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's most populous country is already hooked on cigarettes. More people 
-- 300 million -- smoke in China than live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of teen-age and adult males smoke. Although the percentage of 
female smokers is only one-ninth as great, smoking among women in high schools 
and universities is on the rise, indicating that a traditional cultural 
aversion is giving way. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of young women are smoking to show that they are not the same old 
traditional 'gal,' " said Tinne Loh, a Singapore native who recently graduated 
from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic cigarette manufacturers command the vast bulk of China's huge market 
-- and probably will continue to, given import restrictions and lower prices 
for Chinese-made smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of public image, Western brands -- and especially American ones 
-- are making dramatic inroads in China today. The Marlboro man rides high: His 
rugged form is featured on a billboard in Shanghai's famous Bund central 
business district. In Wuhan, industrial capital of Hubei province, he rides 
herd atop the central post office. 
</P>
<P>
 To try to snuff out the pervasive advertising campaigns by overseas brands, 
the National People's Congress passed a law late last month banning all forms 
of tobacco advertising -- domestic and foreign -- effective Feb. 1. But similar 
attempts to limit tobacco promotion have met with failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts point out that the Beijing central government is too 
dependent on sales by the state-owned tobacco monopoly and taxes on cigarettes 
to mount an effective anti-smoking campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes on popular domestic brands such as Double Happiness and Gaoli (High 
Happiness) are the government's biggest single source of revenue, generating 
about $5.26 billion in 1993. Cigarettes are also the largest-selling retail 
product in China, accounting for more than $24 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although imports of American and other foreign cigarettes are extremely 
limited, totaling less than 2% of the market, the well-financed, sophisticated 
American ad campaigns have helped increase the market for China's own brands. 
</P>
<P>
 China's tobacco industry, in this respect, is indebted to overseas marketing 
experts for its steady annual growth. The glossy pages of a recent issue of a 
magazine published by the China National Tobacco Corp., the state monopoly, 
featured more than a dozen full-page ads by American and foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to their smoky allure here, American cigarettes carry a social and 
political message that speaks of luxury, freedom and modernity. 
</P>
<P>
 During the massive 1989 student demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square, for example, the unofficial cigarette of protest was Marlboro, 
manufactured by America's Philip Morris Co. 
</P>
<P>
 For today's more business-minded students, American cigarettes are a sign of 
having arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "For young people, even younger than me, smoking American cigarettes is a kind 
of a glory," said Lu Haiqing, 25, a municipal government cultural officer in 
Shanghai. "It's a way of showing off your wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps for that reason, foreign business people find American cigarettes a 
perfect bribe when seeking small favors.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here 10 years ago, I could get almost anything I wanted for 
a pack of American cigarettes," said an American garment exporter, a nonsmoker 
himself. "Now the ante has moved up to a carton." 
</P>
<P>
 Many young artists and musicians recently have switched to Camels as the 
cigarette of choice, reports Loh, a heavy smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the recent legislation by the National People's Congress, Chinese 
government anti-tobacco efforts were practically nonexistent. Anti-smoking laws 
that do exist are loosely enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fletcher, manager of general affairs in Hong Kong for the British firm 
Rothmans International, said each province decides how to apply Beijing's 
limits on tobacco advertising. Revenue-hungry local television and radio 
stations, he said, can be persuaded to overlook restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy is written in Beijing and loosely interpreted at the provincial 
level," Fletcher said. "There are a few inconsistencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Local interpretations of the rules sometimes are colored, he noted, by the 
fact that many state governments own advertising agencies that would profit by 
placing ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cigarette companies are just riding rings around the regulations," said 
Judith Mackay, a British physician in Hong Kong who advises Asian governments 
on anti-smoking legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members at the Chinese Assn. on Smoking and Health, the 
government-sponsored anti-smoking organization in Beijing, complain that it is 
difficult to find volunteers for their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The immensity of China's market, plus the hostility of shrinking markets back 
home, have caused the American and European tobacco industries to sink millions 
of dollars into advertising and other product promotions on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Hong Kong-based Survey Research Group, the main foreign 
brands -- Marlboro, Parliament, Kent, 555 State Express (a British brand) and 
Mild Seven (a Japanese brand) -- spent $2.5 million on TV advertising in 1993. 
Marlboro is among the nation's most advertised foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
 Salem sponsors the annual Beijing tennis tournament. The British-American 
Tobacco Co.'s 555 brand sponsors the popular Hong Kong-Beijing Rally car race. 
</P>
<P>
 The most aggressive of the international marketers, 555 sprinkles product 
placements in popular national TV shows, including last year's hit series "A 
Beijinger in New York." For location scenes in that series, the company shipped 
ashtrays and other product-labeled decorations to New York to be used in 
backdrops. The 555 brand is not marketed in America. 
</P>
<P>
 No age group is out of bounds. To promote the Hong Kong-Beijing Rally, free 
tickets to a rally associated with the event -- each ticket emblazoned with the 
555 logo -- were distributed in Beijing elementary schoolyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Shanghai -- China's prosperous industrial center -- billboards 
advertising Kent, Salem and Marlboro cigarettes adorn the city skyline. 
Marlboro and Kent each sponsor popular music programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese cigarette market offers immense opportunities," Philip Morris 
said in its latest annual report. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for a variety of reasons, including the strength and vitality of the 
indigenous tobacco industry, the Chinese market may not be the gold mine the 
tobacco industry seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily self-sufficient in tobacco production, China severely restricts 
imports, set this year at 1% of overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
 And Beijing imposes prohibitive duties on those cigarettes that are imported. 
In January, the Chinese government raised the tax on imported cigarettes from 
175% to 430%, all but halting imports. Shipments are expected to resume by 
year's end under a memorandum of understanding between the Chinese and U.S. 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets of most major Chinese cities, American and European cigarettes 
-- a significant number of them smuggled into the country -- sell for the 
equivalent of $1.25 a pack. That is cheap by American standards. But incomes in 
China are low. And good-quality Chinese cigarettes sell for 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that, although foreign cigarettes have a high-profile posture in 
the major cities and ports, they account for a minute share of the overall 
market. Given the price differential and differences in taste, most Chinese 
prefer to smoke homemade brands. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exhaustive recent study of the mainland Chinese consumer market, 
DRI/McGraw-Hill projected that the domestic-brand market will top $48 billion 
by the year 2003, based on the current 18% annual growth in cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is no compelling reason for China to cede a significant portion 
of the market to foreign products. According to the China National Tobacco 
Corp., 10 million Chinese households are involved in tobacco production. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a toehold in the huge market, several foreign companies have entered 
into joint-production agreements with Chinese partners. Rothmans operates a 
joint venture in China's Shandong province that uses 60% Chinese tobacco in its 
cigarettes. In August, 1993, Philip Morris signed a cooperative agreement with 
the China National Tobacco Corp. to produce Marlboros in Shanghai and Ningbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a two-way street," explained Philip Morris corporate affairs director 
Donald Harris. "We're using their production facilities, and they are working 
with us on learning technical things." 
</P>
<P>
 The DRI/McGraw-Hill researchers suggested that such joint-venture agreements 
could pay off for foreign manufacturers. In general, though, the prospects for 
foreign tobacco products in China are not bright, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "While China's cigarette market is enormous and expected to continue to grow, 
we believe it represents a limited opportunity for foreign manufacturers," the 
report says.

MACY PLANS TO PHASE OUT MAGNIN CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co. will announce plans today to phase out the 118-year-old I. 
Magnin chain by putting eight of the 12 I. Magnin stores up for sale and 
establishing different specialty stores at the remaining sites. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin stores will continue to operate for now. However, if Macy is unable 
to find a buyer for the eight stores, the New York-based retailer is expected 
to close these locations before it emerges from bankruptcy reorganization in 
late December as part of a planned merger with Federated Department Stores, 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy will disclose the four stores it will retain when it unveils its sales 
and conversion plan for I. Magnin today. A list of four stores has been drawn 
up, but executives Thursday were still considering changing some of the 
selections on that list, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin, an upscale specialty apparel retailer headquartered in San 
Francisco, has one store in Phoenix and 11 stores in California. The California 
sites are in Beverly Hills, Woodland Hills, Newport Beach, Palos Verdes, 
Pasadena, San Diego, Palm Desert, Walnut Creek, Palo Alto, Carmel and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The phaseout of I. Magnin would mark the final chapter in one of California's 
oldest retailing sagas. The company was founded in 1876 by Mary Ann Magnin, an 
accomplished seamstress who began modestly by designing and making clothing for 
individual customers in San Francisco. She named the company after her husband, 
Isaac, who was not involved in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 A likely scenario, sources said, is that the four stores Macy retains will be 
converted into either Macy's Men's stores or men's stores in the Bullock's 
chain, which Macy owns. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation that Macy would shut down or sell part of the 
financially troubled I. Magnin chain and convert some of the remaining stores 
into Bloomingdale's, a chain operated by Federated. However, some industry 
analysts said the I. Magnin sites are too small to operate as Bloomingdale's 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Macy has been expanding its Bullock's Men's and Macy's Men's 
stores, and the size of I. Magnin stores is suitable for such a conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy has been quietly holding discussions with possible buyers of eight sites. 
Jacobson Stores Inc., a specialty apparel retailer based in Jackson, Mich., and 
the St. Louis-based May Department Stores, operator of the Robinsons-May 
department store chain, are among the companies that have taken part in such 
discussions, sources said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials from those two retail companies could not be reached for comment. 
May Department Stores operates Lord & Taylor, a chain that may want to 
establish itself at some I. Magnin sites. Jacobson may also want to establish 
some of its stores at I. Magnin sites.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Macy plans to abandon I. Magnin as a store format, it will retain and 
expand the profitable I. Magnin catalogue business. By doing so, Macy can also 
use the expertise and labor of catalogue division personnel to help launch and 
operate a television shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy announced last year that it had forged a partnership with Don Hewitt, 
producer of CBS' "60 Minutes" program, to develop a cable shopping channel. 
Like catalogue operators, television shopping enterprises take orders and 
deliver merchandise by mail. Federated has indicated that work on the shopping 
network will continue after it merges with Macy.  
</P>
<P>
 The impending merger of Federated and Macy -- a deal approved in August by the 
companies' two boards -- may have marked the beginning of the end for I. 
Magnin. The retailer has been hobbled in recent years by the weak California 
economy, flagging nationwide demand for apparel and fierce retail competition, 
and there was speculation that the chain would be closed or sold before the 
Federated-Macy merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation increased after Federated successfully wooed Macy because the 
combined company is expected to consolidate or close inefficient or 
unprofitable operations. Macy does not release the earnings of its separate 
units, but some industry analysts have said that I. Magnin has been 
unprofitable in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 The venerable department store company was known almost from the beginning as 
a favorite place for upscale shoppers. I. Magnin stores in San Francisco were 
the first retail businesses in the city to be furnished with fine cabinetwork, 
elegant showcases and gilded mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin began to sell ready-to-wear clothing in 1909. The company grew 
rapidly in the early 1900s, opening branch shops in exclusive hotels in Santa 
Barbara, Del Monte, Coronado and Pasadena, and then full-line stores along the 
California coast during the go-go retail explosion of the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, I. Magnin and Bullock's merged as a corporation. I. Magnin and 
Bullock's were acquired by the Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores in 
1964. In 1988, Macy acquired Magnin and Bullock's from Federated, only to 
eventually strike a deal to merge with that company.

HORMONE THERAPY CAN CUT WOMEN'S HEART DISEASE RISK; HEALTH: STUDY SHOWS UP TO 
25% DROP, DEPENDING ON POST-MENOPAUSE REGIMEN. TAILORED TREATMENT IS SEEN AS 
KEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Post-menopausal women can significantly lower their risk of heart disease by 
taking hormone therapy, according to a highly anticipated study released 
Thursday at the American Heart Assn. meeting in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Post-Menopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) study is the first 
to monitor how various hormone regimens affect key cardiovascular risk factors. 
The results should help women and their doctors better determine the risks and 
benefits of hormone replacement therapy, which has long been a complicated and 
widely debated issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year study of 875 healthy women showed that those taking any one of 
four hormone regimens experienced an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
or good cholesterol -- which reduced their risk of heart disease by 12% to 25%, 
depending on which regimen they followed. 
</P>
<P>
 All four treatments also caused a drop in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or 
bad cholesterol, compared to a placebo group. Hormone therapy also triggered a 
decrease in fibrinogen, a blood-clotting factor that usually increases with age 
and is strongly associated with strokes and heart attacks. There was no effect 
on blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The hormone did not increase the risk of breast cancer, as some had suggested 
it might, although experts say the study did not last long enough to draw any 
definitive conclusions about this risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results of this landmark study provide the best available guide for 
post-menopausal women and their physicians as they seek safe hormonal regimens 
that will improve their heart disease risk factors," said Dr. Claude Lenfant, 
director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which sponsored the 
study at seven research centers throughout the country, including UC San Diego 
and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural sex hormones apparently help protect women against heart disease 
before age 50. But after menopause, when hormone production ceases, the rate of 
heart disease in women climbs quickly and eventually equals the rate in men. 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in American women. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier studies of women who had experienced heart attacks and those who had 
not found that those taking hormones had up to 50% lower risk. The new study 
was the first to measure heart disease risk factors in a large group of women 
from the time they started hormone therapy. "The PEPI results are a significant 
step forward in our understanding of hormonal therapy and its effects on HDL 
cholesterol, fibrinogen and other factors which affect a woman's risk of heart 
disease," Lenfant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, ages 45 to 64, were randomly assigned to one of five groups: a 
placebo, daily estrogen alone, daily estrogen plus a daily synthetic progestin, 
daily estrogen plus a synthetic progestin taken 12 days per month or daily 
estrogen combined with natural progesterone taken 12 days a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The results indicated that hormone therapy, when tailored to the individual, 
can indeed protect against heart disease without boosting the risk of cancer or 
other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies have shown that estrogen alone promotes the growth of uterine 
tissue, called the endometrium, which can lead to cancer. But when progestin is 
added to the regimen, the risk of endometrial cancer vanishes, so physicians 
typically prescribe progestin for part of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But other studies have indicated that progestin may erase part or all of the 
cardiovascular benefits of estrogen and may also increase the risk of breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knew how much progestin would diminish the protective effect," said 
Suzanne Oparil, president of the American Heart Assn. "Some studies showed it 
would completely diminish the positive effect, others not at all. (PEPI) shows 
the truth is somewhat in between." 
</P>
<P>
 Women taking estrogen alone or the combination of estrogen and natural 
progesterone -- a new form called micronized progesterone -- had the most 
favorable cholesterol benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 However, PEPI also showed that women who have not had a hysterectomy -- 
surgery to remove the uterus -- probably should not take estrogen alone. 
One-third of the women on estrogen alone experienced severe precancerous 
endometrial changes and had to drop out of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "These results provide the strongest evidence to date that estrogen alone 
produces the best effect on HDL cholesterol. However, the high rate of 
potentially harmful endometrial changes makes combination hormone therapy 
advisable for most women with a uterus," said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a 
UC San Diego researcher who helped direct the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Women with a uterus who opt for estrogen alone should undergo regular biopsies 
to detect cancer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recommended regimen would be: If you have a uterus, estrogen plus some 
progesterone; natural progesterone appears to be better. For women without a 
uterus, estrogen (alone)," Oparil said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another positive finding, test subjects showed no increased risk of breast 
cancer. Previous studies have indicated a possible link between breast cancer 
and hormones. But the study is too short for the breast cancer finding to carry 
much significance, Oparil said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need long-term follow-up to determine the breast cancer risk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women were also studied for the effects of hormones on osteoporosis, but 
those findings were not released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer studies, such as the 15-year Women's Health Initiative, will provide a 
more definitive picture of all the risks and benefits of hormones, Lenfant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must wait for the results of large clinical trials such as the Women's 
Health Initiative to determine whether increasing HDL ultimately reduces a 
woman's chance of developing or dying from heart disease," he said.

BONE YIELDS DINOSAUR DNA, SCIENTISTS BELIEVE; PALEONTOLOGY: EXPERTS CALL IT A 
HISTORIC FIRST. BUT SKEPTICS SAY IT MIGHT BE FROM BACTERIAL DECAY INSTEAD.

 In bones recovered from a cave-in at a coal mine, scientists in Utah have 
discovered the genes of what they believe is a dinosaur that lived 80 million 
years ago -- an important step in the search for the chemical blueprints of 
awesome animals that today live on only in the popular imagination.  
</P>
<P>
 The genetic material is the first to be extracted directly from such ancient 
bones, researchers at Brigham Young University announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that we have a DNA sequence that belongs to a Cretaceous 
period bone fragment. Based on the circumstantial evidence, we believe it is a 
dinosaur," said microbiologist Scott Woodward, who led the group. "This is 
something that hasn't been seen for 80 million years." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, many scientists were certain that if such ancient molecules of 
DNA could be preserved, they would be found in amber -- an idea that inspired 
Michael Crichton's best-selling 1990 novel, "Jurassic Park."  
</P>
<P>
 But the new finding, published today in the journal Science, means that 
scientists who hope to study the evolution of dinosaurs may be able to extract 
genetic material directly from remains of the extinct beasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery is the latest advance in an unusual big game hunt for creatures 
that could weigh more than a herd of African elephants or top a four-story 
building. Biologists such as Woodward and paleontologists who usually collect 
fragments of fossilized femurs are now poring over laboratory gels in search of 
the molecular construction kit for the denizens that once dominated Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The discoveries are coming at a rapid pace. In research that has not yet been 
published, a second group of scientists in Montana has extracted genetic 
material from an unusually complete and well-preserved skeleton of a six-ton 
Tyrannosaurus rex discovered in 1990. "We have done it three times," said 
dinosaur expert Jack Horner at Montana State and the Museum of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that ours is 65 million years old. We do have sequences, but it is 
still unclear whether it belongs to the dinosaur or some fungus or some 
bacteria or something else."  
</P>
<P>
 Some experts are skeptical and suggest that the ancient DNA reconstructed by 
Woodward's team may belong to ancient bacteria that flourished on the beast's 
decaying bones.  
</P>
<P>
 "The jury is still out," said microbiologist Raul J. Cano at Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, who has recovered genetic material from ancient insects trapped in 
amber 135 million years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably the oldest putative ancient DNA sequence from bone," Cano said 
of the new research, "but that is a long way from saying that it is a dinosaur. 
When you are sequencing material from a bone, you don't know whether you are 
sequencing the bone itself or microorganisms that may have colonized it. 
</P>
<P>
 "To find any DNA at all in such ancient bone is remarkable, but we still don't 
have a verified dinosaur sequence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward and his colleagues say they can make a strong case that they have 
discovered dinosaur DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scientists have successfully teased DNA from insects cast in amber 
and even 8,000-year-old human brains, researchers had until now believed that 
the complex molecules were too fragile to survive in dinosaur bones for so many 
millions of years. In the normal process of fossilization, any organic material 
in bone is replaced by minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward's bone chips were an exception. He said the dinosaur apparently died 
in a bog on the shores of an ancient inland sea and was quickly covered by 
peat. The geologic forces that compressed the peat into beds of coal also 
preserved the organic material in the delicate bones.  
</P>
<P>
 After two years of effort and thousands of attempts to extract DNA from the 
bone fragments, Woodward and his group were able to get nine genetic sequences 
-- none of which were precisely identical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only when we put them all down together did the pattern emerge which in a 
roundabout way says we have ancient DNA," Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are eager to discover and decipher dinosaur DNA because they hope 
to better understand how the creatures evolved. Genetic analysis would help 
settle a controversy over whether modern birds are descended from the 
dinosaurs, as some paleontologists theorize.  
</P>
<P>
 The DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, obtained from the bone is a fragment of one 
gene in what is called the mitochondria of a cell. Mitochondria carry on the 
cell's metabolism and respiration. The genes they contain pass from mother to 
offspring and change at a specific rate from generation to generation, which 
allows researchers to use them as a kind of clock to gauge the pace of 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 When compared to computerized databanks of modern species, the sequences were 
dramatically different from the genes of any living animal -- so different, in 
fact, that Woodward believes most dinosaurs will not fit into modern animal 
groups. That would mean that no creature living today is descended directly 
from the dinosaurs. The ancient DNA was equally distant from modern birds, 
reptiles or mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Is science on the verge of a real-life Jurassic Park? Certainly not, experts 
say.  
</P>
<P>
 Even when more complete sequences are discovered, it is extremely unlikely 
that biologists could ever use the ancient genes to resurrect an extinct 
species of dinosaur. Even if researchers could accumulate enough genetic 
material -- billions of properly ordered DNA units for a single organism -- the 
technology does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montana group has refrained from publishing its work because, like 
Woodward, they cannot yet say with certainty that the ancient DNA they have 
isolated belongs to a dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who have extracted DNA from dinosaur bones," said 
Horner, who is supervising a group that has extracted DNA from the remains of 
one of the most spectacular carnivores that ever lived -- a Tyrannosaurus rex.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in a race," Horner said. "I refuse to be involved in something 
like that. Until we can demonstrate we have DNA from a dinosaur, none of us 
want to publish anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Woodward said, "I am saying we have found it. We felt it was time to come 
out and say it is possible to recover DNA from bone."

GINGRICH ASKED TO NOT REDUCE STATE'S CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Republican House members from California, disturbed that the state's 
traditional clout could be undermined in the GOP takeover of Capitol Hill, 
Thursday appealed to incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to make sure that 
their influence is not diminished in the 104th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hastily arranged meeting Thursday, California Republicans fretted among 
themselves about plans to deny Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) the 
chairmanship of either of two committees for which he appeared to be in line, 
according to one of the participants. Also sparking concern is a proposed new 
system of apportioning committee assignments that could concentrate more power 
in Gingrich's hands and weaken California lawmakers' claims on plum committee 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich sought quickly to blunt those concerns Thursday night as he met in 
Washington with Gov. Pete Wilson. Gingrich said he promised the California 
governor that he would "do all I can within the framework of my office to be 
helpful to California . . . on a wide range of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's GOP delegation anticipates at least one significant gain when 
Republicans take control of Congress for the first time in 40 years: Rep. 
Duncan Hunter (R-San Diego) is expected to be elevated to one of a few senior 
leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like -- with the exception of Hunter in the leadership -- most of 
our leadership is from the Mississippi (River) east," said Rep. Randy (Duke) 
Cunningham (R-San Diego). "And that concerns us." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham added that he and other California Republicans would ask Gingrich 
"to consider that, since we're losing some of that prestige," at least one and 
maybe two Californians win seats on a key panel that dispenses committee 
assignments. He added that Gingrich could compensate the delegation for its 
loss of Moorhead's chairmanship by naming a Californian to a deputy whip 
position, a relatively low-ranking leadership slot. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday evening, Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said that several 
California lawmakers had brought their concerns to the incoming Speaker. "I 
think in the end California is going to be dramatically well-represented," 
Blankley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in the nation's capital on his way to the Republican Governors 
Conference in Virginia this weekend, indicated that he was seeking assurances 
that the new GOP-controlled Congress would relieve California and other states 
of the burden of complying with "unfunded mandates" -- federal directives for 
which Congress appropriates no federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on assurances that Gingrich and other GOP leaders have given him, Wilson 
said, he expects Congress to "have more sympathy for our position." But it 
remains unclear, he added, whether Congress will pay for the implementation of 
such directives or withdraw the mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 On another matter of special concern to California, Gingrich said after his 
meeting with Wilson that he had asked the governor to take the lead, along with 
governors of other border states, in proposing an effective plan for the 
federal government to seal off their borders to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a federal duty to protect the borders, it is a federal duty to deport 
those who are here illegally, and it is a federal duty to bear any costs that 
are required for those that are here," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Moorhead's apparent ouster from an expected chairman's berth prompted 
worries among some California Republicans, the 72-year-old Glendale native 
appeared to be taking the political blow in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you're chosen to carry the ball; sometimes you're chosen to block 
for those who are given the ball," Moorhead said after being passed over for 
the chairmanships of both the Judiciary and the Energy and Commerce committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich named Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) to head Energy and Commerce 
and Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) to head Judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that I'm not mean enough," Moorhead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead is expected to chair the judiciary subcommittee on intellectual 
property. "That is very important to our area because of all our 
(entertainment) industries that depend on patents and trademarks," said 
Moorhead, dean of California House Republicans who was first elected in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 More subtle than the apparent passing over of Moorhead are changes that would 
loosen California lawmakers' historic grip on sought-after committee 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, at least one seat on the Committee on Committees, which parcels 
out committee assignments to House members, has been reserved for a 
Californian. As a result, California lawmakers have been assured consistent 
membership on committees with key constituencies in the state. Under several 
proposals for reorganization, California's assured seat could be abolished in 
favor of a process that would expand Gingrich's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gingrich is trying desperately to keep the Republicans in lock-step, which he 
has to (do), given that they have a very small margin," said Pam Gilbert of the 
citizens watchdog group Congress Watch. "To get the kinds of controversial 
legislation through that the House Republicans have offered, they need a very 
cohesive group of Republicans. And that generally means doctrinaire, partisan 
chairmen to lead the charge." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), who has emerged as one of Gingrich's 
inner circle of advisers, said Thursday that Moorhead's humiliation should not 
be construed as a diminution of California Republicans' influence in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Other committee chairmanship appointments made by the incoming Speaker: Rep. 
Robert L. Livingston (R-La.) to be acting head of Appropriations until bribery 
charges are resolved against Rep. Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.); Rep. Benjamin A. 
Gilman (R-N.Y.) to Foreign Affairs; Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) to Banking, Finance 
and Urban Affairs; Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Pa.) to Education and Labor; Rep. 
Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) to Rules. All of the appointments must be ratified 
by the GOP caucus, but easy approval is expected.

GOP PUSHES FOR LOCAL CONTROL OF SCHOOL PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leading Republican proposal to restore "voluntary prayer" in public 
schools would let local school authorities require the saying of a prayer at 
the beginning of each class day. Students who do not wish to participate could 
sit silently or leave the room, the measure's prime House sponsor says. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would not make prayer mandatory, nor would state or federal 
governments be entitled to compose an official school prayer. However, its 
sponsors said that local school officials would have wide latitude to encourage 
and institute school prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let local school boards make the decision," said Rep. Ernest 
Istook Jr. (R-Okla.), who has introduced a proposed constitutional amendment on 
school prayer. "It does not require that prayers be held. But why should an 
ACLU attorney from New York City tell the people in Chandler, Okla., that they 
cannot have prayer in the public schools? That's the essence of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Istook and other sponsors declined to spell out exactly how the system they 
envision would work in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, it is not clear whether school boards might be permitted to 
adopt a prayer or several prayers -- The Lord's Prayer or a Psalm -- to be used 
throughout a school system. Another possibility would allow individual teachers 
or even students to choose the prayer for their classroom or school, perhaps 
rotating among a group. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the new Republican proposal has prompted sharp dispute over 
how to define voluntary prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly when (President) Clinton speaks about voluntary prayer, he means 
something quite different from (House Speaker-to-be Newt) Gingrich and Istook," 
said Elliot Mincberg, legal director for People for the American Way, a liberal 
group that opposes school-sponsored prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, turned a new spotlight on the 
school prayer issue when he said he would seek a vote "before the July 4 break" 
on the proposed amendment introduced by Istook. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the proposal in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Tuesday, Clinton said: 
"I'll be glad to discuss it with them. I want to see what the details are. . . 
. It depends on what it says." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks were interpreted by some, especially those opposed to school 
prayer, as moving further toward the Republican position than his words 
explicitly said. On Thursday, the White House emphasized that the President's 
position is essentially the same it has been for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would favor a new law that ensures students have a right to observe "a 
moment of silence" at their desks. "The President has long supported a moment 
of silence, but that can be done (by statute)," said Deputy White House Counsel 
Joel Klein. "He doesn't see the need for a constitutional amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the proposed amendment is by no means limited to the 
Administration and liberal groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Two leaders of Christian organizations said Thursday that they oppose the 
proposed amendment as it is now drawn because it would give local governments 
too much power over prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the government sponsors prayer, that's not good news for religion," said 
Steven McFarland, director of the Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and 
Religious Freedom. "What do you do if you're in Utah and 98% of the class is 
Mormon and you are a Jew or a Catholic or a fundamentalist Christian? It's 
dangerous for religious freedom because there is an element of coercion 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said he is also 
concerned about government sponsorship of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are completely opposed to any prayer that would be composed by, directed 
by or supervised by the government," Reed said. "We support non-sectarian, 
student-initiated prayer that is voluntary. That is a free-speech issue, not a 
religion issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment, introduced by Istook with 44 co-sponsors, says: "Nothing in 
this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in 
public schools or other public institutions. No person shall be required by the 
United States or by any state to participate in prayer. Neither the United 
States nor any state shall compose the words of any prayer to be said in public 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate, and three-fourths of the 
state legislatures, the amendment would reverse a series of Supreme Court 
rulings that since 1962 have barred officially sponsored school prayers. 
Presumably, because of the phrase, "other public institutions," it would also 
allow official prayers in government offices, prisons and courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only restriction that I see (in the Republican proposal) is that the 
school board or the teacher can't write the prayer. But it would allow them to 
select a prayer," Mincberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, at the height of his popularity, then-President Ronald Reagan 
pressed the Senate to approve an identically worded amendment, but it fell 11 
votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority. At the time, many senators 
said they decided to oppose the amendment when 50 prominent church 
organizations, representing Protestants, Catholics and Jews, announced their 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "no" votes then were seven Republicans who will return to Capitol 
Hill in January. They are Sens. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, William S. 
Cohen of Maine, Slade Gorton of Washington, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Nancy 
Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, Bob Packwood of Oregon and Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after the prayer amendment failed in 1984, Congress passed the 
Equal Access Act, which gives secondary-school students the right to pray 
together or read the Bible on campus before class, during lunch or after 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you want genuine, unencumbered prayer by students, it is already 
guaranteed under the Equal Access Act," McFarland said. "We don't need to mess 
with the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 But some conservative activists are saying they want to go further to allow 
prayer in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "A voluntary moment of silence is not sufficient," said Gary Bauer, executive 
director of the Family Research Council here and a former adviser in the Reagan 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Reed said they want to press a constitutional amendment that would 
clear the way for students to lead group prayers in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't worked out the details yet, but we want to build something that 
will have the widest possible support," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Istook said he is confident that the prayer amendment will win a two-thirds 
majority in the House. He noted that opinion polls consistently show that about 
three-fourths of respondents say they favor school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new Congress will reflect that strong majority viewpoint," he 
said. "School prayer was commonplace for a couple hundred years -- until the 
'60s. I just don't think most Americans want the Constitution being used as a 
weapon against their values."

COLUMN ONE; BETTING ON A HIGH-TECH JACKPOT; NBC AND TCI ARE AMONG MEDIA GIANTS 
BANKROLLING A CONTROVERSIAL ENTREPRENEUR WHOSE INTERACTIVE TV IDEA MAY LEAD TO 
A BIG PAYDAY. BUT IS PLAYING LOTTO AT HOME WHAT THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY IS ALL 
ABOUT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The information highway is paved with good intentions. Interactive television, 
its promoters say, will allow users to shop and bank at home, earn college 
credits or obtain medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big payday for interactive television may be in helping viewers hit 
the jackpot -- literally. If proponents have their way, the family TV will turn 
into a living room slot machine, with the information highway leading to Las 
Vegas rather than the Global Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant media corporations, including Tele-Communications Inc. and NBC, are 
maneuvering to reap a multibillion-dollar windfall by backing a company that 
would pump off-track betting and the lottery into every one of the country's 93 
million TV homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as intriguing as the media giants' ambitions is the man they've selected 
as their pathway into American homes. TCI and NBC, along with Sprint and 
Motorola, are bankrolling a little-known entrepreneur named David Lockton who 
has spent $120 million over the last eight years trying to get an interactive 
TV system off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Lockton has been accused in lawsuits of staking a false claim 
to a patent, stealing trade secrets and betraying business partners. Lockton 
denies the charges and claims that he's been the one maligned by jealous 
rivals. To date, he has prevailed at every turn -- except in enlisting 
customers for the game system touted by his San Jose-based firm, Interactive 
Network Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 What's at stake? Lockton says the company is poised to become "the toll booth 
on the information highway." Detractors are skeptical of such boasts, but his 
backers believe Interactive Network represents the best possible technology 
until fully interactive TV is available early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 That confidence rests on the prospects for an obscure, relatively simple 
patent that, if Lockton and his investors are right, may be more valuable than 
the billions of dollars being poured into the hard wiring, computer software 
and programming innovations normally associated with the electronic 
communications revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent -- which Lockton claims he co-developed but a former partner has 
alleged he stole -- allows for the simultaneous transmission of interactive 
games among millions of players. Interactive Network says it has a five-year 
lead over any competitor; its system, the firm says, can accommodate 50 million 
users compared to the 10,000 limit under current cable and telephone company 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court in San Francisco upheld Interactive Network's claim to 
the patent last year. The case is on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A nation playing Lotto and Keno in the comfort of its living rooms may not be 
what Vice President Al Gore and lawmakers envision when they dream about the 
information highway. And a maze of state and federal regulations blocks the 
immediate spread of cyberspace gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 But some technology pioneers are betting that gaming will turn out to be the 
"killer application" consumers really want. With barriers to gambling rapidly 
tumbling, interactive TV -- originally conceived as the ultimate yuppie 
technology -- may end up catering to Joe Six-Pack instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Media analyst Paul Kagan, a longtime investor in Interactive Network, says the 
company has developed a fail-safe technology that prevents users "from scamming 
the system," one of the biggest worries when millions of players are 
registering their answers simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Kagan foresees, people will be able to compete for prizes anywhere -- 
in their cars, at bus stops, at the corner 7-Eleven, in stadiums and, most 
crucially, at home. Interactive Network's system will be the gaming connection 
of choice. He predicts: "This is the ultimate off-track betting device." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few have ridden the interactive bandwagon better than Lockton, whose two-way 
TV system lets viewers try to predict plays in sports programs or match wits 
with game shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Lockton, a onetime sports lawyer who represented O.J. Simpson and Evel Knievel 
and helped launch the Ontario Motor Speedway in the 1960s, has anointed himself 
as a leading advocate for the emerging interactive TV business. 
</P>
<P>
 He recruited the industry's premiere futurists, including Nicholas Negroponte 
of the MIT Media Lab, Apple Computer senior scientist Alan Kay and pollster 
Robert Teeter, to sit on a company advisory board. He's a regular on the trade 
show and interactive conference circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while it has been widely anticipated for more than a decade, interactive 
television is still an industry waiting to lift off the launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
 Media leaders such as TCI and Time Warner have tested it only in small trials; 
phone companies such as Bell Atlantic and US West are still years -- perhaps 
decades -- away from wide-scale rollouts of interactive services. The only 
major tests -- including the QUBE experiment in Columbus, Ohio, in the 1980s 
and GTE's five-year trial in Cerritos, for the most part were regarded by 
industry observers as costly duds. 
</P>
<P>
 To skeptics, Lockton's Interactive Network is further proof that the market 
for interactive television may be much smaller and less lucrative than many 
have supposed. The company, which once projected that it would have 4.8 million 
users by 1993, has only 5,000 customers playing along with game shows and 
predicting sports plays. Using the company's system, subscribers can interact 
with more than 40 programs, including "The Price is Right," "Jeopardy," 
"Murder, She Wrote" and NFL football.

<P>
 Indeed, if new research bears out, consumers may be less interested in touted 
interactive wonders like movies-on-demand and sports programs and more eager 
for such run-of-the-mill services as phone lists, electronic mail and tailored 
news reports. A recent poll by Lou Harris & Associates on behalf of the journal 
Privacy & American Business found that only 40% of consumers surveyed want to 
engage in interactive entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton, however, is an unrepentant believer in the value of his product and 
its consumer appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great big pot of gold for the one company that sets the broadcast 
communications protocol for simulcast, 'play along,' TV programming services," 
he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of upbeat rhetoric has helped Lockton keep Interactive Network alive 
when other companies long ago would have folded. In the seven years after he 
founded the firm, Lockton raised more than $80 million, mostly from stock sales 
and cash infusions from TCI and NBC. Recently, those corporate backers -- along 
with two other telecommunications titans, Motorola and Sprint -- pledged $42 
million more. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it began selling stock to the public in 1991, though, Interactive 
Network has generated only $2 million in revenues. The company has lurched from 
one cash injection to another, by its own acknowledgment often on the brink of 
bankruptcy before another bailout from its partners. Lockton owns 5% of the 
firm and has options on another 2% to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been at war with stock traders who have pounded down 
Interactive Network's share price, Lockton has demonstrated a deft touch when 
it comes to keeping his biggest investors on board. 
</P>
<P>
 While one reason they stick with him is the technological promise of the 
firm's system -- and the prospect, down the road, of a home-gambling gold mine 
-- another may be Lockton's well-honed salesmanship. Watching Lockton is "like 
watching a revivalist . . . " says Ron Kuhl, a former executive at the Young & 
Rubicam ad agency who worked on the Interactive Network account. "He was 
promising interactivity years in advance of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, after years of failing to meet marketing and financial targets, 
the company again delayed a national rollout of its interactive TV service, 
laid off 17% of its 275-member staff and, at the urging of its backers, shifted 
strategy to deliver its product through cable TV. Up to now, subscribers have 
used a laptop keyboard with a small screen that displays questions or other 
information needed to play along. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers attribute the shift to the influence of TCI, which believes that 
viewers want to interact with TV "on the screen" rather than having to 
awkwardly look back and forth from a hand-held unit to the set. The 
Denver-based cable TV company has invested close to $30 million in Interactive 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in plans also triggered the resignation of Peter S. Sealey, a 
highly regarded former marketing executive from Coca-Cola and Columbia Pictures 
who was brought in as president to jump-start the company's national rollout. 
With the marketing campaign delayed at least another year, Sealey says: "I 
would not be needed there." The company has no current plans to name a 
successor. 
</P>

 The son of a businessman who later fell on hard times -- his father once owned 
the company that made the popular after-shave West Indies Bay Rum -- Lockton 
grew up in Indianapolis, attended boarding school at Lawrenceville, N.J., and 
graduated from Yale University and the University of Virginia Law School.  
</P>
<P>
 "The genetics of risk-taking are overpowering," says Lockton, 57, explaining 
the impulse behind his participation in 14 companies over the course of his 
entrepreneurial career. His heroes, he says, are his father and Bobby Knight, 
the ill-tempered basketball coach at Indiana University. "For all his warts," 
he says of Knight, "I like what he stands for." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton returned to Indianapolis to practice law. The firm he worked for 
represented the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and Lockton fell in with the auto 
racing crowd, where he palled around with celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 His interest in motor sports led Lockton to the Ontario Motor Speedway, which 
he helped raise $25.5 million to build in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton was president of the company that operated the track for two years. 
The first race at Ontario drew record crowds, but the speedway quickly ran into 
financial trouble and closed in 1980. Lockton says the problems occurred after 
he resigned and were not because of his management. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor racing also was what brought Lockton to interactive television. Always 
scouting for new ideas, he had been looking for ways to automate a scoring and 
timing system for a "$1-a-lap" mini-race car business he owned. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution came by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Long Beach Grand Prix in the late 1970s he ran into Anthony Fascenda and 
others from a little Burlingame, Calif., firm called Dataspeed Timing. The men 
were clocking cars with radio devices as they buzzed around the track. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting drew Lockton into Dataspeed -- and, eventually, into the lengthy, 
bitter, legal brawl that left Interactive Network with the patent on which its 
business is based today. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his contacts on Wall Street and ability to raise financing, Lockton 
became Dataspeed's chief executive, running the company from 1980 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Dataspeed in the early 1980s that Lockton met brothers Patrick and 
Dan Downs, owners of Carlsbad, Calif.-based NTN Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 NTN had developed an interactive TV sports game called QB-1 that was played 
mostly in bars. And the brothers sought out Dataspeed for help solving certain 
"communications problems" with QB-1, as Fascenda described it in a June, 1992, 
letter to Dan Downs relating events that occurred years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataspeed had developed a device of its own, the QuoTrek, that delivered stock 
market information over the FM radio band. But "when (NTN) presented QB-1, I 
was very impressed with the concept, as was Lockton," Fascenda recalled in a 
deposition. He and Lockton "had no concept of anything like that," Fascenda 
said, adding that he was "astonished" when Lockton later wrote NTN that they 
"had discussed and invented such a game concept prior to (the Downs') visits to 
Dataspeed. This was simply untrue." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton remembers the events quite differently. He maintains that Fascenda was 
not present at meetings with other Dataspeed staffers in the early 1980s when 
Lockton "laid out the concept" for a similar interactive technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Dataspeed sought a patent on its technology. And when the foundering 
firm was sold to Lotus Development Corp. in 1985 for $6.5 million, Lockton 
bought the pending patent himself -- for $1 -- and used the technology to 
launch Interactive Network. 
</P>
<P>
 He was granted the patent the next year -- "an extremely happy day in my 
life," Lockton later recalled. In a deposition, he testified that he flew to 
Carlsbad to celebrate with the Downs brothers. They "met me with open arms -- 
took me out to dinner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next thing Lockton knew, the Downs brothers sued him, alleging that 
Lockton stole the concept for his interactive TV system from NTN. Fascenda 
supported their assertion, testifying that Lockton falsely claimed on the 
patent application that he was the co-inventor. 
</P>
<P>
 NTN and Lockton reached an out-of-court settlement in 1987, with the Downs 
brothers stipulating that they had infringed the patent themselves and that 
Interactive Network's two-way technology had been developed before and 
independent of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But NTN revived the litigation in 1992, claiming that QB-1 did not infringe 
the patent after all. A year later, U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen in San 
Francisco ruled in favor of Lockton and Interactive Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding NTN's claim that the patent was invalid because Lockton wrongfully 
named himself as a co-inventor, Jensen ruled that NTN "has failed to bring 
forth sufficient evidence to establish genuine issues of material facts in 
dispute." Rather than giving the Downs' claims a fresh review, Jensen relied on 
their earlier stipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Fascenda's deposition? "He lied," Lockton insists today, though 
Fascenda stands by his account. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the court outcome, Lockton's actions continue to rankle some of 
Dataspeed's former principals. Lockton "walked away with one of the patents 
from Dataspeed," claims Jim Ellis, a former Dataspeed shareholder. "He told 
Lotus it was worthless. Then he sold the rights to start Interactive Network. 
You give him enough rope and he'll hang himself one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton says he tried to get Lotus to pursue the technology, but that the 
company "was not interested in entertainment applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Great business empires have been founded on far less sturdy footings. And home 
gambling has only begun to be recognized over the last year or two as 
Interactive Network's potential trump card. But Lockton's ambitions for the 
firm's game system consistently have outstripped its performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In an offering memorandum prepared by Kidder Peabody & Co. in 1988 to raise 
capital through the sale of convertible stock, Interactive Network said that 
five years after launch it would have 4.8 million "active subscribers" and 
would have sold 6.5 million units. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm "conservatively" projected that 29 million users ages 18 to 54 with 
incomes of more than $40,000 were "very likely" for the company's sports 
programs and game shows. (By comparison, the most popular pay cable network, 
HBO, has 18 million subscribers.) Interactive Network projected pretax earnings 
of $344 million by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months later, the firm had dramatically scaled back its growth 
projections. According to presentation materials from a September, 1989, board 
meeting, the company hoped to sell 5,000 control units by June, 1990, including 
4,200 in Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet by June, 1992, Lockton's expectations had soared again. He proclaimed that 
"40% of American homes will have this device by the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave wanted to make sure investors wanted to invest," said Kevin Randolph, 
who headed marketing at Interactive Network until 1991, when he parted ways 
with Lockton over strategy. "To some extent you say what people want to hear. 
They wanted to hear this would be a big business soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lockton ran into a brick wall of indifference. While the so-called 
"early adopters" -- the users who quickly gobble up any new technology -- 
initially responded, securing long-term customers has proved much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating robust sales, Interactive Network ordered 50,000 control units at 
a cost of about $270 apiece. About 5,000 were disbursed to customers and 
another 4,000 were given away, but about 41,000 units still are stored in a 
Mountain View, Calif., warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton concluded he had no choice but to go into the "hardware business," 
because he had to establish the platform on which interactive games would be 
played. In addition, one former executive said, Lockton wanted the "large 
upfront revenue" that sales of the control units could generate. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the units were sold at a loss, Interactive Network never made money 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton now says the barrier to acceptance was forcing customers to spend 
roughly $200 for a control unit and then charging another $15 a month as a 
subscription fee, with the charges increasing for extra play of certain games. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Lockton says, Interactive Network has adopted a "service model" that 
builds the cost of the control unit into a $20 monthly subscription fee. In 
essence, Interactive Network has decided to style itself after cable TV, which 
embeds the cost of set-top decoder boxes into the monthly subscription charge. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and NBC view Interactive Network's technology as an "interim step" until 
upgraded cable and telephone lines can deliver the full range of interactive 
services around the year 2000. "Interactivity is going to be incremental, with 
game shows and sports leading the way," says Tom Rogers, an NBC executive vice 
president. Interactive Network, he says, will establish a customer base "before 
the world goes digital."  
</P>
<P>
 Kagan expects Interactive Network will need another $100 million before it 
builds a business beyond a few thousand customers. That -- and broader 
acceptance of the "killer application": gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and NBC don't advertise their long-term interest in the gaming business, 
although they occasionally have hinted where they think the big potential 
rests. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI Chief Executive John C. Malone, speaking at industry trade shows, has made 
no secret of his belief that the big winners for interactive television will be 
"games of skill for prizes" and "near-gambling"; laws, not technology, are the 
only barrier to full-scale gambling, he has observed. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Rogers, while acknowledging that Interactive Network's technology is 
applicable to lotteries and off-track betting, says the priority is to design a 
"prize system" that makes playing along with game shows rewarding and 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockton, the inveterate promoter, feels no compunction about disclosing 
his ambitions. He may finally have found his customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest surprise to me in the changing morals of our country over the 
last five years has been the collapse in the resistance to gambling," Lockton 
says. "I may personally deplore it, but I'm running a public company here." How 
Interactive Network Operates 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose-based Interactive Network sells a system that lets TV viewers at home 
play along with sporting events, game shows and other television programs. 
Backed by media giants, the company for now has only about 5,000 subscribers. 
But it has big plans -- including hopes for bringing gambling into the home. 
Here's how its system works: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Local TV stations and cable systems broadcast programming. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Interactive Network producers in San Jose view local telecasts, enter 
"lock-outs" that prevent cheating, insert game calls ("Will the quarterback 
pass or hand off the ball?") and other statistical information instantaneously, 
as the game or other programming unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 3. This play-along information is transmitted to FM radio stations and public 
TV stations around the country, which simultaneously broadcast it to 
Interactive Network customers on unused portions of their frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Customers play along with the program on laptop control units outfitted 
with liquid crystal display screens. At the end of the game, players plug the 
unit into their telephones to download their scores. In the future, Interactive 
Network will drop the control units; viewers will see play-along information 
superimposed directly on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Telephone lines carry player's score back to Interactive Network's 
computers, which collect, tabulate and rank scores. Network sends results back 
to each customer within four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Normal TV Signal Enters Home 
</P>
<P>
 B. Customer Records Play Choice 
</P>
<P>
 C. Customer Sends Score on Phone Lines 
</P>
<P>
 D. Network Producers Enter Game Calls 
</P>
<P>
 E. FM Signal Carries Network Input

L.A. JOINS CHALLENGE TO PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: LEGAL MOVE COMES AMID DEBATE 
OVER GETTING INVOLVED WHEN MANY ARE CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT. CITY 
ATTORNEY DEFENDS ACTION AS NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles jumped into the legal fray over Proposition 187 on 
Thursday, with City Atty. James K. Hahn filing court papers to join in a 
federal lawsuit seeking to toss out the anti-illegal immigration ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came amid continuing debate on the City Council about whether the 
city should get involved in court action over the initiative, particularly when 
many constituents are clamoring for its immediate enforcement. Hahn's office 
said the action was necessary to clarify the city's responsibilities under the 
measure, which was approved by state voters last week by a 59%-41% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sponsors of the initiative said they were neither surprised nor 
dismayed by Wednesday's issuance of a temporary restraining order by a federal 
judge in Los Angeles covering most portions of the sweeping measure. They 
added, however, that many grass-roots supporters have their phones ringing off 
the hooks, expressing outrage that the initiative has not taken effect 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really offended that their vote, their will and their voice 
doesn't mean anything -- that the court can just tell them to stuff a sock in 
their mouth and tell them to shut up," said Harold Ezell, a co-author of the 
measure and a former federal immigration official. "But people should not be 
surprised or discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go through all of this exercise of going through the courts. They 
did it with Proposition 13, they did it with Proposition 103. . . . It's just 
part of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Since voters approved the get-tough initiative, eight lawsuits have been filed 
to overturn it in state and federal courts from Sacramento to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal filings by government agencies, including the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, have resulted in a strong backlash from voters. The Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors backed away from undertaking a similar suit 
and proponents of the ballot measure announced plans for a recall drive against 
Los Angeles School Board President Mark Slavkin.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Los Angeles City Council also voted to take legal action in an 
effort to overturn the measure. But Wednesday, several council members began an 
effort to retract the vote and to instead ask the courts to clarify how the 
ballot measure should be applied by city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's latest action puts it on the side of the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern California, the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, the Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California and 
other civil rights groups that are attempting to overturn the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In his legal papers seeking to join the case as an intervenor, Hahn blasted 
the initiative in no uncertain terms, saying it is "vague, over-broad and may 
result in thousands of persons suffering violations of their constitutional 
right against discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in Hahn's office maintained that the tough language was necessary 
for the city to be allowed to enter the law case at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We adopt the pleadings of the ACLU and they are asking for . . . relief (from 
the proposition) but our mission is to find out what the law means and what the 
city's duties and obligations under it are," said Jessica F. Heinz, the deputy 
city attorney who drafted the city's legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinz said that the federal courts do not allow parties to simply enter 
litigation in a neutral position to seek answers to questions. Instead, they 
must show what harm they might suffer if the initiative is not clarified. "To 
get standing in the court we have to show that we have a real interest and a 
real stake," Heinz said. "We have to let the court know there is a very real 
problem facing the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Two law professors who are experts in federal civil procedure agreed that the 
city must stake out a clear position in order to intervene in the suit. The 
federal courts probably would ignore a simple request for clarification of the 
law, in the form of a friend of the court brief, said Profs. Stephen Yeazell of 
UCLA and Erwin Chemerinsky of USC. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs has argued that the City Council should reverse its 
earlier stand pursuing "any and all legal action to . . . set aside the 
provisions of Proposition 187 . . . by challenging its constitutionality." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said he will press the City Council today to reverse that stand and "not 
take that activist position. That is what the public is really angry about, 
seeing their money used to try to overturn their action. That is what the 
public sees as an arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg countered that because the entire City Council 
has asked for clarification of the law, it has no choice but to follow the city 
attorney's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after Proposition 187's approval, a San Francisco judge temporarily 
blocked the educational provisions from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr., acting on four 
separate cases filed by civil rights groups and private attorneys, halted 
immediate enforcement of the initiative's ban on non-emergency medical, 
educational and social services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that portions of Proposition 187 raise serious federal 
constitutional questions, Byrne also temporarily blocked implementation of its 
requirement that police and government agencies report suspected illegal 
immigrants to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until hearings are held on requests for preliminary injunctions -- which are 
designed to block implementation of the initiative until its legality is 
determined in court -- the only portion that Byrne ruled could take effect is a 
section providing increased state penalties for the sale and use of fraudulent 
citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's ruling came in suits brought by the civil rights groups, the Center 
for Human Rights & Constitutional Law and two private attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In its wake, leading Proposition 187 proponents have weighed in with decidedly 
measured responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, for one, said a comprehensive court process could prove 
beneficial to the measure's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it is more important that there be a full and complete record 
before the U.S. Supreme Court actually considers the questions that have been 
presented by 187," Wilson said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-187 campaign Chairman Ron Prince, who viewed the proceedings Wednesday, 
praised Byrne's performance, even if he disagreed with the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed by Judge Byrne," said Prince. "I thought his questions 
were fair and he certainly gave the attorney general's representatives ample 
opportunity to present a case. In fact, he was almost presenting their case for 
them in the absence of any effort on the part of the deputy attorney general to 
do it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince termed Wednesday's ruling a partial victory because Byrne upheld the 
initiative's sections on fraudulent documents, which call for penalties of up 
to five years in prison for illegal immigrants who use false citizenship 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince added that he had expected -- and had made clear repeatedly during the 
long campaign -- that the education, health and social service provisions of 
the ballot measure would take months or years for courts to resolve. His only 
surprise, he said, was that Byrne did not allow the immediate implementation of 
a requirement that police verify the immigration status of anyone who is 
arrested in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne, during Wednesday's proceedings, made pointed comments about the 
initiative's apparent legal deficiencies. At one point, noting that the measure 
contains several different definitions of illegal immigrants, he said: "It 
looks as if it's been drafted by committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince said he is not fearful of a backlash against the sponsors of 
Proposition 187 if judges continue to raise questions about the measure's 
constitutionality because of its specific provisions or the manner in which it 
was written. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter how the initiative was written," he said. "The minute you 
challenge special interests, they're going to try to fight you every way that 
they can." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting late Thursday of Proposition 187 supporters, a crowd of more than 
350 loudly applauded speakers who called for the ouster of Los Angeles school 
and City Council officials who mount taxpayer-funded attacks on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing an audience packed into the auditorium of a Sherman Oaks school, 
one speaker protested what he called "the invasion of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Spencer, head of the Voice of Citizens Together, pledged to rewrite the 
three "Rs" for the Los Angeles School District, which he accused of "harboring 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic, it will be recall, remove and 
replace," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's group had announced plans Wednesday to launch a petition drive to 
recall Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince told the group that the initiative has sent a message to state and 
federal officials, especially President Clinton. "We're not going to allow them 
to overturn the will of the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Proposition co-sponsor Barbara Coe, who heads the California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform, said the restraining order "wasn't a surprise 
to supporters of 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Coe said she agrees with voters who do not understand why the courts would 
even get involved in ballot measures that win approval at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an ideal world, when the people spoke, that would be the end of the 
subject -- it would be the law," Coe said. "In many ways, there certainly is no 
need for a court system when we look at the greedy and unethical people who are 
using it for their own purpose and results." 
</P>
<P>
 Those comments brought a shocked reaction from Chemerinsky, a constitutional 
law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the earliest days of our country, courts have been able to declare 
laws unconstitutional -- no matter how popular they might be -- if they violate 
the Constitution," Chemerinsky said. "The whole point of the Constitution is to 
make sure that our basic values won't be trampled by the short-term wishes of 
the majority." 
</P>
<P>
 Suits concerning California initiatives are hardly new, Chemerinsky added, 
citing the ongoing litigation over the fate of Proposition 103, the insurance 
reform measure approved by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more to the point, the professor said, was Proposition 14, the 1964 
ballot measure that overturned state and local anti-discrimination housing 
laws. Three years later, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the measure 
violated the federal Constitution by involving the state in racial 
discrimination.

 Washington is full of mysteries that seem fated to remain unsolved, forever 
giving us occasional pause. Did Ronald Reagan dye his hair? Did Millie really 
write the book? What exactly became, in those post-inaugural days, of Hillary's 
headbands? 
</P>
<P>
 But few are as puzzling as the one now playing at a political souvenir store 
in Union Station, where a former California congressman spends two days a week 
as a clerk selling Socks the Cat T-shirts and life-size cardboard cutouts of 
the Clintons in barbecue aprons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really sort of heartbreaking," said a clerk who has worked with John G. 
Schmitz -- Orange County's firebrand congressman from 1970-73 and a state 
senator for several years before and after that. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so very long ago that Schmitz was riding the crest of a new brand 
of conservatism in Orange County, railing about the evils of Communism and the 
virtues of the Moral Majority. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so there was that little matter of him fathering two children by a woman 
who was not his wife. Are such indiscretions sufficient to lead a man of such 
political stature to this -- a trendy train station souvenir shop where 
tourists pick over cups that say "Proud to Be a Republican"? If so, Washington 
is a mean place. Come to think of it, who ever said it wasn't? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew him say Schmitz breathed politics. It was his life source, the 
object of his desires, this slight man with a pencil-thin mustache and a 
better-dead-than-red philosophy that briefly took Orange County by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine Corps pilot and instructor in Communist propaganda techniques, 
Schmitz was not supposed to win when he entered a broad Orange County field for 
a state Senate seat in 1964. He was a John Bircher, "a kook." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to abolish the income tax, suggesting the lost funds be made up by 
selling Yellowstone Park," said retired Superior Court Judge Bruce Sumner, the 
candidate Schmitz beat. "I thought the audience would laugh at that. They 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitz won by a narrow margin and was on his way, never pulling punches, 
never mincing words. He captured a seat in Congress in 1970, and when Richard 
Nixon went to China, Schmitz said he should have just stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran against Nixon as the American Independent Party's presidential 
candidate in 1972 and got more votes than Democrat George McGovern in four Iowa 
counties. "They love me in Iowa," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
 No word or deed seemed too extreme for John George Schmitz. He was a shameless 
apostle of Joe McCarthy, even purchasing the Washington home where the 
redbaiting senator once lived. If Reagan did not win the presidency in '76, 
Schmitz said, a military coup might be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1980s were less tolerant of intolerance. When Schmitz called attorney 
Gloria Allred a "slick, butch lawyeress," she sued him, winning $20,000 and a 
public apology. When court documents revealed he had fathered two children 
through an extramarital affair, Schmitz left politics in disgrace to live in an 
Orange County mobile home park and teach political science at a Santa Ana 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't agree with him, but I respected his honesty," said Fred Mabbutt, a 
UCLA political science professor who once taught with Schmitz in Santa Ana. 
Told of the mystery, Mabbutt paused. "He wasn't a spectator. He was a 
gladiator." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists mill around Political Americana one autumn afternoon. In the neat 
display cases a Truman button goes for about $90, a Schmitz button for around 
$9. He has also supplied the store with a laminated campaign poster from his 
presidential try. Price: $25. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been here for 4 1/2 years, showing up Wednesdays and Thursdays at 9:30 
a.m., regaling tourists with his war stories -- sans scandals -- and leaving at 
2 on the button. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the Capitol dome is so close you can almost see it. As a former 
congressman, he can still park there. It would seem his season has come back 
around, Rush Limbaugh and all, a time when no remark is considered too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Schmitz burned too many bridges to ever be resurrected from the 
nostalgic world of politics to the real one. Maybe at 64, he just doesn't feel 
like it. In the store, he's a "historical consultant." Across the street, he's 
a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders which place he would rather be. But we won't be hearing the answer 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't talk to reporters anymore," he said curtly, dropping the hand he no 
longer wished to shake when informed it belonged to a member of the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can blame him, really? He's found a niche, a living political relic in a 
store full of plastic ones. No harsh lights. No tough questions. No 
embarrassing past. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, there are a fair amount of people who still feel stung by 
Schmitz's sword. As Allred said lo these many years later: "That retail store 
is as close to the Capitol as John Schmitz should ever get."

FINAL SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED IN WASTE DUMP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending 11 years of litigation, a final $13.5-million settlement will be paid 
for damages caused by the Stringfellow acid pits, one of the most notorious 
toxic waste dumps in the nation, both sides said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The out-of-court settlement will be paid by an insurance company for the state 
of California, the last remaining defendant in the convoluted civil case that 
involved about 3,800 plaintiffs. They were residents of Glen Avon, a small 
blue-collar community just west of Riverside who lived a mile downstream from 
an unlined rock quarry that from 1956 to 1972 served as a dumping ground for 35 
million gallons of industrial chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement brings the total damages to $109 million to be paid to the 
plaintiffs -- including the families of people who died of cancer allegedly 
caused by living close to the chemical dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," said Penny Newman, the lead plaintiff in the case, which 
began in 1984 and has generated 3 million court exhibits and documents. The 
Stringfellow case has 500 attorneys of record. The litigation has cost the 
residents more than $30 million even before attorneys take their contingency 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having an 11-year-old trial come to a close is very exciting. I think we've 
done pretty well," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Weliber, attorney for the plaintiffs, called the settlement "satisfactory 
and reasonable, given the diversity of injuries, and represents to my knowledge 
one of the largest settlements of a toxic tort case in the history of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The cash awards will be distributed to the individual plaintiffs early next 
year under the direction of Francis McGovern, a University of Alabama law 
professor who specializes in the distribution of mass-tort awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The final settlement was mediated with the help of J. Lawrence Irving, a 
retired federal district judge from San Diego. The pact must be formally 
approved by Riverside Superior Court Judge Erik Kaiser, who presided over a 
seven-month trial last year that resolved the cases of 17 of the litigants. 
</P>
<P>
 In that trial, jurors found the state culpable for damages -- but awarded only 
$160,000 of the $3.1 million in damages sought by the 17 people. Eight of the 
17 plaintiffs won nothing, and the largest award -- $43,228 -- went to a man 
who claimed emotional distress because of well-documented breathing 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement is being paid out of consideration of the fact that if we were 
to try 17 cases a year until all the cases were concluded, we'd be in the year 
2530," said Howard Halm, an attorney who represented the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The other $96 million in out-of-court settlements were paid by the 200 or so 
companies that dumped their industrial processing wastes at Stringfellow, as 
well as by Riverside County and the owners of the site. The state was named as 
a defendant because it approved the dump's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the companies that dumped at Stringfellow were General Electric, Alumax 
Inc., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Rockwell International, Rohr Industries, Alcan 
Aluminum Corp., Montrose Chemical Co. and Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Goldsmith, a senior assistant state attorney general, noted that in the 
final settlement, the tab will be picked up by the state's insurance carrier, 
the Chubb Group of Insurance Cos., and not by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup of the site continues. Eighteen companies have agreed to pay $150 
million toward cleanup costs and the state was ordered to pay 75% of the 
ultimate costs -- estimated at $750 million.

REGENTS ARGUE OVER CHALLENGE TO UC MINORITY POLICY; EDUCATION: CHARGE THAT 
UNIVERSITY GIVES PREFERENCE TO SOME STUDENTS RECALLS CONTROVERSY SPARKED BY 
BAKKE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years after the precedent-setting Bakke suit challenged racial quotas 
in college admissions, the University of California regents found themselves in 
the midst of a contentious debate Thursday over whether the system's medical 
schools still set aside slots for minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kind of emotional back-and-forth seldom seen in the staid chambers of 
the university system's governing board, the issue drew charges by several 
regents that University of California medical school officials might be acting 
within the law, but not following its spirit, by using race as a criterion for 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
 The harshest criticism came from Regent Ward Connerly, who said the system of 
admissions, which gives an edge to minority students, "may be lawful but it 
still may not be right." 
</P>
<P>
 "It may trample on the rights of others," said Connerly, who is black. "It may 
not be right. It may not be equitable. It may not be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely catalyst for the friction was a bespectacled San Diego computer 
programmer named Jerry Cook, who forced an examination of the university 
system's admission policies by compiling data that showed that minorities 
admitted to the UC medical schools consistently scored lower than whites in 
grade-point average and medical school entrance exam scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook charged that his figures prove that a quota system still exists in 
medical school admissions despite the Bakke decision, which struck down racial 
quotas but allowed colleges to consider race as one factor in admission 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 That case involved a 1974 lawsuit filed by a 33-year-old student named Allan 
Bakke, who contended that he was denied admission to the UC Davis Medical 
School because he was white. In his suit, Bakke said he was not admitted 
because of the school's policy of reserving 16 slots out of 100 for minority 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 1978 decision, ruled that the school's quota 
system was illegal. The court said that affirmative action could be one of the 
factors that decide admission, but not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, in presenting his findings to UC President Jack W. Peltason, contended 
that his figures proved a quota system is still in place because blacks and 
Latinos have been given preference over white applicants with higher test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 At the regents meeting Thursday, medical school officials and UC lawyers 
painted a much different picture of the selection process, and said there are 
many factors that enter into admission decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "To achieve diversity and meet our educational and professional needs, we must 
give some weight -- among a wide variety of criteria other than grades and test 
scores -- to the race or ethnicity of highly qualified applicants," Peltason 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the lengthy presentation, Michael Drake, associate dean of 
admissions for the UC San Francisco Medical School, pointed out that virtually 
all minority medical students graduated and passed their medical boards. He 
also said there is a need for minority doctors within their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am compelled to remind us that race-related bias is a persistent, sometimes 
crippling force affecting people of color in the United States in countless 
ways," he said. "It has been suggested that we use a color-blind or race-blind 
admissions policy. That would be fine in a color-blind society. Unfortunately, 
we are not there yet."

SEN. FEINSTEIN EXPECTED TO CLAIM VICTORY; POLITICS: INCUMBENT PLANS NEWS 
CONFERENCE TODAY WHILE CHALLENGER HUFFINGTON REFUSES TO CONCEDE UNTIL LAST 
ABSENTEE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After watching her lead grow daily as election officials work their way 
through 700,000 late absentee ballots, Sen. Dianne Feinstein is expected to 
declare victory over her Republican challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington, at a news 
conference today. 
</P>
<P>
 With 220,000 ballots to be counted as of late Thursday, the Democratic 
incumbent's lead had grown to 162,000 votes from about 123,000 a week ago. That 
means that Huffington would need more than 85% of the remaining votes in order 
to win -- an inconceivable tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Feinstein campaign officials will not comment on whether she plans 
to proclaim victory at her San Francisco news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll make comments about the latest vote tally and talk a bit about her 
vote," was all that Feinstein campaign spokesman Bill Chandler would say. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who was en route to Washington late Thursday, could not be reached 
for comment. But his campaign communications director, Jennifer Grossman, said 
the congressman from Santa Barbara had no plans to concede until all the votes 
are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been our principle and our belief that until those final ballots 
are counted and those voters' voices are heard that it would be inappropriate 
for either candidate to call the race," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the tradition of candidates' making concession statements 
when defeat appears inevitable, Grossman replied: "If he makes a statement, it 
will be because it is the appropriate time to do so, not because the political 
handbook says he has to." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's state director, Kam Kuwata, contended that it has been clear for 
more than a week to everyone but Huffington that the freshman congressman will 
lose in his bid to step up to the Senate. "We could wait forever for Michael 
Huffington and I don't think he'll ever be gracious in defeat," Kuwata said. 
"Only Mike Huffington is dreaming the impossible dream right now." 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of the business day Thursday, the secretary of state's office had 
Feinstein leading with 3,835,405 votes to Huffington's 3,674,220 with about 
220,000 absentee ballots to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 In another contentious race still being counted, which will determine whether 
Republicans can take control of the state Assembly, Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor 
Steve Kuykendall, a Republican, inched farther ahead and had a 483-vote lead 
over Assemblywoman Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach). His campaign estimates that 
2,000 absentee ballots are left to be tallied in the 54th Assembly District, 
which includes Long Beach and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not many votes that are left," Kuykendall said. "I won't say anything 
until it's completely in the bag. But I'm feeling a lot better, This stuff is 
so nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the 36th Congressional District, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling 
Hills) widened her lead to 562 votes over Republican opponent Susan Brooks. 
That makes it more doubtful that Brooks can win the South Bay seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beyond our wildest dreams," said Harman's campaign spokesman, Roy Behr, 
when the latest tally came in. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman had 91,248 votes to Brooks' 90,686. The two campaigns estimate that 
there are fewer than 4,000 absentees left to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has not declared victory, and Brooks refuses to concede. In fact, 
Brooks is in Washington to be part of a House transition team appointed by 
incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). While there, she has appeared with 
seven Republican representatives-elect at news conferences and network evening 
news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman had been 93 votes behind the day after the election, and many political 
analysts predicted that Brooks would widen her lead in absentee votes.

FEDERAL JUDGE GETS CLINTON PLAN TO END TIMBER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's timber plan, designed to resolve the long-running dispute 
over the need for forest habitat versus the need for forest products, Thursday 
came before a federal judge, who will decide whether the proposal is acceptable 
under environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the plan could settle one of the most divisive environmental 
battles of recent years -- the fight over logging in the old growth forests of 
the Pacific Northwest, home of the threatened northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it fails to pass muster with District Judge William L. Dwyer, the 
detailed document could be in for extensive retooling -- or might be scrapped 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Dwyer barred new timber sales in the region while he waited 
for a comprehensive federal plan that would ensure the owl's survival. He 
lifted the injunction in June, but deferred judgment on the plan until now. 
</P>
<P>
 While Justice Department lawyers at the hearing called the plan a workable and 
innovative blueprint for saving species and supplying lumber, attorneys 
representing a host of environmental and timber industry groups claimed it is 
seriously flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all its complexity," said Todd True of the Sierra Club Legal Defense 
Fund, the government's proposal "is still a plan for logging large tracts of 
old growth forest." 
</P>
<P>
 And timber industry attorney Mark Rutzick said that the entire governmental 
process that led to the plan was riddled with "flaws, errors and 
uncertainties." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to protect old growth forests while providing a sustainable 
timber harvest," countered Lois Schiffer, assistant U.S. attorney general. "We 
have tried to comply with a myriad of applicable statutes and regulations, as 
well as the mandates of this court." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiffer argued that the proposal meets all criteria and should be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing a dozen environmental plaintiffs said that the 
Administration had ignored reputable scientific studies that they say suggest 
the plan is inadequate to protect spotted owls and other species, including 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said the government didn't examine the economic boon that derives 
from a region's scenic beauty and environmental quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan for managing the spotted owl forests in Washington, Oregon 
and Northern California was released in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Known informally as Option 9, for the alternative eventually chosen out of 10 
that were considered, it came in the form of an environmental impact statement 
that prescribes far more habitat protection than any plan yet implemented in 
the vast federal holdings in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides designating 10 million acres as basically off-limits to logging, it 
calls for buffer zones around rivers and streams and sets up "adaptive 
management areas" as cooperative experiments among forest managers, communities 
and private interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan permits 1.1 billion board feet of timber to be harvested annually. 
That figure compares to the 4.5 billion board feet annual average during the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton plan also would allow up to 25% of the 5.5 million acres of 
the region's old growth forests not set aside for protection to be harvested. 
That raised the ire of environmentalists, who see any further cutting of old 
growth as hazardous, perhaps fatal, to both the owls and the forests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hearing Thursday, Dwyer asked attorneys about taking chances with 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an absolute certainty (of species survival) cannot be found, then doesn't 
it follow that some risk is tolerable? How much risk, that's the question," he 
said. At another point he asked a government attorney if there is "room for 
agencies to take a chance on species protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer is expected to rule by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 While some observers say Dwyer could scrap the plan entirely, 
environmentalists have indicated a willingness to fine tune those aspects they 
are challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking at going back through the massive expenditures of time, 
money and paper that preceded this hearing," True said. "The basic elements (of 
the plan) in terms of reserves and key watersheds are not in dispute," said 
Mike Anderson, a forest resource analyst for the Wilderness Society. "What is 
in dispute is, are the reserves adequately protected."

WOMAN, 100, FINALLY HAS DAY IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The power-suited insurance company lawyer knew he would have to handle the 
witness delicately -- even though she was suing his client for about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he conceded, he had never before cross-examined a woman on the eve 
of her 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a no-win situation," sighed Terry Rowland as the television cameras 
focused on Anne Campbell Smith. Looking pert in her handsome red dress, 
open-toed heels and jewelry, she was the darling of the courtroom Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been in court before," she said, looking not at all nervous or 
apprehensive. "I've never driven a car, so I've never had a traffic ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Smith was set to testify that when her 77-year-old Upland 
home burned to the ground in 1988 because of an electrical malfunction, her 
insurance company, Colonial Penn, gave her a raw deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, she alleged in court papers, shortchanged her on her temporary 
living expenses, failed to reimburse her adequately for the lost contents -- 
clothes, furniture, jewelry, photographs -- and, worst of all, reneged on its 
promise to pay for her to build a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she is the oldest resident of an Ontario retirement home -- 
where, she complained, there are a bunch of "old people who can't hear good, 
can't talk good and can't go upstairs" to visit her. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a woman who has a taste for red meat. She said she likes her roast 
beef rare, and on Thursday, she was ready to take a bite out of the insurance 
company. "I want this case finished," she said, "before I'm finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Penn denies all the charges. Rowland said the company has paid out 
everything it was required to -- more than $160,000, with another $100,000 for 
her after her new house is rebuilt, per the insurance policy. Rowland said the 
reason Smith does not have a new home yet is because her 80-year-old son, 
Stuart Campbell, has ineffectively handled the claim on his mother's behalf 
after he was given the insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who expects to see her centennial photograph displayed by television 
weatherman Willard Scott this morning on "The Today Show," was not sure the 
jury would be sympathetic toward her because of her seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some may think the other way," she said during a court recess. "They may 
wonder, 'What's a sad old woman want with money?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Court employees chuckled, reporters smiled, and the insurance company lawyer 
looked somewhat stone-faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a newsworthy story," Rowland said quietly. "This insurance 
company does not deserve to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 But he knew that he might be viewed unfavorably by jurors, grilling this sweet 
old woman on the witness stand, and so he addressed that quandary during jury 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked if anyone would hold it against me if, as I defend my client, I 
cross-examine a 100-year-old woman," Rowland said. "I asked if they'd be 
hissing at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, that confrontation may not occur. During Thursday's session in San 
Bernardino Superior Court, attorneys for both sides huddled in the chambers of 
Judge Paul M. Bryant Jr. After a while, Smith was asked to join them. And when 
they emerged, both sides clammed up amid speculation that an out-of-court 
settlement was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she was not disappointed that she did not have to take the witness 
stand to confront Colonial Penn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get this settled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the television cameras shadowed her down the courtroom hallway, she 
remarked: "Boy, I didn't think there would be all this commotion."

JORDANIANS TURN BACK RELIEF FOR TOMATO-STARVED ISRAELIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first fruits of Israel's peace with Jordan -- a 20-ton truckload of ripe 
tomatoes bound for Israel -- were turned back at the border crossing Thursday 
by Jordanian agricultural officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomato turnaround at the Jordan River -- ordered because the fruit was of 
inferior quality -- was bad news for Israeli consumers. They are suffering a 
tomato shortage that is causing near-panic in a society that commonly eats the 
acidic fruit at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Israeli officials want to import 
Jordanian tomatoes to help bring prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Israeli market saw only 8,000 tons of tomatoes; the normal 
monthly volume is 13,000 tons. By Thursday, tomato prices had hit 10 shekels a 
kilo -- about $1.50 per pound -- in grocery stores. Tomatoes have not been so 
costly since 1989, when they briefly sold for 12 shekels a kilo. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomato crisis already has produced several public polls on who is to blame 
-- a majority think it is the government's fault -- and on whether Israelis are 
willing to boycott the fruit until the price drops. Ninety percent of people 
polled by Israel Radio said they will boycott. But sales remain brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis also has led to charges that the Labor government has destroyed 
Israeli agriculture by trying to end subsidies and institute market principles 
in farming. "Following the Finance Ministry's disastrous policy, which led to 
an unprecedented price increase of vegetables and fruits, the state's capacity 
to provide the citizens with the basic foods . . . at reasonable cost is in 
doubt," charged Shalom Simchon, general secretary of the nation's cooperative 
farm movement. Simchon called for a commission to be appointed to investigate 
the government's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time last year, tomatoes were selling for less than 60 cents a pound. 
Over the summer, farmers sold tomatoes wholesale for as low as 6 cents a pound. 
The low summer prices sparked angry demonstrations by farmers, who pelted 
Agriculture Minister Yaacov Tsur's office with tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Agriculture Ministry had already been importing tomatoes from the 
Netherlands to try to alleviate the current shortage. But transportation costs 
make the Dutch tomatoes as expensive as local ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In desperation, the Agriculture Ministry turned to Jordan. Israel signed a 
peace treaty with the neighboring Arab state last month, and the treaty went 
into effect last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordanian officials turned back the first post-peace shipment of tomatoes 
because much of it had been damaged in the picking process, said Ronni Hassid, 
a spokesman for the Israeli Agriculture Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to try again, with a new shipment, on Sunday," Hassid said, adding 
that the ministry hopes to start importing 100 tons of tomatoes a day by the 
start of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomato shortage was caused partly by farmers' anticipation that 
inexpensive fruits and vegetables would start flowing in from the Gaza Strip 
after Palestinian autonomy was instituted there in May, Hassid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We advised the farmers to plant something else instead of tomatoes," he said. 
But earlier this month, Israel banned the import of Gazan produce after several 
dozen cases of cholera were discovered in the impoverished strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the ban, the price of tomatoes began to rise. Consumers started 
to complain, but they kept buying. They were not even deterred by Finance 
Minister Avraham Shohat's televised advice earlier this week that prices would 
fall if Israelis would stop buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a child growing up, I didn't eat tomatoes in the winter, and I 
didn't turn out so badly," Shohat told a television reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does Shohat know?" said Eli Mizrachi, a produce seller in Mahane Yehuda, 
a popular open-air market in Jerusalem. "He's too busy eating tomatoes to worry 
about their price." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahane Yehuda is where the capital's shoppers buy high-quality fruits and 
vegetables at bargain prices. Mizrachi was selling tomatoes Thursday for eight 
shekels a kilo -- about $1.20 per pound. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a choice but to buy them," said Mark Edelman, a shopper who 
handed Mizrachi a bag of tomatoes to weigh. "Besides, the price of all food is 
expensive, so we would have to stop eating everything if we stopped buying 
because of the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although tomatoes jumped 53% in price in October, other popular items 
of produce were not far behind. Cabbage rose 46.3%, eggplant increased in price 
by 36.6% and cucumbers rose by 28.2%. All are staples of the Israeli diet.

U.S. DRAFTS OPTIONS TO AID BOSNIA ARMY; BALKANS: CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
COMPLIES WITH CONGRESSIONAL ORDER. BUT IT CITES RISKS AND COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has complied with Congress' order to draft options 
for arming and training Bosnian government forces, but it warns that carrying 
out the proposal would be risky, costly and almost certain to jeopardize ties 
with major U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenarios, outlined in classified briefings with leading lawmakers this 
week, call for the United States to lift the current arms embargo unilaterally, 
to arm and train Bosnian government soldiers and to help evacuate allied troops 
now on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have warned that the operation would require a substantial U.S. 
air campaign, to protect Bosnian forces during training, and the deployment of 
thousands of American ground troops, with a risk of widening the ground war to 
many more civilians. The cost could run as high as $4 billion, Administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have cautioned that any unilateral lifting of the arms embargo would 
so anger major U.S. allies -- such as the British, French and Dutch, who 
together have 19,000 ground troops in Bosnia -- that U.S. planes might not be 
allowed to use North Atlantic Treaty Organization bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration consistently has opposed any unilateral lifting of the arms 
embargo or outside training of Bosnian troops. But that position has been 
popular among lawmakers, many of whom are frustrated with the war and want to 
strengthen Bosnia's government forces, which are largely Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials said President Clinton may be hard-pressed to avert such a 
move after Republicans take control of Congress in January. GOP lawmakers have 
been among the most vigorous proponents of lifting the embargo unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 Under legislation passed earlier this year, Congress gave Clinton until Nov. 
15 to persuade the U.N. Security Council to lift the embargo multilaterally. If 
the world assembly refused, the law required Clinton to cease using U.S. 
military personnel to help enforce the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also required him to submit detailed plans for lifting the embargo 
unilaterally and for training Bosnian government troops outside Bosnia, where 
they are subject to the U.N. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get the 15-country Security Council to lift the embargo, Clinton 
issued orders last week prohibiting U.S. military forces from helping to 
enforce the embargo. But he said the United States would continue to abide by 
its terms and not sell arms to the Bosnian government troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department and intelligence officials flatly denied a report Thursday 
from Europe suggesting that the United States has been sharing satellite photos 
and other intelligence with the Muslim-led government following Clinton's 
decision to stop enforcing the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, contained in the European, a London-based weekly newspaper, said 
that small teams of CIA operatives are working in Bosnia to train soldiers in 
military operations, provide them with satellite photos and control air 
traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 The options the Administration outlined to lawmakers this week involved 
essentially two alternative approaches: 
</P>
<P>
 One would be to pour enough tanks, artillery and weapons into Bosnian 
government hands to give its army the same level of equipment as the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative would be to concentrate on exploiting government forces' 
current advantage in manpower over the Bosnian Serb rebels by equipping them 
with more antitank weapons, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms to create 
a more effective infantry force. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the approach, U.S. officials said that arming the Bosnian 
government could cost between $500 million and $4 billion. And the move would 
bring on a spate of problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * Training the Bosnian forces fully would require a transitional period of a 
year or more, during which time they almost certainly would come under 
stepped-up attacks by the Serbs -- which the United States would have to 
counter with a substantial air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * As soon as the United States lifted the embargo, Britain, France and the 
Netherlands would pull their peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia. Since 
Washington is committed to helping to evacuate them, Clinton would have to send 
in thousands of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Without U.N. peacekeeping troops on the ground, any U.S. warplanes sent to 
protect Bosnian government units would be forced to operate without the help of 
forward air observers, making their bombing less accurate and more likely to 
hit civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 * Renewed attacks by the Bosnian Serbs would widen the war to endanger more 
civilians than are being killed now and could well bring in neighboring 
countries such as Serbia and Croatia and even the major powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately Thursday, the State Department said that unidentified gunmen in 
Sarajevo fired shots into the rooms of U.S. Ambassador Vic Jackovic at the 
Holiday Inn motel but that Jackovic was not in the room. A State Department 
spokesman said there is no reason to believe that Jackovic was the target of 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian presidential offices in Sarajevo also were attacked by a 
wire-guided missile Thursday, leaving two people wounded, wire services 
reported.

INFRASTRUCTURE; NEW PIPELINE A CONDUIT OF HOPE FOR CENTRAL ASIA; FIVE FORMER 
SOVIET REPUBLICS ARE BANKING ON THE AS-YET-UNBUILT CHANNEL, ALONG WITH NEW 
RAILWAYS AND HIGHWAYS, TO BREAK FREE FROM MOSCOW'S LONG DOMINATION.

<P>
 It was a bizarre ceremony in the middle of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Invited guests stood in a circle around two sections of pipe, five feet in 
diameter, that rested on a bed of gravel in the desert. Black limousines rolled 
up one by one, and out climbed the leaders of Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, 
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, each stepping forward to dig up a shovelful of 
dirt. Then welders fitted the two steel cylinders together. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of this would-be pipeline doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 But President Saparmurad A. Niyazov, in a move to drum up financing, staged 
the symbolic inauguration for VIPs on hand last month for his former Soviet 
republic's independence day. 
</P>
<P>
 When -- and if -- completed, the pipeline will take some of Turkmenistan's 
natural gas through Iran and Turkey to customers in Europe, bypassing the 
existing line through Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of a number of pipelines, highways and railroads planned with the 
aim of breaking Moscow's economic control over former subjects in landlocked, 
resource-rich Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this pipeline will be the first of many pipelines," said Pakistani 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose country is among those seeking trade and 
influence in this region of 53 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, the Soviet Union closed its southern borders and isolated the 
five Central Asian republics -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- from their historic Asian trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the five are starting to grasp the advantages of rebuilding trade and 
transport links to the south, to lessen their dependence on those running north 
into Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkmenistan hopes to get rich quick by selling gas to Europe. But so does 
Russia. With Russian hands on the tap, Turkmenistan has little control over 
where its gas goes. Most of it has been consumed by former Soviet republics 
Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, which now owe Turkmenistan $2 billion and are too 
poor to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the pipeline through Iran and Turkey is meant to start early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats say financing from the West could be hard to find because of 
opposition there to any project that might benefit Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge, oil-rich Kazakhstan has a similar problem, as its oil exports depend 
totally on Russian pipelines. Russia, an oil exporter itself, views Kazakhstan 
as a competitor and limits the flow of Kazakh oil. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Kazakhstan has formed a consortium with the Persian Gulf 
sultanate of Oman to build its own pipeline through Russian territory to the 
Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Asians are also planning new transport lines for easier routes to the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 New tracks under construction will join Turkmenistan's railway with the city 
of Mashhad in eastern Iran, giving Central Asia rail access to Iran's port of 
Bandar Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the nearest ports accessible to Central Asia by rail are in Russia 
-- St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea and Vladivostok on the Pacific, both 
thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan, which wants Central Asian trade to flow through its own port of 
Karachi, is also discussing a railroad through western Afghanistan -- a part of 
that country barely touched in recent years by the Afghan civil war.  
</P>
<P>
 The Afghan war has also delayed the opening of Pakistan's most direct route to 
Central Asia, through Kabul to Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another obstacle: Uzbek President Islam A. Karimov, a cautious 
former Communist strongly suspicious of Islamic extremism, is wary about 
opening up too quickly to the Islamic south. 
</P>
<P>
 Other routes connecting Central Asia to Pakistan lead through western China, 
such as the Karakoram Highway. From there, two roads lead to Kazakhstan and 
Kyrgyzstan. Pakistan has discussed upgrading these roads with cooperation from 
China, which is also interested in more trade with Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the isolated sections of pipe in the Turkmen desert, many of these 
proposed links are still in the speculative stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials in the region expect that at least some will be built, bringing 
an end to Central Asia's era of Moscow-engineered isolation.

TERRORISM; RECENT ATTACKS RAISE FEARS OF PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN PERU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANA VON HAGEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent bombing rampage by the ragtag remains of a brutal Maoist insurgency 
is a signal that terrorist violence could increase in the coming months of 
campaigning for April presidential elections, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks by the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) could also shake President 
Alberto Fujimori's plans for reelection, as he has focused his campaign on 
convincing voters of his successes in combatting the terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimori has repeatedly vowed to rid the country of terrorism by the end of 
his term in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Sendero Luminoso has traditionally disrupted elections, especially in the 
hinterlands. The group's tactics include intimidating voters and assassinating 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The group launched its war against the government during the May, 1980, 
presidential elections by burning ballot boxes in the small town of Chuschi, 
near the insurgency's birthplace of Ayacucho in the southern Andes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, an estimated 30,000 Peruvians have died in terrorist violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst blackout since 1992, Senderistas in early October blew up power 
poles, plunging Lima and much of the coast into darkness. Insurgents last week 
tossed makeshift bombs at several banks here. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent bombings also came at the same time that an amnesty period for 
repentant Maoist guerrillas expired Oct. 31. According to the army, about 6,000 
rebels have turned themselves in since the law took effect in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will be inflexible until achieving total peace," Fujimori said in a speech 
to military officials the day after the amnesty law expired. At the same 
ceremony, Defense Minister Victor Malca Villanueva warned Senderistas still at 
large that they now face the "laws of war." 
</P>
<P>
 The amnesty was one of a series of counterinsurgency measures decreed by 
Fujimori after he closed the Congress and seized broad powers in a 
military-backed "self coup" in April, 1992. The law grants those who turn 
themselves in more lenient sentences and, in some cases, exemption from 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law has been called an effective anti-guerrilla strategy, critics 
say that many of those who turned themselves in are peasants who were forced to 
collaborate by Sendero Luminoso. And some repentant insurgents -- in a bid for 
more lenient sentences -- often provided authorities with false information 
that led to the arrests of innocent Peruvians. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as Peru's inefficient judiciary begins processing their paperwork, 
the innocent and guilty alike languish in Peruvian prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sendero Luminoso has been severely crippled by the September, 1992, capture of 
its leader and founder, Abimael Guzman. Today, Sendero Luminoso watchers say, 
the group is headed by Oscar Ramirez, formerly No. 3 in the movement's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman and several other leaders are serving life sentences in a Lima prison. 
Ramirez, known by his nom de guerre, Feliciano, heads Sendero Luminoso's 
splinter faction Sendero Rojo (Red Path), blamed for the recent bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 With Guzman behind bars, Ramirez assumed control of Sendero Luminoso after he 
and hard-line members rejected Guzman's peace overtures to the government. 
Earlier this year, the army announced it was on the verge of capturing Ramirez. 
But antipersonnel mines thwarted an army offensive, and Ramirez escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Peru, attacks have dropped from around 4,000 in the 25 months before 
Guzman's capture to about 2,000 in the 26 months since.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent resurgence of Sendero Luminoso attacks, few believe that 
the rebel group or a similar insurgency could rise again. "People have been 
vaccinated against Sendero Luminoso," said Enrique Obando, an analyst at Lima's 
Peruvian Center for International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the late 1980s, killings in Lima shantytowns of grass-roots 
leaders who refused to toe the Sendero Luminoso line and a spate of car bomb 
attacks in the capital alienated those the rebels tried to recruit.

IRISH PREMIER QUITS BEFORE CONFIDENCE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic move, Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds resigned in Dublin on 
Thursday after a fractious five days during which his coalition government fell 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a no-confidence vote in Parliament, Reynolds also said he will step 
down as head of the leading Fianna Fail party. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring had led his Labor Party out of Ireland's 
governing coalition Wednesday in a dispute over a judicial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said he would recommend to President Mary Robinson that Parliament 
not be dissolved, since that would mean new national elections. Ireland will be 
left rudderless while the major parties now explore ways to form a coalition 
that could win a parliamentary majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' move came just a few weeks before all-party talks were expected to 
begin in quest of a solution to the dispute over British rule in Northern 
Ireland, where a cease-fire recently ended 25 years of sectarian violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, head of the political arm of the province's outlawed Irish 
Republican Army, appeared in London on Thursday for the first time since the 
British government last month lifted a ban on his presence, and he complimented 
Reynolds for playing a leading role in the peace process. But he maintained 
that the move toward peace in the troubled province is "bigger than Mr. 
Reynolds." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams added: "There is an onus on the political parties to ensure a government 
is reformed or reelected as quickly as possible, because any distraction from 
the peace process can help to defuse the momentum which has been built up." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a news conference in a parliamentary office, Adams was asked 
whether the IRA might call off the current cease-fire because of the Irish 
political crisis. "I don't see the peace process being under any threat from 
any Republican element," he responded, saying that he is "willing to work with 
whoever is in power" in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 Though praised for his work in the peace process, Reynolds had come under fire 
for his handling of a recent political crisis, and most observers said he was 
sure to lose a parliamentary confidence vote scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds had insisted on forcing through the appointment of former Atty. Gen. 
Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court -- the leading judicial 
appointment -- despite the strong objections of Spring's Labor partners. 
</P>
<P>
 After Spring, who is also foreign minister, and his Labor Party ministers 
walked out of the government, Reynolds admitted that Whelehan had misled him 
about his past actions as attorney general. On Thursday, Whelehan, who was 
criticized for his handling of a child abuse case involving a Roman Catholic 
priest, resigned as president of the High Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In his farewell remarks, Reynolds said: "I was a risk-taker in politics, I was 
a risk-taker in business. But I am quite happy, having taken the risks, that 
the successes have far outweighed the failures." 
</P>
<P>
 British reaction to his resignation was muted, but privately officials 
stressed that the peace process will continue as normally as possible and that 
there will be no change in the plan to hold exploratory talks next month with 
Adams' group, Sinn Fein, and representatives of British loyalist forces. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an Anglo-Irish meeting due to have been held in Belfast, Northern 
Ireland, on Monday was expected to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Reynolds offered to keep his ministers in office in a 
caretaker status, and he remains acting prime minister. A Fianna Fail 
leadership election Saturday could provide a party head able to restore the 
governing coalition, political sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the second leading party, Fine Gael, might form a coalition with the Labor 
Party and thus garner a working majority to run the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Michael Ancram, said that Britain 
will work with the Irish government to achieve a lasting peace in the province, 
"whoever the government is."

 UNITA rebels suspended peace talks Thursday, accusing government troops of 
violating an hours-old cease-fire with offensives in northern and central 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurgents walked out of the talks in Lusaka, Zambia, where the two sides 
had planned to sign a peace treaty Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire signed Wednesday night was supposed to be the first step toward 
ending 19 years of civil war. The government said all fighting had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 But civilians said the government shelled rebels regrouping around Huambo, the 
country's second-largest city and a rebel stronghold until it was taken by the 
government last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels also accused the government of attacking the northern city of Uige on 
Thursday, but a Defense Ministry spokesman said that city was seized "many 
hours" before the truce began.

AUTHORITIES ESCALATE WHITE HOUSE ATTACK CASE; VIOLENCE: FRANCISCO MARTIN DURAN 
IS CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT CLINTON. THE SUSPECTED 
GUNMAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY. 
</P>

<P>
 Federal prosecutors on Thursday escalated their case against the man accused 
of peppering the White House with gunfire last month, indicting Francisco 
Martin Duran on a charge of attempting to assassinate President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. told reporters that "we have sufficient 
information now" to support the more serious charge, even though officials 
repeatedly have said Duran fired randomly at the White House on the afternoon 
of Oct. 29 and that Clinton was never in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge, brought by a grand jury, carries a maximum punishment of life 
imprisonment, a much harsher sentence than those Duran faces under the 10 
charges previously lodged against him, including weapons violations, 
destruction of federal property and assaulting law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, 26, pleaded not guilty to the attempted-assassination charge Thursday 
afternoon in an appearance before U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey. The 
judge gave Duran's lawyer, public defender Leigh A. Kenny, until early next 
week to disclose if she is planning an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder refused to divulge any specific evidence supporting the new charge 
except to suggest that it is based largely on statements given to the FBI by 
several people who knew Duran in his home state of Colorado and on observations 
by people in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge is supported "by what people said Mr. Duran said while he was in 
Colorado," Holder said. It will become clear at Duran's trial, that "he 
attempted to take action to assassinate the President," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the shooting, Clinton had just returned from a trip to the 
Middle East and was watching a college football game on television in the 
family living quarters on the opposite side of the White House from 
Pennsylvania Avenue, where the attack took place.  
</P>
<P>
 Although no one was injured, at least eight shots chipped the exterior of the 
White House and the adjoining West Wing, where Clinton has his office, and 
broke a window in the press briefing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran was subdued on the sidewalk by two passersby. Secret Service agents 
rushed to seize him several moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempted murder normally is a state crime, not a federal offense, but 
Congress has provided stiff penalties for the murder or attempted murder of a 
President or other federal official. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, which occurred six weeks after the apparent suicide of a Maryland 
man who crashed a small aircraft onto the South Lawn, has spurred an intensive 
study on ways to improve presidential security. Recommendations are due in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Duran case, Holder said: "The fortuitous outcome of this 
disturbing incident does not serve to allay our concerns about the security of 
our elected officials and those who protect them and does not diminish our 
resolve to hold accountable those who seek to place them in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Holder said he was disturbed that more people who knew of Duran's intentions 
had not exercised their "moral duty" by reporting the information to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Government sources have said a map found in Duran's pickup truck after the 
shooting had a phrase on it that may have said "kill the President." The third 
word is unclear, although it appears to be a misspelled abbreviation for 
"President," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates of Duran told reporters in Colorado that he had talked about going 
to Washington to "take out" the President. Duran, a hotel employee, was 
dishonorably discharged from the Army last year after serving a prison term for 
felonious assault.

SPY GETS 12-YEAR TERM IN GERMANY; ESPIONAGE: RAINER RUPP ADMITTED PASSING NATO 
DOCUMENTS TO THE EAST'S SECURITY AGENCY. PROSECUTORS CALLED CASE THE WORST IN 
ALLIANCE HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A state supreme court in Duesseldorf found master spy Rainer Rupp guilty of 
treason Thursday and sentenced him to 12 years in prison, in what prosecutors 
said was the worst espionage case in the history of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 During his two-month trial, Rupp testified that for more than a decade -- 
until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 -- he took sensitive documents out of his 
workplace at NATO headquarters in Brussels, photographed them at home and 
delivered them to the East German security agency, known as the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stasi then forwarded the material, some of it stamped with NATO's most 
secret classification, "Cosmic Top Secret," to the Soviet intelligence agency, 
the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take all the blame myself," said Rupp, who cooperated with German 
prosecutors to protect his British-born wife, Ann-Christine Rupp, who also 
passed NATO documents to the Stasi and helped cover up her husband's 
activities. She was convicted Thursday of abetting treason and sentenced to 22 
months' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two former Stasi officers accused of being Rupp's controllers were given 
suspended sentences of two years each for treason. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in the case said Rupp checked out a total of 1,737 documents from 
1977 to 1989 and handed over such potent secrets as plans for the use of 
nuclear weapons in the event of a war; catalogues of various troop strengths 
and armament levels; reports on military exercises; descriptions of NATO alarm 
systems, and reports on the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, the planned 
missile-defense system known in America as "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Judge Klaus Wagner said that such information would have been 
"decisive" had war ever broken out between the East and the West. "To list all 
the treasonable material would stretch the limits of an oral opinion," Wagner 
said. "The documents filled whole file cabinets at the Stasi office."  
</P>
<P>
 Rupp, who operated under the code name Topaz, also handed over a variety of 
less sensitive documents, including NATO analyses of the strengths and 
weaknesses of various Warsaw Pact forces and reports on such Soviet military 
activities as the invasion of Afghanistan. He made his deliveries every six to 
eight weeks, often leaving his microfilms hidden in cans of Tuborg beer at 
prearranged drop points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupp said he acted according to his personal code of ethics and received no 
money for the secret information. But prosecutors said the Rupps received more 
than $400,000 from the Stasi, including funds to buy a house in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rupp prosecution is one of the most significant among the thousands of 
espionage cases that came into the open after the East German state collapsed 
and many of the files kept by the Stasi were seized and collected in an 
official archive. 
</P>
<P>
 In all of the cases that have gone to trial so far, the accused spies have 
received either jail terms or suspended sentences. But in some key cases, the 
convicted spies have appealed to the German Constitutional Court, arguing that 
they were acting in accordance with the East German laws in force at the time 
and that their convictions under post-unification laws are therefore legally 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupp's case differs, however, because he was a citizen of West Germany who 
broke that country's laws (West Germany's constitution now applies to both 
former states). 
</P>
<P>
 The German authorities were aware as early as 1990 -- when the Stasi files 
were opened -- that there was a super-spy with the code name Topaz. But they 
were unable to identify him at first because the newly jobless Stasi officers 
had destroyed or hidden many crucial files naming their agents and later 
refused to give the names of former agents to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, however, Germany's secret service coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, 
created a sensation by announcing that he had obtained some of the files that 
the Stasi officials hid and that Germany would be able to investigate an 
additional 2,000 spying cases. One of these involved the mysterious Topaz, who 
was located and arrested that July. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Schmidbauer nor anyone else in the German government has explained how 
it got the information leading to Rupp's arrest, but the German newsmagazine 
Der Spiegel has reported that the Central Intelligence Agency somehow recovered 
the relevant Stasi files and brought them to Germany's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old Rupp, who occasionally wept during his trial, told the court 
that he was recruited by the Stasi over a bowl of goulash in late 1967, when as 
a 22-year-old student he had been active in anti-Establishment politics. He 
recalled that after he ate the goulash, he realized he was 50 pfennigs short of 
the bill, and that the man at the next table came to his rescue. A 
life-changing discussion ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a sense of direction," Rupp recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupp's handler-to-be later brought him to East Berlin, asked him to sign a 
pledge to work for the Stasi and to keep its activities secret, and began 
training him. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been in the spy agency's employ for eight years when, with a West 
German security clearance, he went to work in the economics unit at NATO 
headquarters.  
</P>
<P>
 His wife was a secretary at the British military mission in Brussels when the 
couple met, and she testified that although she had first been apolitical, she 
was won over to her husband's views on the international struggle between 
socialism and capitalism. She agreed to help him smuggle documents to East 
Germany and did so under the code name Turquoise from 1972 until 1980, when she 
became disillusioned and quit spying.

NIXON STAMP TO BE ISSUED IN EARLY 1995; POSTAL SERVICE: RELEASE MAINTAINS 
TRADITION OF HONORING A PRESIDENT A YEAR AFTER HIS DEATH. MARILYN MONROE WILL 
ALSO GET FIRST-CLASS TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A memorial stamp bearing a smiling portrait of the late President Richard 
Nixon will be issued early next year, postal officials said Thursday, but 
uncertainty over the first-class postage rate will delay printing for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon will join actress Marilyn Monroe, trumpeter Louis Armstrong and 
chocolatier Milton Hershey, among others, on an eclectic roster of 1995 
commemorative stamp subjects.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon stamp, in keeping with a tradition of honoring all former presidents 
after their deaths, normally would have been issued on his birthday, Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 But its printing will be delayed because the expected January increase from 29 
cents to 32 cents for first-class postage has not yet been approved by the 
independent Postal Rate Commission. (When the expected new rate of 32 cents 
takes effect, the Postal Service will have available large volumes of 
pre-printed stamps, with the letter G, the latest in a series used when rates 
change.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's portrait is based on his official White House photo, but the design by 
Daniel Schwartz incorporates several changes requested by the Nixon family: The 
middle initial M. will be dropped from the name and his suit and tie will be 
darkened. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 million copies of the Nixon stamp will be issued, a standard volume 
for a commemorative stamp. Although he was the only President to resign his 
office and his name is still associated with the Watergate political scandals, 
there was never any doubt that Nixon would be honored along with other 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. William L. Clay (D-Mo.), chairman of the House Post Office Committee, 
complained in a letter to Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. that he was 
unalterably opposed to a Nixon stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon brushed aside the objection last month, telling Clay in a letter that 
"it is a longstanding tradition to feature every President from George 
Washington to Lyndon B. Johnson on commemorative stamps after their death(s). 
Since the turn of the century, the death of a President or former President has 
been marked with the issuance of a memorial stamp the following year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the "spirit" of tradition, Runyon said, "we will feature President Nixon" 
on a stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 While presidents are honored on stamps a year after they die, Postal Service 
rules and traditions dictate that everyone else who is featured on a stamp must 
have been dead for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, President Jimmy Carter, running for reelection, wanted to solidify 
the labor vote by honoring AFL-CIO leader George Meany, who had died not long 
before. When postal officials reminded the White House of the 
dead-for-10-years-or-more rule, a compromise stamp was issued, showing an eagle 
with the slogan, American Labor. Meany, incidentally got his stamp this year, a 
full-face portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service will issue a veritable flood of stamps next year, more than 
100 different stamps. None of them will be as popular as the Elvis Presley 
stamp, which sold 500 million copies last year. The Postal Service made an 
estimated profit of $36 million from Elvis stamps sold to collectors or to fans 
of the rock star, who never used them to mail letters. It costs just a penny to 
print two sheets of 50 stamps. The rest of the price of the stamp is profit if 
it is never put on an envelope for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps are "miniature works of art and symbols of our national heritage," 
Runyon said Thursday as he unveiled the designs of the new issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Four environmental stamps, showing the Earth being washed in a bathtub, a tree 
planting, energy from the sun and children cleaning a beach, will be issued on 
Earth Day. They were designed by students who entered a nationwide competition. 
The winners were Melody Kiper of Shreveport, La.; Jennifer Michalove of 
Stonington, Conn.; Christy Millard of Lakewood, Colo., and Brian Hailes of 
Millville, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 A set of 20 stamps dealing with the Civil War will show Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis on a U.S. stamp for the first time. Abraham Lincoln, who also 
will be featured, has appeared on more than 50 issues.

GOP FACTIONS ANGLE FOR INFLUENTIAL BUDGET POST; LEGISLATORS: HOUSE MILITANTS, 
SENATE MODERATES EACH WANT A SOUL-MATE AT HELM OF CONGRESSIONAL AGENCY. FIGHT 
MAY SET TONE OF A BROADER PARTY BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A critical internal battle is shaping up between the cadre of militant 
Republicans who will control the House next year and their more moderate 
counterparts in the Senate over the appointment of a new director of the 
Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 And the outcome of that struggle, one of the first to emerge since the 
Republican electoral avalanche on Nov. 8, could set the tone for the broader 
fight looming within the party for control of the GOP economic agenda in the 
new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a minor example of what we are going to see from now on, which 
is that there are going to be very serious policy tensions between the Senate 
and House Republicans," noted one source close to the selection process for a 
new chief for the agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The selection of a new CBO director to succeed outgoing Director Robert D. 
Reischauer, whose term expires in January, has become a hot political issue on 
Capitol Hill this week because House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and 
his allies in the House want to install in the powerful post an ideological 
Republican who subscribes to Gingrich's own supply-side philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and probable House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Tex.) believe that 
Reischauer was overly partisan in favor of the Democratic congressional 
leadership. And they believe that they deserve to have one of their own in the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 A conservative supply-sider at the helm of the Budget Office could be expected 
to use the powers of the agency to declare that new tax cuts actually raise 
federal revenue -- and thus would not worsen the deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 House Republican leaders also want a CBO director who shares their belief that 
a capital gains tax cut for corporate America actually would raise tax revenue 
and thus lower the deficit, because it would give businesses an incentive to 
invest more in plant and equipment and hire more workers -- and so create new 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress previously has given the Budget Office the authority to make official 
decisions on such budgetary matters for purposes of complying with the budget 
constraints. So a supply-side ruling from the CBO would enable Republicans to 
cut taxes without forcing them to make offsetting spending cuts that would keep 
the budget within existing budget caps. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more moderate Senate Republican leadership does not go along with the 
budgetary math behind the more conservative House Republican economic agenda 
and is fearful of Gingrich's efforts to exercise political influence at the 
Budget Office to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader-to-be Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and incoming Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete V. Dominici (R-N.M.) apparently are looking for a more 
traditional CBO director who would be able to reassure the nation's financial 
markets that Republicans will not increase the nation's budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Gingrich has approached at least one conservative economist, James C. 
Miller III, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under former 
President Ronald Reagan. But sources said that Miller, who ran unsuccessfully 
against Oliver L. North this year for the Republican senatorial nomination in 
Virginia, is likely to turn down the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican politics in both chambers are already complicating the 
selection process. Normally, the CBO director is chosen jointly by the two 
chairmen of the House and Senate Budget committees. But in the House, Rep. John 
R. Kasich (R-Ohio), the likely Budget chairman, is under fire from conservative 
Republicans because of his vote earlier this year for President Clinton's crime 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasich, who has been the ranking Republican on the budget panel, needs support 
from conservatives to continue to serve in a leadership position and needs to 
show his willingness to cooperate with Gingrich and Armey on budget matters. 
Thus, while he is not a supply-side ideologue, he is expected to allow Gingrich 
and Armey to determine the selection from the House side. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dominici is a traditional Republican who believes that tax cuts need to be 
offset with spending cuts and he can be expected to fight Gingrich on the 
issue. He is said to be urging the selection of Bill Hoaglund, his chief budget 
aide and a moderate on fiscal issues.  
</P>
<P>
 But the issue may not be decided quickly, despite Gingrich's hope to move 
rapidly on the tax and budget elements of the Republican "contract with 
America."  
</P>
<P>
 "Gingrich and Armey got their juices up about this but that was before they 
were aware that there is a normal selection and screening process for choosing 
a CBO director and that this may take time," said one source.  
</P>
<P>
 But even if Gingrich is successful in his bid to remake the CBO into an 
outpost for supply-side thinking, Republicans will still confront sharp limits 
on spending and tax cuts built into current laws.  
</P>
<P>
 The budget rules under a 1990 agreement require that if the OMB finds that the 
spending for a new law exceeds the current budget caps the President must 
impose a "sequester" -- a presidential order that prohibits spending from 
exceeding the specified level. And the Clinton budget office is certain to 
declare that a capital gains tax cut reduces federal revenue -- and thus 
expands the deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 "The sequester is the real hammer and so the Republicans can do what they want 
with CBO, because OMB can make it all moot," said one knowledgeable source.

DEMOCRATS LOSE THEIR VOICE IN WAKE OF GOP TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Call it the "Silence of the Dems." 
</P>
<P>
 With incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Senate Republican leader 
Bob Dole of Kansas and a host of other GOP victors from last week's elections 
saturating the airwaves, the virtual soundlessness of the Democratic leadership 
on Capitol Hill has been deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the silence reflects a conscious tactical decision by 
Democratic leaders on the Hill and at the White House, according to sources who 
requested anonymity. Democrats hope that the flurry of hard-edged Republican 
rhetoric will frighten the public. Why join the debate, the thinking goes, if 
the GOP is doing the job for them? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an interest in them manufacturing enough rope" to hang themselves 
rhetorically, said one Clinton Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many Democrats said they are ceding center stage because they 
want to make clear that Republicans now "own" Congress. They said that 
widespread public dissatisfaction with the institution will now reflect poorly 
on the GOP, rather than on them. 
</P>
<P>
 But their choice of silence over sound bites underscores several fundamental 
problems facing a Democratic Party that suddenly finds itself in the minority 
in both houses of Congress for the first time in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that congressional Democrats are effectively leaderless and there is a 
noticeable lack of enthusiasm about the leading candidates for minority 
leadership positions in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is that many Democrats are still in a state of denial and shock in the 
aftermath of last week's Republican landslide, making it difficult for them to 
mount an effective counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, and perhaps most damning in the view of high-ranking party 
strategists, Democrats in Congress have not yet crafted a coherent alternative 
to the Republicans' aggressive legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is the message itself," conceded one senior Democratic official. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats -- including some senior White House officials -- fear that the 
silent treatment is already hurting their party and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many have just laid down and rolled over; they just cannot get over the fact 
we've lost control of the House," said Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.). "We've got to 
energize our party. . . . We should set up a stage just to communicate we are 
alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the election, the newly ascendant Republicans have dominated 
the public debate. Gingrich, in particular, has given a series of high-profile 
speeches outlining his vision of a GOP-led transformation of American politics, 
beginning with a dramatic restructuring of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the first full week after the midterm elections that swept the 
Republicans to power, not a single leading Democrat called a press conference 
to rebut the Republican onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a few congressional Democrats made the first tentative effort to 
break the silence, promising cooperation with the new GOP majority but warning 
that some conservative Republicans appear to have misread the mandate they 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congressional Democrats acknowledged that they have been too shellshocked 
by the drubbing they suffered and too preoccupied with their own minority 
leadership battles to plot a unified new course for the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) alluded to the Democrats' sheepishness on 
Thursday, telling reporters as he took the podium: "I'm Chris Dodd and I'm a 
Democrat. I know you haven't seen many of us lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.), who is challenging Rep. Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) for the position of House minority leader, conceded that he is having 
difficulty rounding up supporters among elusive House Democrats. "It's been 
very hard to find them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Dodd in the Senate and outgoing House Majority Whip David E. 
Bonoir (D-Mich.) have stepped forward to wave the tattered Democratic flag. "We 
will stand tall and make our case for middle-class and working families," 
Bonoir said at a Thursday briefing.

 About 2,000 people were evacuated from their homes and offices Thursday after 
authorities found a possible bomb attached to two large propane tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomb squad members removed the device and rendered it safe at about 6:30 p.m., 
said Lt. Herb Davidson of the Shasta County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators planned to dismantle the bomb, which appeared to be a "genuine 
explosive device," Davidson said. Authorities would not describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 The device caused concern because it was attached to the propane tanks and an 
explosion could have devastated everything for several blocks, said Sheriff's 
Sgt. Arlin Markin. 
</P>
<P>
 All homes and businesses within a one-mile radius of the industrial area south 
of downtown were evacuated after authorities discovered the bomb Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those evacuated were allowed to return Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities discovered the device after an anonymous caller directed deputies 
to the site shortly after 8 a.m.

BUDGET CUTS LEFT FBI SHORT ON AMMO, FREEH SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, in an unusually frank assessment of the bureau's 
shortcomings, Thursday issued a report condemning "make-work" practices that he 
inherited at the agency and branding as "sheer lunacy" budget cutbacks that 
left agents without ammunition for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 69-page report sent to all FBI field offices, Freeh outlined efforts to 
resolve these problems and described an array of fundamental changes that he 
has introduced since becoming director in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is unprecedented because previous FBI directors have not openly 
discussed bureau problems or detailed their efforts to obtain millions of 
dollars more for the organization than the Administration sought during an 
intense budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was long FBI policy to simply transfer to a make-work job or backwater 
those who did not have the ability to lead or to carry out the heavy 
responsibilities borne by each FBI employee," Freeh said in the message, a copy 
of which was provided to The Times. "No more." 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI is not going to have a broken-wing brigade of people who won't do 
their jobs -- thus pushing even more work on the vast majority of FBI employees 
who are dedicated and productive," Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after taking over the FBI, Freeh said, Clinton Administration 
officials proposed a budget that would have cut 540 agents from the bureau's 
work force. But, he said, the officials later realized that the reductions 
would have been "a dire step . . . that would have sharply reduced the FBI's 
effectiveness in fighting crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though those funds were restored, the Administration's fiscal 1995 budget 
did not provide for hiring any new agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the situation as intolerable, Freeh said that he had gone to 
"members of Congress time and time again to plead the FBI's case for more 
resources. I also reminded them that Congress itself had given the FBI the 
responsibility for enforcement against a range of new federal offenses." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Congress budgeted $2.204 billion for the FBI in fiscal 1995, some 
$75.8 million more than the Administration had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh said that the additional funds will allow the FBI to add 640 agents by 
fiscal 1996, returning the agency to the peak strength level it reached in 1992 
of 10,475 agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he has been asked "why I strayed from Administration requests and 
sought more funding for the FBI," Freeh cited two additional "shocking 
reasons." He said that agents did not have adequate body armor or enough 
ammunition to conduct target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every citizen -- to say nothing of public officials -- should try to imagine 
the dangers, the sheer lunacy, of FBI agents not even having enough bullets," 
Freeh wrote. "That is intolerable and will not be allowed to recur." 
</P>
<P>
 Ammunition for target practice has since been increased 25%, to 1,000 rounds a 
year for each agent, Freeh noted. And planning has begun to develop a body 
armor system with enhanced protection for daily use. 
</P>
<P>
 In commenting on his first year of command, Freeh used blunt terms to condemn 
an incident that took place shortly before he took over: The attempt by 
Associate White House Counsel William H. Kennedy III to call the FBI directly 
to start an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by employees of the White House 
travel office. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, a former law partner of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was 
reprimanded last year after an internal White House review concluded that he 
had improperly pressured the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unfortunate incident and an example of matters that we will avoid 
at all costs," Freeh said.

CLERIC ACCUSED IN N.Y. BOMB PLOT IS HOSPITALIZED WITH PNEUMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric charged with plotting to 
bomb the United Nations and other Manahttan landmarks was hospitalized Thursday 
suffering from pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Rahman, 56, who has diabetes and heart disease, had been undergoing 
treatment for the pneumonia in prison where he and 12 other defendants are 
awaiting trial. But after his condition worsened, physicians decided it was 
necessary he receive intensified therapy and diagnostic tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Emanuel A. Moore, an attorney representing the sheik, said that federal Judge 
Michael B. Mukasey will determine at a hearing on Monday whether the trial 
scheduled to start Nov. 28 will have to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If his condition persists, it will cause a delay," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Moore visited with Abdul Rahman, and later said the sheik "was not 
in good shape at all" and the cleric had been given medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Rahman has been imprisoned more than a year on charges he headed a 
bombing and assassination conspiracy against the United States. According to 
the indictment, the targets included not only the United Nations building on 
Manhattan's East Side, but the Lincoln and Holland tunnels linking New York 
with New Jersey and the federal building containing the New York field office 
of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also charged the terrorists planned to assassinate Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak during a visit to Manhattan, and to kill or kidnap 
public officials in a scheme to force the release of sympathizers from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the suspects were seized as they mixed explosives in a garage in 
Queens, the FBI said, and others were added to the conspiracy later. The 
arrests were an outgrowth of the investigation of the bombing on Feb. 26, 1993, 
of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured more than 1,000. 
Four defendants were convicted in that case and each was sentenced to 240 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against the sheik relies primarily on recordings secretly taped by 
the sheik's former bodyguard, Emad Ali Salem, who is the government's chief 
informant in the case.

JURY DEADLOCKS OVER FLORIDA TOURIST SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the trial of a teen-ager accused of 
killing English tourist Gary Colley and wounding his girlfriend in a botched 
robbery at a highway rest stop in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked after deliberating the fate of John (Billy Joe) Crumitie, 
17, for about six hours.A retrial was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Colley's girlfriend, Margaret Jagger, 36, began crying after the announcement 
and declined to comment. Crumitie's mother, Susie Mae Johnson, joined about 20 
relatives and friends in the courtroom. She also would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Colley was the ninth tourist killed in Florida in a 13-month period. Jagger 
was wounded in the attack, which attracted international headlines, damaged 
Florida's $31-billion tourism industry and spurred state lawmakers to approve 
major reforms in Florida's juvenile-justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-member jury included a former classmate and former teacher of Crumitie. 
If he had been convicted of murder, Crumitie faced life in prison.

OUSTED LAWMAKERS TO WALK AWAY WITH HUGE PENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), the first House Speaker to lose reelection in a 
century, heads the list of ousted congressmen who will take huge pensions with 
them when they leave the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 With 32 years of government service, Foley is eligible to begin collecting 
$123,804 a year starting in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the more than three dozen lawmakers rejected on Election Day are 
immediately entitled to pensions ranging from about $35,000 to more than 
$100,000, according to estimates calculated by the National Taxpayers Union, a 
Washington-based group that advocates lower government spending and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying for pensions of $96,462 a year, according to the group, are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
who awaits trial on public corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), upset in his reelection bid after 46 years of 
government service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Neal Smith (D-Iowa), who has 39 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 If Foley, Rostenkowski, Smith and Brooks reach their respective ages of life 
expectancy -- 80 to 85 -- their four pensions alone will have cost taxpayers 
nearly $9 million, the taxpayers group says. 
</P>
<P>
 The various congressional plans also have other benefits not available to many 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Those include early retirement ages (as young as 50), fewer years of service 
to be vested (usually five) and a mandatory adjustment for inflation. Most 
private pension plans don't adjust for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pension figures aren't readily available on Capitol Hill. But the NTU annually 
provides its own estimates based on surveys it takes of members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers who declined to provide the information are assumed to be in the 
main civil service pension program for the purpose of the estimates, the group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Big pensions also await some lawmakers who retired, including Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.), who can begin collecting $110,538 a year in January. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Senate side, retiring Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) is 
eligible for an $84,595 pension beginning in January.

ANTHRAX DEATHS TIED TO SOVIET LAB; BIOLOGICAL WARFARE: FINDING BY U.S., RUSSIAN 
RESEARCHERS RAISES POSSIBILITY THAT INTERNATIONAL TREATY WAS BROKEN IN 1979 
OUTBREAK THAT KILLED 68 PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unusual anthrax epidemic that killed 68 people in the former Soviet Union 
began when the deadly spores escaped from a covert military microbiology 
facility, Russian and American researchers have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work, based on two years of interviews with survivors of the 1979 
outbreak in Sverdlovsk and unique access to Russian public health records, 
raises the possibility that one of the most controversial chapters in Cold War 
history arose from experiments that violated an international accord forbidding 
biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sverdlovsk epidemic is the largest documented anthrax outbreak of its 
kind. Thousands may have been infected by rare airborne anthrax disease spores, 
which can cause high fever, convulsions, lung lesions and, in severe cases, 
rapid death. 
</P>
<P>
 In an international debate over the incident, U.S. officials at the time 
charged that the outbreak resulted from an accident at a military plant that 
was mass-producing the anthrax bacterium. Soviet and Russian officials argued 
for 10 years that the townspeople had been infected by eating diseased meat or 
other causes.  
</P>
<P>
 In research made public today in the journal Science, Russian and U.S. 
scientists confirmed that the infection was spread by the wind, pinpointed the 
day the anthrax spores escaped and traced the outbreak to its source: a 
military microbiology facility known simply as Compound 19, which U.S. 
scientists suspect is still in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitive proof," said Harvard University biologist Matthew 
Meselson, who led the research team.  
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. diplomatic official in Washington, who asked not to be identified, 
noted that the formal treaty violation is still an open issue. He said he hoped 
that the new evidence concerning the origin of the epidemic would "encourage 
further openness by the Russian government." 
</P>
<P>
 Several countries, including England, experimented with anthrax as a weapon in 
the past, but all stocks of military microbes were destroyed under the 
provisions of a 100-nation arms control treaty in 1972, experts said.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States, Soviet Union and other governments that signed the treaty 
reserved the right to produce such lethal microbes and viruses to conduct 
research into defensive measures, such as vaccines and protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, U.S. Defense Department spending on genetic engineering research into 
such epidemic weapons as anthrax, Rift Valley fever, Lhassa fever and Q fever 
increased sixfold during the 1980s to $90 million a year in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compound 19 laboratory may have been performing such experiments when a 
biological weapon exploded or an accidental release occurred through an air 
filter, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same facilities and the same people are to some extent still there. We 
would like to know what they are doing," Meselson said. "We need to know 
whether the work there was a perfectly legitimate defensive thing or weapons 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Meselson, who first investigated the incident as a consultant for the Central 
Intelligence Agency, helped debunk earlier charges that the Soviet Union had 
waged biological warfare with so-called "yellow rain" in Laos, Cambodia and 
Afghanistan. Until recently, he was a leading critic of U.S. charges about the 
Sverdlovsk epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cooperation of the current Russian government, the team found that 
facts were hard to come by.  
</P>
<P>
 When the outbreak first became public 15 years ago, the KGB confiscated the 
medical records and autopsy reports. The city was placed under military 
quarantine. Researchers believe that the Soviet military authorities concealed 
the cause of the outbreak from local public health officials and doctors trying 
to treat the sick and dying. 
</P>
<P>
 But during two visits last year to the city -- now known by its 
pre-revolutionary name of Ekaterinburg -- researchers found local families 
eager to cooperate. The local chief of hospital pathology also provided key 
medical evidence she had concealed from the security squads.  
</P>
<P>
 "The families did not know why their loved ones had died," said Jeanne 
Guillemin, a Boston College sociologist who conducted many of the interviews. 
"I can't think of a single interview in which they did not cry. I cannot think 
of an interview in which we did not cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris Yeltsin has acknowledged that the outbreak stemmed 
from "our military developments." But Russian officials overseeing chemical and 
biological weapons disarmament still deny that the infection originated at the 
military lab.

PROP. 187 LEADER FILES BANKRUPTCY PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald S. Prince, the Proposition 187 campaign co-chairman, has filed for 
personal bankruptcy, with most of his $313,700 debt made up of expenses from 
the successful anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Prince's unpaid creditors, according to the Chapter 7 petition filed in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, is former Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Commissioner Alan C. Nelson, who is listed as being owed $36,000.A campaign 
finance report filed earlier this year showed Nelson billed the campaign 
$26,000 for consulting services, work which included co-authoring Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single creditor reported in Prince's bankruptcy petition is Yorba 
Linda campaign consultant Robert Kiley, who is owed $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince states in his petition that his assets -- including a 1986 Buick, $200 
cash and other personal items -- total $3,950. Supported by his family and 
living rent-free in a Tustin home, Prince said his income during the last three 
years was in the form of gifts totaling $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The last campaign finance report filed before the Nov. 8 election by the 
Proposition 187 campaign committee showed that it had raised $484,188 and spent 
$582,352, with an outstanding debt of $297,691. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the Proposition 187 campaign, finance reports listed Prince as the 
donor of a $20,000 loan to the campaign. However, caught up in a legal battle 
with his former attorney, who was seeking payment for a $9,600 legal bill, 
Prince told an Orange County Superior Court judge last month that he had no 
assets and that the $20,000 loan was actually made by his father, Downey 
businessman Leland Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Prince's petition to settle his debts through asset liquidation 
was filed Monday, a day before he was due back in Superior Court to show proof 
that the $20,000 campaign loan was made by his father.

IN THE DRAW; THE AMERICAN ANIMATION INSTITUTE IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD GIVES ASPIRING 
ARTISTS A NUTS-AND-BOLTS EDUCATION IN THE CARTOONING BUSINESS.

 Every Wednesday at dusk, Dwight Hwang of Roseville, Calif., drives to the 
municipal airport 40 miles from home to catch a plane bound for Burbank about 
400 miles away. The 20-year-old aspiring artist is a part-time student at a 
Sacramento-area community college. But even so, Hwang has joined the ranks of 
Southwest Airlines frequent fliers to take classes at the American Animation 
Institute (AAI) in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang hopes to gain acceptance to CalArts' animation program. But an adviser 
at the prestigious college in Valencia told him he needed a stronger portfolio. 
The adviser suggested classes at AAI. As a result, Hwang now travels nearly the 
length of the state in a 24-hour period each week. "Considering the prices for 
air fare and the classes, it beats moving into an apartment," said Hwang, who 
lives with his parents in Roseville. 
</P>
<P>
 AAI is little-known outside the animation industry, but the school has been 
steadily gaining recognition as a solid training facility for would-be 
Hollywood animators. It has been operated since 1980 by a labor union, the 
Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists and Affiliated Optical Electronic and Graphic 
Arts, Local 839 of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage

 "We recommend that people take classes there all the time," said Bill 
Matthews, manager of artist development, California, for Walt Disney Co.'s 
feature animation department. 
</P>
<P>
 Several colleges and universities in the United States and Canada offer 
classes and programs on the art of animation, but AAI is believed to be the 
only facility in the country offering such low-cost, practical animation 
training. Its mostly 12-week courses are a bargain at $70 a term (it will jump 
to $80 in February). And while art colleges require students to gain knowledge 
in art history and theory, usually taught by career academics, AAI's curriculum 
is strictly nuts-and-bolts animation, dispensed by industry professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basic animation mechanics," for example, lays out how to use animation "bars 
and peg" systems, the method animators use to assemble scenes. "In-betweening 
and assistant animation" covers the duties of those who toil in the animation 
industry's entry-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall semester ends Monday. Classes will resume Feb. 13, with the exception 
of one introductory class that starts Jan. 3. Students who wish to sign up send 
their names and addresses to AAI, then wait for the school to send out 
registration cards. After that, class positions are assigned based on who gets 
their checks in first. 
</P>
<P>
 Space is tight. For more popular courses, such as figure drawing, the school 
receives twice as many applicants as it can accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is also egalitarian. It requires students to take an overview of 
screen cartooning and basic animation mechanics as prerequisites for most of 
its other courses. But classes are open on a first-come, first-served basis to 
any high school graduate 18 and older. The institute doesn't scrutinize 
portfolios or evaluate a student's record before granting admission. It also 
doesn't provide career counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At present, about 350 students a year are going through introductory classes, 
which typically contain 25 to 30 students. Parking in the area is a nightmare, 
with Lankershim Boulevard under Metro Rail construction. There is no student 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Next term, the school will expand its daytime curriculum to include more 
classes in sketching, drawing and painting. It typically offers about 14 
classes a term. 
</P>
<P>
 AAI is expanding because the industry needs trained workers. Traditionally, 
animation has been a boom-and-bust business -- stints of intense activity as 
new projects get going, followed by bouts of unemployment. But some believe 
that pattern may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood studios are engaged in an animation hiring frenzy, with the industry 
in the throes of the largest boom ever in the field. Blockbuster movies, such 
as Disney's "The Lion King," "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast," have 
prompted other major studios, such as 20th Century Fox, Universal and Warner 
Bros. to step up production of animated features. The new 
Spielberg-Geffen-Katzenberg studio is expected to produce animated fare as 
well. Disney, for example, typically uses 300 to 400 artists for four years to 
produce an animated feature. 
</P>
<P>
 TV animation is also growing, with cartoons now established on network prime 
time and a host of cable TV outlets, such as Ted Turner's Cartoon Network. And 
the emerging multimedia technologies, such as CD-ROM and video games, present a 
potentially enormous outlet. "It's fat city," said Tom Sito, a Disney senior 
animator who is president of the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jet-setting Hwang of Roseville isn't the only student to travel great 
distances to attend AAI. It has attracted aspiring animators from as far away 
as Alaska, New Mexico and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 But remember, this is animation education on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the ivy-covered halls and sculpture gardens of traditional arts 
campuses. Classes take place in the drab confines of a cluttered, former real 
estate office that's been the union's home since 1980. It's a modest, two-story 
affair on a distinctly unglamorous stretch in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 And AAI doesn't issue diplomas or certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Sito acknowledges, "the school's not much to look at." But 
despite its appearance, it conforms to animation's long tradition of passing 
down the art from master to apprentice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Tataranowicz, executive producer at New World Animation, has taken 
life-drawing classes at the school for several semesters to brush up his art 
skills. He's also recruited workers from AAI for positions in storyboard 
cleanup and background design. "I need people who can hit the ground running," 
said Tataranowicz. 
</P>
<P>
 While industry pros praise the school's practical, no-nonsense approach, they 
also say it has limitations. Disney's Matthews, who acts as a training manager 
and animation talent scout for the studio, said the classes succeed because 
they're focused on industry needs. But students must realize that opening doors 
in Hollywood requires more than simply taking instruction at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The real test is not just completing a class at the union, but having a 
portfolio that shows sufficient drawing skills," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for positions in animation is brutal, according to Matthews, who 
culls through 12 to 15 portfolios a day from job-seekers. About only one in 
four shows sufficient skill to earn further consideration by Disney's 80-person 
animation review board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many at prestigious art schools look down at AAI. "That's a trade school," 
said Jules Engel, founding director of experimental animation at CalArts.  
</P>
<P>
 AAI churns out students who learn the mechanics of animation, but never 
develop a personal vision, he said. "When you hire a 'how to do it' person, 
talent never reveals itself," Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of AAI's 14 part-time instructors is animator Glenn Vilppu, a former 
CalArts instructor who has trained many industry notables. He said AAI's 
students simply work harder than many he taught at CalArts. "They're here to 
learn. Students here are more realistic and down-to-earth," said Vilppu. 
</P>
<P>
 One such down-to-earth and fairly typical student is John Gibson, 36. The 
bearded, aspiring artist, who makes his living as a waiter, has taken drawing, 
in-betweening, storyboarding and other classes at AAI. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to be a professional animator and has assembled a portfolio, with 
guidance from some of his instructors. He's knocked on many studio doors. And 
he's faced frequent rejection. "I've been turned down by the best," said a 
barefoot, ponytail-sporting Gibson, relaxing during a half-hour break in 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyn Mantta, the office manager for the cartoonists union who some have 
nicknamed the "dean" of AAI, said the school's students defy categorization. 
Some are naive young people who dream of being part of the sometimes dazzling 
art form. Some are seeking a career change. Others are already working in 
animation, taking classes to sharpen skills. 
</P>
<P>
 So for those who aspire to break into animation or move up the career ladder, 
AAI can play a role, but only a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got talent, you work at it, and you're lucky you can make it," 
Mantta said. ". . . But it's still Hollywood." WHERE AND WHEN

SHARING A CROP OF TUNES; THE SONG FARMERS, A THREE-PERSON WRITING AND SINGING 
COLLECTIVE, SAVOR SMALL VENUES SUCH AS LE CAFE.

 Most of us recognize Ronny Cox's face when we see it. The tall, fair-skinned 
actor has had featured roles in such major films as "Beverly Hills Cop," 
"Beverly Hills Cop II," "RoboCop," "Total Recall" and "Deliverance." 
</P>
<P>
 But what's not so well known about Cox is that he's also a singer-songwriter 
with an album out on Mercury Records. His country tunes have been described as 
having a modern Hoagy Carmichael feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is a member of Song Farmers, a three-person singer-songwriter collective 
that also includes Wendy Waldman and Brad Parker. Waldman has written many hit 
songs, among them "Baby, What About You," recorded by Crystal Gayle, "Save the 
Best For Last" and the brand-new "The Sweetest Days." The latter two were both 
recorded by Vanessa Williams and co-written with Jon Lind and Phil Galdston. 
Parker, Waldman's husband, has composed numerous tunes that have reached 
semi-hit status in the country genre. 
</P>
<P>
 The three, who appear Tuesday at Le Cafe (and again Dec. 13), believe it's 
essential for people who write songs to perform them, specifically in small 
venues such as Le Cafe, which seats 60 to 70 people and where intimacy is a 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear a song in a concert or on radio or in a movie, there's a big 
wall between you and the music," says Parker, who lives in Encino with Waldman. 
"When you come and sit in Le Cafe, it's like being in your living room. We're 
all there together and that's a more primal way of sharing. With people right 
next to you, there's a human exchange that's sublime. We're trying to encourage 
more -- and big name -- songwriters to do this, get back to their roots and 
connect with real people." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman adds: "It's a way of getting back to what music is all about for us."  
</P>
<P>
 Song Farmers appears monthly at Le Cafe as part of the room's ongoing Acoustic 
Songwriter Nights. The affair is modeled after now legendary happenings at the 
Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, Tenn. There, beginning in 1983, such noted 
singer-songwriters as Don Schlitz, who wrote "The Gambler," a huge hit for 
Kenny Rogers, and several other composers performed. They'd arrange chairs in a 
circle and, with just their guitars as accompaniment, they'd sing their songs 
to each other and a small group of enthusiastic listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People love to know the origins of a song, how the ideas led to it, and these 
guys would tell a little bit about their songs," explains Cox, who lives in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At Le Cafe, Waldman, Parker and Cox perform with guest artists they invite. As 
at the Bluebird, each composer performs songs with simple guitar accompaniment. 
"There is no band," says Waldman. "We are the band." 
</P>
<P>
 The repertoire varies. Cox, who calls his tastes "eclectic," says he might 
"try out a new song, or take an old song and put a new spin on it." Parker, who 
has composed pop/rock tunes with what he calls "beat poet" lyrics, might play 
his originals or a country tune co-written with his wife. Waldman occasionally 
sings some of her earlier material -- she's written about 500 songs and in the 
mid-1970s she recorded several of her own albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Though each member of Song Farmers is busy with other activities -- Cox is 
starring in the NBC series "Sweet Justice" and Waldman is concocting songs for 
Clive Barker's new film, "The Thief of Always" -- they make their gatherings at 
Le Cafe a top priority. "We do it each month religiously. I don't want to miss 
it," says Waldman. Adds Cox, "It's a hard, cold day when one of us isn't 
there."  
</P>
<P>
 A number of other singer-songwriter nights are popping up in the Los Angeles 
area, at such clubs as Highland Grounds and Genghis Cohen. Waldman sees this 
trend as a means for her and her fellow composers to validate the musical 
riches of a town that is often denigrated in comparison to Nashville or New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, I feel a real obligation to myself and my community to go out 
there and be accessible, be seen playing music. It's healthy," she says. "For a 
long time, it's been fashionable to hate L.A., but I feel very proud to be an 
L.A. songwriter. The town is full of tough, adventurous musicians, and they've 
been bullied into not having any civic pride (in regard to their music). That's 
one of the reasons I do Song Farmers." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; 'CONFESSION' AN ACT OF FAITH; CARE RATHER THAN RAGE AT THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH MOTIVATE PLAY AT ROAD THEATRE, WHICH AGAIN DISPLAYS COMMITMENT 
TO NEW MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes frequently about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The people at the Road Theatre, bless them, remain firmly committed to plays 
no one has seen before, and to playwrights you may never have heard of. This 
has always been the most meaningful and most dangerous of theater missions, and 
the mission is never clearer than when a theater like the Road stages a new 
play like Douglas Scott Delaney's "My Last Confession." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the rare Catholic plays written not out of rage but care and concern, 
"My Last Confession" is also a piece of Clintonian dramatics -- it wants to 
please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come for comedy, you'll get that (especially in an Act I trying too 
hard to be a sitcom). 
</P>
<P>
 If you come for social drama, you'll get that too (especially in an Act II 
tackling the dilemma of gay Catholics). 
</P>
<P>
 If you come for a lampooning of the church, you'll find it in jolly, naughty 
Father Dunne (Richard Herd), who used to blare Bob Dylan from the pulpit and 
easily falls asleep during confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come for a religious play, you'll get it as well, again from Father 
Dunne, who explains to inflexible Father Nuevos (Javi Mulero) that the church 
exists as an open home to those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Catholic Church Delaney clearly believes in -- and hopes for -- 
and his story is a playing out of certain fantasies, such as that a priest like 
Nuevos would loosen his "stiff white collar" and actually marry two gay men 
desperate for the Church's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 A more secular playwright would have gay characters Alec (Scott Utley) and 
Robert (Robert Clements) just dump the faith and find their bliss in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But where David Hare's just-closed "Racing Demon," views a Church sunk by 
secular bureaucracy, "My Last Confession" believes in a Church that can come 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaney's faith is by far the play's most interesting element, but it's 
consistently muddled by his insistence on throwing in comedy whenever the mood 
strikes him. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of play in which you're guaranteed that a serious scene will 
be followed by a light one, even if it's not as funny as Delaney thinks it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor, pummeled New Yorkers stumbling into St. Martin's Cathedral -- 
Stephanie E. Lesh's hysterical Emily, Michael Ashe's laconic, homeless Lloyd, 
Eve Brent's suicidal Mrs. Levitt -- form a cartoon gallery of the poor. We 
never really feel their pain amid all the slapstick, and with only one visible 
Latino communicant (Robyn Rice), it's hard to believe that this is even a 
Latino neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaney also packs in far too many issues and pieces of business, including 
the inevitable priest-to-be doubting his career track (John Paul Saurine, in a 
distinctly sensitive performance). 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dunne, of course, is lovable for frequently dozing off or playing with 
his ventriloquist dummy near the altar, but he comes through to deliver the 
true faith when the chips are down. He's a priest out of the old 1930s 
Hollywood -- sentimental and socially decent. Which sums up "My Last 
Confession." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Taylor Gilbert can't make Delaney's play into something more of a 
piece, and it's not always clear how people are entering and exiting the large 
church area ambitiously designed by Dan Weingarten. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert has Herd, his cheery disposition and peaceful permanence providing 
a solid craft that floats on the play's choppy waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulero is stuck with the stiff-collar business, but he makes you believe. So 
do Utley and Clements, and you wish their story didn't take so long to get to. 
</P>
<P>
 The Road knows that new plays are about beginnings, and Delaney's has just 
begun. We just hope it doesn't end up on television. WHERE AND WHEN

FOR KIDS; HOLIDAY WORD PLAY; SHARI SACK, WHO READS ALOUD ON SATURDAYS AT PAGES 
BOOKS, WILL HAVE A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR HANUKKAH.

 Growing up in an Irish-Catholic home, young Mary Elizabeth never would have 
dreamed that exposing her son to stories about Hanukkah would be important to 
her. The "miracle of lights" was meaningless, until she married her husband, 
David, and became Beth Abramson a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life can really throw you a curveball. Neither one of us want to thrust our 
religion onto our son, yet we want to give him an understanding of both. It's a 
tricky business," said Abramson, of Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, a friend told me about Pages Books, where they offer a story time 
for both (Christmas and Hanukkah)," she said. Abramson took her 4-year-old, 
Josh, to the Hanukkah reading, and called it "a wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, storyteller Shari Sack will present "Lights, Latkes and Love" at 11 
a.m., Nov. 26, at Pages Books for Children and Young Adults in Tarzana. The 
readings and activities that follow are geared to children from ages 3 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are lucky to have her talents," said Darlene Daniel, owner of Pages. 
"Shari glows when she works. She has a natural ability to engage the children's 
interest, then take it a step further. She helps them connect the stories to 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Sack has been the regular Saturday storyteller for six years. With a passion 
for books and oral interpretation, she attended Cal State Northridge, intending 
to become a trial lawyer but opting to pursue a career in restaurant 
management, before she married and started a family. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until her daughter, now 10, began kindergarten that she came upon 
her true calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right from the beginning, reading to my children was a tremendous part of my 
life," said Sack, who also has a 7-year-old son. "When my daughter started 
school, the teacher allowed me to come in and read aloud. I loved it as much as 
the kids. I started developing a style." 
</P>
<P>
 Sack's affiliation with Pages has enabled her to perfect her craft. Each week, 
the store provides her with a theme and the materials.  
</P>
<P>
 "Reading or telling a story is a profoundly personal experience. It's so much 
more than flatly repeating words. It's patterns and repetitions and something 
kids can keep forever," said Sack, who is living in Encino while earthquake 
repairs are being done on her Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 As in years past, this Hanukkah story time will present books that focus on 
the joys of celebrating family cultural traditions -- the making of latkes 
(potato pancakes), lighting of the menorah and playing dreidel games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sack will read such stories as Eric Kimmel's "Hershel and the Hanukkah 
Goblins," Jane Breskin Zalben's "Papa's Latkes," Malka Penn's "The Miracle of 
Potato Latkes" and Leslie Kimmelman's "Hanukkah Lights, Hanukkah Nights."  
</P>
<P>
 "I really learned that the story of Hanukkah is indeed a beautiful one," said 
Abramson, who plans on attending the story time again this year. "It's so 
universal. It's about bad triumphing over good. It's about a miracle." WHERE 
AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Lights, Latkes and Love," a reading of Hanukkah stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Pages Books for Children and Young Adults, 18399 Ventura Blvd., 
Tarzana. 
</P>

 Price: Free, with a $3 activity fee for materials that can be applied to any

CLUB SCENE; WARMED UP WITH COFFEE, SMILES, JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the weather gets cold, most people tend to bundle up and stay in to wait 
out the winter. But Priscilla's Gourmet Coffee, Tea & Gifts in Toluca Lake is 
one good reason to brave the chill and go out. People are greeted with warm 
smiles, a hot cup of coffee and an occasional massage from the employees to 
take the chill out of gloveless hands. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The large coffee bar in the middle of the room is an indication 
that Priscilla's is serious about its java. But that's only part of the 
attraction. One wall is lined with mugs of all kinds for sale -- with designs 
from artwork to Zodiac signs and just about everything in between. There's also 
a wide variety of coffees and teas for sale.  
</P>
<P>
 THE JAVA: Jim Hechim is the resident barista, or coffee bartender. Co-owner of 
a coffeehouse in Seattle before he moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting, he 
teaches fellow employees to treat the coffee as an art form. "Coffeehouses out 
here are ruining it," he said. "Everybody wants to make the money, but no one 
wants to learn the art, the terminology." He experiments with different tastes 
and wants to build a reputation for Priscilla's. "It's like Cheers, but with 
coffee. And we know their drinks, if not their names." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: On a recent Friday night Phil Upchurch entertained the audience 
with what he described as "jazz with a deep sensitivity to the blues." The gig 
is one "you don't do for the money," he said. "You do it for the intimacy of 
the crowd." Charles Miller, 28, of Burbank came after hearing of the guitarist 
through his mother. "It's far more than I expected," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The average age is mid-20s to mid-30s. The majority of the patrons 
are professionals, usually industry types from nearby studios. "It's a home for 
everybody who, instead of being alone, they come here. It's the best coffee in 
town and the crowd is always friendly," said Debbe Dunning, who plays Heidi the 
Tool Time Girl on the TV sitcom "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: The people are friendly and open to newcomers and the atmosphere is 
casual. Raine Giliberto, 39, said she makes an effort to come each morning on 
her way to work as well as some evenings. "I go out of my way because of the 
cute guys and the coffee," the Van Nuys resident said.  
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Most of the crowd enjoyed the intimate atmosphere, but one Alhambra 
resident thought it was a bit small. Bonnie Henderson, 37, said she'd like it 
"if someone would come around and order me some coffee." In a place where 
patrons often have to wade through tables to stand in an ill-defined line, hers 
was one vote for table service. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: After telling the crowd that he planned to sing one of the last 
songs of his more than two-hour instrumental set, Upchurch joked, "That's a 
treat to get you to stay. Or a warning so you can leave."

COVER STORY; VIDEO LEGIONS; BOYS, AVID FANS OF THE GAMES, CRAVE THE FAST 
ACTION, SNAPPY GRAPHICS -- AND BLOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Video game junkies call it "graphic candy." Computerized artwork and 
photographic realism. Three-dimensional figures who punch and shoot their way 
across the screen with pinpoint brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Kelly Mower craves. A slight young boy from Encino, he owns a Sega 
Genesis and two different Nintendo systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best game?" he asked. "Mortal Kombat II. There's fighting. There's 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
 There is technology. Technology sweetens the graphic candy. The new breed of 
video games pack high-speed microprocessors, graphic engines and digital sound, 
all of which put the gleam in a gamer's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graphics are going to suck you in," explained David Winding, an editor at 
Diehard GameFan magazine. "Then, how is the experience once you're brought in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Donkey Kong Country, arriving in stores on Monday, blankets you in a dazzling 
snowstorm. Sonic & Knuckles gives you the agility to climb walls. And Mortal 
Kombat II blesses you with the strength to rip your opponent asunder and watch 
the blood spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finishing moves," little Mower chirped. "You cut off their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what the gamers, the hard-core players, want. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine them, millions of glassy-eyed boys crouched in the glow of their 
television sets and computer screens, madly fingering plastic game paddles. The 
image is not far from true -- most players are boys ages 8 to 18. They spend 
hours each day honing their skills, scratching toward the top level. And they 
are legion. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spend an estimated $6 billion a year on video games, which is more 
than they spend to go to the movies. Sega and Nintendo, the undisputed champs 
of the industry, occupy an estimated four of 10 United States households. 
Meanwhile, upstart multimedia machines such as Atari's Jaguar and Panasonic's 
REAL 3DO have arrived on a wave of hype. And personal computers, a category 
unto themselves, spin games into millions more living rooms and dens. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, shoppers will have thousands of game titles and dozens of 
game-playing systems to choose from this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 For most adults, navigating this scene will be as bewildering as piloting 
heavy cruisers on a deep recon mission toward the Zeeman-Vela star cluster. 
Gamers say that Super Nintendo gives good graphics while Sega Genesis plays 
more smoothly. Panasonic's REAL packs custom graphics and sound processors for 
even better look and play, but doesn't offer as many games. With computers, 
technical matters of random-access memory and monitor quality must be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 As for all those games, it's a jungle out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many games," said Harry Myerson, owner of Who's On First, a Canoga Park 
shop. Myerson warned: If you make the wrong decision, you get stuck with a dud. 
He pointed to the recently released NHL '95. "It's actually a step backward 
from NHL '94." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood is the only sure bet. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 survey published in the Clinical Pediatrics journal asked a group of 
Midwestern children and teens to list their favorite games. Martial arts and 
shoot-'em-ups predominated, accounting for more than half of the preferred 
titles. Educational games accounted for less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Diehard GameFan polled its readers and found similar 
preferences. Fighting games such as Mortal Kombat II and Final Fantasy III lead 
the pack, followed by sports and role-playing titles. A recent issue of 
Computer Gaming World magazine listed Doom, with its "Knee-Deep in the Dead" 
difficulty level, as the most popular choice for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody plays it," said Terry Coleman, an assistant editor. "We named it 
our game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a new tongue-in-cheek video game release, Earthworm Jim, features a 
battling genus Lumbricus. But gore is not the whole story. Gamers also crave 
action. While the rest of us struggle with the first level of Columns, the true 
players have tapped into a shared logic that allows them to decipher a game's 
intricacies and secret maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Greg Kindred tested the new Beavis and Butt-head at the 
Game Dude shop in North Hollywood. Within minutes, the Sun Valley teen had 
mastered various skateboard tricks and offensive yet high-scoring bodily 
functions. Nearby, Wayne Sanford browsed through racks of new titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has got to be a long game and it has got to be challenging," said Sanford, 
12, of North Hollywood. Ecco the Dolphin is his current favorite. "It is not 
something you can get through the first day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreting out worthwhile games becomes a contest in itself. With new titles 
costing up to $70, it entails no small gamble. Jordan Brandt, 7, of Woodland 
Hills listens for word of mouth or waits for someone else to make the first 
move. "You can play them at a friend's house to see if you like them," he said. 
Kevin Syre, 12, of Sherman Oaks reads Electronic Gaming Monthly and other trade 
magazines for reviews and announcements. And, like others, he visits arcades to 
sacrifice a few quarters in the name of research. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game that does well in the arcades will come out as a video game later on," 
said Alex Mortazavi, owner of Game City in Sherman Oaks. "The kids come here 
asking for it, so I know in advance which games I should stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Weingarten, 6, of West Hills has his eye on the new Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers. "I'm saving up my allowance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are less determined can wait up to three months for the goods to 
reach rental stores where the going rate is $1 a night. They come into 
Mortazavi's shop each afternoon to pore over the racks, asking wistfully for 
popular titles that haven't yet arrived or are already rented. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of the customers are kids. Adults -- mostly men -- rent sports 
games like Bill Walsh College Football and NBA Jam. Men in their 20s and 30s 
represent a growing portion of the video game market. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of guys like myself who are in their early 30s and grew up 
with these games," Winding said. 
</P>
<P>
 While older players eschew the violence and cartoon heroes of such hits as 
Wolfenstein and Sonic the Hedgehog, they are not entirely different from teens. 
They want the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can take batting practice in Fenway Park," Winding explained, 
referring to a computer game called Front Page Sports Baseball. "We have the 
technology to watch the ball as it starts fair and curves foul and bounces off 
the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sweeter the candy, the greater the cost. Sega and Nintendo, with their 
relatively simple 16-bit processors, retail for about $100. Panasonic's 32-bit 
REAL lists at nearly four times that price. Computers equipped with the desired 
CD-ROM drives and Super VGA monitors cost even more. Manufacturers hope that 
adults, with adult-sized discretionary income, will support the high-end 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults have a real difficulty admitting that they do anything for fun," 
explained Coleman, of Computer Gaming World. "But a computer is a serious 
machine. They buy it for business or for their kids. Then they find out they 
can play 'Star Trek' games." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the capacity of computers and improving video game systems, software 
developers are producing impressive games that offer live-action sequences 
featuring actors such as Sylvester Stallone, Brian Keith and Margot Kidder. 
These games are paving the way for an era of "full-motion video," when gamers 
can trade their cartoonish action for motion-picture scenes in which they 
control every move the characters make. 
</P>
<P>
 This and other breakthroughs should begin to arrive late next year, as even 
Sega and Nintendo advance toward 64-bit power. At the same time, 
telecommunications companies will continue work on announced cable channels 
that would allow subscribers to select from a menu of games on their television 
sets and compete with other players nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphic candy for the masses. Gamers can barely contain themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people have a home computer or a decent home entertainment system, they 
aren't going to leave the house," Winding said. "We're looking at a 
'pod'-ization of the world."

BLESSING OR CURSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colors and music, split-second movement on the screen -- video games can have 
a hypnotic effect. Just ask Jason Weingarten. But don't ask him while he is 
playing, because the 6-year-old isn't likely to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn," he blurted out, turning his attention to others in the room only after 
falling victim to some creature in Super Mario Bros. "That's what I always do 
when I play. I curse." 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of his play reinforces conventional wisdom on video games and 
their most loyal fans -- teen and preteen boys. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes like this: boys mature more slowly than girls and, upon smacking 
face-first into puberty, are more likely to seek the relative comfort of a 
hobby or sport. Video games offer even the most withdrawn child a chance to 
exhibit superhuman strength or command great armies or, simply, hit a curveball 
over the fence at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This simple equation overlooks the fact that most video games are designed for 
boys and that girls may not be as frequently encouraged to play with high-tech 
toys. Regardless, it remains that millions of young American boys, like 
Weingarten, are devoted to video games. And when it comes to the relative 
merits of this electronic haven, experts disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Video games have become the new drug of society," said Dr. Carole Lieberman, 
an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and chair of the National 
Coalition on Television Violence. "Parents who wouldn't allow their child to 
use drugs are giving them video games. It acts as a drug to make them excited 
and make them crave more." 
</P>
<P>
 The hours a child devotes to battling cartoon dragons would be better spent 
playing with other children and developing social skills, "the tasks of 
childhood," Lieberman argued. Some of the people who sell and rent video games 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this can be the new baby-sitter," said Mike Sobetzko, manager 
of the Game Dude shop in North Hollywood. "Parents buy a game for $40 and the 
kid is taken care of for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 This concern is heightened by the widespread popularity of violent games. 
While Math Blaster and the educational Carmen Sandiego series are popular, 
Mortal Kombat and Super Street Fighter top the bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just stand outside a video arcade and watch the children going in and coming 
out. Or watch your own children when they play at home," Lieberman said. "They 
become glassy-eyed and hyper-excited. I think it's worse than television 
violence because children are pushing the buttons themselves. They are getting 
rewarded for destroying people in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 But research into the effects of playing violent games has yet to establish an 
accepted link between such play and aggressive behavior. Some researchers are 
not eager to condemn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about a violent kid is that he can't play imaginatively," said Dr. 
Brian Sutton-Smith, a University of Pennsylvania professor emeritus and pioneer 
in the research of toys as culture. "The kid who can play imaginatively doesn't 
tend to be violent. It's the same with adults. Do you go kill someone after you 
see 'Macbeth?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Americans love to play games, Sutton-Smith said. Video games can 
help a boy or girl learn to play the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you aren't playing to learn, you're playing to play," he said. "People 
who play are happier people. And people who don't have access to play tend to 
be depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Are video games a blessing or a curse? Parents find themselves caught between 
feuding experts and pleading children. Nora Moore, of Mission Hills, limits the 
hours her three children play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them they have to study," Moore explained. "They don't play during the 
week, only on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 Such limitations appear relatively commonplace. At Game City in Sherman Oaks, 
owner Alex Mortazavi said that rentals decrease by 70% during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention magazine's The Doctors Book of Home Remedies for Children devotes a 
chapter to what it calls "Video Game Addiction." Doctors suggest not only 
limiting a child's video-game playing but also awarding such time in return for 
completed tasks such as homework and chores. The book also suggests scheduling 
what it calls "reality breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 "After one hour of video game play, the child should be required to take a 
'reality break' to discuss briefly with a family member or friend what else is 
going on in the house," Dr. Donald Jackson Jr. wrote. "It's a way of focusing 
attention away from the fantasy world of the games for a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Weingarten gets such reality breaks when he must put aside Mario Bros. 
for schoolwork or share games with his 3-year-old brother, David. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not crazy about some of the games he plays. I don't like Mortal Kombat," 
said Marcia Weingarten, his mother. "But the other kids talk about them at 
school. He plays them at his cousin's house. I can't totally shelter him."

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FASHIONABLE OFFERINGS; SANDI KENT STUDIO OFFERS ROMANTIC 
APPAREL. TWO-DAY CASHMERE SALE PROMISES BIG SAVINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 A new wholesale showroom has just opened to the public on a limited basis. An 
Australian woman, Sandi Kent, designs a line of women's apparel that is 
becoming to teen-agers as well as to those long past their teens. It's flowing 
and romantic, ladylike or sexy. It's layered if you like, but each piece will 
hold its own. The main point is that it's very today and the prices are just a 
tad over wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture georgette crepes and crushed velvets, lace and pleated tops, pants or 
skirts. If you love to run wild in a warehouse showroom, you'll have a fine 
time rummaging through the crowded racks in this small facility in Venice. The 
sizes are "one size almost fits all" for many garments, and most items would 
fit up to Size 18. This is not a store, though; don't expect any amenities. 
When I visited, they were contemplating putting in a dressing room, but it's 
not there yet, so wear a leotard. 
</P>
<P>
 A chevron-pleated skirt that retails for about $140 is $75 here. A poet blouse 
that looks great with it is $55, instead of its $100 retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally appealing are the accessory touches that Kent has come up with: Lace 
or pleated cuffs (held in place by a wide elastic band) go for $25, and a 
frilly jabot for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's time again for the one sale of the year that I never miss. It's the 
annual William Kasper Cashmere Sale, and it's just about the only time that 
top-quality cashmere is affordable for many of us. 
</P>
<P>
 For women, there are the basic styles, all in two-ply. Crew neck, mock 
turtle-neck sweaters and skirts start at $49. Retail on this group would be 
around $100. Then there are fashion novelties (such as capes or ponchos) that 
normally retail from $250 to $500 and start here at $99. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's styles include the standard V-neck, crew neck and polo styles, all 
two-ply or better, priced from $99 to $150. Regularly these would sell for $175 
to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp bargain shoppers are waiting at the door when the place opens and it's 
packed on both days of the sale. Large quantities of cashmere sweaters for 
women and men are shipped from the distribution center so that the second day 
of the sale will have fresh stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't miss this one.

GETTING WITH THE PROGRAM; AT 12, JAY LIEBOWITZ RUNS HIS OWN SOFTWARE FIRM IN 
BETWEEN HOMEWORK, SPORTS AND MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray is a 
regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It makes sense, starting your own software company in an effort to put your 
programming skills to good use. But at 12? 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Liebowitz, an eighth-grader at Chaminade Intermediate School in 
Chatsworth, says he is making almost $2,000 a month by uploading his homemade 
software to CompuServe, an on-line computer service that helps sell software 
through several forums. Not only does he like the spending money and the joy of 
running a small business, he hopes to use his earnings to pay for college. 
</P>
<P>
 One program, WinDOS, which goes for $35, is a file manager package designed to 
help children and others learn to use a computer. Another, BatchEdit, helps 
users better organize their files. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay started teaching himself to program about two years ago, after he felt 
bored with computer games and eager to learn how the software actually works. 
He started using Microsoft's Visual Basic program, and he designed a simple 
tool -- called Grader -- to help kids keep track of their day-to-day school 
grades. He put that program on the market through CompuServe but it didn't 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
 If he could make a simple program, Jay says, he figured he could spend more 
time on the programming and do something far better. He wrote BatchEdit just a 
few weeks after finishing Grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hard. You program and upload and pray to God that people will buy 
it," he says. Now he says he is getting about 25 buyers a week, which will add 
up to roughly $24,000 a year if the pace continues. "It's pretty good for a 
kid, but it's not going to be my living, I hope," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for expenses, Jay says he has not started to keep track of them, but knows 
his business costs him very little. So far, he hasn't invested in marketing or 
advertising, and he sells solely through the on-line forums. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While on-line experts consider Jay's software selling to be unusual, some 
predict it will not be so rare in the near future. "It's probably a sign of the 
times that more and more of these kids are uploading because they are becoming 
computer-literate so much younger," said Debra Young, a CompuServe spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay, an only child who lives in Northridge, does most of his programming on 
the weekends because his first priority is homework. When not studying or going 
on-line, he plays tennis and golf, and enjoys practicing piano and flute. 
</P>
<P>
 For a career, Jay isn't setting his sights on being the next Bill Gates, the 
billionaire chairman of Microsoft. Instead, he wants to become a surgeon. "I'm 
not sure what kind of surgeon, but I know it won't be an eye surgeon; 
enucleations make me puke. I once saw one on The Learning Channel," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also interested in finding a publisher for a book he just finished -- 
"Views of a 12-Year-Old." Don't expect to find ratings of theme parks or 
impressions of Little League in this tome. Jay discusses the underlying issues 
of society, including morality, responsibility, religion and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this society, the reason people kill is not because they're poor, it's 
because they have a lack of ethics," Jay says. On religion: "It's necessary 
because it gives you values. God is someone to answer to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay says he has several good friends, all of whom are scarcely aware of his 
programming and business acumen. "I don't bring that into my school life," he 
says. But he does admit that interests such as his can make connecting with 
other kids his age a bit challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids badger you sometimes. It's common for smart kids to be called nerds. But 
I have the cushion of all the people who love me and care about it, and I don't 
associate myself with those kind of people," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a business, crafting programs, writing a book -- does it make Jay feel 
grown up? "No. I have an income -- yes -- but it's just a side job. I'm still a 
kid," he says. "But it's nice; if I want to buy a camera, for example, I take 
$400 out and buy it." WHERE TO GO

RELUCTANT NOVICE: CAYENNE-DO SPIRIT OF SELF-DEFENSE; PEPPER SPRAY CAN 
INCAPACITATE AN ASSAILANT. BUT YOU MUST BE CERTIFIED TO LEGALLY POSSESS AND USE 
IT -- AND THAT'S WHERE THE CLASS COMES IN.

 Watch out. I am licensed to spray. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd probably be more impressed if I said I had a black belt in karate or 
could pick a gnat off my wall with a .22 pistol. But I took an easier route 
toward self-defense through a three-hour course legally certifying me in pepper 
spray training. I am now ready to take on any attacker, spraying him as I would 
a giant cockroach with a blast from my own special can of Raid! 
</P>
<P>
 I've only had a few incidents where I've truly felt in danger. A few years 
back, my purse was snatched near the arch in St. Louis while I was on a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area where I live, I was accosted one night by an intoxicated man at a 
fast-food restaurant. I kept moving from table to table, and each time, he 
followed me. Finally, when I got up to tell the manager, the man left the 
restaurant. I had to watch him drive off to believe I would be safe in leaving 
the place myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women are both victims of attacks, I know. But I believe women are 
much more vulnerable to such incidents. It makes me angry that we have to live 
in fear like other prey in the animal world, ever on the alert. It's become 
instinctual, especially in Los Angeles, to be on guard for potential danger. 
And so, with about 19 others, I attended a class at the Northridge Pistol and 
Rifle Range. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray became accessible to citizens in March, and can be found 
everywhere, from convenience stores to sporting-goods stores. What most people 
need to realize, however, is that pepper spray is illegal to possess and use 
unless you have been certified and have the legally authorized canister, which 
is yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 After our instructor, a former state police officer, told us this, a woman 
meekly turned in an unopened package containing a red canister of pepper spray. 
"I don't want to get convicted of a felony," she said demurely. 
</P>
<P>
 So many people were interested in learning how to use pepper spray that this 
course, offered through Learning Tree University in Chatsworth, was expanded to 
accommodate two sessions of trainees. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray is a mixture of carbonated water, its propellant, and derivatives 
of peppers such as cayenne. It must be sprayed into the face of an attacker, 
from three to 10 feet away, to be most effective. Once it hits the attacker's 
eyes, the mucous membranes are affected almost immediately: The eyes swell 
shut; the throat constricts, and the assailant drops to the ground in intense 
pain, usually incapacitated for about 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his police training, our instructor was subjected to pepper spray and said 
dryly, "It doesn't feel great." His description of how his eyes swelled up was 
met with a loud, "Ewwwwww!" by one student. Even when he'd merely gone close to 
the spray one time, our instructor said, he'd been affected. The spicy smell of 
the weapon made him crave Mexican food all evening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The class consisted of discussion and two videos, one about tear gas and 
pepper spray training, the other about gun safety, I guess in case any of us 
wanted to go a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 We all laughed at certain moments in the tear gas and pepper spray video, 
particularly the part about misuse of pepper spray. Scenes depicted the wrong 
reasons to take aim: A wife blasts her husband with spray during an argument; a 
driver shoots a stream of pepper spray on a man who stole her parking space; 
another woman douses a clerk after she feels she's been shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 But some scenes portraying real attacks and demonstrations of use were 
effective, especially with the "Jaws" type of background music played while a 
man crept up on his female victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The real excitement came when we actually got to do some spraying. As I 
stepped up for my turn, trigger-happy, I aimed at the target. To get anything 
to squirt from the canister, you really have to press down hard, but I managed 
to make an accurate hit in the eye area of the target three times, which was 
the requirement to be certified. Yet I felt more like I was watering daffodils 
than maiming an assailant. It was, after all, only water we were practicing 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 As we took turns spraying from the canister at the cardboard silhouette of a 
man, the target became so soggy from saturation, it collapsed in the middle. 
"You killed him!" one woman jokingly yelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people had trouble finding the lever to release the spray; some had 
difficulty hitting the target in the eye area. One woman smoked the target in 
the stomach, which would be futile in a real situation. Our instructor had 
extended an invitation to come back and practice anytime we wanted. Some people 
needed to. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, who attended the class with her husband and son, said she would not 
have come, but her "son insisted on it." 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is in college, and he can't be with us all the time. He thought it 
would be a good idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though we had learned a new way to arm ourselves, our instructor warned us not 
to have a false sense of security. He said we should still try to be more aware 
and cautious on the streets, in parking lots and other areas. And he encouraged 
pepper spray as a defensive mechanism, not an offensive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to go out and stop crime in your neighborhood with pepper 
spray or become a vigilante," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 I may walk a little more bravely into the night, but I'll never feel 
completely safe, even though I have a pink card giving me the legal right to 
carry my little yellow canisters full of cayenne. 
</P>
<P>
 I pray I never have to use them. WHERE AND WHEN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; REVIVING FOOD FAVORITES; THE SMOKE HOUSE STILL SERVES ITS 
RETRO MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH AND HEARTY, OLD-FASHIONED CHATEAUBRIAND FOR TWO.

<P>
 "Jam with a hot sandwich!" gasped my lunch date, goggling at the strawberry 
preserves that accompanied her authentic Monte Cristo. We were at the venerable 
Smoke House in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Oui , mademoiselle , jam. Picture three pieces of deep-fried French toast, 
layered clubhouse-style with sliced turkey, white sauce, ham and melted cheese, 
served with jam (well, it is made from French toast, right?), and you're 
looking at a Monte Cristo sandwich. Talk about retro. I hadn't seen one of 
these in ages, though I served hundreds of them in the early '70s, back when I 
was a waiter in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 A meal at the Smoke House feels appropriate -- and perhaps might even serve as 
an object lesson to a few of our trendier spots -- in this fallback season of 
American institutions. The nation has sprung sharply right, and it may be part 
of the national spirit that this clubby spot appears to be busier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The darkish dining rooms are strung with Christmas lights for the holiday 
season, and I can report that service is as solicitous as it was 15 years ago, 
when I last ate here with any regularity. The food is just as I remember it, 
too -- maybe even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers include thick-battered fried onion rings that crackle when you bite 
them; very tender baby back ribs served with a smoky barbecue sauce; gooey, 
lightly floured fried cheese, topped with a rich marinara sauce; a classic 
shrimp cocktail; a dish of wonderful sauteed mushroom caps sprinkled with 
Parmesan and doused with a wine sauce. You can get the above-mentioned 
separately or all together on the combination plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunches run to sandwiches, salads, meats and a few seafoods. The one I can't 
resist is the prime rib sandwich, a delicious hunk of roasted prime rib served 
open-face on a slice of soggy buttered toast in a puddle of meat juices. Smear 
it up with some of the creamy horseradish -- smooth as a sauce mousseline , 
pungent as a shot of Tabasco. 
</P>
<P>
 When you order Oriental chicken salad here, you get a huge glass bowl filled 
with marinated chicken breast, mixed greens and a few handfuls of wispy fried 
rice noodles, all in a sweet-sour dressing. On a rather contemporary note, 
there's a swell Southwestern chicken sandwich composed of grilled chicken, 
avocado and a spicy house salsa on French bread.  
</P>
<P>
 The beer batter shrimp, however, is a sort of retro tempura, from a time 
before chefs got the notion that batter frying can be light. The four enormous 
shrimp come wrapped in tangy batter parkas nearly an inch thick.  
</P>
<P>
 Most people who come in the evening can't resist ordering a full basket of the 
oily, cheesy Smoke House garlic bread. It's tasty, but watch it -- eat more 
than one piece and it turns into a real appetite killer.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the only restaurants in town where you can get that old-time 
L.A. steakhouse classic, chateaubriand for two. It's a huge tenderloin broiled 
on a plank, surrounded by a sort of retaining wall of Duchess potatoes. The 
meat is exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to complain about something our waitress did, though; something that 
would surely have been a no-no when this dish was in its heyday. We ordered our 
meat medium rare, and after she had sliced it at the table, we noticed it was 
beet-red in the center. "That's no problem," she said cheerily, and then 
proceeded to take the already cut pieces back to the kitchen for further 
cooking. In the old days, I dare say, the waitress would have peeked inside 
before carving, or broiled up an entirely new cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffed filet of salmon " en plank " is another old-fashioned dish. Here a 
good hunk of fresh salmon is stuffed with spinach and crab meat and covered 
with a respectably rich bearnaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the homemade carrot cake, however, would make me take a journey back to 
the restaurant's dessert tray. Most of the other items on the tray look and 
taste tired: cheesecake with refrigerator burn, commercially made pecan pie, 
apple pie in a flaccid crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well. You can always go for the strawberry jam. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>

NIXON STAMP TO BE ISSUED IN EARLY 1995 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 A memorial stamp bearing a smiling portrait of the late President Richard 
Nixon will be issued early next year, postal officials said Thursday, but 
uncertainty over the first-class postage rate will delay printing for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon will join actress Marilyn Monroe, trumpeter Louis Armstrong and 
chocolatier Milton Hershey, among others, on an eclectic roster of 1995 
commemorative stamp subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon stamp, in keeping with a tradition of honoring all former presidents 
after their deaths, normally would have been issued on his birthday, Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 But its printing will be delayed because the expected January increase from 29 
cents to 32 cents for first-class postage has not yet been approved by the 
independent Postal Rate Commission. (When the expected new rate of 32 cents 
takes effect, the Postal Service will have available large volumes of 
pre-printed stamps, with the letter G, the latest in a series used when rates 
change.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's portrait is based on his official White House photo, but the design by 
Daniel Schwartz incorporates several changes requested by the Nixon family: The 
middle initial M. will be dropped from the name and his suit and tie will be 
darkened. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 million copies of the Nixon stamp will be issued, a standard volume 
for a commemorative stamp. Although he was the only President to resign his 
office and his name is still associated with the Watergate political scandals, 
there was never any doubt that Nixon would be honored along with other 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. William L. Clay (D-Mo.), chairman of the House Post Office Committee, 
complained in a letter to Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. that he was 
unalterably opposed to a Nixon stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon brushed aside the objection last month, telling Clay in a letter that 
"it is a longstanding tradition to feature every President from George 
Washington to Lyndon B. Johnson on commemorative stamps after their death(s). 
Since the turn of the century, the death of a President or former President has 
been marked with the issuance of a memorial stamp the following year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the "spirit" of tradition, Runyon said, "we will feature President Nixon" 
on a stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda, tourists and local 
visitors expressed a general approval of the stamp Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great and I'm in favor of it," said Laguna Hills resident Bonnie 
Hightower. "I have heard negative remarks from people who don't like Nixon, but 
if they issue stamps for movie stars, why even question it? Nixon was our 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche Rodgers, visiting the library from Chicago, said, "If Elvis (Presley), 
who was on drugs, got a stamp, then Richard Nixon deserves to be on a stamp as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's director of special projects and events, Brett Holmes, said a 
commemorative stamp is "only fitting. Whether you love him, hate him or have no 
opinion of him, Richard Nixon was our 37th President. He influenced history 
both domestically and internationally as no other President had and no other 
President to come will ever do."  
</P>
<P>
 While presidents are honored on stamps a year after they die, Postal Service 
rules and traditions dictate that everyone else who is featured on a stamp must 
have been dead for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, President Jimmy Carter, running for reelection, wanted to solidify 
the labor vote by honoring AFL-CIO leader George Meany, who had died not long 
before. When postal officials reminded the White House of the 
dead-for-10-years-or-more rule, a compromise stamp was issued, showing an eagle 
with the slogan, American Labor. Meany, incidentally got his stamp this year, a 
full-face portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service will issue a veritable flood of stamps next year, more than 
100 different stamps. None of them will be as popular as the Elvis Presley 
stamp, which sold 500 million copies last year. The Postal Service made an 
estimated profit of $36 million from Elvis stamps sold to collectors or to fans 
of the rock star, who never used them to mail letters. It costs just a penny to 
print two sheets of 50 stamps. The rest of the price of the stamp is profit if 
it is never put on an envelope for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps are "miniature works of art and symbols of our national heritage," 
Runyon said Thursday as he unveiled the designs of the new issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Four environmental stamps, showing the Earth being washed in a bathtub, a tree 
planting, energy from the sun and children cleaning a beach, will be issued on 
Earth Day. They were designed by students who entered a nationwide competition. 
The winners were Melody Kiper of Shreveport, La.; Jennifer Michalove of 
Stonington, Conn.; Christy Millard of Lakewood, Colo., and Brian Hailes of 
Millville, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 A set of 20 stamps dealing with the Civil War will show Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis on a U.S. stamp for the first time. Abraham Lincoln, who also 
will be featured, has appeared on more than 50 issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gens. Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee will be included in the set, along 
with far more obscure figures such as Stand Watie, the last Confederate general 
to surrender, and Phoebe Yates Levy Pember, a nurse at the Richmond army 
hospital who helped feed 15,000 soldiers with her chicken soup specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 A set of 10 World War II stamps will include depictions of Marines raising the 
flag at Iwo Jima, the dropping of the atomic bomb, the surrender of Germany and 
Japan, and the liberation of Holocaust survivors from Nazi concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Other subjects include playwright Tennessee Williams, President James K. Polk, 
and aviator Bessie Coleman, the first woman to earn an international aviator's 
license and the world's first licensed black aviator. 
</P>
<P>
 The legends of American music series, which has covered rock and country, will 
offer stamps with 10 jazz greats, including Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, 
Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Yvette Cabrera contributed to this report. Postage 
Increases 
</P>
<P>
 The price of first-class postage has risen 19 cents in the past 20 years and 
might climb again next year. A decision expected after Thanksgiving will 
determine whether stamps jump from 29 to 32 cents in 1995. Path of the 
increase: 02,16,07 Date Cents March 2, 1974 $.10 Dec. 31, 1975 .13 May 29, 1978

L.A. JOINS CHALLENGE TO PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: LEGAL MOVE COMES AMID DEBATE 
OVER GETTING INVOLVED WHEN MANY ARE CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT. CITY 
ATTORNEY DEFENDS ACTION AS NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles jumped into the legal fray over Proposition 187 on 
Thursday, with City Atty. James K. Hahn filing court papers to join in a 
federal lawsuit seeking to toss out the anti-illegal immigration ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came amid continuing debate on the City Council about whether the 
city should get involved in court action over the initiative, particularly when 
many constituents are clamoring for its immediate enforcement. Hahn's office 
said Thursday that the action was necessary to clarify the city's 
responsibilities under the measure, which was approved by state voters last 
week by a 59%-41% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sponsors of the initiative said they were neither surprised nor 
dismayed by Wednesday's issuance of a temporary restraining order by a federal 
judge in Los Angeles covering most portions of the sweeping measure. They 
added, however, that many grass-roots supporters have their phones ringing off 
the hooks, expressing outrage that Proposition 187 has not taken effect 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really offended that their vote, their will and their voice 
doesn't mean anything -- that the court can just tell them to stuff a sock in 
their mouth and tell them to shut up," said Harold Ezell, a co-author of the 
measure and a former federal immigration official. "But people should not be 
surprised or discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go through all of this exercise of going through the courts. They 
did it with Proposition 13, they did it with Proposition 103. . . . It's just 
part of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal filings by government agencies, including the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, have resulted in a strong backlash from voters. The Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors backed away from undertaking a similar suit 
and proponents of the ballot measure announced plans for a recall drive against 
Los Angeles school board President Mark Slavkin.  
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks on Thursday night, more than 350 people packed the auditorium 
of Riverside Drive Elementary School to call for removal of public officials 
who use their official powers to mount taxpayer-funded attacks on Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, protesting what one speaker called "the invasion of the United 
States," loudly applauded speakers who called for the ouster of Los Angeles 
school board members and City Council representatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Spencer of the Valley-based Voice of Citizens Together pledged to 
rewrite the three "Rs" for the Los Angeles Unified School District, which he 
accused of "harboring criminals."  
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic, it will be recall, remove and 
replace," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's group announced plans Wednesday to launch a petition drive to oust 
Slavkin, who represents the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Cook of Woodland Hills listed for the crowd the names of current school 
board members and the margins by which they won election. "It's very easy to 
replace these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rosenberg of Woodland Hills said he is "indignant that the city officials 
are taking our tax money to fight something we voted for. The audacity and the 
arrogance of these people -- elitists telling us what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg and others said they did not object to private groups challenging 
the ballot measure, but said taxpayer money should not be used in that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, the head of the campaign for Proposition 187, told the group that 
the ballot initiative has sent a clear message to both state and federal 
officials, especially President Clinton. "We're not going to allow them to 
overturn the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the crowd was almost all white, two African American speakers 
received loud applause. One was Terry Anderson from South-Central Los Angeles, 
who received the biggest ovation of the evening when he accused Mexican illegal 
immigrants of stealing jobs away from "the black man." 
</P>
<P>
 Since voters approved the get-tough initiative, eight lawsuits have been filed 
to overturn it in state and federal courts from Sacramento to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Los Angeles City Council also voted to take legal action in an 
effort to overturn the ballot measure. But Wednesday, several council members 
began an effort to retract the vote and to instead simply ask the courts to 
clarify how the ballot measure should be applied by city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's latest action puts it on the side of the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern California, the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, the Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California and 
other civil rights groups that are attempting to overturn the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In his legal papers seeking to join the case as an intervenor, Hahn blasted 
the initiative in no uncertain terms, saying it is "vague, over-broad and may 
result in thousands of persons suffering violations of their constitutional 
right against discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in Hahn's office maintained Thursday that the tough language was 
necessary for the city to be allowed to enter the law case at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We adopt the pleadings of the ACLU and they are asking for . . . relief (from 
the proposition), but our mission is to find out what the law means and what 
the city's duties and obligations under it are," said Jessica F. Heinz, the 
deputy city attorney who drafted the city's legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinz said that the federal courts do not allow parties to simply enter 
litigation in a neutral position to seek answers to questions. Instead, they 
must show what harm they might suffer if the initiative is not clarified. "To 
get standing in the court we have to show that we have a real interest and a 
real stake," Heinz said. "We have to let the court know there is a very real 
problem facing the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Two law professors who are experts in federal civil procedure agreed that the 
city must stake out a clear position in order to intervene in the suit. The 
federal courts probably would ignore a simple request for clarification of the 
law, in the form of a friend of the court brief, said Profs. Stephen Yeazell of 
UCLA and Erwin Chemerinsky of USC. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs, however, has argued that the City Council should 
reverse its earlier stand pursuing "any and all legal action to . . . set aside 
the provisions of Proposition 187 . . . by challenging its constitutionality." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said he will press the City Council today to reverse that stand and "not 
take that activist position. That is what the public is really angry about, 
seeing their money used to try to overturn their action. That is what the 
public sees as an arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after Proposition 187's approval, a state court judge in San Francisco 
temporarily blocked the educational provisions from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr., acting on four 
separate cases filed by civil rights groups and private attorneys, halted 
immediate enforcement of the initiative's ban on non-emergency medical, 
educational and social services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that portions of Proposition 187 raise serious federal 
constitutional questions, Byrne also temporarily blocked implementation of its 
requirement that police and government agencies report suspected illegal 
immigrants to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until hearings are held on requests for preliminary injunctions -- which are 
designed to block implementation of the initiative until its legality is 
determined in court -- the only portion that Byrne ruled could take effect is a 
section providing increased state penalties for the sale and use of fraudulent 
citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's ruling came in suits brought by the civil rights groups, the Center 
for Human Rights & Constitutional Law and two private attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In its wake, leading Proposition 187 proponents have weighed in with decidedly 
measured responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, for one, said a comprehensive court process could prove 
beneficial to the measure's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it is more important that there be a full and complete record 
before the U.S. Supreme Court actually considers the questions that have been 
presented by 187," Wilson said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, the pro-187 leader who viewed the proceedings Wednesday, praised 
Byrne's performance, even if he disagreed with the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed by Judge Byrne," said Prince. "I thought his questions 
were fair and he certainly gave the attorney general's representatives ample 
opportunity to present a case. In fact, he was almost presenting their case for 
them in the absence of any effort on the part of the deputy attorney general to 
do it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince termed Wednesday's ruling a partial victory because Byrne upheld the 
initiative's sections on fraudulent documents, which call for penalties of up 
to five years in prison for illegal immigrants who use false citizenship 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince added that he he had expected -- and had made clear repeatedly during 
the long campaign -- that the education, health and social service provisions 
of the ballot measure would take months or years for courts to resolve. His 
only surprise, he said, was that Byrne did not allow the immediate 
implementation of a requirement that police verify the immigration status of 
anyone who is arrested in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, proposition co-sponsor Barbara Coe, who heads the California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform, said the restraining order "wasn't a surprise 
to supporters of 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe said she agrees with voters who do not understand why the courts would 
even get involved in ballot measures that win approval at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an ideal world, when the people spoke, that would be the end of the 
subject -- it would be the law," said Coe.  
</P>
<P>
 Those comments brought a shocked reaction from Chemerinsky, a constitutional 
law professor.

MACY PLANS TO PHASE OUT MAGNIN CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co. today will announce plans to phase out the 118-year-old I. 
Magnin chain by putting eight of the 12 I. Magnin stores up for sale and 
establishing different specialty stores at the remaining sites. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin stores, including one in Newport Beach, will continue to operate for 
now. However, if Macy is unable to find a buyer for the eight stores, the New 
York-based retailer is expected to close these locations before it emerges from 
bankruptcy reorganization sometime in late December as part of a planned merger 
with Federated Department Stores, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy will disclose the four stores it will retain when it unveils its sales 
and conversion plan for I. Magnin today. A list of four stores has been drawn 
up, but executives Thursday were still considering changing some of the 
selections on that list, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy hasn't revealed the fate of its I. Magnin's store at Fashion Island in 
Newport Beach. And, the Irvine Co., which owns the shopping center, "has no 
official word from Macy on their plans," according to spokeswoman Dawn 
McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Orange County store, the upscale specialty apparel retailer 
headquartered in San Francisco has one store in Phoenix and 11 stores in 
California. The other California sites are in Beverly Hills, Woodland Hills, 
Palos Verdes, Pasadena, San Diego, Palm Desert, Walnut Creek, Palo Alto, Carmel 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The phaseout of I. Magnin would mark the final chapter in one of California's 
oldest retailing sagas. The company was founded in 1876 by Mary Ann Magnin, an 
accomplished seamstress who began modestly by designing and making clothing for 
individual customers in San Francisco. She named the company after her husband, 
Isaac, who was not involved in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 A likely scenario, sources said, is that the four stores Macy retains will be 
converted into either Macy's Men's stores or men's stores in the Bullock's 
chain, which Macy owns. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation that Macy would shut down or sell part of the 
financially troubled I. Magnin chain and convert some of the remaining stores 
into Bloomingdale's, a chain operated by Federated. However, some industry 
analysts said the I. Magnin sites are too small to operate as Bloomingdale's 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's has announced that it wants to open four stores in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties. The chain has been negotiating with owners of both 
Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza, but store executives said earlier that 
they intend to build new stores rather than take over existing space. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Macy has been expanding its Bullock's Men's and Macy's Men's 
stores, and the size of I. Magnin stores is suitable for such a conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy has been quietly holding discussions with possible buyers of eight sites. 
Jacobson Stores Inc., a specialty apparel retailer based in Jackson, Mich., and 
the St. Louis-based May Department Stores, operator of the Robinsons-May 
department store chain, are among the companies that have taken part in such 
discussions, sources said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials from those two retail companies could not be reached for comment. 
May Department Stores operates Lord & Taylor, a chain that may want to 
establish itself at some I. Magnin sites. Jacobson may also want to establish 
some of its stores at I. Magnin sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping at I. Magnin has been a family affair for some Orange County 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach resident Sandy Glain, 34, first shopped I. Magnin when she was a 
preschooler in Fallbrook, in Northern San Diego. Her family made regular trips 
-- starting with the old Orange County I. Magnin store in a since-demolished 
building where MainPlace/Santa Ana mall now sits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the ladies who work here," Glain said Thursday afternoon. "With 
Buffums already gone and this closing, I don't know what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Glain learned about the dedication of I. Magnin's sales staff when, at age 25, 
she returned to the Orange County store after a long absence. "The saleslady, 
who was named Mrs. Tillis, still remembered me," Glain said. "She asked if we 
still lived in Fallbrook." 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin was "always the place our family did its Christmas clothing 
shopping," said Jeanne Didion, 30, another Newport Beach resident who has 
shopped I. Magnin since she was a child. "I still remember when I was a little 
girl and got my first pair of Christian Dior satin panties," Didion said. 
</P>
<P>
 But I. Magnin means more than memories for Didion, who is now store manager of 
the Francoli Gourmet Emporio shop just steps away from I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller shops at Fashion Island depend upon the drawing power of large, 
prestigious department stores for foot traffic, Didion said. So, if the store 
closes, the mall needs to snare another upscale department store "to protect 
its credibility," Didion said. "We need to get a Bloomies or a Bergdorf 
Goodman, or some other big East Coast name." 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin's problems were obvious to first-time shopper Kathy Damelio, who 
moved to Newport Beach a month ago from Boston. "I was just walking through the 
store wondering why it was so empty," Damelio said. "Back East, department 
stores are crowded with people." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of another well-known department store could dull the luster of 
Fashion Island, an outdoor shopping center that targets upscale customers. The 
center surprised some shoppers in 1992 when it replaced a closed Buffums 
department store with Circuit City, a discount electronics chain. In recent 
years the mall has also added a Hard Rock Cafe, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, and 
a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Macy plans to abandon I. Magnin as a store format, it will retain and 
expand the profitable I. Magnin catalogue business. By doing so, Macy can also 
use the expertise and labor of catalogue division personnel to help launch and 
operate a television shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy last year announced that it had forged a partnership with Don Hewitt, 
producer of CBS' "60 Minutes" program, to develop a cable shopping channel. 
Like catalogue operators, television shopping enterprises take orders and 
deliver merchandise by mail. Federated has indicated that work on the shopping 
network will continue after it merges with Macy.  
</P>
<P>
 The impending merger of Federated and Macy -- a deal approved in August by the 
companies' two boards -- may have marked the beginning of the end for I. 
Magnin. The retailer has been hobbled in recent years by the weak California 
economy, flagging nationwide demand for apparel and fierce retail competition, 
and there was speculation that the chain would be closed or sold before the 
Federated-Macy merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation increased after Federated successfully wooed Macy because the 
combined company is expected to consolidate or close inefficient or 
unprofitable operations. Macy does not release the earnings of its separate 
units, but some industry analysts have said that I. Magnin has been 
unprofitable in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 The venerable department store company was known almost from the beginning as 
a favorite place for upscale shoppers. I. Magnin stores in San Francisco were 
the first retail businesses in the city to be furnished with fine cabinetwork, 
elegant showcases and gilded mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin began to sell ready-to-wear clothing in 1909. The company grew 
rapidly in the early 1900s, opening branch shops in exclusive hotels in Santa 
Barbara, Del Monte, Coronado and Pasadena, and then full-line stores along the 
California coast during the go-go retail explosion of the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, I. Magnin and Bullock's merged as a corporation. I. Magnin and 
Bullock's were acquired by the Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores in 
1964. In 1988, Macy acquired Magnin and Bullock's from Federated, only to 
eventually strike a deal to merge with that company.

ACQUISITION GIVES J.M. PETERS ENTRY TO TEXAS HOUSING MART; HOME BUILDING: 
NEWPORT BEACH COMPANY PAYS ABOUT $14 MILLION TO ESTABLISH A PRESENCE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHWEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 J.M. Peters Co. said Thursday that it has acquired a Texas home builder in a 
transaction worth about $14 million, a move that gives the Newport Beach 
company a foothold in Texas and signals a spectacular recovery for the 
once-beleaguered builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Its acquisition of privately held Clark Wilson Homes in Austin will make J.M. 
Peters one of the top 40 home builders in the nation next year, the company 
projected. Coming on the heels of several large land purchases this year and a 
$5-million acquisition of Las Vegas builder Durable Homes in 1993, Thursday's 
announcement gives J.M. Peters a presence across the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've repositioned the company to prevent problems of the past. We're on 
solid footing now and ready to compete with larger builders," said Dale Dowers, 
chief operating officer. "We're trying to become diversified in price and 
geographic location." 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired for about $11 million in cash and a note for about $3 million, Clark 
Wilson Homes builds mostly in the Austin area. It was founded in 1992 by Texas 
developer Clark Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Specializing in new homes for move-up buyers, Clark Wilson Homes prices its 
houses in a range of $100,000 to $150,000. Wilson will remain president of the 
company, which plans to build 340 homes this year and projects $7 million in 
earnings.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, J.M. Peters announced Thursday that it is opening new division 
offices in Phoenix, Sacramento and Las Vegas. The company is in escrow on 
several land deals in those areas and expects to start building homes through 
its new divisions in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a Southern California builder anymore," Dowers said. "We're really 
a regional builder now."  
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Gobar, a real estate consultant in Placentia, hailed the geographic 
expansion as a "savvy move" by J.M. Peters as long as the company can manage 
its far-flung operations effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole industry is moving this way -- into more diversified home-building 
areas," Gobar said. "It will be more like Wal-Mart and less like Nordstrom." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time considered the premier builder of luxury homes in Southern 
California, J.M. Peters was hit especially hard by the real estate downturn, 
reporting a string of losses in the early 1990s. However, the company reported 
a profit of $4.3 million for the six months ended Aug. 31, contrasted with a 
loss of $3.5 million for the same period a year earlier. J.M. Peters, which 
built only 28 homes in 1992, expects to close escrow on more than 1,000 homes, 
some priced as low as $200,000, for its fiscal year ending Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 After being sold by founder James M. Peters in 1985 to San Jacinto Savings & 
Loan Assn., the company fell on hard times. The thrift was seized by federal 
regulators in December, 1990, and J.M. Peters was taken over along with other 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, builders Hadi Makarechian and Dowers bought the company from the 
Resolution Trust Corp. for $47 million. Since then, they have worked to return 
the company, founded in 1975, to its former glory. Their strategy has centered 
on buying land and acquiring other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. Peters has been on a spending spree after selling $100 million worth of 
bonds in May, using the proceeds to pay down debt and make acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the company paid $26 million in cash for 175 estate-sized lots in 
Tarzana. Called Mulholland Park, the 125-acre community in the Santa Monica 
Mountains was sold by Bank of America, which had acquired the property from a 
development partnership in a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 That same month, J.M. Peters paid $17.8 million in cash for 216 lots in Rancho 
San Clemente, a master-planned community in the coastal hills above San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. Peters, which has built single-family homes in Rancho Santa Margarita, 
Portola Hills and Coto de Caza, now has 24 active products, including seven in 
Orange County and 10 in Nevada. It will start construction on eight new 
projects next year. J.M. Peters Advancing J.M. Peters, the Newport Beach home

profitable again. Revenue and earnings in millions:

IRVINE OIL FIRM TO BUY PARENT'S HOLDINGS FOR STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saba Petroleum Co. said it has signed a preliminary agreement to acquire the 
Canadian and Colombian oil production and exploration properties of its 
Canadian parent, Capco Resources Ltd., in an all-stock deal that is yet to be 
valued. 
</P>
<P>
 Saba, an Irvine-based oil production, refining and exploration company, has 
production properties in the United States.The company also owns a refinery in 
Santa Maria, on California's central coast.  
</P>
<P>
 The deal with Capco would make it an international company, said President 
Ilyas Chaudhary. 
</P>
<P>
 Capco, based in Calgary, Alberta, now owns 60% of Saba. If the deal closes at 
year-end as planned, its stake in the Saba would increase, Chaudhary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saba's common stock closed at $1.94 a share Thursday, up 6.3 cents on the 
American Stock Exchange's Emerging Companies market.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; CALIFORNIA STATE ADDS 3 LOCAL BRANCHES, HIRES VETERAN

 Orange County, still struggling to join the economic recovery, remains a 
fertile area for bankers elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest financial institution to enter the county is California State Bank 
in Covina, which picked up three branches with two recent deals.The bank also 
hired veteran Orange County banker David T. Blankenhorn as its executive vice 
president in charge of bank administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bank is focusing its growth plans in Orange County, and plans to expand 
its operations there either internally or through acquisitions," Blankenhorn 
said. The bank is set to open a new branch, possibly taking over the former 
headquarters of failed Bank of Newport on Coast Highway in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The building should be familiar to Blankenhorn. He was brought in last spring 
to try to save the troubled Bank of Newport. Instead, he helped to uncover a 
major fraud by a borrower that led to the bank's failure in August. 
</P>
<P>
 California State Bank picked up branches near John Wayne Airport in Newport 
Beach and in Orange when it bought the deposits of CommerceBank, a Newport 
Beach bank that also failed in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Covina institution completed the $8.1-million purchase of 
healthy Bank of Anaheim and now has a total of $480 million in loans and other 
assets. California State Bank has 14 branches altogether, including nine in Los 
Angeles County and one each in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

ROCKWELL AND ACQUISITION TARGET TO DISCUSS OFFER; CORPORATIONS: RELIANCE 
ELECTRIC HAS ALREADY OKD A $1.4-BILLION MERGER WITH GENERAL SIGNAL, BUT THE 
DEAL COULD BE BROKEN. 
</P>

<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. said Thursday that it will open talks next week 
with acquisition target Reliance Electric Co., which had requested time to 
consider Rockwell's tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance has already agreed to a $1.4-billion stock-swap merger with General 
Signal Corp. of Stamford, Conn.Reliance said that if it breaks that deal, it 
would have to pay General Signal a $50-million termination fee plus $5.15 
million for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, had wanted a decision by today on its 
unsolicited, $1.5-billion cash tender offer of $30 a share for Reliance, a 
Cleveland-based maker of industrial and telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline was extended to noon Monday, and representatives of Reliance and 
Rockwell said they plan to meet before then to discuss a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Signal-Reliance Electric proposal was made public Aug. 30. 
Rockwell made its offer Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making arrangements to meet promptly with Rockwell's representatives," 
John C. Morley, Reliance president and chief executive officer, said in a 
prepared statement. "There can be no assurance that any agreement acceptable to 
the Reliance board will be reached with Rockwell." 
</P>
<P>
 Morley said General Signal will abide by Rockwell's acquisition of Reliance if 
Reliance agrees to a deal and General Signal receives the termination fee and 
costs. Morley said that without a negotiated agreement the company will stick 
with General Signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman and chief executive officer, said the 
company is pleased that Reliance was ready to discuss its offer.

 On-Line Computer Program: Walter P. Blass, who ran the nation's largest 
independent mortgage banking operation out of a Newport Beach high-rise, has 
come up with an on-line computer program for mortgage brokers and lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixstar Inc. in Newport Beach, which hopes to launch its effort next month, is 
designed to speed up the loan approval process by, in part, eliminating the use 
of messengers to deliver paperwork associated with loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Through America Online, one of the major interactive data networks, Mixstar 
will allow mortgage brokers to send documents electronically to savings and 
loans and other lenders, providing same-day service. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the service could put a big dent in the number of telephone 
calls, facsimile transmissions and overnight deliveries associated with 
mortgage transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Blass, a former chief executive of Shearson Lehman Mortgage Corp. in Irvine, 
said institutions can spend as much as $200,000 a month "just on faxing." Blass 
expects to offer his service through AOL for less than $50 a month, not 
including AOL charges.

PUBLIC FACES OVERDOSE OF SIMILAR DRUG NAMES; HEALTH: PROLIFERATION OF NEW 
BRANDS MEANS BIG MONEY IS ON THE LINE FOR COMPETING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, 
BUT CONFUSION CAN BE FATAL FOR PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Quick, what was that prescription your father takes for his ulcer? Zantac? 
Xanax? Zenate? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that heart drug your uncle takes. Cardizem? Procardia? Cardura? Or that new 
breast cancer drug, Taxol -- or was it Paxil? 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmaceutical makers seem intent on tying the American tongue with brand 
names that defy linguistic logic and often look and sound like one another. 
While other new product names are designed to be memorable, drug companies seem 
to live in a nether world of pharmo-jargon founded by ancient Greeks and 
populated only by doctors and druggists. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just confusing -- it's also dangerous. Misunderstandings over names 
have led to fatal mistakes in prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug makers say they want names that are easy to remember, pronounce and 
spell, but that it's a difficult goal to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only 26 letters in the Roman alphabet and there's a glut of 
trademarks," said Marty Mazurek, a naming executive with Merck & Co., the 
world's largest drug maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies also face a complex naming process, watched over by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration and trademark offices in every country where they want 
to sell drugs. So sometimes, even when they think they've found that perfect 
five-letter moniker, it can end up translating to something like "death" in 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, finding new drug names can cost up to $200,000 and take up to 
four years, companies say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desperation in finding a name has driven a lot of name development to very 
arbitrary, gibberish-type names," said Nan Budinger, creative director of 
Metaphor Name Consultants in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The drug-naming process is much different than back in 1899, when scientists 
at Bayer AG in Germany found a new painkiller in the sap of a shrub called 
spiraea. They simply took the root phrase "spir," put an "a" in front of it and 
an "in" in back and came up with aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the process begins years before the drug is sold, while scientists are 
still testing it in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 First, international groups develop a generic name for the drug. This is the 
name that will apply to the chemical compound no matter which company makes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug company naming committees include doctors, pharmacists, linguists, 
marketers, researchers and even English teachers. They start with hundreds of 
candidates from a computerized random name generator or those they dream up on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The namers pick out those easiest to say and spell and discard those that are 
too similar to existing drugs or those with unwanted meanings in English or 
other languages. Then they're reviewed by government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the FDA has been the final name arbiter, further weeding out 
look-alike names and those with too much marketing "puffery," like Fatoff or 
Getwell, said Yana Mille, a labeling regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Wonder' has been used and accepted as the name of a bread, but it is not an 
acceptable name for a drug," she told a trademarks conference in May. The FDA 
has rejected a third of all names. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the FDA rejected the name Regaine for Upjohn's hair restoration 
drug, but approved Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, many drug names have Greek or Latin roots. "Zo," for example, 
is a Greek prefix meaning life, "pro" is Greek and Latin for before, or in 
front of. "Bene" means well. 
</P>
<P>
 These help the drugs sound medicinal, a key ingredient. Without it, "People 
say, 'That doesn't sound like a legitimate drug. That sounds like a candy 
drug,' " said Clive Chajet of Lippincott & Margulies Inc., a corporate identity 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some drug makers, like the Swiss company Sandoz AG, use their corporate name: 
Sandimmune, Sanorex, Sansert. 
</P>
<P>
 Biotech drugs, developed from genetic engineering, can be often be spotted 
with "bio," "gen," or "cell" in their names. 
</P>
<P>
 John Montgomery, Warner-Lambert Co.'s drug naming chief, said companies often 
want to describe the drug or what it does in the trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Cognex increases cognition in Alzheimer's disease patients. 
Pepcid is for peptic ulcers. Halcion, a sleeping pill, is reminiscent of 
halcyon, the mythological Greek bird that calmed the seas. Premarin, for 
post-menopausal pain, is made from pregnant mares' urine. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurontin treats neurons or nerve cells to prevent epileptic seizures. 
Estroderm is a patch that secretes the hormone estrogen through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, catchy phrases get overused. So, Cardura for high blood 
pressure sounds like Cardizem and Procardia for heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies prefer nonsense words because they're less likely to cause a 
trademark conflict. Many began relying on the letters X and Z because they 
stand out from others, but they've become overused too. So there's Zantac for 
ulcers, Xanax for anxiety and Zenate, a vitamin supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of this confusion can be harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the wife of a New York State appeals court judge died after a 
hospital that should have given her Paraplatin, a Bristol-Myers Squibb drug for 
ovarian cancer, instead gave her Platinol, a different cancer drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years earlier, doctors were about to do exploratory surgery on a Colorado 
glaucoma patient who had consistently low blood sugar levels. The night before, 
they checked her medication and found that she had been given Diabinese, a drug 
for diabetics, instead of the glaucoma drug, Diamox. Because of her bad vision, 
she couldn't tell them apart on the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Merck had to rename its ulcer drug Losec to Prilosec because some patients 
were getting the fluid reduction drug Lasix instead. The confusion was blamed 
for at least one death. 
</P>
<P>
 This August, Daniels Pharmaceuticals Inc. promised to change the name of its 
thyroid drug, Levoxine, because pharmacists were giving people Wellcome's heart 
drug Lanoxin. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit group, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in Huntingdon 
Valley, Pa., has found hundreds of "mixed-up pairs" and publishes articles 
warning professionals about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Its president, Michael Cohen -- a drug-naming consultant -- said doctors can 
help avoid confusion by typing prescriptions instead of scribbling and 
indicating what condition a drug is being prescribed to treat, such as Paxil 
for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Druggists also need to talk more to their customers, he said. "Tell the 
patient, this is your Seldane, it's an antihistamine. If the patient was told 
to take Feldene for arthritis, they'll say, 'Wait a minute.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More public awareness of different drugs and what they do would also help, 
experts say.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; ARE SAT PREPARATION COURSES A GOOD IDEA?; NO, 
THEY MERELY ACCENTUATE INEQUALITIES IN THE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MING HSU, Ming Hsu attends Irvine High School, where this article first 
appeared in the student newspaper, the El Vaquero. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressure to excel on the SAT is fierce. As a result, thousands of anxious 
students rush to cash in on the wonder of expensive preparation classes in the 
hopes that their scores will magically rise and their chance of college 
admission will be secured. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the problem? Isn't everyone merely getting what they want? For 
those who can afford to pay a small fortune to ensure their success on the 
exam, the answer may be yes, but for those who simply cannot afford the high 
expense, the question moves away from "getting what you want" into the realm of 
cold, hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold, hard fact is that no matter how badly the average student may want 
to improve his or her score, the majority of families in a time fraught with 
financial difficulties cannot comfortably afford these classes.  
</P>
<P>
 The cold, hard fact is that since large universities such as the UC system 
deliberate over thousands of applicants each year, they do not always have the 
time to consider the special "extras" of each applicant and instead rely on the 
academic index consisting of test scores and GPA to accept up to 60% of their 
freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold, hard fact is that because of the academic index, SAT scores can 
often be the determining factor as to whether a student has a chance of making 
it in the admissions game. The cold, hard fact is that while the game may be 
unfair, it is the game that each college-bound student must play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, standardized tests were initially incorporated in the admission 
process to eradicate the same inequalities that they now either intentionally 
or unintentionally perpetuate. 
</P>
<P>
 A GPA or class rank cannot be trusted when the systems and processes that have 
fed into these numbers vary hugely from school to school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 report profiling the valedictorians from high schools across Orange 
County, the listed GPAs ranged from 2.73 to 4.96, and yet each profiled student 
held the same No. 1 class ranking in the college admissions process. Likewise, 
a school that does not grant bonus points for its honors classes cannot offer 
an equal playing field to those that do. 
</P>
<P>
 America has long prided itself on offering some of the finest institutions of 
higher education in the world, and the state of California, in particular, 
provides one of the most inclusive systems of affordable education in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then, are we eliminating players from the game before they even have the 
chance to get up to bat?

STUDYING THE FINER PRINT; EXAMPLES OF THE ABSORBING, OFTEN ADVENTUROUS ART FORM 
ARE ON EXHIBIT IN WOODLAND HILLS.

 Printmaking isn't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there are still printmakers who continue to make fine tradi tional 
prints such as engravings, etchings and lithographs. But today, some 
adventurous artists in this field are creating particularly intricate and 
absorbing prints by using a combination of printmaking techniques in the 
production of an image. Others are dabbling with the latest technology, making 
photocopy, laser and ink-jet prints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Printmakers are sophisticated today. They do a lot of research and 
experimenting," said Renee Amitai, a printmaker and member of the Los Angeles 
Printmaking Society. "It's like a sickness. You need it like air. It's hard 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 A good overview of printmaking is on display at Artspace Gallery in Woodland 
Hills, which is presenting "Small Images," the Los Angeles Printmaking 
Society's membership exhibit. More than 100 prints by 65 members of this 
nonprofit group, dedicated to encouraging the art of printmaking, are on view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very intimate show," said Printmaking Society president Dona Geib. 
"You do not stand back and get an impression. I hope (viewers) get up close and 
look at each one so that they will understand how each artist works so 
differently in a media that is little understood." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to display only small prints was made so that there would be more 
space for more members to enter the show, said Amitai, who organized the 
exhibit. Members come not only from the Los Angeles area but throughout the 
United States and Canada. Each was allowed to submit two prints for the 
non-juried show. "We wanted work from all over, to know what the others are 
doing," Amitai said. "People see differently in different places." 
</P>
<P>
 In two examples from her "Window" series, Amitai fuses the process of etching 
with Chine Colle, a Chinese technique involving the gluing of fine paper -- 
usually Chinese rice paper -- or fabric to the print paper during the printing 
process. Although Amitai has a concept of what the image will look like, 
there's often a surprise when she pulls the print off the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a kind of happening, and I feel it's very spiritual, in what you 
obtain," she said. "When you see it, it's very mysterious." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the prints that provoked particular curiosity and respect from Amitai 
were Maria Abondolo's relief etching, "There Was a Crooked Man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be a real printmaker to arrive at this sophistication -- someone 
who has a lot of experience in etching," she said. She also called Jani 
Hoberg's drypoint "Hope" -- a lyrical depiction of that feeling -- "so special. 
It is so beautiful, you ask, 'How did she do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Belle Osipow's richly colorful laser and pochoir (French for "stencil") 
"Fragrance" also speaks to that question. The print presents the profile of a 
woman's face as it meets a vase full of radiant flowers. Painting, drawing, and 
a photograph have been incorporated into the source image from which Osipow's 
laser print was made. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the benefits of laser-printing technology, said Isabel Anderson, a 
Printmaking Society member, is you can reduce or enlarge a print. Formerly a 
screen-print maker, she has given up working with the solvents involved in that 
process to paint and to make Xerox prints, which afford "very nice ranges of 
grays," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several printmakers choose to make monotypes, one-of-a-kind images. Susan 
Smith Evans' quirky, untitled monotype of geometric shapes and pea pod-like 
forms includes thread and was printed on handmade paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Masha Schweitzer's black-and-white monotype, "Windowsill," pulls viewers into 
the scene, making them wonder what could be going on beyond the frame. Her 
colorful "Man Smoking," with smoke billowing up in front of the man's face, 
manages to convey at once the pleasures and dangers of that pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the compelling examples of more conventional printmaking techniques are 
Bruce Carter's bold woodcut image of "Sisters," Donna Westerman's fine wood 
engraving, "Orangeman's Day," and Karen J. Wesler's very small etching that 
still depicts an expansive "Villa." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>

LOCAL TEACHER MOTIVATED TO EXCEL BY REMARK; EDUCATION: WESTMINSTER'S HUONG TRAN 
NGUYEN, HONORED BY DISNEY FOR HER WORK IN LONG BEACH SCHOOLS, SAYS INSTRUCTOR'S 
NEGATIVISM HELPED HER REACH GOALS.

<P>
 Huong Tran Nguyen of Westminster, who arrived in the United States as a 
student at the height of the Vietnam War, remembers a college instructor's 
admonition that she would never measure up to her white peers as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Nguyen, a Long Beach high school teacher, was named outstanding 
teacher of 1994 by the Walt Disney Co. She accepted the award Wednesday night 
during ceremonies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 41, said the college instructor's disparaging remarks served as the 
primary motivation for her to pursue teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was precisely this remark that drove me to pursue a teaching career and to 
be the best I can be for my students," Nguyen wrote in her application for the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined to prove to her and to myself that there was not a goal I 
could not reach if I put my mind to the task. This is the message that has led 
me to want to make my students believe they too can experience success in the 
'real' world." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was one of 12 teachers nationwide honored for their "teaching skills, 
rapport with students and ability to inspire." 
</P>
<P>
 She serves as a role model for students, particularly non-English speaking 
students, as well as fellow faculty members at Polytechnic High School, where 
she established and now heads the school's language program for students with 
limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very resourceful in engaging students in learning," said Dick Van Der 
Laan, school district spokesman. "I think something she instills in the 
students is that no matter what the obstacles are, you can make something of 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving to Long Beach, Nguyen spent five years in the San Diego area, 
teaching elementary and high school students. She also taught reading to older 
students for the San Diego Job Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, a Westminster resident for about 10 years, lives with her husband and 
their two sons, ages 5 and 10, and two nieces. 
</P>
<P>
 She was nominated as the educator of the year by 36 other teachers singled out 
for recognition at this year's awards. Ed Cabil of John Muir Junior High School 
in Los Angeles was one of the 36 finalists for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and her high school each will receive an honorarium of $25,000. The 
Long Beach school district will receive $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual American Teacher Awards ceremony was aired live Wednesday 
evening and will be aired again nationally on cable television's Disney Channel 
on Dec. 2.

LEADER OF PROP. 187 EFFORT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; FUNDS: MOST OF RONALD S. 
PRINCE'S DEBT IS FROM THE INITIATIVE. BECAUSE HE'S SEEKING COURT RELIEF, THE 
CAMPAIGN CAN'T RAISE FUNDS FOR THOSE COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald S. Prince, the Proposition 187 campaign co-chairman, has filed for 
personal bankruptcy, with most of his $313,700 debt made up of expenses from 
the successful anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Prince's unpaid creditors, according to the Chapter 7 petition filed in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, is former Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Commissioner Alan C. Nelson, who is listed as being owed $36,000. A campaign 
finance report filed earlier this year showed Nelson billed the campaign 
$26,000 for consulting services, which included co-authoring Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single creditor reported in Prince's bankruptcy petition is Yorba 
Linda campaign consultant Robert Kiley, who is owed $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince states in his petition that his assets -- including a 1986 Buick, $200 
cash and other personal items -- total $3,950. Supported by his family and 
living rent free in a Tustin home, Prince said his income during the past three 
years was in the form of gifts totaling $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Not mentioned in the petition is a $32,000 lawsuit settlement he was awarded 
in March, 1993, as a result of a Bankruptcy Court dispute with a Canadian 
immigrant who was his friend and construction partner. The settlement agreement 
is contained in the files of the old Bankruptcy Court case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But his court action appeared to catch some by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign treasurer Betty Presley said she did not know details about Prince's 
bankruptcy or why he assumed much of the campaign's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything and I kind of would just as soon not know," Presley 
said. "I don't know anything about his personal debts." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley, meanwhile, refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance experts said it is not unusual for a campaign official to 
take on a committee's financial liability in order to secure contracts with 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may very well be that at the time that he contracted for these services, 
he held himself to be personally liable as well," said Jeanette Turvill, a 
spokeswoman for the California Fair Political Practices Commission. However, 
now that Prince is seeking relief through Bankruptcy Court, the campaign cannot 
raise funds to repay those debts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last campaign finance report filed before the Nov. 8 election by the 
Proposition 187 campaign committee showed that it had raised $484,188 and spent 
$582,352, with an outstanding debt of $297,691. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on in the Proposition 187 campaign, finance reports listed Prince as the 
donor of a $20,000 loan to the campaign. However, caught up in a legal battle 
with his former attorney who was seeking payment for a $9,600 legal bill, 
Prince told an Orange County Superior Court judge last month that he had no 
assets and that the $20,000 loan was actually made by his father, Downey 
businessman Leland Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Prince's petition to settle his debts through asset liquidation 
was filed Monday, a day before he was due back in Superior Court to show proof 
that the $20,000 campaign loan was made by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney who received a judgment against Prince, William Baker of Santa 
Ana, had argued in Superior Court last month that if Prince could lend money to 
the Proposition 187 campaign, then he had the means to pay his legal bill, 
which has since gone up from $9,600 to $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bankruptcy petition, Prince stated he owes his father $20,000 for a 
"personal loan" made this year, plus another $14,000 that the elder Prince lent 
to his son in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Nelson, Kiley and Leland Prince, other creditors included in 
the bankruptcy petition were: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Petition Consultants of Rancho Cordova, the firm that gathered 
signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot. The amount due is $28,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Freeway Commerce Center of Tustin, which is owed $600 in rent for the 
campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * James Maryea of Westminster, who is owed $25,000. Maryea handled the direct 
mail and campaign literature for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Lunetta of Corona, who now holds the $18,000 legal bill that Prince 
owed Baker, his former attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Parcel Service, which is owed $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy record states that Prince, an unemployed accountant, is 
supported by his family. His petition stated that the house he lives in is 
owned by a Tustin couple, but he holds a $48,633 note on the house secured by a 
deed of trust. The owner "has exchanged free rent in property for note . . . 
(Prince) has received no cash," according to the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince also stated in the court record that he paid $300 to a paralegal firm 
in Huntington Beach for assistance in preparing the bankruptcy petition.

JUDGE FINDS KILLER ON DEATH ROW HAD COMPETENT DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A murderer from Fullerton who is appealing his death sentence claiming his 
attorney was incompetent had, in fact, "an experienced criminal trial 
attorney," an Orange County Superior Court judge said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for John Louis Visciotti, 37, had argued before the state Supreme 
Court that his former attorney, Roger J. Agajanian, never told the jury about 
his troubled childhood before they sentenced him to death in 1983. They also 
pointed out that Agajanian was subsequently forced to resign from the state Bar 
Assn. and was convicted on two counts of criminal contempt, all relating to 
other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Visciotti fatally shot 22-year-old Timothy Dykstra of Westminster, a former 
co-worker, after Visciotti lured him to Santiago Canyon and robbed him in 1982. 
 
</P>
<P>
 While it is common for killers on Death Row to appeal their sentences claiming 
attorney incompetence, it is highly unusual for the Supreme Court to consider 
that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly three years ago, the state Supreme Court did just that in 
Visciotti's case. The justices asked Orange County Superior Court Judge Eileen 
C. Moore -- who did preside over the case -- to hear testimony on the issue of 
Agajanian's handling of the defense. The high court also asked her to answer 
specific questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's answers now go back to the justices, who will hear further arguments 
on the question before deciding whether Visciotti should have a new penalty 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore also said in her report that Agajanian "used his store of knowledge, 
experience, professional instinct and intuition" in Visciotti's case. But she 
also found that he did not take some actions on Visciotti's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of interviews with Visciotti's family and friends, Agajanian did not 
"become aware of potentially mitigating evidence from any other source." 
Neither did he review "school records; juvenile court records; or other 
material relevant to the defendant's history." 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian testified that he did not present evidence of Visciotti's troubled 
family life or lengthy juvenile record because, "frankly, I didn't think it 
would work. Maybe now with the Menendez-type case . . . it works. Maybe you can 
use an Oprah defense . . . (when) your clients become the guests rather than 
the clients and maybe the jury becomes the audience. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Chuck Middleton, who argued the prosecution's case before 
Moore, said the judge's finding made the point to the Supreme Court "that Mr. 
Agajanian provided an adequate defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Visciotti's current attorneys could not be reached for comment Thursday. But 
earlier, one of the defense lawyers, Richard Schwartzberg, said that had 
Agajanian taken the steps the justices asked about, "that jury would have voted 
for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Visciotti's guilty verdict was upheld by the 4th Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, 
and in early 1992 the state Supreme Court rejected Visciotti's "final" appeal 
in a 6-1 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Visciotti's appeal 
that year.  
</P>
<P>
 But after reconsidering, the state Supreme Court decided to take another look 
at the competence issue.

AND NOW, THE MAIN COURSE; WAITERS AND WAITRESSES SERVE UP THRILLS, SPILLS AT 
NEWPORT BEACH RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Staci Beech spilled her wine before its time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 36-year-old waitress wasn't the only one. Few of the 25 local 
restaurant owners, managers, and waiters who braved the second annual 
Beaujolais Nouveau Race emerged from the treacherous parking lot obstacle 
course unstained. 
</P>
<P>
 In berets and aprons, the intrepid competitors from a dozen upscale Orange 
County restaurants balanced two glasses of the French wine on their trays and 
then scampered over a four-inch wooden beam, through six tires and across a 
wobbly sheet of plywood. If their wine and meatball trays survived the trek, 
the participants quickly served a table of lucky "customers" before darting to 
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a dumped bottle of wine," said Doris Cormack, who posed as a 
customer and tried to keep dry by wearing a tablecloth up to her chin.  
</P>
<P>
 The event at Le Meridien Hotel is one of scores going on nationwide to trumpet 
the annual delivery of the imported wine, which sells for about $10 a bottle. 
The modest import is the first wine to market each year, traditionally on the 
third Thursday of November. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine's arrival in the United States presents a particular challenge to 
restaurateurs looking for new ways to hype it. In years past, some American 
restaurants have even flown in the new wine on the supersonic Concorde.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's makeshift obstacle course was the brainchild of Le Meridien's food 
and beverage director, Jean Pierre Lortal, who finished his own course in a 
respectable one minute and one second.  
</P>
<P>
 Pascal Olhats, a French native and owner of Pascal restaurant in Newport 
Beach, said the heralding of the wine was "more fun here than in France. Over 
there, the waiters have to run through the streets, sometimes a mile or more." 
</P>
<P>
 For Beech, the event could have gone better. The waitress, who represented The 
Cannery in Newport Beach, made her misstep inches from the finish line. In a 
rush, she dropped wine on a customer's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to solid glasses," she said. "Those plastic glasses aren't very 
sturdy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the next entrants lined up to negotiate the course, she shouted some 
advice: "You should have a glass before you do it!" 
</P>
<P>
 After several heats, a sure-footed Taras Young, a waiter at the French 
restaurant La Fayette of Garden Grove, won the contest by speeding through the 
course in just 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to lose," Young said. "The hardest part was putting on 
the apron. I'm used to tuxedo jackets. The rest was easy." 
</P>
<P>
 For restaurants owners like Bill Hamilton, 70, more accustomed to managing 
than working for tips, serving customers proved a challenge. After his 1:03 
finish, the owner of the Cannery admitted he hadn't waited tables for almost 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little sloppy but I was a little nervous," he said. "The tires, they 
were tough. I stumbled there a bit. But I think I still won the senior 
division." 
</P>
<P>
 As tricky as the event was, the course organizers are already thinking of how 
to make it even tougher for future contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, said George Blanckensee of Le Meridien, "we might add a rope 
climb."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; 'CASTLE' OWNER GIVEN ONE YEAR TO REMODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge approved an agreement Thursday that will save the 
castle-like home of Haym and Fern Ganish from demolition by the city, and 
requires that they complete renovations within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes have battled city officials for 12 years over the start-and-stop 
remodeling of their three-story, stone-covered house into what neighbors have 
called the "Kron Street Castle." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Fern Ganish pleaded no contest to criminal charges filed against 
her by the city for safety code violations. The plea came after two days of 
negotiations with a deputy city attorney and a municipal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock approved an agreement 
Thursday that ends civil and criminal court actions and requires the Ganishes 
to post a $50,000 bond or deposit $10,000 with the court as a guarantee that 
work will be done within a year. Haym Ganish had filed a civil suit against the 
city to block demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not the house fits in with the neighborhood is not the issue," 
said City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. "The issue was a safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes are prohibited from living in areas of the house found to be in 
violation of safety codes, and they will be subject to a $21,000 fine and 
demolition of the house if the work is not completed by Nov. 9, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that this accomplishes what my client was willing to compromise to in 
order to settle," said attorney John Barthrop, representing Fern Ganish. "The 
real problem was money. Mr. Ganish was doing it himself out of his small 
monthly income." RUSS LOAR

 An additional crossing guard will be assigned to an intersection used by 
students at Bernardo Yorba Middle School and Fairmont Elementary School, the 
City Council decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city has one crossing guard to help students cross Fairmont 
Boulevard and Old Ranch Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study of pedestrian traffic in the area showed that more than 450 
students cross one or both of those streets in the morning and afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of students at both schools have frequently requested that another 
crossing guard be assigned to the area. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; PARTNERS' BEACH WORKS STRIKE A BALANCE 
BETWEEN ART, NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daryl Maddeaux's art typically evokes a response much like the one from 
passerby Nat Sanders -- part puzzlement, part wonder, part awe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a retired physicist and I'm amazed," said Sanders, 71, a Dana Point 
resident who strolled by Maddeaux's 50-yard tableau of oddly shaped rocks 
precariously balanced in pairs, end-on-end, along Dana Strand Beachbetween the 
Dana Point Headlands and the Ritz-Carlton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddeaux uses the narrowest end of a rock as its balancing point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible how he found out what has to be done to get that balance," 
Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cope, 33, a dripping wet surfer still carrying his board, welcomed the 
temporary addition to his longtime surfing spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been surfing at this beach for 15 years and I couldn't believe it. This 
is neat . . . this is art," said Cope, a student at Orange Coast College. "I'm 
coming back with my girlfriend on a full moon night." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddeaux is a self-described former hippie from Vancouver whose credo is 
"balance is the future." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, he and partner Jozsef Toth have spent nine months cruising the 
West Coast in a van in search of the beach with the right mixture of elements 
to create their unusual style of sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those guys from the '60s and '70s who grew my hair halfway down my 
back, who got arrested in Vietnam peace marches, who still strongly believes we 
can have a world in balance," said Maddeaux, 43. "It's not a corny thought, 
it's our art." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddeaux and Toth, a stone mason who is helping promote his partner's unique 
artwork, are hoping to receive a commission from the Canadian government to 
produce a similar creation to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our idea is that we can't always have the world's people in balance, but we 
can balance the countries," Maddeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 If not that, the duo would like to see some sort of sponsor pick up their 
designs for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 One day this week, a steady stream of the curious, including television and 
newspaper reporters, stopped by. Some people leave donations and others sign a 
book with their observations. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling against the wind and rain, Maddeaux and Toth had created about 200 
of the balanced rock pairs within a few days and were attempting to make about 
3,000 strung all the way down the beach to the Headlands peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have a long enough section so people can look at our creation and 
get lost in it," Maddeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of beach below an abandoned trailer park has the rocks, the palm 
trees and the foreboding Headlands peninsula that caught their imagination, 
Toth said. "Dana Point just grabbed our attention. It was just too much, too 
beautiful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no trick to the rock balancing, just practice at "finding the center 
of gravity," Maddeaux said. His hands are his only tools -- no glue, no sand, 
no filing of the pieces -- and he works only with rocks found on site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use what Mother Nature gives us just the way it is," Maddeaux said.LEN

<P>
 Issue: Opening of south Orange County's first ice-skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Several local investors pleased thousands of South County 
residents when they announced plans to open the Ice Palace in a local light 
industrial park.The investors had hoped to open the rink Sept. 15. Hundreds of 
children swamped the site to sign up for hockey leagues and figure-skating 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: Due to delays by the ice manufacturer, the rink did not open as 
scheduled. Co-owner John Rudenski said the company, based in Pittsburgh, had 
trouble getting started on time because it was busy building ice rinks 
elsewhere in the world. He said he now expects the rink to open sometime this 
winter.

 The city has applied for county money to help senior citizens and low-income 
residents improve their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a Community Block Development Grant, city officials are seeking 
$25,000 to help residents who are unable to maintain their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income residents who are no longer able to pay for trash service or cannot 
remove or repair inoperable vehicles could qualify for assistance in bringing 
their homes into compliance with city requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city wants to use the money to clean up abandoned homes with 
inoperable vehicles, trash and other unsightly and unsafe conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood cleanup project aimed at helping senior citizens and disabled 
residents maintain their homes also could benefit from the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 About $10,000 would go to an existing program that provides materials for 
landscaping, painting and minor repairs to volunteer groups that assist 
qualified residents who are physically unable to perform the repairs. DANIELLE

 Issue: Consolidating municipal election with statewide primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: The city's next general election was scheduled for April 9, 1996, 
just two weeks after the statewide primary election March 26.An analysis by the 
city clerk's office indicated that consolidating the two elections could result 
in increased voter turnout and reduced costs to the city. Disadvantages of a 
consolidated election, according to the analysis, include the loss of 
visibility for city issues and candidates, and increased campaign costs for 
City Council hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: The council gave final approval to a measure consolidating the 
municipal election with the statewide primary, starting in 1996. If the primary 
election does not take place in March at some future date, the municipal 
election would return to the second Tuesday in April during even-numbered 
years. Council members in favor of the measure said a consolidated election is 
more convenient for voters. Councilman Michael J. Doyle, who opposed 
consolidation, said the municipal election date has been changed too frequently 
in recent years.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR PARAMEDIC SERVICE

<P>
 The city has made it easier for residents to subscribe to its paramedic 
program by allowing open enrollment and making other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics answer all city emergency medical calls, but residents have the 
choice of paying a $42-a-year fee for unlimited service or paying by the call 
-- $150 for basic life-support services or $250 for advanced life support 
required in trauma cases. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city began offering subscriptions in July, 1993, subscribers could 
enroll only by the year, from July of one year through June of the next. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 months of running the program, Fire Department officials have found 
that residents want to be able to begin their subscriptions at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will begin automatic renewal, sending bills to subscribers at 
the end of each 12-month subscription and giving two weeks' notice of 
cancellation if the fees are not paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions related to public safety services, the City Council this week 
approved the sale of a 1970 Mack fire engine to Ensenada, Mexico, for $5,750 
and approved a letter of intent to buy 10 new police cruisers for $202,559. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 Chevrolet Caprice cruisers will replace 10 1992 Caprice cruisers that 
are expected to exceed their 75,000-mile service life by January. HOLLY J.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; STUDENTS ASK SMOKERS TO KICK HABIT FOR DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 UC Irvine students tried to coax smokers to go cold turkey for a day Thursday 
by raffling off free Thanksgiving meals and frozen turkeys as part of the 18th 
annual American Cancer Society Smokeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at the UCI Health Education Center joined others across Orange 
County to distribute anti-smoking brochures and pamphlets to young people. As 
passersby gawked at chalked outlines of dead bodies along the sidewalk outside 
the UCI Student Center, a handful of volunteers asked smokers walking by to 
kick the habit for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 When a volunteer asked Scott Robinson, a four-year smoker, to quit for the 
day, Robinson hesitated after taking a drag from a cigarette. Then he declined, 
saying: "One day you snub it out, it's not going to change things. You got to 
die somehow anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the county Alcohol and Drug Education and Prevention Team, 90% of 
current smokers began smoking before age 21, and first-time tobacco use usually 
starts at ages 11 to 15. Once addicted to smoking in high school, teen-agers 
"become a customer with the tobacco industry for life," said Phil Falcetti, a 
drug education specialist with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Young smokers are a particular challenge, said UCI Health Education Center 
coordinator Ellen Thomas. "It's tough with this age group because they think 
they are invincible and don't feel at risk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As volunteers fanned out across the campus center Thursday, John Loh, 20, sat 
nearby puffing his cigarettes. A smoker for more than three years, Loh said he 
believes he can control his nicotine addiction. "I'm young now," Loh said. "I 
want to have fun and enjoy life. I'm athletic, so I'm not too worried about my 
health." 
</P>
<P>
 For other young people, tobacco use already has taken a deadly toll. Smokeout 
volunteer Jeff Kirchman lost his stepfather six years ago to a stroke after his 
lungs deteriorated from years of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoking is the deadliest drug out there," said Kirchman, 22. "A lot of these 
'Generation X' kids are smoking because they think it's the cult thing. It's a 
moral suicide."TINA NGUYEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; LIBRARY BOARD CHAIRWOMAN QUITS, CITING LOSS OF 
AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairwoman of the Library Board of Trustees has quit in disgust, she said, 
over the council election results and a perceived loss of authority over the 
city's beleaguered library system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This council and the last council don't give a damn about the library," said 
Mara Brandman, the library chairwoman and a losing candidate in the council 
race. "It's just a political football to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandman was one of 10 contenders for the two council seats, which went to 
incumbent Mark Murphy and realtor Dan Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 She said council members had stepped into the library board's scope of 
authority when they decided to set up an ad hoc committee of outside 
professionals as advisers. She had hoped that an election victory for her would 
signal stronger community support for the library. Instead, she came in fifth 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Coontz, who beat Councilman Fred L. Barrera for the mayor's seat, said 
Brandman is "politically motivated." The ad hoc committee will give 
professional perspectives on the library, which has suffered from cutbacks in 
staff, hours and high-tech equipment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad hoc committee should be appointed within a month, said City Manager 
David F. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not be empowered to do anything but give recommendations," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who was top vote-getter, said the library board has no reason to be 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything adversarial at all about the ad hoc committee just 
trying to put more minds on a challenging issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Library Trustee Carolyn Cavecche, who moved into the chairman's seat last 
week, said: "I want to work with the City Council, but I will be very firm 
trying to get what we need for the library. I'm not going to take a huge 
adversarial position, but I'm not going to lie down and die either."LESLEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HISTORIC POOL, GYM WILL BE REVAMPED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials say the time has come to give the historic city gym and pool a 
$2-million make-over to recapture its original glory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been in need of restoration for a number of years," said Jim Engle, 
community services deputy director. "It's a remarkable building and it's needed 
for our community. It's part of our history and recreation." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1931, the facility at 17th Street and Palm Avenue is home to the only 
indoor gym and pool operated by the city. The facility, once part of adjacent 
Ethel Dwyer Middle School, has been operated by the city for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, it has become a popular place where residents of all ages 
frequent year-round to swim, play basketball and volleyball or practice karate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a landmark downtown. . . . There are a lot of generations using the 
facility," said Dave Dominguez, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez said between 3,000 and 5,000 people visit the facility monthly for 
league play and drop-in use. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Historical Resources Commission approved the city's application Nov. 
4 to place the facility on the State and National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez also said the facility is in dire need of repairs. For instance, the 
building has no heating and only cold water in the men's locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations will be done in four phases with improvements made over the next 
five to six years. Engle said that, with the facility's historic significance, 
the city will be able to apply for grants for the restoration work. He also 
said the city is negotiating to buy the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Upgrades will include new heating, plumbing and roofing, making the facility 
accessible to the disabled, restoring the historic facade and refurbishing the 
gym and pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has secured $500,000 in federal grant money for the first phase, 
scheduled to begin next spring.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 5,000 EXPECTED TO JOIN IN WALK-A-THON AIMED 
AT HELPING VIETNAMESE REFUGEES 
</P>

<P>
 About 5,000 people are expected to participate in a 10-kilometer walk Saturday 
to help raise money for Vietnamese boat people, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual Walk-a-Thon starts at 9 a.m. at Warner Avenue and Euclid 
Street in Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they hope to raise more than $100,000 from the event. The 
money will be used to hire attorneys, legal assistants and interpreters to help 
refugees in camps in Southeast Asia avoid repatriation to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all the camps are scheduled to close by '95, and we want the ending to 
be humane and dignified for our people," said Van Tran, a spokesman for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 45,000 refugees are now living in about a dozen camps, according to 
figures from Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers, a 
Westminster-based group specializing in refugee rights. The group is one of 
more than 20 organizations sponsoring the Walk-a-Thon. Similar events will be 
held in San Jose and Houston, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the majority of these people will have to go back to Vietnam," 
Tran said. "But we want the screening process to be fair. We want the people 
who deserve to qualify as asylum seekers to get that status." 
</P>
<P>
 Camp refugees go through a screening process to determine whether they left 
Vietnam for economic or political reasons. Refugees will not be sent back to 
Vietnam if they can prove that they left Vietnam for political reasons. 
Otherwise, repatriation is the rule, Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran and other human-rights activists say the screening process as it is now 
forces repatriation of many Vietnamese who will face hardships for their 
political stance when they are returned to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said that in the past three years, some 200 people who were supposed to 
be repatriated have won political asylum status because of LAVAS intervention 
with the United Nations and camp officials.THAO HUA

<P>
 Nearing the midway point of its annual fund-raising campaign, United Way of 
Orange County has received more than $9.8 million in pledges -- just under half 
of its $20.2-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign is in good shape, and we're going to meet the goal -- there is 
no question about that," said Vince Kontny, who led the 1993 fund-raising 
effort and is serving as assistant chairman this year.Last year's campaign 
collected $19.3 million in pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions support nonprofit health and human service agencies in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Kontny, recently retired president and chief operating officer of Irvine-based 
Fluor Corp., said the county's improving economic climate is making it somewhat 
easier for companies and their employees to support United Way. He noted, 
however, that "it's a mixed bag" because many firms still are consolidating and 
downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kontny said the county's health and human service needs "are just as great, if 
not greater" than they were in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign update was delivered at a sports-themed "pep rally" in Tustin 
Ranch on Thursday that featured a motivational "halftime" talk by former 
National Football League place-kicker Efren Herrera, a two-time Super Bowl 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, who became involved with United Way during his pro football career, 
said he tries to educate Latino professionals about how campaign contributions 
help meet the needs of local Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month campaign began Sept. 16 with the annual "Day of Caring," an 
event that put corporate representatives directly in touch with 30 local 
charities, "so they could see what their dollars are doing," United Way 
spokesman Jeff Urbaniec said.ALAN EYERLY

 City officials are asking residents to help save landfill space by recycling 
old telephone directories instead of throwing them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell Directory recently launched a recycling program with the Garden 
Grove Sanitary District and the Midway City Sanitary District. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Landstedt of the city's Public Services Department said the Garden 
Grove Sanitary District has agreed to pick up discarded telephone directories 
that residents place on the curb with other recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners may place old telephone books in their trash bins. Trash 
company employees will later sort and remove them for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and businesses served by the Midway City Sanitary District may take 
old phone books to a drop-off center at the Eastgate Shopping Center at Chapman 
Avenue and Valley View. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone books will be accepted until Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Landstedt said that every ton of recycled phone books saves about three cubic 
yards of landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
 The old phone books will be shipped to an out-of-state paper mill, where they 
will be recycled for use in new directories, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell began distributing the 1995 telephone directories throughout the 
city this week. BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Palma couple who have nine children and six grandchildren have been named 
the city's 1994-95 Family of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday night honored Linda and Dennis Miller and their 
family, who were selected by a volunteer committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers have lived in La Palma for 24 years. They have five daughters and 
four sons, ranging in age from 11 to 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Miller, who owns his own landscaping business, said he thinks a key to 
having a successful family is treating each child, regardless of age, as a 
person with rights and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each person deserves love and respect," he said. "I've always told my 
children that they have the right to tell me when they feel wronged. I say, 
'Let's sit down and talk about it.' And it could be something I've handled 
incorrectly. You know, even though you are a small child, you have your 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he and his wife, Linda, a homemaker, encourage a minimum of 
television watching and a fondness for books and reading. The family sticks 
together and does many things together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wally Linn, who knows the Millers, told the council that the family's 
togetherness includes much volunteer work at Kennedy High School and in other 
community efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you that they give of themselves beyond the normal call of 
duty," the mayor said. "If there was ever a job to be done at Kennedy High 
School -- I don't care what it was -- they were there to help." 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers received a commemorative plaque and a proclamation from the 
council. BILL BILLITER

IRVINE UNDER STUDY AS SITE FOR NEW COLLEGE; EDUCATION: LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOL 
WOULD BLEND ACADEMIC INQUIRY, CHRISTIAN THOUGHT OF BRITISH AUTHOR C.S. LEWIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is one of five locations being considered by a group of scholars 
intent on creating a liberal arts college that would blend academic inquiry 
with Christian thought as embraced by the late British author C.S. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The C.S. Lewis Foundation of Redlands hasn't begun raising funds to build the 
proposed nondenominational college, planned to open in fall 2001 with about 800 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is searching for a site and, besides Irvine, the candidates include 
Claremont; Raleigh, N.C.; Princeton, N.J., and Amherst, Mass. The choice will 
be narrowed to three within the next 18 months, but a final decision could be 
three years away, according to foundation President Stanley Mattson. 
</P>
<P>
 An important consideration is the fund-raising potential in the city that is 
chosen, Mattson said. Other selection criteria include quality of life, 
affordable faculty housing and access to cultural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all those things in mind, Irvine is very attractive," Mattson said. "The 
university (UC Irvine) is also a highly international campus, which is very 
appealing to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattson, a former American history professor who retired from the University 
of Redlands in 1986 as director of corporate and foundation relations, said the 
proposed college would counter the rejection of Christian thought by most 
American universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea grew out of a concern that the current intellectual landscape 
within American higher education is one that is inhospitable to scholars of 
faith," Mattson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who died in 1963, wrote than 40 books, including "The Screwtape 
Letters" and a series of children's books known as "The Chronicles of Narnia." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was initially interested in land next to Concordia University, 
a campus affiliated with the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about the time they said, 'This land has real possibilities,' it was too 
late," said Concordia theology professor Rod Rosenbladt, a member of the Lewis 
Foundation. "The university sold the land for a housing development." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbladt, an admirer of Lewis, said the foundation's ambition to create a 
college reflects more than a desire to link Christianity with scholarship. He 
said foundation members are also concerned about a decline of academic 
traditions based on Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the same basic movement that says our universities have become 
propaganda centers," Rosenbladt said. "So people are going out to try something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at UC Irvine and Irvine Valley College said they had not been 
contacted by the Lewis Foundation. About 30,000 students attend Irvine's three 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 8-year-old Lewis Foundation are primarily university and 
college educators, according to Mattson. The foundation bought the Lewis home 
in Oxford, England, in 1988, where it is establishing a C.S. Lewis study 
center. The foundation also sponsors summer institutes in Oxford and Cambridge.

CHARLES CASE INVESTIGATORS PLAN BLOOD TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators said Thursday they plan to test for blood stains on a pair of 
high-top sneakers and sparring gloves that were seized last week from the 
family house where Edward Charles III is accused of killing his parents and 
younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also will test blood stains that were found on a night stand and 
wall inside the Fullerton house. 
</P>
<P>
 The sneakers, gloves and blood samples were the only items listed in a 
sparsely worded report on the daylong house search following the Nov. 6 
slayings of Edward and Dolores Charles, and their son Danny, a USC student. The 
report was filed in court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were found dead in a family car that had been doused with gasoline 
and set on fire Nov. 7 outside a La Mirada high school. The suspect was 
arrested two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no blood was visible on the black-and-white sneakers, Charles is 
believed to have been wearing them at the time of the killings, said Detective 
Ron Lancaster of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is leading 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the morning after the family was killed, Charles was seen by a 
neighbor wearing a pair of black fingerless gloves as he appeared to be wiping 
his driveway with a rag, according to a police affidavit. A substance 
resembling blood was on the seized sparring gloves, said sheriff's Lt. Ray 
Peavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, a 22-year-old mechanic, is an amateur boxer.  
</P>
<P>
 Peavy described the house search as fruitful, even though investigators have 
yet to find the hammer and knife they believe were used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward and Danny Charles were determined to have been bludgeoned to death. 
Danny Charles, whose body was found unburned in the trunk of the charred Honda, 
also suffered stab wounds and strangulation. Dolores Charles had bruises on her 
throat, but the cause of her death was unknown because she was burned too 
severely. 
</P>
<P>
 Peavy said investigators were able to recover spattered blood inside the 
house, though there had been evident attempts to clean the house before 
investigators obtained a warrant early on Nov. 10, just hours after Charles was 
arrested there in front of relatives and his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was charged Monday with three counts of murder with a special 
circumstance that could mean the death penalty if he is convicted. He is to be 
arraigned Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles has steadfastly maintained his innocence to authorities. An affidavit 
used to obtain the search warrant claimed he confessed the killings to friend 
Nov. 8, one day after the bodies were discovered; his defense attorney has 
denied there was any confession.

MEMORIAL CELEBRATES LIFE OF LATINO ADVOCATE DAVIS; FUNERAL: ATTORNEY CARRIED 
TORCH FOR HIS PEOPLE, WINNING LANDMARK CASE AND LEADING LOCAL OPPOSITION TO 
PROP. 187. 
</P>

 About 700 mourners Thursday remembered Wallace R. (Wally) Davis, a longtime 
Latino rights activist, as a passionate and caring man who always found time to 
help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wally was my mentor," said Santa Ana attorney Alfredo M. Amezcua. "When I 
passed my bar exam, he sat down with me for 2 1/2 hours to share with me his 
knowledge, because he wanted me to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 59, was best known as the attorney whose successful lawsuit against the 
Santa Ana Unified School District in 1968 abolished a practice of placing 
disproportionate numbers of Latino students in a program for the mentally 
retarded. He died Saturday of a heart attack in Santa Ana while playing 
basketball, his favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In attendance at funeral services at Holy Family Cathedral and Holy Sepulcher 
Cemetery were Orange County judges, educators, politicians, community activists 
and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who played the saxophone, was known in Orange County colleges, 
universities, schools, human rights organizations and political circles for his 
tireless efforts on Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, he worked on the campaign to elect Miguel Pulido, an eight-year 
council veteran, mayor of Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who volunteered his legal services to numerous Latino rights 
organizations, helped the Santa Ana chapter of the League of United Latin 
American Citizens raise money for the 30,000 mailers denouncing Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which passed overwhelmingly, bans social services, education 
and all but emergency health care to illegal immigrants. Its implementation has 
been temporarily blocked by a federal court judge.  
</P>
<P>
 "Wally was our legal counsel," said Arturo Montez, LULAC's president. "He was 
going to handle all the Proposition 187 lawsuits for us. Now, we're left 
without any legal counsel whatsoever.. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He had never lost a case for us. . . . Everything he did was with passion, 
with heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Aguirre, a Fullerton attorney, said close friend Davis "touched a lot of 
people. It's amazing what one man can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who was of Mexican American, Juaneno Indian and Anglo heritage, "was 
born to fight for what we all know is right," said UC Irvine Prof. Manuel 
Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Friend Vera Perez said: "Wally was always ready to help and always believed in 
helping youth. I remember him as a wonderful, beautiful person who was always 
there for you, always with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' seven children -- daughters Anja Friday, Marisa Timothy, Nadia and 
Sabrina, and sons Mark, Luke and Erik -- delivered tearful eulogies, describing 
their father as a pillar in the family and the Latino community. They read 
poems, told of their father's struggles against racism as a child and sang his 
favorite song, "Sentimental Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Davis, 31, said his father was writing an autobiography when he died. One 
passage told how Davis was tossed out of elementary school "like trash" because 
of his race, but he managed to "land on his feet." Throughout his life, Davis 
said, his father continued to land on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daddy wrote a song for me to tell me of his love," said Marisa Timothy, 
28, her voice trembling. "He wrote a song for you, too. His instruments were 
faith and hope and the melody was love." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, of Santa Ana, is also survived by his wife of 33 years, Irmgard, 59, 
and six grandchildren.

BOARD REJECTS PLAN FOR ROLLER HOCKEY ARENA AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a roller hockey arena at the Wardlow School were shot down Thursday 
night by the school board, after neighbors predicted the arena would bring 
traffic and noise.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley school board refused to waive its policy that prohibits 
roller sports on school grounds -- even a vacant school site such as Wardlow. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Huntington Beach and Kid Connection, a nonprofit youth group, had 
proposed the arena at the school at 9191 Pioneer Drive om Huntington Beach, and 
that city had approved spending $5,000 to help build it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Catherine Hacker, who lives near the school, called it a "bad 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about the liability issue, and as a board member we have a fiscal 
responsibility. I was also concerned that there was no neighborhood support for 
it. The site was not a good site for a roller hockey rink."

DEFENDANT IN SWINDLING TRIAL WON'T TESTIFY; COURTS: THREE O.C. WOMEN SAY JAMES 
BORZYNSKI PROMISED LOVE, MARRIAGE BUT MADE OFF WITH $87,000 THAT WAS NOT 
REPAID. 
</P>

 James Borzynski, the used-car salesman accused of becoming a Don Juan con 
artist, refused to take the stand Thursday to defend himself against charges he 
swindled three Orange County women out of $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski's attorney said his client decided late Wednesday night that he did 
not need to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief that the present state of evidence is insufficient for a 
conviction," said defense attorney Dennis O'Connell. "The witnesses have all 
testified that they viewed him as a sympathetic person and felt sorry for him 
and gave him money because they wanted to help him. That's not false 
pretenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski, 45, a former Laguna Niguel resident, is charged with three counts 
of grand theft by false pretenses. He was arrested last November after 10 
California women complained to authorities, and three Orange County women 
pressed charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Five women have testified in Superior Court this week that Borzynski promised 
them love and marriage, and to repay the loans promptly. Instead, they said, he 
disappeared with their money. Prosecutors say Borzynski used at least 12 
aliases in his dealings with the women.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said his client has done nothing wrong and that the testimony of at 
least one witness, Joan Norton, 47, of Aliso Viejo, is suspect. O'Connell 
introduced bankruptcy forms into evidence Thursday that Norton allegedly filed 
in 1993, the year she was involved with Borzynski. 
</P>
<P>
 Several statements she allegedly made on the forms are inconsistent with 
testimony Norton gave during the trial, O'Connell said. Norton, who contends 
she gave Borzynski $50,000, took the Fifth Amendment Thursday when pressed by 
O'Connell to answer questions about the forms. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell would not comment on what the forms contain, but said he will 
disclose the alleged inconsistencies publicly during closing arguments in the 
trial on Monday.

2 TRAFFIC CONTROL WORKERS HURT BY HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men doing traffic control work early Thursday at Warner Avenue and Ross 
Street were struck and injured by an unidentified motorist who fled, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Agotsch, 20, of Laguna Hills and Scott Frank, 28, of Costa Mesa were 
picking up traffic cones at 4 a.m. when they were struck by a white Toyota 
pickup, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agotsch was pinned between a truck and the signal-board trailer it was towing. 
He was later reported in fair condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, who was standing in the truck bed when the collision occurred, suffered 
minor injuries and was taken to Huntington Beach Medical Center for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the driver of the pickup stopped briefly and then drove onto the 
southbound San Diego Freeway. He was described as white, 25 to 30 years old, 
with heavy mustache and eyeglasses, about 6 feet tall and of medium build. 
Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to notify the Fountain 
Valley Police Department at (714) 965-4481.

VIDEO SHOWN IN ABORTION CLINIC TRIAL; COURT: ADMINISTRATOR WHO FACES MURDER 
CHARGES INSISTED ON HER INNOCENCE IN 1993 TAPED POLICE INTERVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An abortion clinic administrator accused of the murder of one of her patients 
insisted on her innocence in a taped interview with police that was played in 
court for the first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Hanna, who was allegedly caught by witnesses trying to stuff the 
victim's body into the trunk of a car, told skeptical Santa Ana police 
investigators during the Jan. 19 interrogation that she had only tried to help 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not do anything bad," Hanna said in the interview with the 
investigators who had brought her in for questioning the night the woman died. 
"I was there for her. I'm innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna is charged with the murder of 27-year-old Angela Nieto Sanchez, an 
Orange woman who police say went to Hanna's clinic in January, 1993, seeking an 
abortion. She is accused of injecting the woman with an unknown drug, and 
refusing to call 911 after the woman began vomiting and foaming at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez's 12-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son were waiting outside the 
clinic as their mother died, then were sent home with an uncle by Hanna after 
an assistant told them their mother had left without them, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives told investigators that when they returned to the clinic to find 
Sanchez later that night, they discovered Hanna attempting to hoist the dead 
woman's body into the trunk of Sanchez's car. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the taped interview, Hanna gives a very different version of events 
that night. She insisted to investigators that she never injected Sanchez and 
that the two had "only talked" about a possible abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Sanchez then left the clinic and that she didn't see her again until 
several hours later, when a man drove an unconscious Sanchez into her driveway 
and took off running. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said she was trying to drag Sanchez out of the car to help her when 
Sanchez's relatives drove up. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really cold," Hanna said in the interview. "And I was trying to pull 
her out. . . . I didn't know if she had fainted or she was dead. I never 
touched a dead body before." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Steve Biskar, has said that Sanchez 
died before an abortion was performed and a subsequent botched autopsy on her 
body has concealed the true cause of the woman's death. 
</P>
<P>
 But several times during the interview, Santa Ana investigators Ruben Zambrano 
and Phillip Lozano pointed out discrepancies between Hanna's story and the 
claims of Sanchez's relatives, who, the investigators contended, had no reason 
to lie.  
</P>
<P>
 They accused Hanna of "playing games" and urged her to tell them the truth. 
Investigators also noted during the interview that she never expressed regret 
over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried," Hanna protested. "I cried with her daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 "You were crying for yourself," one of the investigators responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been here for hours and you've shown no remorse," Lozano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want me to do, cry so that you think it's my fault?" Hanna asked. 
"Come on. Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is scheduled to continue Monday, when Sanchez's daughter, now 13, is 
expected to take the stand.

IRVINE SCHOOL BOARD DROPS CONTROVERSIAL 'NO-FAIL' RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school board this week ended the "no-fail" rule for extracurricular 
activities that had prompted a four-year legal battle between the Irvine 
Unified School District and a high school cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Woodbridge High School cheerleader Melissa Fontes sued the district in 
1990 after she was dropped from the pep squad for failing a chemistry class.She 
claimed the no-fail policy was unfair because it did not apply to male 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the state Supreme Court upheld an appellate court decision that the 
policy was discriminatory. The justices, however, said the ruling applied only 
to the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's new eligibility policy applies uniform regulations for 
all extracurricular activities. After the school board approved a first reading 
of the policy last month, trustees said they wanted to consider adding the 
no-fail rule for all extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But interim Supt. Dean Waldfogel argued against the no-fail provision Tuesday 
night, saying it would encourage athletes to "play the system" by taking easier 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board unanimously approved the second reading of the policy, which 
also lowers the 2.5 grade-point average that was required of cheerleaders to 
the same 2.0 average required of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Mary Ellen Hadley asked Waldfogel to find out how many 
failing grades are received by students in the district. But Hadley said she 
has no intention of trying to reinstate the no-fail rule. "I just think that's 
something we ought to know," she said.
