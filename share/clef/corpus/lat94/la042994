O.C. THEATRE REVIEW; RICH TALENT, POOR ON FAME 
</P>

<P>
 In a thoughtful and entertaining show at the Way Off Broadway Playhouse, Mark 
Turnbull offers the bittersweet reflections of a genuine artist who should have 
become rich and famous but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Poet, songwriter, singer and jazz guitarist -- a modern troubadour of sorts -- 
he started out in a blaze of glory. If early promise meant anything, Turnbull 
was destined for big things. As a junior at Newport Harbor High School in the 
late '60s, he wrote a Grammy-nominated children's album for Disney called "A 
Happy Birthday Party With Winnie the Pooh." As a senior, he recorded his next 
album, "Portrait of the Young Artist," for Reprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the fortunate ones who knew what he wanted to do from the 
beginning," he remarks, a tall, thin, bearded redhead sitting under an amber 
spotlight and looking like a bohemian lumberjack. "Well, here I am. What went 
wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing actually -- not if you care for witty lyrics and offbeat irony, 
musical warmth and coffeehouse charisma. They're all abundantly evident in 
"Mark Turnbull and Friends -- A One-Man Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Both as tunesmith and storyteller, Turnbull has a self-deprecating talent for 
combining the heartfelt with the facetious. And that keeps his retrospective 
look at himself, and his downward climb on the mainstream ladder of success, 
consistently amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly two dozen songs he has chosen from his prolific output date mostly 
from the '70s. Often delivered just above a whisper in a high-pitched voice, 
all are worth hearing and some are worth treasuring. My own favorites are "In a 
Classroom," "Baseball Cards," "Baggage," but especially "Teach Me." 
</P>
<P>
 The "friends" who get top billing with Turnbull never appear in person. 
Instead, they populate the rich tapestry of stories he weaves from his personal 
history and his backstage memories of the scene at the Golden Bear, a legendary 
club in Huntington Beach (now defunct) where he got his arts education 
listening to everyone from Ramblin' Jack Elliott to Lord Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnbull might be accused of name-dropping if his stories weren't so much fun. 
He tells how he met George Harrison in an effort to get recorded by Apple, when 
the Beatles were starting up the label. He tells how he used to ditch school 
("actually sixth period -- we were good bad boys") with Frank Marshall, the 
future Hollywood producer of "E.T.," "Back to the Future" and the "Indiana 
Jones" pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more comical stories relates his encounter with John Wayne at a 
Christmas bash thrown annually in Newport Beach by a big-time record producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnbull, the high school prodigy, was invited to write and perform a Yuletide 
tune. Proud as a peacock, he showed up in "Spanish bedspread pants, a white 
shirt with red polka dots and a purple, floppy Edgar Allan Poe bow tie." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne just blinked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked," Turnbull recounts, "like the unraveling of the American flag, the 
death of Betsy Ross, the dissolution of America itself." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, any sign of the extroverted dandy is long gone. Turnbull seems 
like nothing less than a performer on a spiritual quest, unwilling to pander 
even when he's being funny, full of quiet conviction, poetic vigor, clever 
whimsy and touching insight. 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes it easy to understand why Peter Tork of the Monkees once told him: 
"Mark, I see nothing between you and success except a long hard road." 
</P>
<P>

MIRAMAX'S 'CROW' QUIETLY TAKES FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the 
land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens, that a terrible 
sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then, sometimes, just 
sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put things right."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On May 11, "The Crow," which opens with the above ominous voice-over, will 
arrive in Los Angeles and New York theaters. Two days later it will open 
nationwide. But this Brandon Lee film, which generated more publicity than most 
films during production, will open with no premiere or much of the usual 
fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Its distributor, Miramax, known for trumpeting controversy surrounding its 
films, this time has tried its best to downplay the tragedy associated with 
this film version of James O'Barr's horror comic book, namely, the death of the 
28-year-old Lee on March 31, 1993, after he was accidentally shot by a dummy 
slug during a climactic scene on the Wilmington, N.C., set. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the opening of the film, in which a crow soars through the rainy midnight 
urban skyline, the film's campaign began in February with a poster of a crow 
flying out of the film's title. Last weekend a 90-second MTV spot, overlaid 
with Gothic music, told the haunting tale of this avenging angel from the 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
 More TV spots are planned for this weekend; a soundtrack album, released in 
March, is already No. 36 on the charts. Full-page and two-page print ads, 
showing Lee walking through a corridor, back-lit by a halo of downcast light 
and framed by only his name and a line from the film, began appearing last week 
and will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 But no mention of what happened to Brandon Lee will ever be noted in this 
campaign. "This is very delicate," says David Dinerstein, president of 
marketing for Miramax. "What happened is not something we're running from. But 
we have to be very sensitive to Brandon's memory, his family and the film."  
</P>
<P>
 The $14-million film almost didn't see the light of day. Practically from the 
day filming began on Feb. 1, 1993, problems plagued production. There were 
reports of a Wilmington carpenter working on the set being severely burned when 
live power lines hit the crane he was working on. A disgruntled sculptor who 
reportedly went berserk on the back lot drove a car through the studio's 
plaster shop. A construction worker slipped and drove a screwdriver through his 
hand; a stuntman, after working nine hours straight, reportedly fell the wrong 
way on a roof and broke some ribs. A storm hit 17 days before Lee's shooting, 
destroying some of the sets.  
</P>
<P>
 Some problems were blamed on non-union crews' being overworked and producers' 
penny-pinching. But it was Lee's death that prompted the film's Australian 
director, Alex Proyas, to consider abandoning his first American feature, says 
Edward R. Pressman, who co-produced the film with Jeff Most. "Alex really felt 
like he couldn't go on" after Lee's death, Pressman says. The cast, crew and 
Lee's family and fiancee, Eliza Hutton -- whom Lee had been planning to wed 
immediately after production wrapped -- were distraught. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was shot during a scene by fellow actor Michael Masee, portraying bad guy 
Fat Boy, who fired a .44-caliber blank pistol from 15 feet away. Without 
anyone's knowledge, a dummy slug had lodged in the pistol and when Masee fired, 
it dislodged from the gun and penetrated Lee's abdomen. The scene has been 
removed from the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's district attorney Jerry Spivey investigating the incident 
found no evidence of "willful and wanton" negligence on the part of the 
production company, Crowvision Inc., Masee or the crew, although North 
Carolina's Occupational Safety and Health Division levied a $77,000 fine 
against Crowvision for three workplace violations. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lee's mother, Linda Lee Cadwell, sued the company for negligence, settling 
out of court for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month hiatus following Lee's death, production resumed on May 26, 
1993. At that time, Hutton said she supported the film: "Brandon told me that 
he thought this film was his finest performance yet. I know he would have 
wanted it to be completed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, both Lee's character, rocker Eric Draven, and fiancee Shelly 
(Sofia Shinas) are killed Halloween Eve, the day before their wedding. It is 
Eric's ghost that comes back to avenge their death. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, the film's distributor, Paramount Pictures, decided to drop the 
project, saying the movie was too disturbing in light of Lee's death. Miramax 
then stepped in, to distribute the picture jointly under its Miramax and 
Dimension banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadwell, Hutton and Lee's personal manager and close friend Jan McCormack, who 
expressed rage over the death publicly last year, were all unavailable for 
comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pressman and Miramax say they would not have pursued finishing or 
releasing the picture without the blessing of Hutton and Lee's family. They say 
they asked for their counsel on every aspect of finishing, handling and 
marketing of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not marketing this film as a legacy to Brandon Lee," Pressman says. 
"We are trying to take the high road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliza is adverse to a (premiere) party, but we have talked about the idea of 
setting up a foundation in Brandon's name," Pressman said. "We're still 
grappling with what we will do and the family really isn't ready to deal with 
this yet. They are still grieving. But they really have been very supportive of 
this movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a word-of-mouth screening in Phoenix a month ago," Dinerstein says. 
"People lined up around the block to get into the theater, wearing masks (like 
Lee's character) and dressed like crows. We were really shocked to see it. They 
were kids who are part of a real underground fan club, fans of the comic book, 
of Brandon and just action fans in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it is really sad what has happened with all of the circumstances 
surrounding this film. But we're hoping this film will send out a positive 
image to kids."

A CLASSICAL GAS; MUSIC: PIANIST JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET USES ELEGANCE AND STYLE TO 
MAKE CONCERT-GOING A COLORFUL EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SWED, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jean-Yves Thibaudet welcomes a visitor to his Upper West Side penthouse, 
on one of the first warm days after the winter that no one stops complaining 
about, he is wearing faded jeans, loafers without socks, a black T-shirt with 
the sleeves rolled up, an expensive illuminated designer vest and a large 
stylish metallic crucifix. He is young, fit and looks like a million dollars. 
He could be a television or movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that, of course, is supposed to matter in the mostly dowdy world of 
classical music. Thibaudet's sartorial style should not tell you how the 
32-year-old pianist from Lyons will play the Beethoven Second Piano Concerto 
tonight and Saturday with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. In classical 
music, "style" usually means only the manner in which a piece of music is 
played, not the way the performer looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Style, however, is also that which we conventionally separate from substance. 
But music, being non-representational, so the New Harvard Dictionary of Music 
reminds us, is also nothing but style. Style, in other words, is content. And 
anyone who wants evidence might try focusing the laser beam anyplace along 
Thibaudet's celebrated CD set of Ravel's piano music on London Records. He is a 
pianist whose preference, in the French stylistic manner, is distinctly the 
music's substance, each note cleanly articulated, textures made to seem as 
clear as spring water. 
</P>
<P>
 Thibaudet's pianistic style is most often described as "elegant" in review 
after review (Albert Goldberg chose "exquisite" for Thibaudet's Los Angeles 
debut a dozen years ago), and elegance happens to be something that Thibaudet 
feels not only can enhance the concert experience, but might just be a way to 
help make it more enticing to that new generation everyone in the business is 
desperate to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think style is part of that," Thibaudet says in his fluent English. "I 
think it does help. The concert experience is already such a stiff thing. You 
sit down at the piano, just by yourself, and everybody is supposed to be really 
quiet and listen to you. So I think you have to make it a little more 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never go in jeans. You have to respect the audience. Still, being 
really elegant and stylish is important, and you can find different ways to do 
it. It doesn't have to be a white cummerbund with tails. I always have a nice 
vest with it or something different, just to give some color." 
</P>
<P>
 Thibaudet's craving for color and elegance, moreover, is something that seems 
to spill over into every aspect of his life and art, from his passion for 
Versace to his love of Brazilian popular music. In Japan, where he has had a 
large following for many years, he has modeled clothes on television 
commercials, which he called lots of fun. "I always loved clothes, whether 
causal or to get dressed up." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't make it that much fun, however, in most concert halls with their 
stiff performer dress code. "We have to have this white shirt, white tie," 
Thibaudet complains. "I mean, it's really boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, to most in Thibaudet's generation and younger, white tie and tails is 
the uniform of the service industry, of exclusive restaurant waiters and hotel 
porters. Thibaudet notes that tails are so outre these days that to get nice 
ones you have to have them made. "They're not part of the collections anymore, 
because who's going to buy them besides classical artists?" 
</P>
<P>
 This idea of not separating style from substance in music and dress has 
lasting implications for Thibaudet. Not only does he hope that by making the 
classical concert experience less frumpy, it might seem more appealing to a 
younger fashion-conscious audience, style, in his case, is also a meaningful 
symbol of a wide-ranging musical mind. For Thibaudet, that means everything 
from a love for opera and the human voice to an active interest in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 Two highlights of his musical life, he says, exemplify this. One was touring 
with mezzo-soprano Brigitte Fassbaender this season in a program of Hugo Wolf 
songs (which he has also recorded). From Fassbaender, he says, he has learned 
"the things you don't have on the piano, all about phrasing and legato and 
breathing. For me, it's the best lesson, especially when you have to play a 
slow movement of Beethoven, and it's just like someone singing. If you can't 
think of it that way, I think you're missing the whole point." 
</P>
<P>
 The other is performing Messiaen's massive "Turangalila," which he has 
recorded with the Concertgebouw Orchestra under Riccardo Chailly. It is 
representative of his interest in modern music, which he says is, like his 
taste in clothes, purely instinctive. When he hears something he likes, he 
plays it, whether it is music by Dutch modernist Peter Schat or American 
romantic Lowell Liebermann or even the new work for piano and orchestra by the 
young Italian post-minimalist Luca Francesconi, which he'll be premiering soon 
in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the the world of fashion, musical styles keep changing. If you like 
clothes, you tend to like all kinds of clothes, new styles, different styles. 
And Thibaudet offers the same philosophy to the classical music world as a 
method for survival in a pop-dominated culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think music is just music," Thibaudet enthuses, pointing to his two 
revolving CD shelves of the latest pop releases on one side of his living room 
and a tall column of opera sets on the other. "If you like music you have to 
love all kinds of music. Which also should go the other way. All those young 
kids who love pop music should also like classical." 
</P>
<P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'WOMAN': DAYS OF WINE AND TURMOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What does happen when a man loves a woman? Is it really necessary, as the 
Percy Sledge song mournfully insisted, to spend your last dime and sleep out in 
the rain? Or is a middle ground possible, one with perhaps a bit less suffering 
and a bit more dry land? Hollywood wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sledge on the soundtrack and Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia in starring roles 
as a couple as much in trouble as they are in love, "When a Man Loves a Woman," 
directed by Luis Mandoki from a script by Ronald Bass and Al Franken, 
demonstrates why emotional turmoil is always a tricky subject for studio films 
to deal with effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 For though everyone yearns for the impact only the realistic treatment of 
problems delivers, there is inevitably a timid reluctance to renounce the 
slickness of Hollywood that serves as a convenient safety net. And seriousness 
of purpose does not mix well with excessive contrivance, not well at all. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is more unfortunate than usual with "When a Man Loves a Woman," 
because Garcia and especially Ryan have worked extremely hard on their 
performances, with excellent results. But the honesty of their work only serves 
to point up the surrounding artificiality, which displays their accomplishments 
in a shallow light. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasantly settled in San Francisco, Michael and Alice Green are introduced 
joking around at the Buena Vista, a celebrated local cafe. He is a dark and 
killer-handsome pilot, she a lively mother of two young girls (only one of whom 
is Michael's) who works at a local school. The fun all four have together, 
complete with cloying remarks like "God, woman, just look at her" from one of 
those precocious tykes to the other about their mom, is treacly enough to make 
one yearn for the trouble to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But though it may set your teeth on edge, this fantasy setup is simply the 
opening thrust of a classic Hollywood one-two situation. The idea is to first 
envy the Greens their seemingly ideal life and their glamorous external 
trappings, only to pity them and feel superior later on when it turns out that 
they've a worse set of crises than most people in the audience. Which they do. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take too long for the first sign of trouble to appear. One sad look 
from older daughter Jess (Tina Majorino) at her mother as she lies in bed hung 
over from an anniversary celebration is the key: Alice turns out to be a 
Problem Drinker with a quart of vodka a day habit and a genius for denial. 
</P>
<P>
 While a difficulty like that might be enough for most movies, "When a Man 
Loves a Woman" isn't about to take any chances. Among the many other things 
that go wrong in the Greens' lives is a threat to his job, a major child-care 
blowup, painful conflicts about Jess' absent father and overbearing 
grandmother, even child abuse and several near-death experiences. It gets so 
that when anyone sets foot in the street you fear at the very least they'll be 
struck by a passing bus. 
</P>
<P>
 And that doesn't even count the way the situations are milked on screen, often 
by having 9-year-old Majorino, a charming actress, pull some of the longest 
faces ever recorded as she responds to loaded "What's an alcoholic?"-type 
questions from her perky younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 This consistent artificiality is not at all in keeping with the strength of 
the performances, especially Ryan's. Always an audience favorite, the actress 
uses that sympathy to her advantage here, strongly and graphically portraying a 
woman who not only acts badly in the grip of alcoholism but continues to be 
mired in pain and confusion both in treatment and afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Garcia has to spend most of the movie saying supportive things like 
"You're not alone, honey, never," he, too, has his impressive moments, when 
this habit of insisting everything will be OK is called into question. When the 
movie allows itself to focus on Alice and Michael dealing one-on-one with these 
core difficulties, it is at its most persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, the Greens' predicament doesn't move you as much as the 
quality of the acting makes you think it would. As crisis mounts on crisis, the 
wires of manipulation become too visible and you start to feel uncomfortably 
like an emotional dartboard. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a measure of "When a Man Loves a Woman's" lack of restraint that when 
Michael and Alice take a vacation in Mexico, prominently visible on her beach 
blanket is a copy of Amy Tan's "The Kitchen God's Wife," which just happens to 
be executive producer and co-screenwriter Bass' next project. Filmmakers who 
wouldn't hesitate at the thought of such a shameless plug can't be trusted to 
deal with the issues this film raises with the straightforwardness they 
deserve.

 Screen Deal: Culture Clash, the Los Angeles Chicano comedy trio that has 
already transformed its successful stage shows into a sketch comedy series on 
Fox TV, will star in its first major feature, "Gomez, Gomez, Gomez," for United

Salinas and Herbert Siguenza -- as bumbling L.A. detectives hired by a museum 
to recover a priceless stolen Mexican Indian headdress. Studio executives 
reportedly agreed to the picture immediately after the trio acted out the 
entire story line during a meeting. Culture Clash has previously appeared in

 Ramona Directors Step Down: Maurice and Hilda Jara, co-directors of Hemet's 
Ramona Pageant for the past 27 years, are retiring after this weekend's final 
performances of the 71-year-old outdoor play. The couple set a longevity record 
for directing the pageant. Maurice Jara, 72, cited health reasons for his 
departure and added, "I'd hate for the day to come when they'd throw me out." 
Prior to directing the pageant, he set a record for playing the co-starring 
role of Alessandro longer than anyone else -- 15 years. Pageant executive 
director Roland Parker said a handful of applications had been received for the 
director's job, and interviews will begin soon.

 * UCLA's Aman Shows Canceled: The UCLA Center for the Performing Arts has 
canceled its June 4 and 5 performances of the Aman International Music & Dance 
Ensemble. The performances were originally scheduled for UCLA's Royce Hall, but 
were moved to the Wadsworth Theater after the Royce sustained significant 
damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. The production won't fit on the Wadsworth 
stage, however, so refunds will be offered to all ticket holders. The Aman 
company has scheduled a makeup performance June 19 at Glendale's Alex Theater. 
Separate tickets must be purchased for that show. POP/ROCK

MOVIE REVIEW; 'HONORS': CONTRIVED LESSON FOR A STUDENT AT HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvard and the homeless -- what a concept! "With Honors" gives us Monty 
(Brendan Fraser), an industrious political science student who reluctantly 
befriends Simon (Joe Pesci), a ragamuffin misfit who lives in the boiler room 
of Harvard's Widener Library. This is a life-lesson movie where most of the 
lessons run one-way. Simon's got all the answers. Monty at first doesn't even 
know the questions. By the end he learns to shed his snobbishness and see Simon 
as a person, not a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 This journey-to-wisdom, scripted by playwright William Mastrosimone, is 
preordained from the first contrivance. Monty loses his entire senior thesis on 
his computer during a power outage and then loses his one printed copy by 
accidentally dropping it down a grate and into Simon's hideaway. Simon, sensing 
an angle, makes the sputtering student a deal: He will return one page of his 
100-page thesis at a time for an equal number of favors. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the favors are tiny -- like a supply of glazed doughnuts with no 
cracks in the glaze. Then Monty, exasperated, puts Simon up in the abandoned VW 
van in the front yard of the house he shares with three other students. Simon 
gets blankets, food and wine but no entry into the house -- at least not until 
another series of contrivances kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Honors" works best when it's not trying to clobber us with socially 
conscious parables about how we should respect our fellow man. We should, of 
course, but shouldn't an audience's intelligence also be respected? There's a 
scene where Monty is chewed out by his arch Nobel laureate professor, played by 
Gore Vidal no less, that really takes the "Paper Chase" cake. Vidal, trying for 
John Houseman's plump snootiness, tears into the boy's notions of democracy 
until the Harvard-T-shirted Simon, who has accompanied Monty to class, quashes 
the snob with a ringing endorsement of we-the-people. The theater owners 
playing this film should hand out copies of the Constitution to patrons as they 
exit the multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 The college roommate atmosphere, which seemed so phony in the recent 
"Threesome," actually seems almost believable in "With Honors," perhaps because 
the director Alek Keshishian is a Harvard '86 grad. He quickly establishes the 
other roomies: Courtney (Moira Kelley) has a tart, Winona Ryder look and a 
furtive crush on Monty; Jeff (Josh Hamilton) is a premed student who takes one 
look at Simon and puts a bolt on his door; Everett (Patrick Dempsey) is a 
college radio DJ with a pet rooster and a love of vino -- he's the kind of 
gentle eccentric who blooms on every campus. Their glancing, cantankerous 
interactions are familiar and funny. They turn to cardboard only when Simon is 
required to set each one of them on the road to self-betterment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Fraser has a strong brooding presence, a hurt quality that at least 
makes Monty's attachment to Simon believable. Simon fills in for Monty's errant 
father, and Monty takes the place of the son Simon walked out on years before. 
It's all terribly schematic, but Fraser and Pesci work well together. Fraser 
takes some of the nattering edge off of Pesci's performance. (In "Jimmy 
Hollywood" there was no such buffer, and Pesci's performance felt like an 
assault.) Pesci enjoys playing this ragamuffin sage and some of his enjoyment 
cuts through the corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of it, though. In the end there's still a large portion of the 
cornfield left unharvested and flapping in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for language and brief sensuality . Times guidelines: It 
includes a few scenes of homelessness that might disturb small children and 
should disturb adults .

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PCU' AN ATTEMPT TO SKEWER CAMPUS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "PCU" stands for both Port Chester University and Politically Correct 
University. Actually, the spoofing of campus politics is haphazard and directed 
mainly at humorless feminists.The whole point of this anemic venture is to get 
down and party, but it comes across as a pale passe carbon of "Animal House" 
that's not half as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Young stars as a preppy who's come to PCU for the weekend to see if he 
wants to enroll there in the fall. He's assigned to a good-natured sharpie 
(Jeremy Piven), who's the key guy in the Pit, a residence hall that's supposed 
to be the last bastion of independent thought on campus, waging a war on PC. 
This translates mainly into the students asserting their right to engage in 
nonstop hell-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Adam Leff and Zak Penn and directed by Hart Bochner, "PCU" is 
terrifically tedious, its people and their lives remaining relentlessly 
uninvolving. You're better off with the real thing, the amusing and involving 
"Frosh: Nine Months in a College," which reveals what it's actually like to be 
in college in the '90s.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NO ESCAPE' FROM THE VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm not a joiner," says imprisoned Marine Capt. John Robbins (Ray Liotta) in 
"No Escape," and that's an understatement. After assassinating his commanding 
officer in the very first scene, Robbins is dispatched to a maximum security 
prison and then, still bucking the authorities, dumped by the 
don't-mess-with-me warden (Michael Lerner) into the ultimate prison -- a jungle 
peninsula called Absolom, 200 miles from civilization. He's not much of a 
joiner there either. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't really blame him. Half the peninsula is occupied by the Outsiders, a 
band of 600 or so really grody guys, led by the snickery, very hairy Marek 
(Stuart Wilson). These convicts have gone tribal in a big way -- they 
decapitate each other for sport, bare their tonsils in bloodcurdling yells and 
never, ever floss. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, by comparison, is a GQ model, and so it's not long before he does a 
back flip into raging waterfalls, which brings him into contact with the 
Insiders. (This flipping into raging torrents must be the latest thing: You 
half expect Robbins to collide in the rapids with "The Fugitive's" Richard 
Kimble.) The Insiders, led by a haunted-looking ex-surgeon known as the Father 
(Lance Henriksen), are a comparatively peaceful brood of convicts numbering 
less than 100; they weave and grow vegetables and ready themselves for periodic 
assaults from the Outsiders. Robbins could be an asset to them -- he is, after 
all, the only guy ever to escape from the Outsiders -- but he just wants out. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins the loner individualist is, of course, a good guy camouflaged by a 
scowl and an attitude. He's a natural leader, as opposed to all the unnatural 
Outsider types. There's a brotherhood-of-man morality play lurking in all this 
underbrush, but it's best not to peer too closely. Pulp is best digested raw. 
(But not too raw: There is not a single woman on the entire peninsula, but the 
film is surprisingly chaste about any suggestion of male coupling.) It's clear 
that director Martin Campbell doesn't have the same feeling for the Insiders as 
he does for the Outsiders. The spectacle of virtuousness seems to curdle his 
movie-making instincts; it doesn't galvanize the Mad Max in his soul. And so we 
in the audience are placed in the same wait-and-see position as the Insiders 
bracing for another attack -- except that we look forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie bad guys always seem to take up more space on the screen than good guys. 
Besides the Father, the Insiders include a jumbo-size security chief (Ernie 
Hudson), an inventor (Jack Shepherd) who is sort of like a jungle version of Q 
in the James Bond series, and a youthful, scared-stiff kidnaper (Kevin Dillon) 
who looks up to Robbins. None of them can hold a candle to the gross-out 
bullyboys from the wrong side of the falls. Stuart Wilson, in particular, is so 
amusingly vile as Marek that he positively glistens with dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that spending a few hours with all their yelling and 
puncturing and head-rolling is any great time either. "No Escape" will appeal 
primarily to people who thought "The Road Warrior" was a tad too intellectual. 
Except for all the brains it spills, it could qualify as the archetypal 
no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>

language . Times guidelines: It includes virtually nonstop graphic violence.

'THE FAVOR' A PLEASANT COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Favor" is a pleasant romantic comedy, aimed at thirtysomethings and 
younger, and it affords solid roles for Harley Jane Kozak and Elizabeth 
McGovern. Bearing a 1991 copyright, the film had been held up by the bankruptcy 
filing by Orion Pictures, which has since reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 Married 10 years to Peter (Bill Pullman), a nice, but often preoccupied, guy, 
Kozak's Kathy finds that as her 15th high school reunion approaches she starts 
dreaming of her high school boyfriend, a macho football player with whom she 
did not go all the way. She and Peter, who live in Portland, have been married 
long enough to have two small daughters and busy lives loaded with 
responsibilities, and to discover that both are often too tired to make love. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy realizes she's got what might be called a 10-year itch, but is not about 
to scratch it. However, there's no reason why her best pal Emily (McGovern) 
can't look up her old boyfriend Tom (Ken Wahl) while she's on Denver on 
business. Emily is a single, definitely liberated woman who says she's getting 
tired of her younger lover (Brad Pitt) anyway. Indeed, Kathy thinks that she 
might just get Tom out of her system if Emily ended up in bed with him. 
Predictably, Kathy's cockamamie logic backfires spectacularly, even beyond her 
being driven crazy by Emily's description of Tom's awesome sexual prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Favor" is as American as apple pie, perhaps in its way as puritanical as 
"The Scarlet Letter." Kathy is a healthy, attractive young woman with a 
completely natural and understandable sexual longing, which Kozak expresses 
with much good humor. But you suspect strongly that writers Sara Parriott and 
Josann McGibbon and director Donald Petrie aren't going to let Kathy have her 
fling with Tom. In any event, there's much elaborate contrivance to bring the 
film to its finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast, however, does sparkle, and Kozak and McGovern play off each other 
smartly. Pullman's a likable nerd and Pitt is especially good as a young man 
who has to struggle mightily to be taken seriously by his elders -- elders by 
six or seven years. Wahl finds hilarity in the hunky Tom, even though he's been 
arbitrarily given a nasty side. Larry Miller contributes one of his insidious 
pompous types as the worst possible man Peter could take as a confidante. 
There's a bit of sadness, too, underlying "The Favor" in that people still in 
their 30s actually believe they're getting old. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines: Its basic premise is about a 
sexual situation, so it includes considerable innuendo and adult situations.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'FIRE THIS TIME' SHEDS LIGHT ON L.A. RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Fire This Time" documentarian Randy Holland has done such a thorough 
soul-searching job of researching the roots of the 1992 L.A. riots that the 
event itself takes on a quality of tragic inevitability. Most people who will 
see this film -- and countless others who probably will not -- are aware of the 
pervasiveness of racial inequality and injustice. Almost everyone, regardless 
of his or her opinions, has been inundated by images of the riots on TV or in 
newspapers or magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-worsening plight of blacks trapped in ghettos is so familiar, so 
omnipresent, that many no longer respond to it. Holland, however, demolishes 
indifference, first by sketching the difficult history of blacks in Southern 
California, and then by letting the people of South-Central L.A. speak for 
themselves. Holland starts making connections that are finally explosive in 
impact, like a string of firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
 The way in which Holland weaves together the words of his witnesses reveals 
the destructive interplay of social, political and economic forces. "The Fire 
This Time" suggests persuasively that inflammatory infiltration activities on 
the part of police and the FBI have had an even more profoundly destructive 
impact on black communities than most of us have ever realized, stirring up 
gang warfare, destroying the Black Panthers and arresting small boys so that 
they will have records that stick with them for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland pays particular attention to the Panthers, stressing their positive 
contributions and suggesting that the elimination or suppression of a 
generation of courageous black males served to pave the way for the dominance 
of the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making everything incalculably worse has been the loss of 200,000 jobs in the 
area, as one factory after another has closed, compounded with a decline in 
basic community services and resources to an extent that can only be described 
as shocking -- hospital wards without any equipment, a high school wood shop 
course without any wood. 
</P>
<P>
 One individual after another tells us that there's nothing for young people to 
do, no place for them to go, no alternatives to the gangs. One man, working 
with maps, shows us that more striking than the abundance of liquor stores in 
South-Central is the lack of virtually all other kinds of businesses. Although 
Holland doesn't state it, what he is showing us is the inner workings of a 
phenomenon that can only be described as a conspiracy, a combination of forces, 
both conscious and unconscious, to disenfranchise and oppress black people. We 
hear a laborer working on the construction of the Century Freeway say that he's 
only one of two people from nearby South-Central on the crew -- the rest of the 
workers have been imported from out of state, he claims. More startling, we 
hear a young man tell us how guns and other weapons are mysteriously deposited 
by the boxcar-load into the community, free for the taking. Bobby Lavender, 
co-founder of the Bloods, says they come from "certain families" or "police on 
the wrong side of the law."  
</P>
<P>
 As Holland's litany of decay and despair unreels, he suggests that the white 
business Establishment has good reason to want to see South-Central destroyed, 
because its land is so valuable, so conveniently situated -- there may even be 
oil under the projects -- that it's ripe for the kind of redevelopment that has 
no interest in preserving what's left of the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative impact of his film, however, drives home the point that whites 
can no longer afford to be ignorant or indifferent about the ills of the black 
neighborhoods that they have "maintained and condoned." As former U.N. 
ambassador Andrew Young observes, it almost takes as much money to keep a black 
man in prison as it does to send him to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland was moved to make his film by the powerful dignity of the elderly 
women he met in the wake of the riots at the South-Central Senior Center. They 
are among the film's many memorable presences, and their forthright character 
and determination lends "The Fire This Time" a sense of hope, which is also to 
be found in the truces between key gangs. Young, too, talks hopefully of the 
diversity of American society that threatens to tear it apart as also being the 
source of strength for the future. "We have to be a part of the system," says 
Lavender, a man weary beyond his years, "or there isn't going to be a system."

issues and themes that older children should be able to grasp.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MELISSA FERRICK GIFTED BUT UNFOCUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Should we try it again? It's a cool groove." Melissa Ferrick and her 
admittedly under-rehearsed three-piece band had just derailed during an 
extended instrumental break on Tuesday at the Troubadour, but at her impromptu 
suggestion, they picked it up and rolled through it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Endearingly loose or sloppy to a fault? It depends on your expectations, but 
the Boston singer-songwriter's music would probably be better served by a more 
focused approach. This would have been a diverting warm-up show for an 
established figure, but as an introduction to a new artist it was a little 
hazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrick throws herself into her turbulent confessionals with an unvarying 
intensity. Amid choppy arrangements, she alternates powerful, long-held notes 
with an odd, agile chattering, and she can adjust timbre at whim, from clear, 
pure tones to a rough snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer technical bravado gets your attention, but Ferrick's music registers 
emotionally only now and then. In her early 20s, she's searching for a musical 
identity that takes advantage of her gifts, and she also might want to find a 
collaborator who can bring some depth and maturity to her lyrics. At this point 
the title of her debut album -- "Massive Blur" -- says it all.RICHARD CROMELIN

ART REVIEWS; LITTLE PICTURES FRAME A BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Mark Innerst's little paintings in large frames at Kohn Turner Gallery are 
denser and more physical than his earlier cityscapes. Painted in a wider range 
of colors, with greater tonal variations, sharper contrasts, intensified 
luminosity and increasingly textured surfaces, they rank among the 36-year-old 
New Yorker's best. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foyer, two images from 1993 provide an instructive contrast to 
Innerst's new paintings. "View Towards Times Square" and "Gordon" depict New 
York's skyline as an intangible apparition: Each building's facade appears to 
be a flat plane of ethereal color held in place by the pictures' tight, 
geometric compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky is almost completely cropped from the tops of these images and streets 
are merely hinted at in the shadows at their bottoms. Inertia, airlessness and 
claustrophobia are precariously held in check by Innerst's studious formalism. 
He seems more interested in the way abstract lines and shapes form pictorial 
structures than in the substances they depict. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main gallery, all this changes as the exhibition splits into two bodies 
of work. The abstract half, which consists of four blue-and-white patterns, 
never rises above the level of innocuous decoration. However, seven 
representational paintings signal something of a breakthrough for Innerst. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicality of the city enters these pictures, making them less 
diagrammatic and more captivating. In "Dirty & Busy & Old," a solid chunk of 
impastoed sky, wedged between two towering blocks of buildings, touches down in 
the street. In a similar untitled piece, a splash of late-afternoon sunlight 
glistens off distant traffic and picks up highlights in foreground cars 
otherwise shrouded in shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Innerst's two largest paintings (measuring about 4 square feet) are even more 
grounded, gritty and sensual. Their point of view is up-close and hands-on, 
from where they invite us to glimpse the fugitive beauty of the urban 
environment. Innerst aligns the pleasures of painting with an unsentimental 
glance down a busy city street. 
</P>

 * Kohn Turner Gallery, 9006 Melrose Ave., (310) 271-4453, through May 7. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays. * Disconnected Explorations: Gail Chase-Bien's 14 
paintings at Caplan Gallery sample freely from art history, referring directly 
to artists as diverse as Rene Magritte, Chuck Close and Jean Fragonard; to 
styles as different as abstraction and figuration; and to genres as distinct as 
landscape, self-portraiture and manuscript illumination. 
</P>
<P>
 Film noir horrors, scenes from medieval theater and photographic reproductions 
also play important roles in these multipanel paintings on canvas and wood. 
Unfortunately, Chase-Bien's willingness to quote other subjects is not matched 
by an equally strong sense of purpose. Her disconnected explorations lack focus 
and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not that Chase-Bien attempts to bring far-flung elements into 
her work. Her paintings fall flat because they're less interesting than their 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than critically challenging established conventions, her images bleed 
styles and genres of their content, reducing art to a series of easily imitated 
yet ultimately unsatisfying techniques.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; CATCHING UP WITH CLASSIC OSCAR WINNERS ON LASER DISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the word Oscar is magic, then Columbia TriStar Home Video hopes to cash in 
on its spell with the release of several Academy Award-laden films from its 
vaults, some in newly restored editions. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not a disappointing film in the batch and many are responsible for 
some of film history's finest hours. Each is being offered individually with 
single-disc movies selling for $35 and double discs selling for $40 -- a 
bargain for the restored two-disc sets. Unfortunately, for all the care put 
into the releases, the two-disc sets are not packaged with separate sleeves for 
each disc, which doesn't bode well for storage protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, the most welcome in the first set of releases is "The Bridge on the 
River Kwai," winner of the 1957 best picture Oscar and six other Academy 
Awards. Offered as part of "The Studio Heritage Collection," it represents a 
sizable investment in restoration, $500,000, according to the detailed liner 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 To reconstruct the Cinemascope negative -- which, letter-boxed, plays with 
relatively wide banding -- Sony Pictures Entertainment worked from the original 
separations and retimed the film to re-create the rich color, which is intense, 
almost jumping off the screen. A new Dolby Stereo Surround score came from 
separate dialogue, music and effects tapes, mixed with several "newly recorded 
atmospheric sound effects," since the film's original stereo soundtrack "no 
longer existed."  
</P>
<P>
 The end result does justice to this powerful story of Allied POWs building a 
strategic bridge while in a World War II Japanese prison camp in Burma. William 
Holden was at his best as the escaped American sailor blackmailed into 
returning to the camp to blow up the bridge. Alec Guinness won the best actor 
Oscar as the stubborn British colonel pitted against an equally proud Sessue 
Hayakawa. Director David Lean won an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar-winning screenplay by Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who were 
blacklisted, was initially credited to Pierre Boulle, who wrote the fact-based 
novel from which the screenplay was adapted. Foreman and Wilson are here given 
credit on the screen. The Sam Spiegel production also won Oscars for 
cinematography, editing and music scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-disc set includes two CAV (standard play) sides and two CLV (extended 
play) sides, with the bridge blown up in CAV, so it can be savored one frame at 
a time. Another powerful World War II-era film, the 1953 "From Here to 
Eternity," shows how potent black-and-white movies could be in a time when 
color was becoming the rage. The Daniel Taradash adaptation of the James Jones 
novel recharged Frank Sinatra's career and won him a best supporting actor 
Oscar. Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed (whose 
role as a prostitute won her a best supporting actress Oscar) also turned in 
memorable performances under Fred Zinnemann's direction. The film won a total 
of eight Oscars, including best picture. 
</P>
<P>
 A second film in "The Studio Heritage Collection" -- films restored as closely 
as possible to their original-release condition -- is the eight-Oscar winner 
"On the Waterfront," which helped propel Marlon Brando to the forefront of 
American actors. Elia Kazan directed the intense story of graft and corruption 
among New York's longshoremen, shot in gritty black and white from an original 
script by Budd Schulberg, who spent a year researching and writing it. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls initially showing the project to Fox's Darryl Zanuck, whose initial 
reaction to the project was: "Finally Zanuck comes clean and says he doesn't 
like a single thing about it. And we ask why not. And I will never forget his 
reply. 'Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The laser disc was digitally remastered from newly restored film elements. 
(Other laser discs in the "Studio Heritage Collection," currently available on 
VHS, will be released after this year.) Eva Marie Saint, who made her film 
debut in "Waterfront," won a best supporting actress Oscar; Kazan and Schulberg 
were among others honored by the academy. Two vintage Frank Capra films are 
included in the Oscar-film laser series: the 1934 "It Happened One Night," with 
the incomparable Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, and the 1938 best picture 
winner, "You Can't Take It With You," featuring Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 The film version of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "All the 
King's Men," inspired by the rise and fall of Louisiana's Huey Pierce Long, 
brought Oscars to Broderick Crawford and supporting actress Mercedes 
McCambridge. The 1949 film also won for best picture.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1982 "Gandhi," which won nine Academy Awards (best picture, director, 
actor, original screenplay, cinematography, film editing, art direction, 
costume design, sound) is among the more recent of the "Columbia Pictures Award 
Winner" series. The letter-boxed transfer, presented in the original theatrical 
aspect ration of 2.35:1, makes for wide banding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Kingsley's memorable performance as the Mahatma plays against the sweep of 
colonial India breaking free of British rule. Director Richard Attenborough 
also brought in an array of strong guest stars, including Candice Bergen as 
photographer Margaret Bourke-White, Edward Fox, John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, 
John Mills and Martin Sheen.  
</P>
<P>
 The exuberant 1968 best picture winner, "Oliver!," Sir Carol Reed's stellar 
adaptation of the Lionel Bart musical, comes with an intense color transfer, 
again almost too hot, like a previous Pioneer release. The rather wide 
letter-box banding preserves the original theatrical aspect ratio. The film won 
six Academy Awards, though the liner notes fail to list them all. One of the 
finest stage to film adaptations of a musical ever, this full-bodied, tender 
tale of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist stars Mark Lester in the title role, with 
Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger and Ron Moody in a memorable performance as 
Fagin. Oliver Reed is the evil Bill Sikes and Shani Wallis the kind Nancy.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'FUGITIVE' COULD BE IN FOR A RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Fugitive" still ran away from the pack this week, but it looks as if the 
newly released "Mrs. Doubtfire" will be racing him to the wire in coming weeks. 
"In the Line of Fire" drops two places to No. 4, and "What's Love Got to Do 
With It," the Tina Turner biography, continues to do well on video, climbing to 
No. 2. Brian De Palma's gangster film "Carlito's Way," which stars Al Pacino, 
makes a big jump from No. 8 to No. 3 this week, and it should continue to make 
a strong showing, especially among De Palma fans. "Demolition Man" and "The 
Good Son" both drop slightly but stay solidly within the Top 10. "The Age of 
Innocence" rises slightly to No. 8 from No. 10, and fans of Martin Scorsese, 
Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder should keep it a top rental for quite a 
while. Disney's "Cool Runnings" enters the chart at No. 10. "Malice" debuts at 
No. 12. 04,05,35,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1. "The Fugitive" 1 6

5 7 8. "The Age of Innocence" 10 2 9. "Striking Distance" 7 7 10. "Cool 
Runnings" ... 1 * "A Bronx Tale" 15 2 * In only its second week on the chart, 
"A Bronx Tale," which stars and was directed by Robert De Niro, moves up to No. 
11 from No. 15 and seems poised to enter the Top 10. The Savoy release grossed 
$17.3 million in theatrical release, and De Niro's following could ensure a 
long life for the film on video.

POP ALBUM CHART: PINK FLOYD RETAINS 'DIVISION' TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pink Floyd's "The Division Bell" keeps its lock on the No. 1 spot this week, 
and it looks as though the band's continuing popularity could keep this album 
in the Top 10 for a while. Ace of Base's "The Sign" holds steady at No. 2, 
while Tim McGraw's "Not a Moment Too Soon," which features the single "Indian 
Outlaw," moves up one spot to No. 3. The Benedictine Monks' album of Gregorian 
chants moves up from No. 6 to No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crash Test Dummies' "God Shuffled His Feet" moves into the Top 10, fueled 
by the success of its single, "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm." Sales of the Nirvana albums 
dropped slightly, and the album by Courtney Love's band Hole moved to No. 61 
after entering the charts last week at No. 55. Jon Secada's "If You Go" debuts 
at No. 54 this week. On the singles chart, R. Kelly's "Bump 'n' Grind" 
continues to hold the top spot. 04,52,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last Weeks on

MUSIC REVIEW; SOPRANO KAROL BENNETT SHINES IN RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing wrong with Karol Bennett's recital Wednesday night at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art was that there were few people there to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a small (and lucky) gathering in Bing Theater, the young soprano -- a 
graduate of Yale and winner of the 1993 Pro Musicis International Award -- 
offered an intelligently chosen program of songs by Schubert, Brahms, Faure, 
Rachmaninoff and Harbison, memorably delivered and exquisitely sung. 
</P>
<P>
 Ably seconded by pianist-composer John McDonald, Bennett showed complete 
talents for the task at hand, but perhaps her most distinguishing 
characteristic was her care for words. She made their clear pronunciation the 
starting point for the music, building their sounds and stresses into carefully 
sculpted phrases, all the while avoiding any operatic flights of vocalism that 
might obscure them. In other words, her singing talked. 
</P>
<P>
 This was accomplished without preciousness or undue theatricality, in a light 
soprano of resonant focus, glimmering tone and creamy fluidity. 
</P>
<P>
 In John Harbison's remarkable 1988 song cycle "Simple Daylight" (minus its 
briefest song), she revealed her gift for understatement. Instead of stating 
the obvious qualities of Harbison's angular impulses and Michael Fried's bleak, 
wounded poetry, she etched long lines over wide spaces, while, likewise, 
McDonald found expressive nuance in the composer's clattering accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 The silky elegance and delicacy of Bennett's voice was displayed to glowing 
effect in four Faure melodies -- "En sourdine," "Notre amour," "Toujours" and 
"Adieu" -- though she never slighted their breathless fervency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Schubert and Brahms, she used her full resources to create mini-dramas, but 
always with an ear for proportion and intimacy. She even found fresh insights 
into Rachmaninoff's Vocalise and, in encore, Brahms "Lullaby." TIMOTHY MANGAN

CHILDREN'S THEATRE REVIEW; PHUN 'PHANTOM,' BUT YOUNG ONES MAY NOT GET PUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We can report that the parents in the audience loved the Laguna Playhouse 
Youth Theatre's performance Saturday of "The Phantom Tollbooth." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids, we're not so sure about. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, a lot of little ones clamored in the lobby for autographs from 
the Youth Theatre company members (still in costume). But during the show, the 
usual sound of pint-sized amusement in the house had been most conspicuously 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the grown-ups -- this reviewer included -- were having a 
pretty good time. Is it possible that it's been 33 years since Norton Juster 
wrote his picaresque adventure of young, bored Milo, his travels to the Lands 
Beyond and the lessons he learns there about life's richness? It seems like 
just yesterday when we read that book, even if we were in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a lot of the kids at Laguna hadn't read Juster's tale, but that 
shouldn't get in the way of enjoying a staging of Susan Nanus' adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Nanus' version virtually eliminates more than one-third of the book and 
rudely drops such wonderful (and naturally theatrical) people and places as 
traffic cop Officer Short Shrift, Faintly Macabre the Not-So-Wicked Which, 
orchestra conductor Chroma the Great, the City of Reality and the Valley of 
Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 But while there's no substitute for the original (except maybe Chuck Jones' 
eccentric animated film version, available on video), Nanus' play preserves 
Juster's ingenuity, the basic boy-and-his-dog relationship and, above all, 
Juster's pun-a-minute (sometimes pun-a-second) style. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the children seemed to get the ongoing battle between the Kingdoms 
of Dictionopolis (where words reign) and Digitopolis (where numbers reign). And 
they chuckled audibly at Amy Lang's amusing Spelling Bee, who spells out every 
other word she speaks, and Michael Tryon's larger-than-life Kakafonous A. 
Dischord, Doctor of Dissonance. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the subtle and brilliant wordplay might have been beyond them. 
Milo, at one point, runs into such characters as the Dodecahedron and the 
Terrible Trivium. Be warned, parents: We're not watching "Barney" anymore. This 
is one show, at least, that assumes kids aren't just dumb 
consumers-in-training. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Lauderdale's staging could be a little friendlier, though -- or at least 
more fun. Beginning with designer Timothy Mueller's unsightly attempt at soft, 
cushy set pieces and going on to David Edwards' barely audible sound, there's a 
hesitancy, a static quality, plaguing the feel and action of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 As Milo, Justin Morgan provides some good emotional ground for the kids to get 
into, but the real energy is provided by a small group of actors enjoying 
themselves supremely: Elisabeth Cass as loyal watchdog Tock; Terry Christopher 
as bumbling, pompous Humbug; Marc Ravenhill and Aaron Matthew Kraft as the 
feuding kings; Beth Crosby and Athena Gam as the imprisoned Princesses of Sweet 
Rhyme and Pure Reason, and Michael Proppe's Senses Taker. Get it? We hope the 
kids can. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Phantom Tollbooth," Laguna Playhouse, 606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna 
Beach. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. Ends

THEATRE REVIEW; 'DARK' MYTH UNDERSTANDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mythology is what playwright Marsha Norman's "Traveler in the Dark" stumbles 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When her protagonist, Sam, was a child, he caught his country preacher father 
messing up a magic trick. He also pretended to being saved at one of his 
father's revivals, because everyone else was doing it. He was very, very smart, 
and he didn't buy any of it: Santa or magic, nursery rhymes or God. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman doesn't provide any answers in her family drama about traveling toward 
the light even if you can't see it. But her discussions about the myriad myths 
that keep us all going are cogent and insightful and well worth listening to. 
They are mostly simplistic, but so is the will to believe -- or not to. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Peter Senkbeil's staging of the play at Concordia University is 
clear-cut and lucid and makes no judgments on Norman's attempted conquest of 
the battle between honesty and truth, and the comfort of belief. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mark Henderson and Tim Farmer's beautifully designed setting of father 
Everett's back porch and overgrown yard, which is intricately and purposefully 
lit by Rob Wolter, Senkbeil ably makes his young cast enlarge itself to fit the 
older roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Manning and Heather Manning as successful surgeon Sam and his rich wife, 
Glory, after a few minutes appear very close to the unhappy couple verging on 
middle-age.

<P>
 If her voice remains a bit light for the age she's playing, she makes up for 
it in understanding; his solid sense of responsibility -- both to his aging 
father and to his own young son -- makes up for the difference in age. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Steve Hinman, as the preacher Everett, captures some of the aura of the 
gentleness and rural wisdom of Everett's background. Paul Henry is often 
effective as the 9-year-old son but isn't as successful playing younger as his 
cohorts are playing older. 
</P>
<P>
 The production's best moments, and Norman's best writing, are the quiet, 
thoughtful scenes between Sam and his father, and between Sam and his son. As 
Sam balances his own shaky, truthful trail through the dark against the 
brightness that myths bring to his father and son, Manning makes the most of 
some difficult emotional transitions. 
</P>
<P>
 What they have accomplished under Senkbeil's guidance is to capture the intent 
at the core of Norman's modern parable and to give it a life of its own. In 
spite of the one-note currents of the writing throughout, the director and cast 
bring an individualistic approach to the subject.

RESTAURANTS; DAIRY DINING: HOME-STYLE AND KOSHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Under kosher dietary law, there are no restrictions on food from plants -- the 
guidelines deal exclusively with the killing and eating of birds, fish and 
animals. To be eaten, animals must have a "split hoof," and chew their cuds; 
cattle and sheep are OK, swine, horses, reptiles, elephants and all carnivorous 
beasts are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Only fish with fins and tails can be consumed, therefore shellfish and 
crustaceans cannot. Of feathered and/or airborne creatures, birds of prey and 
insects are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 To be classified "kosher," meat must be slaughtered and prepared under the 
supervision of specifically certified Jewish officials. These rules also forbid 
the eating of meat and dairy products together. In fact, separate pots and 
plates are used, one set for meat and one set for dairy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kosher restaurant world, this division translates into two distinct 
types of establishments: meat and dairy. Meat restaurants offer beef and lamb 
and fowl; dairy restaurants offer dishes made with cheese and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The name of Los Angeles' newest kosher dairy restaurant, Milk 'n' Honey, 
clever as it is, is somewhat deceptive. The menu largely resembles the most 
trendy and popular menus in Los Angeles: pizza, pasta, salads, entrees. 
Entrees, however, are exclusively fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Umbrellas and sidewalk tables cluster around the corner location. Just 3 
months old, Milk 'n' Honey retains the look of a classic downtown restaurant 
with lots of old wood and mirror. There's a dark, cozy bar area, but the most 
popular room is the bright, corner room with its wrap-around windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Milk 'n' Honey is popular and the wait staff is friendly, earnest. Sometimes 
the kitchen gives staffers the job of soothing hungry diners forced to wait and 
wait for their dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 The food here tastes home-cooked, as if you've gone to a relative's house for 
dinner. This can be good, and this can be not so good. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite items all happen to be salads. A fresh and ample Caesar is topped 
with anchovies and, inexplicably, garnished with plum tomatoes. The Nicoise is 
just like one you'd make at home: leaf lettuce, creamy boiled red potatoes, 
steamed green beans, hard-boiled eggs and fresh, rather well-done tuna. The 
Greek salad is beautiful, brightened with red and yellow peppers and crumbles 
of a delicious snow-white feta. The only trouble is, all the salads are 
meal-sized; there are no appetizer portions so if you want a salad before your 
main course, you need to share one with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizzas, however, come in two sizes: a hefty individual portion and large. The 
crust is unremarkable. A spinach pizza is made with thick layers of tomato 
sauce and mozzarella cheese and only a negligible sprinkling of fresh, raw 
chopped spinach leaf. I was surprised that the smoked salmon pizza had the same 
base -- tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese -- which tasted incongruous, no, 
downright weird with slices of smoked salmon and daubs of sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I could see, pastas are probably the most popular item here. There 
are the usual suspects: capellini alla checca, fettuccine alfredo, 
ricotta-stuffed ravioli. I like the penne "Marengo," quill-shaped pasta in a 
classic combination of tomatoes, black olives, capers and basil. While three 
kinds of mushrooms are promised in the rigatoni, we find only one kind -- the 
most common supermarket variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Grilled tuna tends to be tasty, but over-done. I am seriously disappointed 
with my baked sea bass, a tasteless slab of poorly trimmed fish served with 
dull roasted potatoes and steamed vegetables. In comparison, mushroom blintzes 
seem quite edible, even if the blintzes themselves are rather sweeter, breadier 
and less supple than I generally like in a savory blintz. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are made on the premises and worth saving room for. They look lavish, 
but are pleasantly, lightly sweetened. I enjoyed a moist cinnamon cake with 
raspberries, and the cheesecakes, particularly a chocolate-cherry cheesecake, 
is rich without being cloying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Milk 'n' Honey, 8837 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (310) 858-8850. Lunch and 
dinner Sunday through Thursday. Beer and wine. Major credit cards accepted.

MUSIC; RECAPTURING ROMANCE; CROONER JEAN-PAUL VIGNON RETURNS TO THE CABARET 
SCENE, TAKING HIS CUE FROM THE RENEWED POPULARITY OF SUCH LEGENDS AS TONY 
BENNETT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of French singer and cabaret artist Jean-Paul Vignon as a butterfly. The 
Palos Verdes blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PV blue," as it's called, was believed to be extinct three years after it 
was declared an endangered species in 1980. Development in the Palos Verdes 
area had apparently gotten the better of the blue-winged creature. 
</P>
<P>
 But in March, scientists found 100 to 200 of the butterflies in their habitat 
-- alive, if not completely thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Vignon's school of music, the romantically sung ballads and standards of the 
era of Edith Piaf and Lerner and Loewe and Jacques Brel, was believed to be 
nearly as extinct. Certainly, Vignon's singing career, once a heady circuit of 
the "The Ed Sullivan Show" and New York nightclub and Vegas appearances, had 
been in eclipse since, yes, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was rock music, and I just quit, pffft!" says Vignon, in a sunny 
Studio City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But something has happened to bring Vignon back from artistic extinction. 
Exactly a year after "A Stranger in Paradise," his first show in 12 years, 
Vignon is taking his act to Studio City's Tonto & Dietz. For the new engagement 
at the cabaret coffee club, he's titling it "A Frenchman in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the cycle of show biz. Vignon sensed a change in the air when Michael 
Feinstein and Harry Connick Jr. actually charted with standards and Broadway 
tunes. Since the mid-'80s, jazz stars like Keith Jarrett and Wynton Marsalis 
have energetically re-examined the standards canon. The Sinatra presence 
continues, of course, and seemed to grow each year into the '90s. And now 
there's the Tony Bennett phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read that he's being embraced by the MTV generation," Vignon says, "it 
made my heart so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The capper that told Vignon to get his act together was Natalie Cole's huge 
hit, "Unforgettable," her faithful remake of father Nat King Cole's song, 
incorporating his original vocal. "A Stranger in Paradise" soon followed, to 
some ringing praise. "Vignon," noted Drama-Logue critic Polly Warfield, "offers 
a welcome relief from urban angst , a brief surcease from present cares and 
refreshments of warmth and bonhomie ." 
</P>
<P>
 "What struck me with Cole's recording," Vignon says, "was that the old 
arrangement wasn't changed. It was like a sign that it's OK to do the old 
songs, in the old way." 
</P>
<P>
 Old is about the last term one would associate with Vignon, strikingly 
youthful for a man born in the 1930s. But because of his years, he has a 
considerable life to tell -- a life he gladly interweaves into his show. 
</P>
<P>
 Vignon was the child of a French father and Italian mother, and a product of 
French colonial Africa. Though born in the Ethiopian city of Dire-Daoua, he 
spent most of his boyhood in French Somaliland, renamed Djibouti after 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was poor," Vignon says, "but because French products couldn't get 
through to such a remote country in east Africa, we seemed to have nothing but 
American goods -- from American refrigerators to American cheese. My parents' 
friends were traders, and they once brought this catalogue of items with 
pictures of the perfect American family and the kids with -- what you say, 
freckles? -- and so I was very influenced by this image of wealth and 
perfection." 
</P>
<P>
 The image, amid the dusty but prospering seaport town, seemed further 
solidified by the most impressive American import of all: the movies. "Seeing 
these unbelievable sights of Americans on the big screen was just amazing. You 
can't imagine what an impact they had in such a place." 
</P>
<P>
 Vignon was yanked out of this world at 11, when his parents sent him to a 
French Jesuit boarding school in Avignon, leaving him with mixed feelings he 
still holds about Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one hand," he says, "colonialism was very hard for many people, but it 
varied tremendously from country to country. I never saw abject poverty in 
Djibouti, but that was because it was a vital trading center. And there was a 
real attempt to teach the people. I've found that in those countries that cut 
themselves off from their former colonial masters, they are in desperate shape. 
Those that didn't, seem to be doing OK. But what has happened in Ethiopia and 
Somalia, with war and famine, breaks my heart. Ethiopia was once so rich! It 
had endless, endless fields of wheat! Imagine!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Jesuits at Avignon drummed into Vignon the notion of life's enormous 
difficulties -- a precursor of his own later struggles, but "a real gift, 
because when I got out of school, I found that I was ready for anything." He 
already knew that he could dazzle people with his singing voice, but followed 
his father's wishes and studied medicine in Marseilles. "Bored to death" is how 
he describes his state of mind then, with the idea of singing never too far 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Studio City living room, Vignon points out a photo of celebrities 
sitting around the captain's table on board the French liner, Liberte: "There's 
Ernie Kovacs, and Edie Adams and, in the far corner, a young Carol Burnett. I 
sang on that ship, and they all told to come to America." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Vignon might have had a major French movie career (he had already 
starred in late '50s films such as "Asphalte" and "Promesses Dangereuses") but 
for a two-year compulsory army hitch and the breakout of the French "New Wave" 
cinema, which swept aside the kind of traditional, romantic movies he was 
associated with. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in America, Vignon's career took off, with several stints on "The Ed 
Sullivan Show," "The Tonight Show," "The Red Skelton Hour" and a perpetual 
whirl of nightclub dates. "From the start, it was like magic," he says. "My 
first night at the Blue Angel club in New York, Gloria Swanson came to see me. 
She thought my hair was too long -- this was 1964, with the Beatles everywhere 
-- and later that night, she cut my hair in the middle of her 5th Avenue 
apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Vignon fulfilled the American image of the romantic, singing Frenchman. 
Ironically, rather than compare his voice to such renowned Gallic crooners as 
Maurice Chevalier and Gilbert Becaud, Vignon says that he has "a Bobby Darin 
kind of voice, able to sing fast and passionate, or gentle and slow. Darin! Ah! 
He could do anything!" 
</P>
<P>
 But as pop music shifted from Darin to the Doors, Vignon struggled. Married 
with child Marguerite, then divorced in 1969, he went on to host a 
Canadian-made, Dick Clark-produced series, "The Sensuous Man," which led to a 
posing for one of the first Playgirl magazine centerfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That show was fun, nothing really, ummm, suggestive," he says, a smile on his 
lips. "We'd always end the show with me taking a sensuous bath -- in olive oil, 
or mud, or flowers, even cereal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad luck, though, started happening: The Paramount studio executive behind 
"The Sensuous Man" was dumped, along with the show; clubs closed, along with 
his contracts. "I had had it," says Vignon, his smile disappearing. A series of 
unlikely jobs followed, including serving as an accountant and public relations 
man for Ma Maison's Patrick Terrail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pop cycle came around again, "and I realized that I not only still had 
my voice, but I had my own life to tell. We have some new songs this time, but 
the big difference from 'Stranger in Paradise' is that I begin with Johnny 
Mercer's 'Dream,' the dream of a young boy in Africa, imagining America." 
</P>
<P>
 Vignon credits three women for his return: British playwright Jane Harris, who 
helped write and polish the show's spoken narrative; pianist-accompanist 
Samantha Ryan; and Tonto & Dietz co-producer Susan Dietz. "She has the perfect 
room for a singer like me," he says, "where people can hold hands, and listen, 
and feel they're at home." WHERE AND WHEN

MUSIC; THE HILLS ARE ALIVE, AGAIN; PARAMOUNT RANCH WILL BE THE HOST FOR THE 
TOPANGA BANJO-FIDDLE CONTEST AND FOLK ARTS FEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly

<TEXT>
<P>
 The traditional sounds of bluegrass, folk and country music return to the 
mountains and for ests above Los Angeles on Sunday as musicians, dancers and 
fans converge for the 34th annual Topanga Banjo-Fiddle Contest and Dance & Folk 
Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the annual event hasn't actually been based in Topanga since 
1969, leaving the festival bouncing from one venue to another through many of 
the years since. But its present location in nearby Paramount Ranch, just 
outside Agoura in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, has 
served as a fitting home since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all felt like we were finally back home again," longtime spokeswoman Dalia 
Keyser says of the event that has at various times been presented in the open 
athletic fields of UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, El Camino College, Santa Monica 
College and elsewhere. "We were in the mountains again. A football field just 
isn't the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival began its life in 1960 as simply a banjo and fiddle contest, but 
the years since have seen dance, folk art, storytelling, cowboy poetry and 
other activities added to the mix. Now the festival has three separate stages, 
offering dueling banjos and fiddles, demonstrations of various international 
folk dances, and such professional bluegrass performers as the Grateful Dudes 
Bluegrass Band, Andy Rau, the Gap Tooth Mountain Ramblers String Band, Ed Lowe 
and Tom Sauber. And since random jam sessions have become a tradition at the 
event, visitors are encouraged to "bring your instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mendelson of the Gap Tooth Mountain Ramblers has been competing and 
performing at the festival since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like home," says the guitarist, who is a Santa Barbara computer 
systems analyst by day. "People sometimes come across the country just for 
this. Some people you see only once a year, but you've known them for 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 The banjo-fiddle contests award prizes of as much as $150 each for a variety 
of categories, from solo performers to bands, beginning to advanced. Notes 
Keyser: "Some of the advanced players are very, very advanced." 
</P>
<P>
 A folk art section will present 30 booths of weaving, ceramics, jewelry, wood 
carving and other crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can also roam Paramount Ranch, which serves as a location for the TV 
series "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like another world when you're out there," says Keyser of the park, 
which should be covered with blooming wildflowers, and is just 10 minutes from 
the Ventura Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 The music and folk art of the festival have proven popular over the years, she 
adds, because "these days people are kind of looking for something like this to 
hold on to, something that has been around a long time and endured. . . . It 
represents peoples' roots." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival has a faithful audience, usually totaling about 5,000 every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, nearly 4,000 fans came, although two 
judges had to bow out. "We got surprisingly good attendance, I think because we 
were probably the only show in town that went on. Everything else was 
canceled." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 * What: 34th Topanga Banjo-Fiddle Contest and Dance & Folk Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * Location: Paramount Ranch, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, 
outside Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 * Getting there: From the Ventura Freeway, take the Kanan Road exit south, 
then turn left on Cornell Road. Follow it until you see the gate on the right 
for Paramount Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hours: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>

children under 12.

MUSIC; STILL IN HARMONY; THE NEW FOUR PREPS, INCLUDING FOUNDING MEMBERS BRUCE 
BELLAND AND ED COBB, WILL PERFORM AT THE ACADEMY PLAZA THEATER. THE GROUP HAS 
FOUND NICHES WITH BOTH YOUNG AND OLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The old blazers with the embroidered crests were abandoned long ago. And the 
blond Ivy League haircuts have, in some cases, receded with time. But the 
smooth harmonies that earned the Four Preps a string of hits in the late '50s 
and early '60s survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet is today called the New Four Preps, and still includes founding 
members Bruce Belland and Ed Cobb, who launched the act at a Hollywood High 
talent show back in 1955. And before the Beatles emerged in 1964, forever 
changing the creative boundaries of pop and rock music, the Four Preps enjoyed 
such lingering hits as "26 Miles," "Big Man" and "Down by the Station." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-part harmonizing on the Southern California lifestyle in those songs 
was a key influence on such later acts as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. 
Their clean-cut, preppy image dogged the group through most of its career, 
although Belland now jokes: "We've managed to counteract that now. We're just 
dirty old men." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Four Preps, who will perform two shows Sunday at the Academy Plaza 
Theater in North Hollywood, include members of such chart-topping acts as the 
Association and the Diamonds. Tallied together, the new act's four members have 
created 29 hit singles, from the Association's "Cherish" to the Diamonds' 
"Little Darlin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us would have gone back out on the road and busted our 
humps with the one-nighters, sound checks and all the hassles that go with 
traveling, if not for the exciting prospect of singing with this kind of 
talent," says Belland, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 "We swap solos around. And it becomes in some ways sort of improvisational and 
ad-lib. We try to surprise each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The Preps re-formed in the '90s with the intention of playing mostly black-tie 
dates at corporate conventions, and they have enjoyed much success on that 
circuit during their usual 50 to 65 dates a year. Many of their original fans 
have since become business executives, says Prep member David Somerville, 60. 
"They grew up on this music. They can afford whatever they want now, and they 
want their music, damn it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new group, which also includes Jim Yester of the Association, has also 
discovered that their appeal extends to family festivals and such high-profile 
club venues as Trump Castle in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oldies stations, bless their hearts, keep this stuff alive," says 
Somerville, an original member of the Diamonds, who joined the Preps in the 
'60s. "A lot of children hear this music." 
</P>
<P>
 Belland is quick to note that the new group is much more musically 
sophisticated than the quartet of teen-agers that founded the Preps. After all, 
each of the New Four Preps has since earned long resumes in the music and 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no comparison," Belland says. The new act's performances are 
accompanied by five live musicians and occasional taped orchestral elements, 
for a repertoire that includes a 20-minute medley of the members' top-10 hits, 
and several popular songs by Elton John, Mariah Carey, the Beatles and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that material has emerged on more recent recording projects, such as 
last year's "Better Than Ever" album. Another album, titled "We Be 50," was 
just completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood concert marks the first time any version of the Four Preps 
has performed in the San Fernando Valley, even though Belland has spent most of 
his adult life in Encino, and both his daughters attended Birmingham High 
School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping some old friends are going to show up," Belland says. WHERE AND 
WHEN

MUSIC; SWINGING IN STYLE; SINGER-PIANIST BETTY BRYANT PERFORMS EASY-LISTENING 
TUNES -- BUT SHE LIVES FOR VIBRANT JAZZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Betty Bryant leads two musical lives. 
</P>
<P>
 On her regular Wednesday-through-Friday engagement at Bob Burns res taurant in 
Santa Monica, or her occa sional one-nighters at eateries such as 72 Market 
Street in Venice, veteran L.A. musician Bryant works unaccompanied or with a 
bassist, and her performances could be called "background music." 
</P>
<P>
 But then there are the late-night sets Fridays at Bob Burns, when Bryant is 
joined by bassist Larry Gales, or the every-now-and-then engagements at rooms 
such as Chadney's in Burbank, where Bryant leads a quartet on Thursdays. There 
she can dig into her vibrant jazz style and feel completely at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more me there. I'm more about jazz," she says. "I can get right into it. 
It's so hard to give a definition of a club, but, for me, Chadney's is more 
energy-generating. Even a ballad there can have a lot of energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that her slower songs lacked spark on a recent Saturday at 72 Market 
Street, where diners chatted and ate as she played, paying her scant attention. 
Bryant, in a flowing orange-and-red caftan, her medium-length brown hair pulled 
back to reveal her fine features, delivered a dulcet-toned "Willow Weep for 
Me," a quietly graceful "Some Other Time" and a subtly driving "Have You Met 
Miss Jones?" -- each rendition enlivened by spiffy execution and an understated 
be-bop muscularity that gave the small room added warmth and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bryant couldn't sing at 72 Market, or swing hard there, for that matter -- 
and those are two things she loves to do, and does with aplomb when she plays 
the Burbank establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swinging -- I guess it's all in the word," says Bryant. "It's a happy, joyous 
feeling. And singing. I have fun with all kinds of tunes. I like to go to 
extremes, from a funky version of " 'Lil Darlin' " to a sultry ballad or torch 
song. It's always been that way." 
</P>
<P>
 There's obviously a charisma about Bryant's vocalizing. Dennis Duke, who books 
Chadney's, says, "She can put a lot of emotion into a rendition without 
detracting from the lyric. She flirts with a tune's words, but she doesn't get 
cute." Times reviewer Bill Kohlhaase, writing about a Bryant show in San Juan 
Capistrano, agrees. Bryant, he says, sings "like she means it, without an 
over-reliance on stylistic tricks or gimmicks." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe her piano style, Bryant says, "Before they had 
easy-listening stations, I called myself an easy-listening pianist. Lilting, 
like John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet, or Bill Evans. Easygoing. I never 
play so driving that you get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bryant can cook solidly, even if she didn't always, says fellow pianist 
Gerald Wiggins. "She used to tap the keys, tap, tap, tap," he says. "Now she's 
got confidence. She digs in and plays her tail off." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant admits she used to be "more timid" pianistically, a characteristic she 
feels came from working in Southern California as a single, where she was 
expected to stay in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chadney's, Bryant's foursome will include sax man Rob Kyle, drummer Don 
Moffat and bassist Larry Gales. She appears with Gales on Fridays at Bob Burns 
and says that when Duke arranged for them to work together a while back, he 
started a sound musical friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, born in Kansas City and a resident of Los Angeles since 1955, studied 
playing classical piano from the age of 4 until she was 12 in her hometown, 
then shifted to art in college at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan. It was 
there, while she worked as a psychiatric secretary at the Menninger Foundation 
by day, that her performing career began. "I was put on the radio, singing and 
playing piano, because this station director thought I had a sexy voice, which 
was something I had never thought about at the time," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she went back to Kansas City, she started performing in clubs 
full-time, and she hasn't stopped. "I can't imagine doing anything else now," 
she says. "It's a wonderful thing to be able to do what you want to do." WHERE

THEATER; AT THE CORE OF CHANGE; 'FLIGHT OF THE PENGUIN' IS A ROMANTIC COMEDY 
WITH A SERIOUS UNDERBELLY -- AN EXAMINATION OF RACISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T. H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It comes as a shock when Rudy discovers that his best friend Spot's rabid 
racism suddenly offends him. But the trauma is compounded when he realizes that 
that same racism is struggling for survival in his own enlightened emotional 
matrix. Rudy and his friend Spot are white. Rudy has just fallen in love with 
African American Donna, and is very confused. 
</P>
<P>
 That confusion is at the core of Steve Apostolina's comedy with a very serious 
underbelly, "Flight of the Penguin," opening tonight at the Limelight 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Penguin" is a comedy. It takes place in what the playwright refers to as "the 
world's largest bookstore" in Manhattan, a setting where he worked before 
moving to Los Angeles as an actor (films "The Heist" and "Blue Desert" and the 
hit "Creeps" at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood). Apostolina knows these people 
and how they tick. 
</P>
<P>
 While the playwright was working in the bookstore, a friend mentioned that 
there might be a play in some of the situations he'd encountered. The play that 
finally emerged, after Apostolina had written and directed a one-act version in 
a writer's workshop at Hollywood's Friends and Artists Theatre Ensemble, is the 
full-length version at the Limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to write about these guys in the play who were sort of 
rough-around-the-edges kinds of guys," Apostolina said. "But looks can be 
deceiving, and don't judge books by their covers." He decided to put them in a 
literary environment, the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast interested him, he said, "because they do talk rough. One of the 
guys in the store was that type of guy. I thought he was rude and crude, and 
he's uneducated. Then I went back to New York this summer to do some more 
research, and the lady who was head of the store told me he's a lawyer. I was 
judging a book by its cover. I was quick to judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging a book by its cover, Apostolina believes, is at the core of racism. 
When he constructed his central story, about Rudy and his romance with Donna, 
and the disintegration of his lifelong friendship with Spot, he was delving 
into a subject that attracts and disturbs him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play is about conditioning," Apostolina said, "about the history of 
racism that has existed for so long that for some people it's a habit, it's 
their conditioning. And it still exists. Rudy needs to break that history, in a 
way. If racism is to be stopped, it has to be broken. Some people will say, 'I 
know, I know what you're saying about racism,' but they still have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Apostolina isn't directing this full-length version of his play. He brought in 
Steven Ingrassia as a third eye, to shape and build the production. Ingrassia, 
whose production of "Lib" at Friends and Artists received numerous awards, was 
attracted by the sociopolitical ramifications of the play, but became even more 
engrossed in the personal drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingrassia said: "I was struck by things that I've always struggled with, which 
are change. What makes Rudy change and Spot not change? Rudy was brought up in 
exactly the same atmosphere as Spot. What makes him decide to make the change? 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship with Donna, Spot's racism and Rudy facing that same thing in 
himself, which is probably one of the strongest things in his background, is 
what kind of cracks the veneer for his deciding to step out and listen to his 
own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play is about the lies that we tell ourselves about ourselves and about 
others, in order to perpetuate what's safe in our lives. A change is always 
very dangerous for us. You have to be an incredibly brave person to step out 
and make the change. Rudy makes that statement for us." 
</P>
<P>
 That step is Apostolina's titular flight of the penguin. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Tony Maggio, who received a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle award this 
year for his performance in Stages' production of "La Bete" at the John Anson 
Ford Theatre, is playing Rudy. Rudy's statement interested him in the role, but 
he was equally intrigued by the complexity in Rudy's character. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggio explained: "Rudy is looked upon as the most together guy at the store. 
But there is this ambiguity, this question mark going on. This guy is really 
denying a lot of things about himself. There are people in the play who are 
more honest than he is. He's not dealing with his problems, his political 
incorrectness. He's not what he thinks he is, or what he tries to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Apostolina, Ingrassia and Maggio comment on the humor in the play, humor that 
comes out of character, just as it is in character that the problems in the 
play are explored. There are no answers, but all three believe that presenting 
Rudy's situation honestly might shed some light on reasons for its occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ingrassia noted: "It's time to break through those things that are in us, 
become aware of them. You never change what your attitudes are, as much as you 
change what your response to those attitudes are." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER; A TALE OF TWO TIMES; MARK LEE'S 'PIRATES' UNDERSCORES THE RELEVANCE OF 
HISTORY AND THE PRICE OF PERSONAL FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pirates are on the prowl again in Mark Lee's "Pirates" -- opening tonight at 
the Road Theatre -- the parallel stories of a contemporary history teacher and 
her 18th-Century counterpart, real-life adventurer Anne Bonney. "It's about how 
we disguise ourselves in everyday life," explains the playwright, 42. "In the 
18th Century, women had to disguise themselves as men to get what they wanted. 
You see that duplication with the (modern-day) character Helen Raymond, who has 
to swallow her opinions to move through the academic environment." 
</P>
<P>
 One impetus for the story was Lee's then-18-year-old niece, who admitted that 
she'd never heard of the Spanish-American War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you watch MTV, you begin to think that history, what happened in 
the past, is not relevant," says the Santa Barbara-raised, Mar Vista-based 
writer. "Well, I happen to think that it is. In Los Angeles, flying into the 
future, we forget there is a meaning in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the transition, the interior of the Road Theatre has been transformed 
into a boat -- complete with sails and blowing fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience forms the configuration around the boat, so they'll feel very 
much a part of the play," says director Brad Hills, who staged "Vig" last year 
at the theater. "The characters themselves exist on (an unspecified) plane; 
they sail along and touch each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Hills, who originally staged a reading of "Pirates" four years ago at Circle 
Rep West, has long lobbied to mount a full production of this work. "It's very 
much about freedom," he says, "the prices people pay for their own personal 
freedoms." 
</P>
<P>
 One differentiation between the two worlds is the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pirates speak in 18th-Century criminal slang," says Lee, who won South 
Coast Repertory's California Playwrights Competition in 1990 for this work. 
"It's such a rich language. Using characters from another time allows a writer 
to be more expressive; a lot of times one is captive to contemporary dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he enjoys the modern structural freedoms that allow fantastic shifts in 
time and place. "People often focus on the negative aspects of film and TV. But 
one positive is that audiences are much more sophisticated in terms of 
accepting these kind of leaps." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's other stage works include "California Dogfight" (which was developed at 
the Victory Theatre in Burbank and later played at the Manhattan Theatre Club 
and London's Bush Theatre), "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad" (which played at the 
Long Wharf in New Haven and San Diego's Old Globe) and a new adaptation of 
"Moby Dick," which is scheduled to premiere next year at Trinity Rep in 
Providence, R.I. Last month, Lee also finished writing his first novel, "The 
Stork King," in which Africans and Americans look for the lost tribes of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Yale, where he majored in political science, Lee refers to the 
late Robert Penn Warren as his mentor. "He taught me it's possible to be a 
writer and live a graceful life." Initially, Lee wrote poetry, some of which 
was published in the Atlantic Monthly and the London Times Literary Supplement. 
Then, in the 1980s he worked for the London Daily Telegraph as a reporter in 
Uganda (the inspiration for his play "Rebel Armies"), where he was ultimately 
expelled for writing about military atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That experience totally changed me," Lee says. "When I came back to the 
States, I stopped writing poetry. I needed to express myself through dramatic 
characters." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; THE NEW 'ZOO'; RENDITION OF ALBEE'S EARLIEST PLAY FEATURES 
ACTORS WHO SPEAK AND SIGN THROUGHOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ray Loynd writes regularly about theater 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Albee's earliest play, "The Zoo Story," which dramatizes the perils of 
communication and isolation, has been reanimated in an exciting experiment in 
innovative staging at the new Artists Workout Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-character one-act, in which a nerdy publishing executive's encounter 
on a park bench with a shiftless wanderer propels a life-altering 
confrontation, features hearing actors who speak and sign simultaneously 
throughout the production. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened late last month and has been drawing such ample houses, 
divided between hearing and hearing-impaired patrons, that the run has been 
extended through the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a mesmerizing, first-rate revival in conventional and traditional 
terms, the added element of the actors (Michael Bonnabel and Conrad Dunn) 
voicing and signing at the same time makes the production special, if not, 
indeed, groundbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies have staged plays in sign language, but they are either 
accompanied, for the benefit of the hearing, by live actors off stage reading 
aloud from the script or by recorded dialogue heard through earphones. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "Zoo Story," two exceptional actors and director Jodi Binstock 
(a New York University film school grad making her Los Angeles theatrical 
debut) have managed to turn the signing experience into an unexpected 
embellishment for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who does not read sign language (such as this reviewer), the 
signing, rather than confusing events and filling the air with visual 
distraction, enhances the mounting tension between the characters. From the 
beginning, the signing appears to the hearing audience members as coming from 
two guys who happen to gesture with a lot of volatile body language. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be overlooked in this biting revival of the 1960 off-Broadway hit, 
which launched Albee's career and influenced other American playwrights of the 
early '60s, is the announcement last week that Albee had won the Pulitzer Prize 
(his third) for the current New York production of "Three Tall Women" (a 
theatrical coming to terms with his strained feelings for his mother). 
</P>
<P>
 But Albee's strongest work was done in the 1960s, and "Zoo Story" is 
characteristic of his pungent language and dark, edgy view of human nature. 
Much in the manner of "Dutchman," LeRoi Jones' (now Amiri Baraka) bitter subway 
drama from the same period, "The Zoo Story" is notable for its economy of 
character and its jolting, bloody resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 It's to the immense credit of actors Dunn and Bonnabel that although many 
theatergoers may be familiar with the outcome, the ending still arrives with 
shocking impact in director Binstock's expertly crafted fade-to-black ending 
(she also designed the autumnal lighting scheme). 
</P>
<P>
 Albee's crackling dialogue always seems to be looking for a fight. In the very 
first line of the play, and materializing from nowhere in leafy Central Park 
(set design by Darrell Martin), Dunn's street bum intrudes on the privacy of 
Bonnabel's meek businessman, who is reading a book. 
</P>
<P>
 The shabbily dressed homeless man says, "I've been to the zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 The man with the book doesn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I've been to the zoo. MISTER, I'VE BEEN TO THE ZOO!" 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" responds the passive man with the book. "I'm sorry, were you talking 
to me?" That's his first mistake. The ensuing riff of innuendoes and wary 
intonations are delightfully off-putting, thanks to the skill of the players 
and the discipline of a company that looks as if it's going places. WHERE AND

COVER STORY; STRENGTH IN DIVERSITY; AUTRY MUSEUM HONORS THE WEST'S 
MULTICULTURAL ROOTS, UNSADDLING CELLULOID COWBOYS AND CLICHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an unexpected juxtaposition. A Japanese-American woman in the loveliest 
of kimonos poured tea according to an ancient ritual. Nearby, two men wearing 
string ties oohed and aahed at a larger-than-life bronze statue of singing 
cowboy Gene Autry, posed alongside his faithful horse, Champion. 
</P>
<P>
 If you came to the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum expecting a curator of 
chaps or do-si-docents, forget it. Welcome to the surprisingly polycultural 
Autry, where diversity is an important part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedicated to explicating the American West, the Autry might have taken the low 
road and celebrated the predominantly white West of celluloid and cliche -- the 
monosyllabic cowboy, his freckled skin turning to leather in the sun; the 
frontier wife, ready to defend to the death her clutch of towheads; the 
imperial explorers and terminally grizzled mountain men. 
</P>
<P>
 Those icons of the Old West are certainly represented at the Autry, whose 
treasures range from Albert Bierstadt paintings to chenille kiddie curtains 
bearing the hallowed name of Hopalong Cassidy. But the Griffith Park museum is 
devoting an increasing amount of money, time and space to showing visitors that 
the American West was created not just by Anglos but by people of diverse 
ethnic and cultural origins. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mexican-American staffer Mary Ann Ruelas says, with obvious relief, "I 
think people are beginning to understand we're more than Gene's closet or the 
Giddyup Museum." 
</P>
<P>
 The Autry's commitment to multiculturalism isn't new. Since its founding in 
1988, the Autry has surprised thousands of visitors with the fact that many 
cowboys were African American. The often heart-breaking history of Native 
Americans is an essential part of the Western tale the museum attempts to tell. 
A current exhibit documents the unique contribution of Japanese-American women 
to Western life, and past shows have chronicled the contributions of Russians 
and Italians. Only last year, the museum initiated an annual Juneteenth 
celebration to mark the end of slavery in the traditional style of the black 
communities of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Autry's commitment to polyculturalism is being reaffirmed in a major 
way with a new permanent gallery, to open Memorial Day weekend. Called the 
Spirit of Community, the gallery will show how six different ethnic or cultural 
groups interacted with the dominant Anglo-American culture in and around the 
year 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 The new exhibit, which cost $500,000, was conceived by Michael Duchemin, the 
Autry's curator of history. "It came about," Duchemin says, "because the museum 
recognized that we weren't diverse enough in our representation and 
interpretation of the history of the West." To counter that deficiency, 
Duchemin proposed that the museum tell the interconnected stories of seven 
Western communities: Anglo American, Asian, Mexican, Native American, African 
American, Canadian and Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
 As Duchemin explains, each of these groups was a major player in the West of 
1890. In that turbulent year, the year the Mormon church officially renounced 
polygamy, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had 150,000 followers 
in the American West. Some were Mormons who had trekked to Utah after 
anti-Mormon violence farther east, only to find themselves hounded by 
evangelical Protestants who urged them to "Get right with God!" Others were 
recent European converts to Mormonism, many of whom sailed from the English 
port of Liverpool on their journey to what would soon become the 45th state. 
Only immigrants of German origin were more numerous than Mormons in the West in 
1890, Duchemin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spirit of Community exhibit will consist of artifacts, maps, photographic 
enlargements and other objects, plus explanatory material. Each community's 
material will be displayed behind Plexiglas in cases -- one to a cultural group 
-- that resemble buildings. The exterior architecture of each of these display 
areas relates to the group whose story is being told. Thus, the Mexican area 
appears to be made of stuccoed adobe (it's actually made of fire-retardant 
materials, including fiberglass), with a tile roof and the distinctive canales 
, or rain gutters, typical of Spanish colonial architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian area -- mostly devoted to the Chinese -- takes a different 
architectural tack. By 1890, many Western Chinese were concentrated in urban 
Chinatowns that had formerly housed non-Asians. Given this history, the 
exhibit's Asian space looks like one of the brick buildings, designed by 
Anglo-American architects, that filled the downtowns of San Francisco and other 
Western cities. But the building has been modified by its Asian occupants. Its 
window sills and doorway have been painted, and streamers have been hung, in 
the bright purples, yellows and greens that the Chinese believed brought 
prosperity and other things devoutly to be wished. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the exhibit is a fabulous artifact -- a gleaming Silsby 
steam-operated fire engine, made about 1860, that was the pride of Carson City, 
Nev. You can look at the fire engine from two very different points of view. 
"From one perspective, it shows the power and dominance of the Anglo 
community," Duchemin says. But a fire was one of the few occasions when the 
ethnically polarized towns of Western America might all work together for the 
common good so "it can also be seen as a unifying piece," he says. Duchemin 
trusts that visitors will make up their own minds. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, the project was conceived as a collaborative effort 
between the museum and the communities being featured. The Autry enlisted the 
help of a panel of museum consultants who are themselves members of the ethnic 
or cultural groups involved. The advisers each have a professional's 
understanding of what makes an evocative exhibit and other museum expertise. 
But each is also an ethnic insider, who can bring his or her own experience and 
special sensitivity to bear on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants have been very much involved, Duchemin says. They have vetted 
the "scripts" that are the basis for the signage and other written materials in 
the exhibit. And they have been invaluable in ensuring that each ethnic story 
is told in its own voice, not that of the dominant culture. Eventually, the 
Autry hopes to have a community-based advisory board, with a revolving 
membership of 25 or 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
 As one example of the consultant's insight, Duchemin points to Suellen Cheng's 
insistence that the woman featured in the Asian section be a merchant's wife, 
not a prostitute, as were many of the first Chinese women in the West. Cheng, a 
curator at El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument, objected to focusing too 
much attention on a woman who was essentially a slave, without influence. She 
argued persuasively that wives, while few in number, were more representative 
after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 barred unmarried Chinese women from 
entering the country. Moreover, Cheng insisted, wives and mothers were more 
central to the creation of community than marginal members of the demimonde. 
</P>
<P>
 An embroidered silk wedding costume is included in the Asian section, Osage 
marriage garb in the Native-American section. Eventually, the museum would like 
a wedding dress for every community featured in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic interaction in 1890 wasn't always pretty, and that, too, is reflected 
in the exhibit. One of the less attractive European-immigrant artifacts is a 
ballot for the San Francisco-based Workingmen's Party. This largely Irish 
organization ran its candidates on a shamelessly anti-Chinese platform. Some of 
the interactions are quite unexpected. One striking artifact is evidence that, 
at some point in the late 19th Century, a Navajo weaver chose to decorate her 
blanket or rug with stylized images of African-American cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 The new exhibit will occupy about 2,800 square feet, with each constituent 
community assigned about 125 square feet of display area. Between each ethnic 
display will be a recessed area (the staff calls them fiords) where docents 
will be able to gather a small group of school-age visitors out of the flow of 
traffic. Each ethnic display will include a hidden "education box" filled with 
replicas of relevant artifacts that the children can handle. A built-in camp 
stool opens into the fiord so the docent can sit down as she teaches her 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit's multiculturalism extends to the docents themselves. The Autry's 
education department tapped docents from each of the cultural communities 
represented and asked them if they would share their own family histories with 
visitors. As a result, volunteer Winnie Lu will tell how her grandfather 
practiced Chinese herbal medicine. And Jean Fernilius, a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will show youngsters a replica of the 
autograph book her great-grandfather kept in prison where he was incarcerated 
for having more than one wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to museum staffers for ethnic information has worked well for the 
museum in the past. When creating its Children's Discovery Gallery in 1992, the 
museum decided to build the please-touch exhibit around the Mexican-American 
ranching family of Mary Ann Ruelas, assistant director of programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasures that filled the Tucson townhouse of Ruelas' grandparents have 
been painstakingly reproduced, down to the traditional paper cutouts, called 
papel picado, that hung on the walls. By involving its own ethnic expert, the 
museum was able to get ongoing feedback about the accuracy of the exhibit. 
Ruelas objected, for instance, when the family ranch house was shown with 
sections of the adobe exposed, unprotected by stucco and, thus, at risk of 
melting away in a heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like showing your house with the windows broken," Ruelas protested. 
She also pointed out that her family had lived in Arizona, not California, and 
so the exhibit's simulation of an afternoon sky was repainted minus the 
Southland pinks and mauves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas was a learner in the course of the project as well as a teacher. While 
sharing information with other family members, she discovered that some of her 
ancestors may have been Conversos, Jews who had been pressured into converting 
to Catholicism by the Spanish Inquisition but secretly adhered to such Jewish 
practices as not mixing meat and dairy products at the same meal. 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the Autry's drive for multiculturism is that it is attracting a 
more diverse audience. Last year's Juneteenth celebration drew 3,000 people, 
most of them African American. As education associate Lori Givens points out, 
"It brought a lot of people here who didn't think there was anything here for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Givens thinks African Americans and other minority visitors are also heartened 
when they learn that the Autry has ongoing relationships with ethnic 
institutions such as the California African American Museum. "People feel a 
little safer that their story will be told responsibly," says Givens, who 
recently planned children's programs on the Buffalo soldiers and other 
African-American themes for Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spirit of Community gallery will open May 28, but it won't be finished, 
says Duchemin. As the curator explains, it is his hope that the visitors who 
come to see how their ancestors struggled in the American West will become 
actively involved with the exhibit, which will change over time. The curator 
hopes that these ad hoc ethnic experts will be quick to tell the staff what it 
got right and what it didn't.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot more dialogue is required," he says. Duchemin also hopes that visitors 
will bring their own ethnic artifacts -- also known as family treasures -- to 
add to the evolving display. WHERE AND WHEN

ART; MARKS ON THE EARTH; 'UNNATURAL LANDSCAPES' CONVEYS FIVE ARTISTS' 
PROVOCATIVE VIEWS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Landscape painting is not what it used to be. At least, not for some Los 
Angeles artists who contemplate landscape from the confines of our urban 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 There remain some open vistas in our area. And these city-dweller artists can 
probably still recall images of beautiful, open panoramas in not only 
historical but contemporary landscape art. But they have refused to let 
humankind's marks on the earth escape them or their art. Almost 30 works 
conveying five artists' personal views of our environment are on display in the 
show "Unnatural Landscapes" at Century Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The artists questioned me about the title of the show. They said, 'Why do you 
want me for a show titled "Unnatural Landscapes"?' " said gallery director Lee 
Musgrave. "The concept grew out of looking at landscape artists who were using 
landscape as an excuse for something else -- social, human and political 
concerns. The landscape seems to be only a stage setting for other things. But 
actually the political and social concerns are related to the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using the word 'unnatural' has caused people to think, to ask questions. If I 
had titled the show 'Contemporary Landscapes,' that wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Zolita Sverdlove's abstract oil paintings and monoprints present local scenes 
in expressive strokes of bold greens, blues and yellows. One is immediately 
drawn into the monoprint, "Nite Sky," with its wispy clouds and lights in the 
form of yellow and orange dots. It conveys a delightfully mysterious feeling 
that negates any uneasiness with the development that generates such a night 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the man-made arches in the monoprint, "The Two Arches of the Colorado 
Bridge," dominate the image, there is still a vitality to the foliage beneath 
the arches. In contrast, the clutter of buildings in the oil painting "L.A. 
Skyline IV" loom large and heavy on the more open spaces below. 
</P>
<P>
 The burning fires of Jerome Sander's five "Window Series" paintings bring to 
mind the media images of Kuwait's oil fields after the Persian Gulf War. Three 
of them are direct references to those fires. Of the other two paintings, one 
depicts a grassland fire, the other industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 These images leave no doubt of Sander's concern for the earth's survival. Yet, 
the fire and smoke of these works are seen through arch-shaped, painted 
windows, leading some viewers to find religious and romantic overtones in the 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "These particular events, even seen secondhand through the eye of the camera, 
are spectacular, awesome, and strangely beautiful," Sander writes. "They are 
fraught with ecological implications and remind us all too clearly of 
civilization's destructive tendencies that threaten to alter the balance of the 
earth's ecosystem that supports life as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 A photograph of a portion of a freeway, taken from a moving car, has been 
mounted in the center of most of Seta Injeyan's canvases. Emanating from and 
surrounding each photograph is an expressionistic burst of feeling in response 
to the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Injeyan's work conveys the benefits of freeway construction, yet she also 
illustrates "the conflict between freeways and how they cut right through the 
earth," Musgrave said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Arreola's unframed, mixed-media / collage on paper works incorporate 
photocopies of photographs, street maps and aerial views of the area along the 
L.A. River. These rough, almost technical presentations ably represent the 
unnatural character of the concrete channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Detrick's watercolor landscapes are completely abstract, rather geometric 
compositions of earth tones with hues of blue at the top. The uninitiated may 
not recognize them immediately as landscapes, but "what he's doing is a 
well-established intellectual exercise," Musgrave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He goes to the landscapes, but makes them into unnatural landscapes. Linda, 
Seta and Jerome are focusing on the unnatural you can see with the eye, but 
he's focusing on the unnatural within himself." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "Unnatural Landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Location: Century Gallery, 13000 Sayre St., Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. Ends May 13.

RELUCTANT NOVICE: TALKING THROUGH TERROR; THOUGH KNOWN FOR 'LIP-FLAPPING' ON 
THE PHONE, AUTHOR HAS LONG BEEN AFRAID OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. YEARS LATER, SHE 
FINALLY CONFRONTS HER FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although I have many nicknames, perhaps the most annoying is Uniblab. My 
husband calls me this when I am "lip-flapping," or talking incessantly (usually 
on the phone). I think he stole the unflattering word from a robot character in 
an old "Jetsons" cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lip-flapping aside, even the most talkative souls can experience crowd fright. 
Anyone who's ever had to address even a dozen or so people whose eyes are 
solely focused upon you have known sheer terror at least once in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with me. It started in the eighth grade, when I wrote a 
satirical paper on the care and feeding of parents. My teacher selected me to 
read the speech in a contest. Yikes! It was one thing to write something, quite 
another to read it aloud. When it came time to "perform" on that hot Texas 
summer afternoon, I keeled over and landed on the hard, gray floor. Humiliated 
in defeat in front of strangers and classmates, I later slumped to the back of 
the school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of proverbial grimace whenever memories of that day surfaced, I 
decided to get back onto the horse, although I wasn't sure which end I might 
land on. Confronting my fears head-on, I decided to volunteer my public 
speaking services at -- picking a school at random -- Taft High School in 
Woodland Hills. My topic? For lack of more glorious inspiration, I selected my 
profession and contacted the journalism teacher there. We decided on a mutually 
convenient time, and I marked the date on the calendar, counting the days with 
all the dread of a Death Row inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the date approached, the word reached my skin that I was 
returning to high school. In the spirit of conformity and Clearasil, breakouts 
ensued. Fortunately, I "oxycuted" 'em and proceeded to worry about the really 
important considerations -- like what to wear. Should I try to fit in -- a 
Beavis and Butt-head T-shirt? The grunge look, a la flannel shirt and frayed 
denims? What would the teacher think? In the end, I decided on a tasteful 
blazer with colored denims and the new rage -- black jet beads. 
</P>
<P>
 Once all the important stuff was taken care of, I realized that I could no 
longer procrastinate: I needed an outline. I scribbled down some ideas on a 
small note sheet, still in a fair amount of denial about the experience. I 
walked into the classroom 10 minutes early. A couple of students were seated at 
their desks, apparently cramming for a political studies exam. I shuffled 
around my props -- article copies -- and nervously wrote a few things on the 
chalkboard. Even then I knew that this was totally unnecessary, but I simply 
had to stay busy to keep up the denial that I was moments away from speaking!  
</P>
<P>
 Students began creeping in, like the frenetic feathered creatures hovering 
over the jungle gym in Hitchcock's "The Birds." I kept telling myself that I 
wasn't nervous, but my hands were so sweaty it wasn't long before the chalk was 
soaked and wouldn't write anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 As the teacher introduced me, all sound in the room was muffled, like the 
squawking gibberish from the mouths of adults in the Charlie Brown cartoons. 
Then, all eyes on me, I had to pry open my own mouth so the uniblabbing could 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided that if I continued to glance at several different faces, it would 
be easy to pretend I was only talking to a couple of people. And you know what? 
It worked! Words that actually made sense spilled forth, and the Uniblab unit 
was functioning at optimum capacity. Most of the students seemed interested -- 
although one did sleep for about 10 minutes toward the end. Many asked 
questions, so many that I had to push to finish my outline. 
</P>
<P>
 I only choked a couple of times: A student asked how much money I make -- I am 
the crouton winner, my husband is the breadwinner -- and another wanted to know 
if I get weak in the knees interviewing celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising to the occasion, I tried to answer their questions as truthfully as 
possible without revealing my secret passion for James Spader and other closely 
guarded secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bell rang, my body relaxed and a greater supply of oxygen returned to 
my brain. Although I am sure that I didn't change any of the kids' lives 
dramatically, I couldn't have done too badly since the teacher asked me to be a 
featured speaker at an upcoming L. A. Unified program. I felt vindicated, 
released from a past that had haunted me. 
</P>
<P>
 If you, too, experience fear at the idea of speaking in public, it might be a 
good idea to start out with a small speaking experience, such as talking to a 
class about your job or a special skill. If that seems too daunting, read some 
stories to a group of children. They're the most forgiving audience of all, and 
you'll be performing a valuable community service by taking them away from the 
video games.

3-HOUR TOUR: ECOLOGY'S LOCAL BRANCHES; TREES ARE TOPMOST AT COLDWATER CANYON 
PARK, HEADQUARTERS FOR TREEPEOPLE. BESIDES PLENTY OF GREENERY, THERE ARE 
TRAILS, PICNIC SPOTS AND DISPLAYS ON RECYCLING.

 Coldwater Canyon Park offers eucalyptus and pine-scented trails, panoramic San 
Fernando Valley views, and shady nooks and crannies perfect for picnicking. The 
park is also the headquarters of TreePeople, the environmental organization 
that promotes ecological awareness, recycling and tree-planting. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30,000 schoolchildren take field trips to TreePeople every year, but 
on weekends, the park provides a quiet respite where college students study 
under the oaks, couples walk their dogs and families find a peaceful slice of 
wilderness just minutes from Ventura Boulevard bustle. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you set out on your TreePeople tour, pack a lunch, lace up your walking 
shoes -- and bring some money. You may get inspired and decide to buy a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 to 11:45 a.m.: Park in the TreePeople lot on the east side of the 
intersection of Mulholland Drive and Coldwater Canyon Avenue. Your first stop 
is the information booth, which displays vintage photos of Coldwater Canyon 
Park, used in the 1920s by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Today, the 
firefighters' old horse stables are potting sheds, and the Model T firetruck 
garages are used to store planting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find the 25-cent brochure titled "Guide to Coldwater Canyon Park," buy 
it. While the guide is somewhat outdated, it still does a decent job of 
pointing out the park's highlights, including the Magic Forest Nature Trail, 
which you'll explore later. 
</P>
<P>
 11:45 a.m. to 12:15 p.m.: Head to the Recycling Center. The displays in this 
building are geared to children, but we all can benefit from a little nudge. 
Photos show how recycled goods are converted into new items; for example, 
plastic soda bottles become fiberfill for pillows and sleeping bags, and 
recycled glass is made into new jars and bottles. For a graphic look at what 
waste does to the wilderness, examine the case housing a miniature pristine 
canyon. Turn the crank and the canyon becomes a trash-filled landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 12:15 to 12:45 p.m.: Exit the Recycling Center and turn left to the Education 
Center. Exhibit cases display animals, insects, bird nests (complete with 
eggs), seeds and cones. Posters show how trees transform urban alleys into 
inviting promenades or give a lush, outdoor feel to small patios. 
</P>
<P>
 12:45 to 1:30 p.m.: Take a hike on the Magic Forest Nature Trail. The trail 
head is at the information booth. It's a cool and shady walk, with rustic 
benches and picnic tables scattered under trees. The stone walls and staircases 
lining the trail were built during the Depression by the Work Projects 
Administration. Unfortunately, much of the handsome stonework was badly damaged 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2:15 p.m.: Picnic time. (You did remember to pack a lunch, didn't 
you?) If you feel energetic after your meal and would like to enjoy sweeping 
vistas, take some time to explore the Dearing Mountain Trail (the wide fire 
road intersecting the Magic Forest Nature Trail) that links Coldwater Canyon 
Park with adjacent Wilacre Park and Fryman Overlook. 
</P>
<P>
 2:15 to 2:30 p.m.: Return to the TreePeople grounds. Stop in the nursery, open 
from 2 to 4 p.m. Tuesdays and Saturdays. More than 30 tree species that grow 
well in urban areas are stocked and divided in sections labeled "Old World," 
"New World" and "Australia," depending on where they originated. Trees are 
available for a donation -- pay what you think is fair. After you've selected a 
tree and helped yourself to some free mulch, head home to plant. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 * What: TreePeople at Coldwater Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Location: From the Ventura Freeway, exit on Coldwater Canyon Avenue and go 
south. TreePeople is at Mulholland Drive and Coldwater. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hours: Sunrise to sunset; parking lot opens at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Price: Free guided tours of the TreePeople grounds, gardens and orchards 
given one Sunday a month. Call (818) 753-4647. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call: (818) 753-4600 for general information. To find out about weekend 
workshops, call (818) 753-4609.

RECREATION; LIFE IN THE BUSY LANES; TINY MONTROSE BOWL IS A FAVORITE OF 
LOCATION DIRECTORS AND A SECOND HOME FOR MANY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S ALREADY 
BOOKED FOR PARTIES THROUGH JUNE.

 When you ask Bob Berger why he bought a bowling alley about 11 years ago, 
he'll say, "Stupidity. I never owned anything like this, and I didn't even know 
how to bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 But that little, "stupid" investment has become Berger's life, a location 
director's dream, and the livelihood of the Montrose-area residents who see the 
bowling alley as their second home. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating since 1936, the Montrose Bowl is the only eight-lane bowling alley 
in the Los Angeles area (Fullerton, San Diego and Point Mugu also have small 
alleys). 
</P>
<P>
 "You find four-, six-, eight-lane alleys in small towns," says Mark Miller, 
publication assistant for the American Bowling Congress, "but it's very unusual 
to see one thrive in a big city like Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 When Berger's employer of 30 years laid him off back in 1989, Berger decided 
to concentrate on the bowling investment and make it work. But he found the 
going tough and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, you cannot exist with just leagues in an eight-lane alley," he 
said. So he and wife Maria had to make the bowling alley work for them in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 And work it does. The Montrose Bowl is the hardest-working bowling alley in 
town. If it's not the location for the latest Miller Beer commercial or wrap 
party for a television movie, it's the site of a youngster's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Canada Mixed 4 league has called it home for more than 40 years and 
uses the lanes every Tuesday evening. And ordinary folks who want to bowl a few 
lanes drop in. (Patrons are advised to call first.) 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms, insurance companies, hospitals and real estate companies book the 
alley regularly for parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone likes to bowl, you know," he says, with a German accent from his 
early years in the Black Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 He pulls out a thick, black book and shows off appointment pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have parties scheduled in here until June," he said. "And forget about 
October, that's Oktoberfest." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday times are always in great demand and this year Donna Thomas, owner of 
Permanent Employment Agency in Glendale, has already booked the alley for her 
annual Christmas party. She did it in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure I got the date I wanted," Thomas explained. 
</P>
<P>
 She discovered Montrose Bowl while driving down Honolulu Avenue and noticing 
the handwritten "Private party" signs and balloons on the bowling alley's front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 She called for a price and discovered a great deal -- a six-hour private party 
rental at Montrose Bowl costs $400. At other bowling alleys, the cheapest quote 
she got was $3,300 -- and that wouldn't even be for a private party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only place I know where you can have your own private bowling alley 
for an evening," says Scott Craig of H.K.M. Productions, which specializes in 
TV commercials. Craig recently used the Montrose Bowl for an upcoming Miller 
Ice Beer commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much texture and charm there," he said. "Berger is well 
experienced in working with the film business." 
</P>
<P>
 Berger is proud of the movies filmed here. His walls are filled with photos 
from "Frankie and Johnnie" with Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino, "Teen Wolf" 
with Michael J. Fox, and shots of the queen of bad horror films, Elvira. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities aren't always in front of the camera at the Montrose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Willis celebrated his birthday by knocking pins down on lane 8, and 
party-throwers Janet Jackson, Eddie Van Halen, Donald Sutherland and David 
Cassidy have taken advantage of the privacy and the charm of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the cast and crew of "Hard Copy" celebrated the end of February 
Nielsen ratings sweeps at the Montrose Bowl, and according to Miguel Encino, 
associate director and self-proclaimed social coordinator for the show, "the 
staff makes you feel right at home. We even cleaned out their refrigerator!" 
</P>
<P>
 The stars may be out in the evening, but during the day Montrose Bowl becomes 
the dream party location for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the kids love it here," says Bob Bitticks, a Glendale lawyer who recently 
threw a birthday party for his 6-year-old son, Adam, and about 20 of Adam's 
little friends. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been a nightmare keeping track of the kids as well as 
entertaining them, said Bitticks' wife, Sabine, but at the Montrose Bowl, 
everything is self-contained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's small enough so you can stand here and see every kid," she said on the 
day of the party, as she prepared the birthday cake and pinata. "And they're 
having a blast," said Bitticks, watching his other son, Christopher, 11, roll a 
nice ball. 
</P>
<P>
 After the pinata was cracked open, Adam opened his presents. Most of his 
friends, however, were back slinging bowling balls down the lanes, which are 
protected with huge, inflatable gutter bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Adam ripped open the wrapping of his first present, he said, "Uh oh, I 
gotta go. I gotta go back bowling." WHERE AND WHEN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A NEW BORSCHT BELT; EATERIES AROUND COLDWATER AND VICTORY 
OFFER HOME-STYLE FAVORITES OF SOVIET EMIGRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 NoHo is one way insiders refer to North Hollywood, meaning to compare it with 
Manhattan's SoHo district. Actually, it's look ing as if ExSo might be a better 
name. The area near Coldwater and Victory has begun to sprout businesses 
operated by emigrants from former Soviet republics. Restaurants included, of 
course.  
</P>
<P>
 Such as Tamara's Family Restaurant. It's named for proprietor Tamara Stern, a 
Jewish Ukrainian woman who greets her customers like old friends. It's a simply 
appointed place with the look of a late-'60s coffee shop: a long counter, 
pastries twirling on a carousel, pink vinyl booths big enough for six. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd describe the food as Denny's with an Eastern European twist. You'll find 
everything you'd expect from a family restaurant, such as an American 
breakfast, meatloaf, turkey and burgers, plus several home-style dishes from 
the Ukraine, ranging from stuffed cabbage to something Stern calls her Napoleon 
cake.  
</P>
<P>
 Soup, from a rotating list made fresh daily, is one place to begin. On 
weekends there is a good sweet-and-sour cabbage borscht served with sour cream 
-- a meatless version, conforming to Jewish tradition. During the week, try the 
comforting chicken soup with noodles, or that deli standby, mushroom barley. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinners, which come with soup or salad (take the soup), are mostly familiar to 
anyone who has been inside a coffee shop. There is turkey: freshly roasted, a 
generous portion, with bread stuffing that boasts walnuts and apples. Or 
stuffed cabbage rolls: two to an order, with a dense meat stuffing and a watery 
tomato sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 If you crave meatloaf, proceed at your own risk. Tamara's serves a thick slab 
colored an unappetizing brownish-gray, blanketed with a russet-hued gravy you 
could stand a spoon in. I recommend the beef stroganoff instead: chunky beef in 
a sour cream sauce with mushrooms and buttered noodles. You won't find that at 
Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are distinctive as well. Stern bakes four cakes on the premises, 
and all, save an opulent carrot cake, are in the Eastern European mold. The 
Napoleon cake consists of several layers of a crepe-like pastry, alternating 
with a creamy butterscotch-vanilla filling. Chocolate walnut and strawberry 
walnut cakes are also multilayered (and cloyingly sweet). If the kids insist on 
American, though, the restaurant's traditional banana split should do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign at Cheers is a replica of the one used on the television show of the 
same name, and owner Nick Hakopian may actually come over to your table and 
introduce himself as "Sam Malone." But what you eat here is Russian and 
Armenian cuisine, not Beer Nuts and Cheese Doodles. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, you're not very likely to imagine that you're in a Boston bar. On 
warm nights, you can sit outside on a spiffy outdoor patio shielded from 
Victory Boulevard by a wrought-iron fence and a dense thicket of plants.  
</P>
<P>
 The huge menu spans a good number of the former Soviet republics. Beside the 
spicy Georgian lamb soup known as kharcho , for instance, you find salty red 
salmon from Russia, Siberian pelmeny and Armenian dishes such as the spicy cold 
cuts basturma and bujinina .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't miss the wonderful pelmeny , about two dozen tiny meat-filled ravioli 
served in a light broth. The most expensive dish on the menu, at $11.50, is the 
delicious marinated lamb chops po-Karsky , nicely trimmed and grilled on a 
charcoal brazier. Lula kebab is the poor man's shish kebab, made with ground 
meat mixed with onions and spices. It's a bargain at $5.25. 
</P>
<P>
 You can make an entire meal of the appetizers here, mostly salty fare supposed 
to encourage drinking. (Unfortunately -- and ironically -- Cheers' beer and 
wine license is pending.) 
</P>
<P>
 Try sarma and bujinina , my two favorites. Sarma are wonderful little 
cigar-shaped stuffed grape leaves with an oily but tasty meat and rice mixture. 
Bujinina is a kind of roast pork that has been sprinkled rather generously with 
cayenne pepper. You'll need about two glasses of the house ice tea to wash an 
order down. WHERE AND WHEN

$11.8 MILLION TO WIDEN SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY IS OKD; TRANSPORTATION: THE PROJECT 
WILL ADD TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION ALONG A 12-MILE SEGMENT. THE WORK IS 
EXPECTED TO START IN DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Close on the heels of the massive project to repair the earthquake-damaged 
Simi Valley Freeway, work will begin anew before year's end to enlarge the 
freeway by four lanes, Caltrans announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission, meeting in Sacramento this week, 
allocated $11.8 million to widen the freeway from west of the Los 
Angeles/Ventura County line to the Golden State Freeway, a distance of about 12 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year project will add one regular lane and one car-pool lane in each 
direction. Construction is expected to begin in December and be completed by 
the end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Park-and-Ride lots to serve the Simi Valley Freeway will also be 
constructed near its intersection with the San Diego Freeway and at Winnetka 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Commission will contribute 
$15.7 million to the $27-million project, said Joe Shaw, spokesman for the 
state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will include median and shoulder reconstruction, drainage 
modification, bridge widening, retaining walls and sound walls, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the funds have been allocated for the project, contracts can be 
awarded for the work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of the freeway were closed by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Crews worked 
round-the-clock to make preliminary repairs, and through traffic resumed just 
over a month after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete repairs, including the rebuilding of several freeway overpasses, is 
scheduled to be done by June, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall traffic volume on the Simi Valley Freeway, in some places reduced to 
two lanes, has steadily increased since the earthquake. From an average of 
107,000 daily trips early in March, traffic has increased to an average 118,000 
daily trips this week, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening peak hour traffic of 9,400 daily trips has now nearly reached the 
pre-quake level of 9,950 trips, according to Caltrans studies. Morning volume 
remains somewhat lower at 8,800 daily trips, compared with 10,800 before the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, the Simi Valley Freeway experienced increasingly 
heavy traffic as suburban populations grew in northwestern Los Angeles and 
eastern Ventura counties. Traffic was also slowed during peak hours by the 
changing configuration of the freeway, which varied from three lanes to five. 
</P>
<P>
 The car-pool lanes, known officially as High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, 
are reserved for cars with two or more occupants and are designed to relieve 
congestion by concentrating more people into a portion of the freeway. Some HOV 
lanes carry up to 40% of the people traveling on a freeway, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The HOV program is designed to significantly increase the capacity of the 
freeway system in a relatively short time and at minimal cost," said Jerry B. 
Baxter, director of District 7 for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are 65 miles of HOV lanes in Los Angeles County. Other HOV 
lanes are under construction on the Harbor and Artesia freeways, and the 
Ventura Freeway east of the Hollywood Freeway.

THEY DIED FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE; HUGE LINES AT S. AFRICA POLLS UNDERSCORE QUEST 
FOR DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is 75 and a grandfather. And for the first time in his life Nelson Mandela 
is a voter -- like millions of other newly enfranchised black South Africans 
now enjoying the right to determine how their country is governed. Finally, the 
once silenced majority will have a say in its political destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotionally liberating effect of the franchise to vote was evident from 
the remotest bush country to the biggest cities. The enormous lines of voters 
offered dramatic evidence of just what this historic election means. Blacks and 
their white supporters died for this; bombs have not had the power to frighten 
away the millions eager to participate in South Africa's first all-race 
election, in which the turnout topped 90% in some areas. (Contrast this with 
most U.S. elections: Relatively few go to the polls; the right to vote is taken 
for granted.) Whatever happens next in South Africa, the people and their 
leaders -- Mandela and outgoing President Frederik W. de Klerk -- deserve the 
world's admiration for what they have done to achieve this epic moment.  
</P>
<P>
 When all the votes are tabulated, Mandela and his African National Congress -- 
a liberation movement turned respectable political party -- undoubtedly will 
prevail. At a time of life when most people are retired, he will become the 
first black president of Africa's newest democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela knows he cannot afford to escalate the white exodus from South Africa. 
He knows that the evil apartheid system resulted in whites receiving better 
educations and better professional training. A continued brain drain would rob 
the nation of expertise and capital needed to prime the engine of reform. One 
hopes that others in Mandela's party equally appreciate these vital nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 Generous foreign aid will help. President Clinton plans to increase U.S. 
assistance to $200 million a year. In addition, the potential for private 
investment is vastly greater now, with foreign investors being tantalized by 
visions of a market of 30 million black consumers. However, few will take the 
risk of making major outlays if political violence continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Western investment also will dry up if South Africa suffers the pitfalls 
common in new democracies -- widespread corruption, human rights abuses and 
intractable ethnic conflicts. Neighboring Zimbabwe largely has escaped those 
ills. South Africa can too if Mandela fulfills his promises during his 
five-year term -- and if his successors remain true to his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has beaten the odds before. In 1964, when he was sentenced to life in 
prison for his role in the ANC's fight for black freedom, he said: "I have 
fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I 
have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons 
live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I 
hope to live for and to achieve. But if need be, it is an ideal for which I am 
prepared to die." He has lived. He has achieved. Now he will lead. Everyone 
must hope that South Africa will prove to be the exception among many fledging 
states that have tried democracy: that this first vote will not be South 
Africa's last.

FINALLY, THE FINGER POINTS AT CLEANUP; AFTER YEARS OF CHARGE AND COUNTERCHARGE, 
A PLAN TO HEAL SANTA MONICA BAY IS REACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is good news indeed that longstanding adversaries agree on a plan to clean 
up and protect Santa Monica Bay, one of the nation's most troubled coastal 
resources. Now comes the hard part: finding the money to do the job, 
maintaining the corporate and institutional goodwill that generated this 
ambitious consensus plan and enlisting the cooperation of the residents and 
institutions in the 414-square-mile watershed that drains into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching from Ventura County beaches to the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the 
Santa Monica Bay is one of the state's most popular recreational resources. Its 
coastline, 50 miles long, annually attracts 4 million visitors, who come to 
swim, boat and surf. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those activities have become more hazardous of late as the water has 
become increasingly polluted. The bay faces almost every type of ecological 
threat, including water pollution and degradation of marine life and adjacent 
wetlands. Yet as it deteriorated in recent years, finger-pointing too often 
prevailed over consensus and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, former adversaries including Heal the Bay, Chevron USA, 
Southern California Edison and local sewage treatment operators unveiled a 
$67-million plan to reverse the tide, as it were. The plan is the result of 
five years of effort encouraged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; it 
recommends 73 steps or priorities for cleaning up the bay by 1999.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of those steps are obvious: upgrading sewage treatment facilities at 
local plants, diverting storm runoff into those plants, restoring the Ballona 
Wetlands and the Malibu Lagoon and developing an inspection system to find 
illegal sewage connections into storm drains. These involve institutional 
action. However, the brunt of cleanup will fall on the individuals who live in 
the bay's vast watershed. The major bay pollutant is urban runoff, that toxic 
stew of motor oil, garden chemicals, grease and other urban trash that flows 
from our homes and businesses down gutters, into storm drains and out to sea. 
For that reason, small gestures, repeated on a grand scale, can make a very big 
difference. Small gestures like not throwing trash into the gutter or properly 
disposing of used motor oil, insecticide and paint rather than dumping them 
down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Public debate over the final shape of the plan will continue in the coming 
months. But the proposal looks promising and the path it outlines to a 
healthier bay is clear -- a lot clearer than the water at Southern California's 
shores.

WORLD'S FISHERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I take exception to John Andrews' April 18 letter, which questioned "why 
hunters as a group are so much smarter and more intelligent than fishermen as a 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 I can understand people reacting in alarm to the prophecies of doom generated 
by the new "save the oceans" campaign unveiled worldwide by the eco-crisis 
industry.Yes, we have problems in some fisheries, but much of the information 
in print is very misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish populations fluctuate greatly due to natural changes in the ocean. It is 
easy to declare one species "depleted" even as it is replaced by another, 
naturally. The return of the sardines off our coast coincides with a natural 
40-year cycle. Sadly, we watch as the salmon fade in their turn. Protected 
seals and sea lions exacerbate the situation, but that is another story. 
Although the natural bloom and fade of the ocean's inhabitants can be traumatic 
for the people involved, we have the capacity to adjust as long as bureaucracy 
is not so stringent that it stifles this process. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen around the globe participate in a variety of scientific management 
regimes. Southern California tuna fishermen helped start and continue to 
participate in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission's (IATTC) program 
for their traditional fishing grounds in the eastern Pacific. When was the 
IATTC established? 1949.

U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your April 20 editorial regarding The Times' proposals for bringing peace to 
Bosnia literally cries out for response. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit and implementation of the policies you advocate are, make no 
mistake, an act of war. To remove U.N. peacekeepers and initiate a 
significantly increased tactical air operation, while at the same time lifting 
the arms embargo, ensures direct United States entry, however distant it may 
currently be, as an active participant in war. Unless you and those who would 
advocate similar policies are prepared to support the commitment of the full 
might of the armed forces of the United States, and the potential consequences 
of such events, it would be a wiser policy to minimize U.S. involvement in such 
affairs. The pages of history of the region are dripping with the blood spilled 
in ethnic and tribal civil wars. How many of America's sons and daughters must 
be sacrificed before the folly of such actions is finally recognized.

<P>
 * Since when can American blood and treasure be put at risk upon "request" by 
the U.N., NATO, Boutros-Ghali, or anyone else other than Americans? 
</P>
<P>
 * How can we bomb with a "limited" objective? If I start with the limited 
objective of punching you in the nose and you respond by hitting me on the head 
with a baseball bat, how "limited" can my objective remain? 
</P>
<P>
 * Before risking American lives, why are not the armed-to-the-teeth Arab 
countries rushing to the aid of their Muslim brothers in Bosnia the way we 
rushed to their aid in Kuwait? 
</P>
<P>
 * The bottom line: Our government is lying to us about Bosnia.

 * Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and, earlier, 
former President George Bush have raised the air of hypocrisy to levels never 
before seen even in Washington, which is famous for hypocrisy. If Bush and his 
apologists in Congress had not been deaf and blind to the developing tragedy in 
Yugoslavia we would not have the crisis today. 
</P>
<P>
 Their current criticism is merely a smoke screen to divert attention from the 
disastrous inaction of the Bush Administration at a time when non-military 
action could have helped. By seeing intervention only in military terms two and 
three years ago and dismissing all other actions to avert a crisis, they have 
created the disaster in Bosnia today.

 * As a specialist in South Slavic studies for over 20 years, I read Jack 
Valenti's commentary on Bosnia (April 22) with interest. His primary 
illustration of the dangers of "ancient feuds and the surliest of landscapes" 
was that "20 crack Nazi divisions were still stumbling over Yugoslavia in 
futile frustration when the war ended." I hate to toss a cold bucket of reality 
on Valenti's point-making, but there are no ancient feuds in Bosnia. The 
Croatians and Serbs never fought a war in history until 1914, when Serbia 
assassinated Archduke Ferdinand, starting the Third Balkan War, which quickly 
became World War I. The war in Bosnia is about Serbian aggression, not ancient 
feuds. Croatia and Bosnia have some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth. 
There were never 20 "Nazi" (I think he meant "German") divisions in all of 
Yugoslavia during World War II. As for "crack" I'm not sure what that means, 
but the 369th, 373rd, 392nd, and 13th " Handschar " divisions operating in 
Bosnia during the war were mostly locally recruited Croatians and Muslims with 
German officers. Most German forces withdrew from Yugoslavia well before the 
war ended.

ADM. FRANK KELSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * April 19 I turned on the television to look at C-Span. The debate regarding 
the retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso II was in full swing.It was amazing to me 
the vehemence with which several male senators attacked the women senators who 
all, regardless of party, voted to deny the Navy's top admiral retirement with 
four stars ("Senate to Retire Kelso at 4 Stars After Fiery Debate," April 20). 
His shameless part in the Tailhook affair was ample reason for his removal from 
the Navy long ago. The disgraceful whitewash of those involved will be a black 
mark on Navy history for years to come.  
</P>
<P>
 I was in the Navy for two years during World War II and harassment was in full 
swing then. However, my generation had not as yet had its consciousness raised, 
and we handled these situations ourselves -- each as it occurred. The senators 
who voted to allow Kelso to retire as a four-star admiral show that the "old 
boy system" is still in command and has changed little since my career in the 
Navy 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who redeemed himself with his forthright 
support of the denial. Most of all, brickbats to Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). 
He should bury his face in a large iceberg with shame. It is obvious that women 
still have to struggle mightily for fair and unbiased treatment.

MOTOR-VOTER LAW AND THE DMV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The allegation of Peter Drier and Jowanna Waits ("If They're Registered, 
Most Will Vote," Commentary, April 20) that the Department of Motor Vehicles 
will not comply with the federal "motor-voter" law is 100% wrong. With Gov. 
Pete Wilson's strong support, the DMV is preparing to comply with the law and 
will do so by the Jan. 1, 1995, deadline. The DMV has no need for legislation 
to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, DMV plans are in place to implement "motor voter" even though the 
federal government has yet to issue its own guidelines. We don't need federal 
guidelines, but it would be nice if Uncle Sam would reimburse us for the $3 
million per year California taxpayers will be spending to implement just the 
DMV portion of this unfunded federal mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV employees proudly follow the laws of California and of the United States. 
The charge that DMV would do otherwise for political reasons or for any reason 
is unfair to the DMV and to our employees. 
</P>
<P>
 FRANK S. ZOLIN, Director 
</P>
<P>
 DMV, Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
 * From my view I give Gov. Wilson high marks for rebuffing the federal 
motor-voter law. It is yet another example of an unfunded federal mandate. I 
have voted in all states that I've lived in for nearly 50 years and have never 
had a problem registering, and with convenience. Also, I've never been asked to 
prove citizenship. We don't need more federal bureaucracy to solve what I 
believe to be both a voter apathy problem and a states' rights issue. It should 
go to the courts for resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, the authors' statement that " . . . social welfare agencies have 
a much higher standard of screening applicants than our system of registering 
voters at sidewalk tables . . ." is difficult to digest in the face of almost 
daily articles about the flagrant abuses and mismanagement in our already 
overworked welfare system.

 How can we pose as champions of human rights when we let homelessness exist 
and nothing is done to attack the problem? Is there any greater infraction of 
human rights than for the government to refuse to touch this problem? Even the 
countries we criticize, like China, are better in this respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The country will pay for this in children who are brought up on the streets. 
It may pay in epidemics that get started in miserable human conditions. It is 
another plague that needs to be addressed at the federal level.

ROSEANNE'S ABUSE SCRIPT: BRUISE, RUSE, SHAME, SHAM?; BATTERED WOMEN: THE TV 
STAR'S ACCUSATIONS AND RECANTING DO A DISSERVICE TO REAL VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERTA IKEMI and SUSAN BERKE FOGEL, Roberta Ikemi and Susan Berke Fogel are 
staff attorneys at the California Women's Law Center, Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Either Roseanne Arnold has constructed a publicity stunt so tasteless and 
harmful that atonement is all but beyond reach, or she has provided a 
picture-perfect portrait of a battered wife. The speed with which she made 
claim to battered-wife syndrome and then recanted with an apology to her 
husband has given commentators permission to trivialize the horrors of domestic 
violence. Surely this was not her intent. However, her actions may have 
seriously set back the domestic violence movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The media thugs were quick to point to Roseanne as proof that women fabricate 
stories of spousal abuse to get attention. Others, perhaps more charitable, 
simply dismissed the Arnold saga as a publicity stunt. Just about all of them 
found it convenient to use the celebrity excuse to avoid discussing the serious 
and too-long-neglected issue of abusive relationships and domestic violence 
against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence shapes the lives, and often the deaths, of millions of women 
who are abused by the men close to them. According to the Los Angeles Domestic 
Violence Council, the Los Angeles Police Department alone investigated 42,698 
domestic violence incidents and made 7,858 felony arrests in 1993. The FBI has 
reported that domestic violence accounts for 30% of the homicides in which 
women are the victims. As many as 35% of all emergency-room visits by women are 
related to abuse. And yet, in one sweeping verdict on the Arnold case, the 
urgency for understanding domestic violence is dismissed.  
</P>
<P>
 Is Roseanne's behavior a valid example of the effects of domestic violence? We 
will never know for sure. We can only speculate and compare her words and 
actions with what we know about domestic violence and relationships gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Abusive relationships involve complex, interrelated behaviors on the part of 
both the victim and the abuser. These relationships cycle through three phases: 
building of tension, explosion of violence, then reconciliation. Some abusers 
and victims cycle through the phases quickly, in days or weeks; other couples 
take years to pass from phase to phase. The cycle is one of continual 
repetition; sometimes, only death ends it. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders are easily deceived by these relationships. The victim and the 
batterer are bound together by secrecy and deception. The victim remains silent 
because she feels that she is responsible for her condition and she fears 
further violence if she confronts her abuser. Society helps to reinforce the 
secrecy by treating the claims of abused women with skepticism. Further 
reinforcement comes from physicians who are unwilling or untrained to recognize 
the signs of abuse. They often accept the contrived explanations that women 
patients give, out of shame or fear, to explain their injuries. In one study, 
emergency-room physicians failed to identify 92% of the cases attributable to 
spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne's abrupt dismissal of her husband from their production company 
following a venomous argument and her subsequent accusations of abuse at his 
hands were called "crazy" by many people. If Roseanne really were an abused 
woman, her "crazy" behavior would be normal in terms of what is known about 
abusive relationships. An abuser will turn reality upside down. He will say, 
for example, that the victim's "crazy" behavior provoked him, that she was 
really the dangerous one in the relationship. The victim loses her bearings and 
becomes entirely dependent on her abuser for her understanding of reality. If 
the victim sounds crazy to us, it's because the abuser has driven her crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 To many of us, the Arnolds' marriage and professional lives seemed broken 
beyond repair. Now we hear that they are getting back together. Could this be 
the reconciliation phase in the life of the abuse victim? Many domestic 
violence victims live on the hope that the promises will be kept, that life 
together will be fine, because thinking about the repetition of the cycle is 
unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual in domestic violence situations for the victim to return to 
the familiarity of a dangerous home life after escaping to a safe place. Fear 
of the unknown and economic dependence on the abuser drives some women back 
home. Others are too tired to run, certain that their abuser will pursue them 
to the ends of the Earth. Many know, if only intuitively, that leaving can be 
more dangerous than being beaten; in fact, victims who leave are 75% more 
likely to be killed by their abusers than those who stay. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, these choices are puzzling; it becomes easy to dismiss what 
looks like self-defeating behavior and minimize the problem of domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 None who have experience with these truly serious problems would wish them on 
Roseanne Arnold or any other woman. If she is truly a victim of domestic 
violence, she must seek help. In so doing, she can help expose a national 
epidemic that has always hidden in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, Roseanne overstated her situation, more than an apology 
to battered women is in order. It will take a second career as a celebrity 
educator on domestic violence before her dues are paid.

PERSPECTIVE ON NUCLEAR DISASTER; NO PEACE FOR CHERNOBYL'S VICTIMS; THERE IS 
MORE SICKNESS, MORE DEATH AND THE CONSTANT THREAT THAT ANOTHER SOVIET-ERA 
REACTOR WILL BLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUDMILLA THORNE, Ludmilla Thorne is director of studies for the Commonwealth 
of Independent States at Freedom House. She is editing an anthology on the 
impact of Chernobyl on Belarus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week marks the eighth anniversary of Chernobyl, the nuclear disaster that 
spewed 50 tons of radioactive particles (10 times the fallout of Hiroshima). 
The world's memory of Chernobyl has dimmed, its focus moved to other places in 
harm's way, like Rwanda and Bosnia. But for people living in the contaminated 
areas of Ukraine, Belarus and western Russia, the accident continues to wreak 
consequences whose danger and immensity could not have been imagined before the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The small republic of Belarus was hardest hit by the catastrophe. The 
Chernobyl nuclear-power plant is in Ukraine, but the reactor that exploded 
during the night of April 26, 1986, is only 10 miles from the Belarusian 
border. The lethally radioactive cloud that was emitted passed first over 
Belarus; 70% of the radioactive matter ejected by the explosion fell there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of Belarus' 10 million people are still living in contaminated 
areas and we are just beginning to see the devastating results. There has been 
an astronomical increase in thyroid cancer, especially among Belarusian 
children, with 237 cases diagnosed since the Chernobyl accident. About a dozen 
of the stricken children have already died. Under normal circumstances, the 
incidence of thyroid cancer in children younger than 15 is infinitesimal, on 
the order of one per million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cancers, anemias, immune disorders and respiratory illnesses have also 
increased considerably in the affected regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. 
Birth rates have dropped, due in part to the fear of genetic problems, and 
there is an increase in infants with Down's syndrome. In addition, there have 
been horrific mutations in humans, animals and plants, including livestock born 
with extra legs and other body parts and children born with missing limbs and 
skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The harm of the radiation was multiplied because irradiated food products were 
distributed throughout the Soviet Union. Today, eight years after the 
explosion, potatoes, grains, cucumbers, onions, leafy green vegetables and 
fruit continue to be grown on highly contaminated land. Some farms in Ukraine 
and Belarus that were officially shut down continue to harvest grain; local 
officials even collect taxes on the produce. People know that the meat and 
vegetables they cultivate are poisonous, but not to eat them can mean going 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Western experts believe that all three types of Soviet-designed nuclear 
reactors, especially the 15 Chernobyl-style reactors still operating in the 
former Soviet Union, are dangerously flawed and that another catastrophe is 
almost inevitable. But economic hardships, a lack of hard currency and energy 
shortages have forced the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union 
to continue depending on nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1986 disaster at the No. 4 reactor, there have been four fires and 
one water leak at the still-functioning Chernobyl units. There were also two 
"incidents" -- irregularities of function due to safety defects -- just last 
week. In 1992, there were 205 reported incidents at energy plants in the former 
Soviet Union, a rise of 19% over the previous year. In March, 1994, the Russian 
Federal Nuclear and Radiation Safety Oversight Committee reported 20,000 safety 
violations for 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 On April 8, Ukraine said that it would shut down Chernobyl, but two weeks 
later told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it can't afford to do 
so. Chernobyl alone generates 7% of the country's electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Chernobyl's most tragic victims are the so-called liquidators, the 
600,000 young cleanup workers -- mostly soldiers, coal miners and army veterans 
-- who were sent in shifts over three years to the disaster site without 
protective clothing. They buried chunks of radioactive graphite blown out of 
the reactor and built a "permanent" concrete sarcophagus that is already 
dangerously ineffective. Health monitoring is poor, but more than 7,000 of the 
young men, whose average age is 29, are reported to have died of causes related 
to Chernobyl; up to 80% of the others are said to suffer from spinal-cord 
disorders, nerve damage and psychological problems. A spokesman for the Russian 
government's Chernobyl committee revealed last year that 18% of the men who 
have died -- about 1,250 people -- committed suicide, unable to cope with 
radiation effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the indirect victims, among them the "squatters" who have 
returned to their contaminated, abandoned villages to live out their lives 
rather than face ostracism as "Chernobyl goblins." Evacuees from Chernobyl's 
irradiated regions have been shunned and discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to inflicting immense suffering, the Chernobyl disaster has also 
spawned numerous scams, many of them involving Western humanitarian aid. In one 
such cheating operation, bureaucrats in the Bryansk region of Russia sent their 
own children, instead of sick Chernobyl youngsters, to Western summer camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernobyl has even given rise to poisoned values among children. 
Eight-year-old leukemia victim Pasha, who was born a month before the Chernobyl 
disaster in Gomel, Belarus, told a visiting journalist in his hospital room: "I 
like to eat everything with radiation. Without radiation, it doesn't taste 
good."

RISE IN BOND YIELDS SENDS DOW TUMBLING 31.23 POINTS; MARKETS: STOCKS CLIPPED BY 
GOVERNMENT REPORT SHOWING INFLATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER GREW FASTER THAN 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury bond yields posted one of their biggest one-day rises ever as a 
government report showed that inflation grew faster than expected in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in yields dashed hopes that interest rates will decline further soon, 
in turn pushing stocks sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield jumped to 7.26% from 7.10% on Tuesday. 
Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, tumbled $17.50 per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.23 points to 3,668.31 
as 323.76 million shares changed hands. In the broader market, declining issues 
outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks underperformed smaller issues. The NYSE's composite index 
fell 1.28 to 249.13. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller companies declined 2.52 
to 731.69. The S&P 500 lost 2.77 to 449.10. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in long-term interest yields reversed a weeklong retreat, killing 
hopes for a lasting decline that in turn would ease pressure on the Federal 
Reserve Board to further tighten credit. Some economists fear that further rate 
hikes, which in turn would drive up mortgage and other borrowing rates, could 
stifle the economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product grew 
at a moderate 2.6% annual rate in the first three months of the year. That was 
less than the 3.2% expected by many economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices initially rose on the news, because slower growth can check 
inflationary pressures. Inflation tends to diminish the value of investments 
that pay a fixed rate of interest, such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, bond prices deteriorated after analysts took a closer look at an 
inflation index tied to the GDP. The index rose at an annual rate of only 2.6% 
in the first quarter, but the growth was steeper than expected and the biggest 
increase since the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff accelerated after bond prices failed to break above a key 
technical resistance level. 
</P>
<P>
 News of dismal demand at the Treasury's sale of five-year notes Thursday -- 
the second stage of the monthly auction -- accelerated the market's tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury announced in early afternoon that it sold $11 billion in notes at 
a high yield of 6.60%. That was higher than the 5.56% that many market 
participants had expected, indicating that the government was forced to offer 
higher rates to try to drum up demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the poor response, the bid-to-cover ratio -- a measure of 
auction demand that compares the number of bids received to those accepted -- 
was 2.13 to 1. That was down from an average of 2.70 in the last 20 auctions of 
five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 One observer said the auction results were among the worst on record. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. financial markets were closed Wednesday to observe a national day of 
mourning for former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and traders appeared dismayed at the degree to which the equity 
market was tied to bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just in lock-step with that sucker," said Ralph Acampora, market 
analyst for Prudential Securities. "It really is too bad. I thought from an 
equity point of view we had a market that was washed out and pretty bearish, 
and we could get a recovery going here, but that turns out not to be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * SciClone Pharmaceuticals and Alpha 1 Biomedical shares lost about two-thirds 
of their value after their hepatitis drug failed to perform better than a 
placebo in clinical tests. SciClone shares closed down 7 9/16, or 60%, at 5 
3/16. Alpha 1 fell 4 13/16, or 68%, to close at 2.

AGRICULTURE DEPT. SAYS WHEAT IMPORTS COST TAXPAYERS MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wheat imports from Canada will cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $682 million 
in subsidies for U.S. farmers, the Agriculture Department reported Thursday to 
a trade panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The $682 million represents payments to wheat growers over four years ending 
May, 1995, to make up for the difference between the government's target price 
and the real price. 
</P>
<P>
 Imports from Canada are steadily growing and will continue to hold all U.S. 
wheat prices down an average of 9 cents a bushel through next year, said Keith 
Collins, chief economist for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that stagnant world trade, including lost sales to China and the 
former Soviet Union, have choked off U.S. opportunities for price-boosting 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of sanctions against Canada told the International Trade 
Commission that U.S. consumers will pay an invisible tax in the form of higher 
food prices if imports of wheat, especially durum, are curbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Durum goes into macaroni, spaghetti and other noodles. Opponents of sanctions 
say the U.S. demand for those foods is growing faster than U.S. farmers can 
supply the wheat, especially because of flood-induced shortages last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing put the Administration in the position of arguing for restrictions 
under a U.S. law that will be invalid when a worldwide agreement to lower trade 
barriers takes effect next year.

 MOVING UP: The improved Writing Center at Valley College has entered the 
modern age, and that can mean only one thing: Computers, of course. The center 
now has two Macintosh computers for students who need help in writing. . . . 
The old center was, safe to say, a bit out of date. Its only equipment was a 
set of dictionaries (B3). 
</P>
<P>
 RABBINICAL VISIT: On Thursday, the rabbi spoke to the students at Emek Hebrew 
Academy in Sherman Oaks. But not just any rabbi. Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, one of 
Israel's two chief rabbis, visited on the first day of his trip to Los Angeles. 
(B3) . . . Speaking in Hebrew, he questioned how strictly American Jews 
practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVERSITY: The West, no matter what Hollywood tells us, was not explored 
exclusively by white cowboys riding off into the sunset. It was a group effort, 
attracting a wide range of cultures. . . . And this has not escaped the Gene 
Autry Western Heritage Museum (above), which will open a gallery to honor the 
ethnic groups who took part in the adventure. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 MELLOW MATADOR: CSUN first baseman Jason Shanahan sounds too good to be true. 
He leads his Matadors in batting average, home runs and wholesomeness. "I've 
never been somebody who does crazy things just for the sake of it," he says. . 
. . Shanahan, however, better get some help from his teammates this weekend in 
a do-or-die series against division leader San Diego State (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 NO SECOND FIDDLE: For years, it was a festival without a proper home. Well, no 
longer. Finally, the annual Topanga Banjo-Fiddle Contest and Dance & Folk Arts 
Festival seems settled at Paramount Ranch near Agoura. And this Sunday, the 
sounds of bluegrass and banjos will be alive again. . . . "People sometimes 
come across the country just for this," said one performer. See Valley Life!

 DAUGHTERS DAY: While national "Take Our Daughters to Work Day" was a onetime 
experience for most Ventura County parents (B1), Sarah Rye gets to see her 
daughter, Caroline, every day on the job at Oxnard City Hall. . . . Sarah is a 
custodian and Caroline works in the library. Before they joined the city a few 
years ago, the mother-daughter duo worked together at an Oxnard company for 
about seven years. . . . "We see each other all the time," Caroline Rye said. 
"It's a good feeling to work for the same company." 
</P>
<P>
 FICUS FRACAS: There's an old-fashioned political slugfest brewing over the 
fate of the ficus tree in downtown Ventura. . . . It seems that city leaders 
are torn over whether the ficus should be included in downtown revitalization 
plans. Councilman Gary Tuttle, who sits on a subcommittee studying the issue, 
so far hasn't even been able to convince his wife and daughter that the ficus 
should go. . . . "I'm certainly in support of what the citizens support," 
Tuttle said. "I'm not falling on my sword for this one."

 BASEBALL FEVER: Jeff Bennett's passion for baseball has extended to late-night 
batting practice illuminated only by car headlights (C11). . . . "My mom hates 
it," said the catcher for the Newbury Park High Panthers. "She thinks I'm 
obsessed. She said I need balance in my life. But I just like to hit." . . . He 
is hitting .363 and leading the team with five home runs and 20 runs batted in, 
along with being among the area's best catchers.

 CRACKING DOWN: Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) continues to press his 
campaign to halt illegal immigration. . . . Gallegly met Thursday with U. S. 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. Meissner promised a 40% increase in agents and 
resources along the border. . . . "While the attorney general and the 
commissioner did not say everything I wanted to hear, they said enough to make 
me feel that some of my longstanding concerns over illegal immigration are 
closer to being addressed," Gallegly said.

NORTH, SOUTH YEMEN SOLDIERS CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Yemeni soldiers were killed or wounded in fierce clashes between 
northern and southern troops at a joint military camp near the capital, 
southern authorities and Western diplomats said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But northern security officials put the casualty toll much lower -- at dozens 
killed and hundreds wounded.The conflicting estimates could not immediately be 
reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting has flared over the last two days at a camp about 40 miles north of 
this capital, where both sides have military posts. The clash was the nearest 
to the capital since sporadic military confrontations began in February between 
troops loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh of the north and Vice President 
Ali Salim Bidh of the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The battles in the impoverished Red Sea nation threaten to unravel a nearly 
four-year union of the conservative north and the formerly Marxist south. 
Merging of the two countries' armies -- one of the last steps of the 
unification process -- has not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heart of the capital, Deputy Prime Minister Hassan Mohammed Makki, a 
prominent figure from northern Yemen, survived an assassination attempt 
Thursday, but three of his aides were killed, the Interior Ministry said.

BIOCHEMIST GIVES $24 MILLION TO UC SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A biochemist famous for his pioneering work in gene splicing has donated $24 
million to UC San Francisco, setting a record for the largest gift by an 
individual to any of the nine UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation was made by Herbert W. Boyer, a professor emeritus at UC San 
Francisco and co-founder of Genentech Inc., a leading biotechnology company in 
south San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of Boyer's gift reflects the . . . principle that strong 
institutions with proven track records are magnets for philanthropic support," 
UC San Francisco Chancellor Joseph B. Martin said in a statement announcing the 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer's contribution was sought under a six-year UC San Francisco fund-raising 
campaign that began in 1990. The campaign, which has raised almost 60% of its 
$533-million goal, was launched to offset cuts in federal funding for 
biomedical research. It marks the first campuswide appeal for private support 
in the university's 130-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer, 57, of Mill Valley, is one of two scientists credited with a watershed 
in biomedical research that forms the foundation of today's burgeoning 
biotechnology industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Boyer and Stanley N. Cohen of Stanford University discovered ways to 
transplant genes from one living cell to another. Working collaboratively but 
in separate laboratories, they later developed the underlying scientific 
techniques for genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The many outgrowths of their discovery have become health care staples, 
including genetically engineered insulin, human growth hormone, the hepatitis B 
vaccine and drugs for conditions ranging from heart attacks to multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer's donation comes from proceeds he earned from patent rights to the 
gene-splicing process. The $24 million represents his share of proceeds over a 
17-year period that will end in 1997. The money is earmarked for biomedical 
research.

RON HARRIS: THE RIOTS HELPED NO ONE -- EXCEPT THE WELL-PLACED FEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Harris 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damien wasn't doing much better than the last time I saw him. He and his wife 
are still struggling to hold their family together in a tiny one-bedroom 
apartment. The furniture looks as worn as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are still hard to come by. Damien works part time as security guard, the 
same position he held when I met him two years ago. He had hoped for better by 
now, but his training at a technical school hasn't really drawn anything. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Damien, who is 22, shortly after the riot/rebellion/uprising. It was my 
job to interview people who had actually participated in the riots, which 
erupted exactly two years ago today. In their rage, Damien and a friend had 
burned down a liquor store on West Boulevard near the corner of Hyde Park 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 I had stopped by his apartment to thank him for helping me become a columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in offices across the city are black and brown people who have been 
promoted, rewarded or had their stature elevated because folks like Damien 
hurled a bottle through a window, burned down a building, looted a store or 
otherwise wreaked havoc on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a cruel paradox, summed up most aptly in that old Billie Holiday lyric: 
"Them that got shall get."  
</P>
<P>
 The recipients are smart people, talented men and women who have already 
achieved a measure of success based on skill, education and drive. Ask them 
about the riots, about the violence and they will condemn it. Nothing good, 
they will tell you, can come out of such acts. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, there they sit, new titles, new job responsibilities, fatter 
paychecks because brothers got crazy and tried to burn down the town. And 
because they lit a match, white folks got nervous (and perhaps conscious and 
compassionate) and they figured they needed to change their way of doing 
business. So, they found us. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Joe Naphier for example. Two years ago, Joe Naphier, then a human 
resources manager on a McDonnell Douglas commercial airline project, stood on 
the executive floors with company President Robert Hood and watched the city 
burn. Hood was disturbed by what he saw. He wanted to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men talked. Two months later, Naphier, who had been with the company 
for 14 years and was then the only black general manager, was named to head a 
diversity committee. Four months later, he was promoted to ombudsman, a 
position last held by a company vice president. He got a nice raise as the 
first black face ever in that sensitive position at the company. Naphier has no 
problems telling you that the riots are the reason he's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Bernard Kinsey, recently departed co-chairman of Rebuild L.A. 
Kinsey was no slouch before he got to RLA. He had been a Xerox vice president 
for 10 years, supervising some 3,000 employees before he left to start his own 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 But outside of a relatively small arena, he was little known. Thanks to RLA, 
Kinsey has become a player, hobnobbing with all the town's decision makers. 
Newspapers like the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times and others asked him 
to write opinion pieces. He was a guest of the governments of Germany, England 
and France to discuss matters of race. Plus he got paid to the tune of 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an unbelievable experience," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Times, George Ramos, a Latino reporter, and I were approached to become 
columnists a few months after the riots. The editor thought the paper could use 
some new voices -- particularly black and Latino. There's also a bunch of 
minority reporters over at The Times' new, weekly City Times section who can 
thank the riots for their positions. That section had been on hold for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin A. Holden says that he was hired as a reporter by the Wall Street 
Journal "as a direct result of the riots." He says he had applied there a year 
before the unrest and was told nothing was available. After the riots, however, 
the paper created a special beat for him covering race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 And what has come to those who felt so alienated that they took to the 
streets? Very little. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the unfortunate reality," says Danny Bakewell, president of 
Brotherhood Crusade and another recipient. "The people who needed something 
haven't been the ones to get the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, it's people like myself, (the Rev.) Chip Murray, Maxine (Waters), 
the people at Rebuild L.A., we've all benefited. It's not that we didn't have 
some persona before, but all these things empowered us even more. The question 
is, what do you do with that? What have you done for the brothers lately? 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that a lot of people won't even acknowledge that they owe 
those people a debt of gratitude. Many of them will say that I was always Mr. 
Wonderful, I was always going to become a columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge," Bakewell says, "is to have the people on the street become 
more of a beneficiary. That is the challenge for us all. Unless people come to 
grips with that, it's going to breed more and more of what we've already been 
through."

 This is our, uh, life: We mentioned that actor Randy Quaid visited us to 
prepare for his role as a columnist in "The Paper." Imagine our delight, then, 
when we saw Quaid portrayed on the screen as a slovenly, boozing, dyspeptic 
writer in the habit of firing off a gun in the newsroom and sleeping in his 
boss's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Who says Hollywood doesn't reflect reality? 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, we should point out that we actually sleep at home. For one 
thing, the editors' offices at The Times are now locked at night. 
</P>
<P>
 A former colleague of ours was partly responsible for this security measure. 
He was an impoverished worker on the night shift who secretly sacked out in an 
editor's office to save the price of rent. The arrangement was exposed one 
morning when our colleague -- we'll call him Gordon Vincent -- yelled at a 
janitor who had the temerity to wake him up. Vincent was fired. But not 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone later put up a sign in the editor's office where he had slept. It 
said, "Just think -- if you were Gordon Vincent, you'd be home now." 
</P>
<P>
 Instructions that are a breeze: We suspect that the authors of the "Emergency 
Procedures Guidelines" publication at Chaffey College included the section on 
"Wind" to see if anyone was paying attention. (The rest of the booklet is 
written in a serious vein.) On the other hand, noted Carol Olson, a spokesman 
for the Rancho Cucamonga school, "We do get some strong winds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least they haven't posted border guards: A newspaper columnist far from 
here is lamenting the influx of Angelenos in the wake of our disasters. So 
worried is Don Digilio that he urged the Chamber of Commerce to "stop promoting 
the plus things" of his fair city and "get into some of the negatives." 
</P>
<P>
 And where is this paradise -- Carmel? Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
 Paris, France? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's that haven of tacky architecture, compulsive gamblers, 110-degree 
days . . . and, oh, we could go on forever about Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the beef: McDonald's Corp. has ignored pleas from both President 
Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson to reopen its landmark stand in Downey. Nor have 
petitions signed by thousands of people moved it to save the 40-year-old 
eatery, with its original symbol, Speedee the Chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if it makes the beleaguered corporation feel any better, we received a 
note supporting the McDonald's closure. And the letter writer, Peter Carltock 
of Burbank, added that millions of others agree with him. Still, we don't think 
McDonald's will be eager to promote his position.

 The 21 years between the deaths of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon 
represent the longest period without a President dying in America in more than 
160 years. The only longer duration was the period between the deaths of George 
Washington (1799) and John Adams and Thomas Jefferson (both on July 4, 1826).

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; RIDE THERAPY CENTER PLANS FUND-RAISER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual horse trail fund-raiser for the Fran Joswick Therapeutic Riding 
Center will be held on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 It's an opportunity to experience the scenic trails of San Juan Capistrano on 
horseback and help out the Joswick Center, which uses horses in a therapy 
program designed to help people recover from debilitating injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The program starts at 8:30 a.m. and will also feature art, food and game 
booths, as well as refreshments. People wishing to take a trail ride during the 
fund-raiser must reserve them by calling (714) 240-8441. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Powers, an on-air personality for radio KIK-FM, will present awards to 
horse show winners and sign autographs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The center is at 
26282 Oso Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is a major fund-raiser for the Joswick Center, a nonprofit group 
that survives largely through the generosity of South County communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The center gives children and adults, some of whom use wheelchairs, a chance 
to be lifted onto the back of a horse and learn basic riding techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Center officials say the horse rides are an important therapy tool that has 
helped many physically challenged people in its 16 years of existence. FRANK

SUPPORT GROUPS ARE IMPORTANT TO RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "In Sickness and in Health" (April 7): As more and more American women come 
to suffer from breast cancer it is increasingly important for the media to 
cover it, and I appreciate your attempt to raise some of the difficult social 
issues surrounding it. I also appreciated your trying to accentuate the 
positive and to highlight loving, supportive men. 
</P>
<P>
 But by emphasizing the positive to the extent that you did, you didn't really 
convey the need for support groups. One problem, as you acknowledged, is that 
no man is going to admit breasts are a crucially important part of his 
relationship with his significant other. But women realize this to be true in 
many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed all the women in your article, in spite of their supporting 
husbands, went through the painful, extended and expensive process of breast 
reconstruction. Do women for whom a relationship with a man is very important 
have reconstruction more often than other women? Statistics on this would be 
useful.  
</P>
<P>
 I know my roommate in the hospital when I had my mastectomy -- a married woman 
with two grown sons -- had opted for reconstruction because the three men in 
her life wanted her to have it. They did it out of love for her -- they 
couldn't imagine that she would be happy without a reconstruction -- but I got 
the strong impression that the reconstruction was so painful and difficult that 
she would never have done it if she was single.

 I would like to tell you of another source of great help. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago and we both went to the 
Wellness Community in Redondo Beach. She attended a group for newly diagnosed 
breast cancer women and I attended a support group for family members. We were 
both greatly helped by the group experience. These groups were led by qualified 
and caring leaders. There is no charge for participants.

NO NEW AGE GROUP, NO PARTICULAR CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Feb. 20 View section, there was an article entitled "Eyes on a Cosmic 
Prize" which contained misinformation about John-Roger, spiritual director of 
the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 John-Roger is not a "new age leader."Our church does not consider itself a 
"new age" church. The Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness is an 
ecumenical church that presents a new look at ancient spiritual philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 John-Roger does not have a "cause." He has a wide range of life experiences 
that many people find valuable as reference points for learning how to live a 
happy, joyful, peaceful life that is focused on sharing, loving and being of 
service. He does not have a foundation in Santa Monica.

 I thoroughly disagree with Margaret Echevarria's letter saying that staying 
home with children is "the single most disempowering decision women make" 
(April 12).

 As a career woman who is taking off five years to stay at home, I can tell 
you, it is very empowering to take control of my life and the lives of my young 
children.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; '90S-STYLE 'ZENTREPRENEURS' AND THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS 
OF CAPITALISM; THE HEART AROUSED: POETRY AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE SOUL IN 
CORPORATE AMERICA BY DAVID WHYTE ; DOUBLEDAY $22.50, 304 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At long last, American business seems to have bid a not-so-fond farewell to 
Gordon Gekko, that embodiment of '80s capitalism, who proclaimed "Greed Is 
Good" in Oliver Stone's movie "Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent spate of management books suggests a new breed of business people, 
the "zentrepreneur," is storming the corporate citadel of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised on the idealism of the '60s, disillusioned with the materialism of the 
'80s but sobered by the failure of socialism that has become so unmistakable in 
the '90s, these zentrepreneurs have been moved to concoct a kinder, gentler 
sort of capitalism.  
</P>
<P>
 Their leaders range from Mel and Patricia Ziegler -- whose 1992 book, "The 
Republic of Tea," described how these self-titled "Ministers of Leaves and 
Enchantment," respectively, created a successful San Francisco tea company -- 
to Vice President Gore. In his 1992 book "Earth in the Balance," Gore argued 
idealistically, if improbably, that it is profitable to bless the beasts and 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a bizarre marriage, capitalism and Zen, for the former is obsessed with 
doing and the latter with being. But in this elegantly written book, 
English-born poet David Whyte almost brings it off. 
</P>
<P>
 He writes not explicitly about Zen but about the Zen-like concepts of mostly 
Western poets. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditionally fractious relationship between poetry and business is 
perhaps best symbolized by the scroungy Elizabethan bard in Virginia Woolf's 
novel "Orlando" who scoffs at a nobleman's attempt to compose verse. Whyte, 
nevertheless, manages to find celebrations of the workaday world even in the 
writings of Bohemians and iconoclasts who have always regarded "company" as a 
four-letter word.  
</P>
<P>
 Whyte, who makes his own living teaching poetry to corporate America, flatters 
business people by rhetorically situating them in the "upper world . . . the 
material, light-filled portion of existence"; poets he consigns to "the dark 
and subterranean cave of the soul."  
</P>
<P>
 There are many good reasons, of course, why American managers prefer to keep 
soulful feelings in caves and out of the office, and Whyte, to his credit, 
acknowledges some of them.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Koreans and the Japanese are not great readers of Jungian psychology and 
will have another product on the shelves before we have surfaced for air," he 
writes. "The relief from other people's emotional burdens in a professional 
environment can be refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Whyte argues, however, that if managers expect their employees to "respond 
with personal artistry to the confusion of global market change," then they 
simply cannot afford to keep the soul subterranean. They need its creativity 
and thus must attend to its fears and desires (e.g., the "unresolved 
parent-child relationships that play out in rigid company hierarchies"). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Whyte's understanding is limited by his apparent inexperience with the 
actual nature of office life. His description of how everyday tasks can be 
transcendent, for instance, is so romantic that one suspects he has not toiled 
much at those tasks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifting our fingers over the computer keyboard to write a memo, we 
unconsciously play out the continuing drama of universal existence. A small 
eddy in the vast river of events, our quickly written memo is a small 
perturbation on the edge of a vast system, about to change everything or 
nothing. Every action taken, from the moment we switch off the alarm clock in 
the morning to the way we write a line of poetry or design a product, has the 
potential to change the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Whyte's tips on how we can work more soulfully do not acknowledge 
the compromises that are arguably necessary to help the corporate wheels turn 
smoothly. He glorifies the manager, for instance, who announces at a board 
meeting that the boss's idea is a "zero" on a scale of 1 to 10. And he quotes 
Rilke: "Where I am folded in upon myself, there I am a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Like pop theologian Thomas Moore, whose generous blurbs adorn both the front 
and back covers of this book, Whyte situates soulful conflicts entirely within 
the realm of the individual, not between the individual and social forces like 
capitalism or companies. The "veritable San Andreas fault in the modern 
American psyche," he writes, is between the power-loving "personality" and the 
experience-loving "soul."  
</P>
<P>
 But given that human nature seems inclined to "be" in the present, while 
corporate nature seems compelled to "do" for the future, perhaps it would be 
more realistic to define that fault line as running between the power-loving 
company and the experience-loving person .

 PRESIDENTIAL VIEWS: Jack Kemp was here this week for the solemn occasion of 
the Richard Nixon funeral. But he was available for politicking too. Kemp, a 
strong contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 1996, appeared on 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton's cable talk show -- to first air on Saturday. . . 
. Kemp's thoughts on President Clinton's health care plans: "He has his 
right-turn signal on, but he's turning left." And on Nixon: A great leader, but 
"he was flawed in his approach to his enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 DYNAMITE MURDER CASE: It was the most notorious murder trial of 1947: 
18-year-old Beulah Louise Overell (now deceased) and her fiance George Gollum, 
21, were acquitted in the murders of her Newport Beach parents. . . . 
Prosecutors alleged they covered up the murders by dynamiting the victims' 
yacht. Now international photographer Lewis Baltz, who grew up in Newport 
Beach, has written "The Deaths in Newport," an illustrated book about the 
trial. The book will be published next month in France, with a text in English 
and French. 
</P>
<P>
 DOLLAR DIALING: Gov. Pete Wilson may be behind in the polls, but he still has 
many friends in Orange County. Christine Diemer, executive director of the 
Building Industry Assn., has put together one of the year's largest 
private-home fund-raisers for Wilson next week -- 40 people at $1,000 each, 
plus similar donations from 10 who can't make it. . . . Says Diemer: "To me, 
there is just no question that something is different (with the economy); 
there's more discretionary money." 
</P>
<P>
 POSITIVE JOE: Dodgers Quiz: They had the elite pitching staff of the 1960s 
with starters like Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Bill Singer and Don Sutton -- 
but who was the fifth starter?. . . . For part of those years it was Joe 
Moeller, who is still associated with the Dodgers. . . . Today he's at the 
Orange YMCA's fifth annual "Public Awareness" luncheon at Chapman University. 
He'll talk about positive ways local leaders can help young people.

<P>
 -- Reason No. 2 why the Raiders should not move to Orlando: Temptation by 
locals to rename team the Orlando Raider, singular. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reason No. 3 why the Raiders should not move to Orlando: We need four NFL 
teams in Florida like we need three more oil spills in Alaska.

 -- Reason No. 4 why the Raiders should not move to Orlando: Only 
skulls-and-crossbones there found on "Pirates of the Caribbean" ride.

have evidence that they are the same man!  
</P>
<P>
 -- Everybody sit back now and enjoy the first of many Tonya-Nancy movies of 
the week. In Part I, Harding and Kerrigan give up their jobs as rangers and 
leave their small town in Texas to lead a big cattle drive up to Montana.

 -- Sorry, you waited too long. Those UCLA vs. Wisconsin 1995 and 1996 Rose 
Bowl tickets have already been snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The previously undetected heart condition of Evander Holyfield is one more 
reason why that clown with the parachute could be serving time now for

 -- Michael Moorer winning the heavyweight champion of the world is itself

 -- In Part II of their movie of the week, Tonya and Nancy go back to Africa to 
search for their roots, then shoot J.R. Ewing and nuke a small town in Kansas. 
We're talking big ratings here.

 -- Phil Rizzuto and Harry Caray should call the Kentucky Derby and take turns 
yelling, "Holy Bull!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Buffalo Sabres beat the New Jersey Devils in four overtimes. I checked 
something in my NHL rule book. After five overtimes, a game is decided by which 
team has the most teeth.

 -- Turns out that all the Kings needed to win a Stanley Cup was for the

</P>
<P>
 -- If New York wins two in a row, look for a wild party next year at Gov. 
Stern's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Part III, Tonya and Nancy meet a strange creature in the woods who keeps 
saying, "Phone home! Phone home!" Then they are taken by a scarecrow and 
cowardly lion to Oz, where they are eaten by a giant shark. We're talking big, 
BIG ratings here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Well, I can't say anything about the White Sox, but I have gotten a good 
look at the Cubs. For them, Michael Jordan could bat cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sorry, you waited too long again. Now those 1997 UCLA-Wisconsin tickets are 
gone, too.

ORIOLES' REVENGE IS SWEET; ANGELS: FERNANDEZ ANSWERS PREVIOUS NIGHT'S BEANING 
WITH SHARP PITCHING IN BALTIMORE'S 4-2 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sid Fernandez toyed with the idea of vengeance Thursday night, thinking about 
sending a few Angel batters to the dirt and maybe purposely hitting a couple 
for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he retaliated by pitching one of the finest games of his career, 
enabling the Baltimore Orioles to walk away smugly into the night with a 4-2 
victory over the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want me to do, start a war?" Fernandez said. "What happened last 
night is last night. This is a different day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to get revenge is by winning the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez stymied the Angels in front of 16,415 at Anaheim Stadium, giving up 
three hits in 8 1/3 innings. He then stepped aside for Lee Smith, who needed 
only three pitches to record his major league leading 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, making only his third start since coming back from biceps 
tendinitis, yielded a second-inning homer to Chili Davis, a bunt single to Chad 
Curtis in the fourth and did not allow another hit until Curtis' one-out homer 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as good a game that's been pitched against us this year," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said. "El Sid had pretty good stuff, and we helped him a 
lot by swinging at a lot of bad pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles (14-7), who stayed within half a game of Boston in the American 
League East, would have actually preferred to do their damage Thursday against 
Angel reliever Scott Lewis when he entered the game in the seventh. Lewis hit 
Oriole catcher Chris Hoiles in the head Wednesday night, but said Thursday that 
he was sorry for the accidental pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I wasn't trying to pitch inside," 
Lewis said. "But I was not trying to hit him. Part of the plate is mine too; I 
have to pitch inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got hit, I thought, 'Oh geez, I hurt him really bad.' Believe me, I'm 
not there trying to hit anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to think about my team, and I'm not trying to pluck one of those 
guys in the head knowing my teammates have got to come to bat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (9-14), who were ripped for 17 runs and 29 hits in their two-game 
sweep, now appear ready to shake up their pitching staff. They have lost six of 
their last seven games and nine of their last 12, falling into third place in 
the anemic American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dopson (1-3, 6.00 earned-run average), who yielded seven hits and four 
earned runs in six innings, probably will be the first casualty in the 
rotation. The Angels privately decided that Dopson will be moved to the 
bullpen. Joe Magrane, who will make his final rehabilitative start Saturday for 
triple-A Vancouver, will replace Dopson in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since opening day, he's been taking steps backward," Rodgers said. "You have 
to consider him for the bullpen, but I don't know how his arm will respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dopson, who pitched six games in relief last season for the Red Sox: 
"It's best for me not to comment. Except for one bad inning, I didn't think I 
did bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran starting pitcher John Farrell, who started Thursday for Vancouver, 
probably will remain in the minors until the Angels make a determination on 
starter Phil Leftwich. If Leftwich (0-3, 7.15 ERA) struggles tonight against 
Boston, he might be replaced by Farrell in the rotation. The Angels also are 
contemplating using Mark Leiter as a bullpen stopper, but Leiter has been 
effective as a starter with a 2-1 record and 4.50 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to keep shuttling people back and forth," Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi said. "If we make a move, we'd like it to be permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Lewis' regrets, the Orioles were still complaining about the pitch 
that nailed Hoiles, saying it was a purpose pitch, vowing there will be 
retaliation before the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see those guys somewhere down the road," Oriole starting pitcher Ben 
McDonald said. "I don't care what they say; there was no doubt in my mind he 
was throwing at him. It was that obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oriole Manager Johnny Oates: "I hope all those brave souls think what the 
consequences are if they ever hit somebody in the temple and he doesn't get up. 
It's easy to be brave 60 feet away." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoiles was unable to play Thursday. He is expected to return to the lineup 
tonight, but he remained angry at Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to hit somebody, you don't hit somebody in the head," Hoiles 
said. "Throwing inside is part of the game, I understand that, but not at that 
height. To hit me where he did is uncalled for."

NBA PLAYOFFS; HAWKS' ADVANTAGE OVER HEAT SHORT-LIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a season-long race, with a four-week sprint to the finish, and Atlanta 
finally edged out New York and Chicago for the best record in the Eastern 
Conference and home-court advantage in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Hawks blew the edge in the first playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Rice got the screen he needed from John Salley, broke free across the 
lane and tipped in a basket to help the Miami Heat get its first playoff 
victory ever, 93-88 over the Hawks on Thursday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't hard at all," Rice said of the tip that gave Miami a 90-87 lead 
with 32 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice added two free throws 20 seconds later to stretch the lead to 92-87. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Miami a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat held Atlanta without a field goal in the final seven minutes and 
erased a 77-69 deficit in the final 10 minutes. It was Miami's first victory at 
Atlanta after 11 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks won their last seven home games in the regular season and had a 36-5 
record at the Omni going into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta took an 11-point lead in the game's first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out with a lot of intensity at the beginning, and I thought we stayed 
up defensively," Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "Then, all of a sudden, we 
seemed not to be up as much. We allowed them to get too many second shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 89, Orlando 88 -- The Magic's first playoff game ever was derailed by 
a playoff veteran when the Pacers' Byron Scott made a three-point shot with two 
seconds to play at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott scored on Indiana's fourth shot in one trip downcourt after Shaquille 
O'Neal's rebound tip put Orlando ahead, 88-86, with 25 seconds to go. Rik Smits 
missed a 12-foot jump shot, Derrick McKey missed a tip inside and Reggie Miller 
misfired on a three-pointer before Scott made his game-winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I wanted it to be a three or nothing," said Scott, a member of 
three Laker champions in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller led Indiana with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 106, Utah 89 -- David Robinson scored 25 points and the Spurs, 0-5 
against Utah in the regular season, routed the Jazz at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone's 36 points weren't enough to keep the Jazz in contention, and he 
was the only Utah player to score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams will meet Saturday for Game 2 of their best-of-five series with 
an undercurrent of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5:29 to play, San Antonio Coach John Lucas angrily benched Dennis Rodman 
after Rodman swung his arms at Lucas following Rodman's brief tangle with 
Utah's Bryon Russell. A technical foul was called on Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 106, Denver 82 -- Detlef Schrempf scored 21 points and Gary Payton 20 
as the SuperSonics opened a 25-point halftime lead in winning at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets, back in the playoffs after a four-year absence, lost their 10th 
consecutive playoff game.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; TORONTO RINGS DOWN CURTAIN IN CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was closing night at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toronto Maple Leafs ended a 65-year era with a 1-0 victory over the 
Blackhawks on Thursday night, clinching their first-round Western Conference 
playoff series, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It sends the Maple Leafs into the conference semifinals and ends the season 
and tenancy in the venerable arena for Chicago, which moves into a new building 
across the street next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Potvin stopped 27 shots as Toronto won a 1-0 game for the third time in 
the series. Mike Gartner had the only goal on a deflection in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime it's a 1-0 game, you've got to feel good about yourself," said 
Potvin, who had two of his three shutouts in the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy about the way I played in this series. Hopefully we'll keep it 
going next series. I don't want to play 60 games like this, but it's fun. Five 
of the six games were decided by one goal. It's always like this in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto killed two Chicago power plays in the opening period, the second when 
Potvin made five saves, once smothering Joe Murphy's rebound shot right in 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs went on a power play after Chicago was called for having too 
many men on the ice. Gartner was in front of the goal and deflected in Dave 
Ellett's shot from just inside the blue line with 5:11 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went in right off my leg," Gartner said. "I got in front of the net and it 
went in off me. I've made a lot better shots than that this series that haven't 
gone in the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 7, San Jose 1 -- Goals by Sergei Fedorov, Steve Chiasson, Ray Sheppard 
and Vyacheslav Kozlov in the first period and Steve Yzerman in the second gave 
the Red Wings a 5-0 lead and they coasted in Detroit to tie the series, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Ciccarelli scored in the second and third periods for the Red Wings, 
giving him five goals in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit, which had the best record in the Western Conference and the 
fourth-best in the NHL, will play host to the seventh and deciding game 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 3, Calgary 2 -- Trevor Linden scored with less than four minutes 
left in overtime at Vancouver to enable the Canucks to tie their Western 
Conference series, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames' Wes Walz, who had 11 goals during the regular season, scored his 
third goal of the series at 3:24 of the third period to tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 7 is at Calgary on Saturday.

GOLF ROUNDUP; MAGEE CAN'T FAULT GREENS AFTER HIS 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrew Magee could have been among those complaining about the greens in 
Thursday's first round of the Houston Open at The Woodlands. He didn't because 
he was too busy making seven birdie putts in a round of seven-under 65 that 
gave him a one-shot lead over Bob Gilder and Dave Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Mast, Steve Elkington and Mike Heinen each finished strong to share 
fourth at 67. 
</P>
<P>
 There were complaints about some of the greens, damaged weeks ago when a 
non-golf course herbicide got into the irrigation reservoir used to water them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Magee couldn't knock the greens at The Woodlands' TPC course. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're putting good," said Magee, who won the Northern Telcom Open in 
January for the fourth victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilder made the first run of the day with his 66, and he could have been the 
leader if he had not bogeyed his final two holes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Dibos, a Peruvian who has won only $2,311 on the LPGA tour this season, 
birdied her final three holes to shoot a six-under 66 and take the first-round 
lead in the $1.2-million Sprint Championship on the Indigo Lakes Golf Resort at 
Daytona Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Dibos recorded seven birdies with only one bogey to take a one-stroke lead 
over England's Trish Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dibos, 34, has never won a professional event with her best finish a second 
place at the 1992 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's 67 stood up most of the day before Dibos finished in the windy 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaia Arruti, a former Spanish amateur champion and tour rookie, was in a pack 
at 68. Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez, winless this year, was at 70.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: HEALY'S NOT READY TO SAY: 'I'VE GOT TO GET OFF THE 
AIR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it true? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Healy, a Los Angeles institution for 43 years, might have done his last 
live radio show Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC's new owners take over the station Monday, and Healy isn't part of their 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy, a listening habit for so many people over the years, is still holding 
out hope for somewhere else, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a meeting early next week that could lead to something," he said. "I'd 
rather not discuss it because it's rather sensitive right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Healy started at KMPC in 1951, writing for the late Bob Kelley, and was there 
for 10 years. He returned in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The side trips in between included two stints at KLAC and seven years in 
television with Channel 7 in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 For his last KMPC show, Healy didn't get overly nostalgic. He simply played 
some memorable tapes, and then signed off by saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, effective Monday, KMPC will have new ownership, 
management, and programming. So in signing off tonight, I want to say what a 
delight it's been to work with Bill Ward, Gene and Jackie Autry and so many 
other really class people here at KMPC for the past nearly 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 And then he played a song by Vera Lynn that was featured in the movie, "Dr. 
Strangelove," entitled "We'll Meet Again." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add KMPC: The station has carried the Rams since 1946, the year they moved to 
Los Angeles from Cleveland, and probably will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were close to announcing a deal last week with Capital Cities, KMPC's 
new owners, before negotiations hit a snag. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem might be money. According to sources, the Rams got $2.5 million 
for last season from KMPC, which lost about $2 million on the deal. Capital 
Cities reportedly is willing to pay only about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now word is that Niederlander Sports Marketing, which holds the radio rights 
to the Raiders, has become involved and will share in some of the losses or 
profits. But still no announcement from the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, meanwhile, expect to stay on KMPC. Their contract with the 
station has two years left. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is leaving KMPC and is expected to announce a deal with XTRA. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The highlight of ESPN's NFL draft coverage last Sunday was Bill Tobin lighting 
into "expert" Mel Kiper Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Tobin, the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, 
said, "Who is Mel Kiper?" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, that isn't a bad question. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiper is a 33-year-old football fanatic who grew up in the Baltimore area. By 
the time he was 14, he figured he would someday be a coach or scout. He played 
baseball in high school, but was always obsessed with football. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, he began putting out a newsletter about draft prospects. Today, he has 
a small publishing company in the Baltimore suburb of Jarrettsville, Md., that 
consists of himself, his wife, Kim, and a secretary. Kiper puts out seven 
annual publications -- a draft preview, a draft report, a draft review, three 
newsletters and his newest one, a free-agent report. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiper first became nationally known in 1984 when, at 23, he was hired by ESPN 
as a researcher, but ended up on the air. He has worked every draft since. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday wasn't the first time he has drawn the ire of NFL types. Mike Hickey, 
former player personnel director for the New York Jets, wasn't too pleased with 
Kiper in 1989 when Kiper criticized the Jets for making linebacker Jeff Lageman 
the 14th selection overall, rather than trading down to pick up additional 
draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday's outburst by Tobin, prompted by Kiper's criticism of the Colts for 
bypassing quarterback Trent Dilfer, was the topper. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Bill Tobin did was let me get under his skin," Kiper said. "He showed a 
lot of insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I was saying was that the Colts made the move to get in position to take 
Dilfer, then fumbled the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Tobin had class, he should have said, 'He's entitled to his opinion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended viewing: Sometimes it is possible to turn back the clock. And what 
a great idea to bring back "Shell's Wonderful World of Golf." 
</P>
<P>
 The second installment of the new show will be on Channel 7 and most other ABC 
stations Saturday at 1 p.m. (San Diego's Channel 10 will show it at noon.) It 
features Jack Nicklaus against Arnold Palmer in a medal-play round taped this 
month at the Pinehurst No. 2 course in North Carolina, site of this summer's 
U.S. Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old shows, the participants shared a purse of $7,000. But now the 
winner gets $100,000, the loser $50,000. That's not a lot of money by today's 
standards, but producer Terry Jastrow of Jack Nicklaus Productions has had no 
problem lining up players. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples and Raymond Floyd played in the first segment, which was shown 
April 9. This year's third and final show will pit Greg Norman against Nick 
Faldo at Sunningdale outside London. It will be shown July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Jastrow said the plan, beginning next year, is to do seven or eight shows a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good idea: Turner Broadcasting and the NBA have gone to a new format in which 
both TBS and TNT are televising weeknight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to decide when to switch from game to game," said Don McGuire, senior 
vice president and executive producer for Turner Sports. "Now viewers make the 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS and the NCAA should try such a system with the early rounds of the NCAA 
tournament.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WITH COOPER HITTING, RED SOX ARE WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Cooper calls April 12 his starting point, and he's on a ride he hopes 
won't end. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper homered and doubled to drive in all of Boston's runs in a 4-1 victory 
over the Athletics on Thursday at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the Athletics' 10th in a row, the longest streak of futility in 
Oakland in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who has six homers after hitting nine all last season, has been on a 
tear since hitting for the cycle April 12 at Kansas City, going 17 for 42 
(.405). He has helped carry Boston to a club-record 15 victories in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night I hit for the cycle was the night I turned things around," Cooper 
said. "I just was really able to relax and opened my stance up a little bit. It 
opened up the whole plate to me. I was able to turn on the inside pitch and 
reach the outside pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston also got a strong outing from Danny Darwin (4-1), who gave up seven 
hits, struck out seven and walked none in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Cleveland 3 -- Wilson Alvarez won his 12th consecutive decision and 
Robin Ventura drove in four runs with two singles for the White Sox at 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago won its 13th game, matching the franchise-best April total set last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 All four runs driven in by Ventura were unearned because of two Cleveland 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (5-0) is 12-0 in 13 starts since losing to Oakland last Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Manny Ramirez drove in all three Cleveland runs with a two-run home run 
in the fourth inning, his sixth of the year and third in as many days, and a 
single in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 13, Detroit 4 -- Consecutive errors by Chad Kreuter and Travis 
Fryman led to four unearned runs in the fourth inning as the Royals won at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Belcher (0-4) gave up 10 runs -- five earned -- and 10 hits in four 
innings. In 21 2/3 innings, he has allowed 19 walks and 38 hits and has an 
earned-run average of 9.55. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Appier (2-2) gave up Cecil Fielder's 426-foot home run in the third 
inning but raised his record against the Tigers to 8-1.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas 1, Toronto 0 -- Kevin Brown scattered 10 hits over eight innings and 
induced four groundball double plays as the Rangers made a first-inning run 
hold up at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown (1-4) handed the Blue Jays their first shutout since June 30, a 103-game 
span. Tom Henke, despite giving up an inning-opening double to Carlos Delgado 
in the ninth, pitched out of the jam for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had entered the game with a 10.86 ERA, having given up 58 hits, 
including seven homers, in 29 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 12, Minnesota 2 -- John Jaha hit two home runs and Turner Ward 
homered and drove in three runs to lead the Brewers at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee, which was no-hit by the Twins' Scott Erickson on Wednesday, ended a 
20-inning scoreless drought with a run off Carlos Pulido (0-3) in the third 
inning on Ward's RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 6, New York 0 -- Mariner rookies Roger Salkeld and Tim Davis combined 
on a three-hitter at Seattle and Tino Martinez had three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Salkeld (1-0) gave up two hits in 6 2/3 innings for his first major league 
victory. Davis, who entered the game in the seventh, finished with 2 1/3 
innings of one-hit relief.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WILLIAMS STILL WILD THING IN ASTROS' 11TH-INNING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Add Terry Collins to the list of managers driven, if not to smoking, at least 
to antacids by relief pitcher Mitch Williams, the Wild Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams put the go-ahead run on base in the 11th inning with a two-out walk 
and gave up another run on a wild pitch in the Astros' 5-3 loss to the Chicago 
Cubs on Thursday night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a control guy," Collins said. "Sometimes he gets himself into jams 
and he doesn't get out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 3-3, in the 11th, Williams (0-2, 6.75 earned-run average) 
walked pinch-hitter Eddie Zambrano, who took third on Steve Buechele's single 
and scored on an infield hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Buechele scored on Williams' wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 19, Pittsburgh 7 -- Hal Morris drove in six runs and Barry Larkin 
followed Erik Hanson's first two major league hits with two-run homers for the 
Reds at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Fernandez homered for the fourth consecutive game as the Reds won their 
eighth in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 8, Colorado 7 -- Alex Arias' bases-loaded single and Ellis Burks' 
error scored three runs to cap a five-run eighth inning for the Marlins at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Andres Galarraga tied a National League record with his 29th RBI in 
April.

 Chuck Finley, who for the first time in his career as a starting pitcher will 
finish the month of April without a victory, was summoned for a private meeting 
Thursday with Angel Manager Buck Rodgers and pitching coach Chuck Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez detected a flaw in Finley's delivery, and they will experiment on 
the side before his next scheduled start May 3 against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a leper pitcher right now," Finley said. "When you pitch like I am, 
nobody wants to be around you." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who has won at least 16 games in four of the last five seasons, is 0-2 
with a 6.42 earned-run average. Most disturbing to Finley, he said, is that the 
Angels are 0-5 in his five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty frustrated right now because I know I'm better than what I'm 
showing," Finley said. "But as long as I'm healthy, and throwing the ball good, 
I've got to think things will turn around."

 Left-handed reliever Ken Patterson will undergo season-ending surgery Tuesday

NUMEROUS HEADS FIELD IN SIX-HORSE DERBY TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
 Numerous, who threw a shoe while running fourth in the Santa Anita Derby, 
heads a six-horse field on opening day Saturday at Churchill Downs in the Derby 
Trial, which hasn't produced a Kentucky Derby winner since Tim Tam in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous is more of a prospect for the May 21 Preakness, the second leg of the 
Triple Crown, than the Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he won by 15 lengths and came back all right, then we might think about 
the Derby," said trainer Charlie Whittingham, whose primary Derby contender is 
Strodes Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, who will be ridden by Chris McCarron on Saturday, is a son of Mr. 
Prospector. He was bought for $1.7 million as a yearling by Howard Keck, whose 
family won the 1986 Derby with Ferdinand. Numerous, one of three million-dollar 
horses sold at auction in 1992, was the year's highest-priced yearling. He ran 
twice last year, breaking his maiden at Santa Anita in November. This year he 
was second to Pollock's Luck and Dramatic Gold in Santa Anita races before his 
fourth-place finish on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Others running in the one-mile Trial are Crary, Exclusive Praline, Tarzan's 
Blade, Dynamic Asset and Camanche Trail. BILL CHRISTINE

 British boxer Bradley Stone died Thursday night, two days after suffering 
brain damage in the ring. He was 23. Stone had surgery Wednesday at Royal 
London Hospital to remove a blood clot on his brain and was put on a 
life-support system. Doctors had held out little hope for a full recovery.

 Stone collapsed at his fiancee's home and slipped into a coma a few hours 
after being stopped in the 10th round of a fight for the British

SURGE IN BOND YIELDS SENDS DOW TUMBLING 31.23 POINTS; MARKETS: INVESTORS ARE 
SPOOKED BY GOVERNMENT REPORT SHOWING INFLATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER ROSE FASTER 
THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields posted one of their biggest one-day rises ever on news 
that a key measure of inflation ran at a surprisingly high rate in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest jump in yields, after nearly a full week in which they had 
declined, dashed hopes for a sustained turnaround in the battered bond market, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond soared to 7.26% on Thursday 
from 7.10% on Tuesday, the last time bonds traded before Wednesday's day of 
mourning for former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' selloff Thursday also clipped the stock market, where the Dow Jones 
industrials fell 31.23 points to 3,668.31. However, broader stock indexes were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said bond yields initially fell Thursday morning, after the government 
reported that the nation's gross domestic product grew at a moderate 2.6% 
annual rate in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That was less than the 3.2% expected by many economists, leading some 
investors to conclude that the economy is weakening -- an environment that 
could allow for lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But digging deeper into the GDP report, investors quickly panicked over the 
first-quarter change in the government's so-called price deflator, a measure of 
inflation throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That index rose at an annual rate of 2.6% in the quarter, higher than expected 
and the biggest gain since 1993's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The deflator number reinforced the idea that the Federal Reserve Board will 
feel compelled to raise short-term interest rates further to fight inflation, 
analysts said. The Fed has already boosted short rates from 3% to 3.75% this 
year, in turn pushing longer-term yields up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Treasuries, the trend is clear in most people's mind. We're going to see 
higher rates," said Reid Smith, a bond fund manager for Vanguard Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed selloff in long-term Treasury bonds spilled into other bond 
markets Thursday, driving yields up on mortgage-backed securities, municipal 
issues and other fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much negative feeling in the market . . . that they (investors) 
just don't want to commit money," said Mark Romano, who manages $500 million at 
First Interstate Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
 News of dismal demand at the Treasury's sale of five-year notes Thursday also 
depressed investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold $11 billion in five-year notes at a top yield of 6.60%. That 
was higher than the 6.56% many market participants had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the weak demand for the notes, the bid-to-cover ratio -- the 
number of bids received to those accepted -- was 2.13 to 1, compared to an 
average of 2.70 in the last 20 such auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond experts fear that the latest negative turn of sentiment in the market 
will drive more small investors out of bond mutual funds, whose share prices 
have been falling as older, fixed-rate bonds are devalued by higher market 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bond fund shares have already lost 5% to 10% of their value so far this 
year. In March, bond fund investors pulled a net $7.7 billion out of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the stock market, the reaction to surging yields was 
surprisingly muted. Losers topped winners by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, but most stock indexes suffered smaller losses than the Dow, and some 
even rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks, for example, edged up 0.36 point to 
251.31. 
</P>
<P>
 But many traders believe stocks will be unable to continue their recent 
rebound without help in the form of stable interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among stocks' highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many financial issues lost ground as interest rates jumped. Morgan Stanley 
dropped 1 7/8 to 61, Citicorp fell 5/8 to 36 3/4, NationsBank sank 7/8 to 51 
1/4 and American International Group slid 2 7/8 to 86. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial issues were also pressured. Caterpillar dropped 1 3/4 to 108 
7/8, Deere shed 1 3/8 to 77 1/2, Alcoa lost 7/8 to 67 7/8 and Bearings lost 3/4 
to 33. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another fall in oil prices weighed on energy stocks. Crude oil futures on 
the New York Merc dropped 34 cents to $16.57 a barrel. Among oil giants, 
Chevron tumbled 2 1/4 to 88 5/8, Mobil dropped 2 1/4 to 77 3/8 and Amoco was 
off 1 to 55 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, some airline stocks were stronger after Delta said it will 
eliminate up to 20% of its work force. Delta gained 1 7/8 to 45 1/4 and USAir 
rose 5/8 to 7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * SciClone Pharmaceuticals and Alpha 1 Biomedical shares lost about two-thirds 
of their value after their hepatitis drug failed to perform better than a 
placebo in clinical tests. SciClone shares closed down 7 9/16 to 5 3/16. Alpha 
fell 4 13/16 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index fell 20.1 points to 3,129.9; Frankfurt's DAX 
index eased 2.35 points to 2,251.22. Tokyo's Nikkei index was off 3.90 points 
at 19,725.25, while Mexico's Bolsa index lost 11.55 points to 2,321.33.

quarter. A1

DAUGHTERS GET A TASTE OF THE 'OFFICE'; CAREERS: THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY, GIRLS -- 
AND A FEW BOYS -- GET A DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW HARD THEIR PARENTS 
WORK.

 Bankers and cops, missile-makers and clerks across Ventura County showed their 
daughters the ropes Thursday on national Take Our Daughters to Work Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide event, first organized last year by the Ms. Foundation for 
Women to give girls ages 9 to 15 a taste of the working world, seems to be 
catching on in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-year-old daughter of a Ventura police officer watched her father 
interview burglary victims and rush to aid a schoolmate who wrecked his 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, a banker's 12-year-old twin daughters helped trace rubber 
checks and load cash into an ATM machine. 
</P>
<P>
 And all over Ventura County, girls -- and a few boys -- were given a day off 
from school to learn how hard their parents work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea to work with people, to see what your parents do," 
said Danielle Will, nearly 14, who visited her mother Renee Will's office at 
the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Port Hueneme. "You can get involved with 
your parents and know what they're doing and, if you like it, you can go for it 
-- you can go out to do it too." 
</P>
<P>
 But after filing contracts, faxing documents and running computer printouts 
all day at the missile installation, Danielle confessed: "I learned that it's 
not fun to work. It's hard. It's confusing if you don't know what you're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Twins Nadia and Nicole Lukiewski agreed that they would not like to work for 
long in their father's Bank of A. Levy branch in Simi Valley -- even though 
they enjoyed helping tellers handle drive-through customers and stack cash in 
the automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like it'd get too tiring if you did it every single day of your 
life, but it might be fun to do it for a little while," Nadia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Nicole: "I think I would like it for a couple years, but I think it'd 
get boring for a while. I want to be a teacher and a writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some girls said they were glad to learn more about their parents' work. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding in a Ventura police car with Officer Tom Randall, 50, Sara Randall 
watched her father take burglary reports, and confiscate marijuana and crack 
that a woman reported finding in her son's jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it might be sort of fun to find out what my dad's really doing 
-- maybe I could be a policewoman some day," said Sara, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, she said: "I think it's great, because 
women haven't really been able to do anything in the last hundred years. I 
guess it's just a good experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Randall agreed. "I think it's important for all kids to know what 
their parents do for a living," he said. "I've enjoyed it. It's fun being with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 At Amgen in Newbury Park, 11-year-old Michelle Porter helped her mother with 
photocopies and faxes, travel requisitions and plane tickets that the clinical 
research associate needs to oversee research into a drug the company is testing 
for the treatment of AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty interesting how they try to help people," said Michelle, 
who approves of Take Our Daughters to Work Day because it can give girls career 
ideas. "I just think it was really neat and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Linda Porter, heard about Take Our Daughters to Work through her 
membership in the National Assn. for Female Executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy that she has a basic understanding of what I do here in the 
group for Amgen," said Porter, 34. "I also hope it will encourage her to pursue 
professional experiences in her career." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, employees held a daylong vocational program for workers who 
brought their daughters to City Hall, presenting lectures by top female 
administrators in city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned all the different jobs and what the employees do," said 13-year-old 
Erin Absmeier, whose mother, Caethe, works as an analyst in the city Personnel 
Department. "It's not the easy work I thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
 But another daughter was more impressed with her mother's profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does a lot of hard work and she has to put up with a lot of people," said 
Sammy Schlag, the 11-year-old daughter of Christine Schlag, the senior 
personnel analyst. "I don't want the job she has when I get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Schlag said of her daughter: "She's been in to work a lot when she 
was little. But I really wanted her to hear the speakers and see what 
opportunities are available to women." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Natalie Kiunke, whose mother, Patty, works as a word processor, 
said she already knows what she wants to do when she grows up: practice law. 
</P>
<P>

FAT CITY; MOVIEGOERS INDULGE TASTY POPCORN HABIT DESPITE THREAT TO HEALTH

 He walked to the movie concession stand, warily eyeing the popcorn bin and its 
hot-buttered temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I should," said Brian Greene of Ventura, shaking his head. 
"It might kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, you eat Big Macs, don't you?" Chris Pendergraft challenged from behind 
the counter at the Buenaventura theaters in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Greene said, hesitating. "Give me a medium. And can I get some extra 
salt on it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Saturated in fatty coconut oil, sopped in butter, movie popcorn remains the 
irresistible big-screen delicacy. Despite media reports this week exposing 
popcorn with a fat content higher than hot dogs and even McDonald's Big Macs, 
moviegoers are still ordering tons of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same thing as when they said barbecuing hamburgers causes cancer," 
Deby Raynor of Oxnard said as she walked away from the concession stand with a 
medium-size bag of popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's talking about it, but we're in denial," said Westlake resident 
Jill Pincus, on her way to a matinee of "Bad Girls" at The Oaks mall in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pincus and a friend, who declined to give her name on the grounds that she did 
not want her doctor to know about her coconut-oil consumption, had already 
purchased dual bags of buttered popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women said they hope that the theater would come out with a "skinny" 
version of popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 That may happen, according to United Artists spokesman Bill Quigley. UA, the 
county's largest theater chain, uses coconut oil to make popcorn in 98% of its 
venues, including the theater at The Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released Monday by the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
identified coconut oil as the chief culprit in the high fat content in movie 
popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy oil leaves enough saturated fat in a small, unbuttered bag of 
popcorn to satisfy the recommended daily allowance for most adults, the 
consumer group reported. Theaters could cut calories by simply using low-fat 
canola oil or even air-popped popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific's Carriage Square Theater in Oxnard is already cooking its popcorn in 
canola oil. The choice was made partly for health reasons and partly for 
convenience, said Milt Moritz, a Pacific vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Canola oil comes in liquid form, packed in easy-to-use bags. Coconut oil often 
arrives in solid chunks and must be melted before it is used. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to offering the canola-popped variety, Pacific Theaters and its 
300 screens statewide plan to make packages of air-popped popcorn available, 
Moritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will definitely have a choice, and it will be interesting to see how it 
goes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quigley said UA would consider making a change if consumers demand it. "We 
take this seriously," he said. "We're keeping track of concerns and interest." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Quigley pointed out, moviegoers have historically come back 
to the staples: popcorn, candy and soda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should be defensive about what we're doing," he said. "We 
don't sell this as health food. It's a snack." 
</P>
<P>
 Some theaters will no doubt continue cooking in coconut oil for a simple 
reason: Fat tastes good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason they use it is because of the taste," said one manager, who did 
not want his name attached to his comments. "That's the reason theater popcorn 
tastes so much better than home-popped popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
 At some theaters, cooking methods are a closely guarded secret. The Century 8 
theaters in Oxnard, for instance, referred all questions about cooking oil to 
corporate headquarters, which referred all questions to the National Assn. of 
Theater Owners. The national group, naturally, had no idea what kind of oil the 
Oxnard venue uses. 
</P>
<P>
 At Buenaventura theaters, one enterprising concessionaire had no shame about 
the coconut-oil kernels he cooks. Pendergraft has even perfected his own 
super-fatty concoction, which he calls gourmet popcorn. It involves obscene 
amounts of butter flavoring and seasoned salt layered throughout the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a taste of heaven," Pendergraft said. "It's probably 15 Big 
Macs, but it's excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 He is not planning to give it up any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take drugs; I don't drink," he said. "I can have popcorn."

2 FORMER CARD CLUB PROMOTERS PLEAD GUILTY; COURTS: THE ONETIME OXNARD CASINO 
PRINCIPALS ADMIT TO MISDEMEANOR POLITICAL MONEY LAUNDERING AND AGREE TO PAY 
FINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former promoters of an Oxnard card casino pleaded guilty Thursday to 
misdemeanor money laundering, the first case by the Ventura County district 
attorney's year-old political corruption unit to end in conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael E. Wooten, 45, of Camarillo and Frank Marasco, 48, of Ventura each 
pleaded guilty to a single count of political money laundering and agreed to 
pay fines of $3,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 They admitted violating state law by making $998 in small contributions 
indirectly to two Oxnard councilmen, one former councilwoman and a state 
assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleas were entered after prosecutors agreed to drop six money-laundering 
charges that each carried a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a 
$10,000 fine. The key allegations in the six counts were incorporated into a 
single remaining count. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial was set to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who discovered the illegal contributions 
while investigating Oxnard card club promoters last spring, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett said the pleas send "a message to 
politicians and campaign contributors alike that if you're going to make or 
accept a contribution, you had better know the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Wooten nor Marasco could be reached for comment. Their attorneys said 
the case was resolved fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 But both also said the case could have been resolved more quickly as a civil 
prosecution, since both defendants immediately acknowledged that they had 
unintentionally broken the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute they knew it was illegal, they admitted to the facts," said 
Richard Loy, who represented Wooten. "This case was much to do about very 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Chuck Samonsky, the lawyer for Marasco, said the fact that the case was 
prosecuted criminally suggests that Bradbury was politically motivated. Cases 
involving much more money are handled civilly in other jurisdictions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is closely tied to the fact that Mr. Bradbury made a statement to 
the Oxnard City Council that anybody involved in card clubs has got to be 
crooked," Samonsky said. "And he set about to prove that even though the great 
majority of this money was donated well before the card club was even 
conceived." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett declined comment on Bradbury's motivation. But he said the case was 
prosecuted appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we come across this type of activity, the person involved will be 
investigated and prosecuted," he said. "There's been a just resolution of the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In entering their pleas, Wooten and Marasco admitted that they illegally 
reimbursed three former employees for contributions to former Oxnard 
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron's 1990 council race, Assemblyman Nao Takasugi's 1992 
Assembly race, Councilman Michael Plisky's 1992 mayoral race and Councilman 
Thomas Holden's 1993 council race. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions are illegal under state law if the true identities of 
contributors are not revealed to candidates. Prosecutors said the candidates 
did not know of the Marasco and Wooten reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessmen, who ran the now-defunct Darrik Marten Co. of Ventura, 
acknowledged nearly $1,000 in illegal contributions -- about $500 to Maron, 
$250 to Takasugi, $149 to Plisky and $99 to Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate grand theft case against the two men is pending. But a Superior 
Court judge said last week that he had tentatively decided to throw out the 
charge of stealing $10,000 in a construction deal unrelated to the card club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council considered a card casino because of its tax and job 
benefits, but killed the project when faced with strong community opposition 
and Bradbury's condemnation of casinos at a hearing in June.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMEN FOCUS OF CAREER DAY AT HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura High School senior Carrie Parks paid no attention to dozens of tables 
lining the walls of the girls' gymnasium Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she headed straight toward the Ventura Police Department booth to 
find out what it would take to realize her dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to become a police officer real bad," the 18-year-old said. "I had fun 
when I was an Explorer and it seemed really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of virtually every industry in Ventura County showed up at the 
fifth annual Career Day at Ventura High School, a morning-long seminar of 
vocational options tailored for women in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes at the Ventura police booth, armed with information about 
policing supplied by Officer Wenona Utter, Parks was more determined than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's told me I can't, so I'm going to do it," she said. "But I didn't 
know you had to be 20 to be a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mikles, a Ventura High math teacher, started the school's Career Day in 
1990 after noticing that many of her female students lacked career guidance. 
The annual event is not connected to the nationwide "Take Our Daughters to Work 
Day," which was also observed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls don't have an awful lot of role models, or information about what they 
can do," Mikles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls are so smart, and they really need to see they can do this kind of 
stuff," added Mikles, who made national news earlier this school year when she 
started one of the first all-girl math classes in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "By exposing them to more female role models, it will help them set some 
future goals for themselves," Mikles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the gym, 16-year-old Lindsay Crabbe was tinkering for the first time 
under the hood of her 1991 Plymouth Laser at a car-care demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought it down here and (teacher Bob Dixon) showed me how to do all this 
stuff," Lindsay said. "Now I can change a tire, the oil, check the brake fluid, 
the clutch fluid and the windshield wiper fluid." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, clad in a bright yellow fireproof jacket, sophomore Pam Knutson was 
breathing through a face mask from a tank of oxygen strapped across her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be something I'd want to do, save people and fight fires," she said, 
removing the jacket and thick rubber mask. But she was more excited to get a 
glimpse of the wide array of jobs available to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really opens my eyes about the opportunities," said Pam, who plans to 
attend Cal State Northridge when she graduates. "It gives me a lot of choices 
about what I might want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 On the soccer field outside the girls' gym, 16-year-old Christina Gerber got 
her first taste of operating a backhoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different than driving a regular car," she said. "But I think I'll stick 
with becoming a veterinarian." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO, OXNARD; ARRIVAL TIMES FOR TRAINS PUSHED

 One of two Metrolink evening trains that has stops in Camarillo and Oxnard 
will be moved up about half an hour because surveys show that riders want the 
train to arrive earlier, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Train No. 109, which stops in Camarillo at 7:02 p.m. and Oxnard at 7:14 p.m., 
will be replaced by Train No. 107, which will leave downtown Los Angeles at 
5:07 p.m. That train will stop in Camarillo at 6:33 p.m. and Oxnard at 6:46 
p.m. The schedule will change beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys conducted this month showed that riders overwhelmingly opted for the 
earlier times, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Train No. 105, which arrives in Camarillo at 5:46 p.m. and Oxnard at 6 p.m., 
will continue with no changes. It leaves downtown Los Angeles at 4:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no changes in the arrival times for Moorpark and Simi Valley 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metrolink station in Camarillo opened in February, and the Oxnard station 
opened earlier this month. Both stations operate two round-trip trains to Los 
Angeles daily. They were added after the Jan. 17 earthquake to help ease 
congestion on commuter-clogged freeways. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CITY OKS RESIDENTIAL PROJECT FOR ORCHARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council has unanimously approved a proposal to turn an 
aging lemon orchard on the city's west side into a development of 302 
residences and an 18-hole semi-public golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission had unanimously approved the proposal from 
Camarillo-based Knightsbridge Holdings Inc. earlier this month.In voting for 
the project during its meeting Wednesday, the City Council credited the 
developer for making the 236-acre site compatible with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developer did a real good job in preparing this project," Mayor Ken Gose 
said. "They worked well with the neighbors and that in turn headed off any 
potential problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the housing development and golf course is near Beardsley and 
Wright roads. Once completed, the development will feature 207 single-family 
houses and 95 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Knightsbridge officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The development came before the council because the lemon orchard, which has 
not been actively farmed since August, had to be rezoned for residential use.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; DOZENS SIGN UP FOR TATTOO REMOVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of youths have signed up for tattoo removals offered free of charge 
today by a Beverly Hills dermatologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Adrianna Scheibner said she would have to return to Ventura County to 
remove the markings of all the local youths who want them erased. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the health educator at Fillmore High School said she has been 
bombarded by young people wanting to get their tattoos removed after a news 
report on Scheibner's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's overwhelming," said Janice Shieferle, who had been coordinating the 
sign-ups. "I've probably had 20 calls (Thursday) morning and people keep 
running in saying, 'You have another call.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Scheibner founded the Brave Hearts Foundation four years ago after removing 
tattoos from hundreds of children for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Howatt, a Fillmore family practitioner, donated the use of his 
office for the tattoo removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of young people wanting tattoos removed means that many will have 
to wait until Scheibner returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are increasing," said Shannon Simpson, director of the Brave 
Hearts Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we'll be back here about every three months, which is about the right 
amount of time between treatments," said Simpson, who added that many tattoos 
require more than one treatment. "We're going to do our best to get all of them 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Young people interested in getting tattoos removed by Scheibner should 
register with the Brave Hearts Foundation by calling (310) 550-0677. JEFF

 Saying they were interested in bringing a minor league baseball team to 
Ventura County, Camarillo City Council members have approved spending as much 
as $25,000 for a consultant to conduct a study of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 During its Wednesday meeting, the council voted unanimously to spend the money 
with the cities of Ventura and Oxnard.Mayor Ken Gose said the consultant has 
yet to be named, and the exact price for the study must still be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was gratified that my colleagues on the council supported this," Gose said. 
"If this proposal works, I believe it'll be good for the city and the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Gose said preliminary discussions with professional baseball officials have 
indicated the willingness of at least one single A-rated minor league team to 
relocate to the county should a stadium be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost estimates for such a stadium, to be borne equally by the three cities, 
could run as high as $12 million. The facility would be designed to seat 4,000 
to 6,000 fans, Gose said. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENTS ON BOARD MAY GAIN MORE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura school board members have tentatively approved a plan to grant 
students a stronger voice in the district by allowing the board's two high 
school representatives to cast advisory votes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fall, student representatives from the district's two high schools 
would be able to announce their opinions on all but employee issues, under the 
plan tentatively approved Tuesday.The trustees are expected to vote on the 
issue at their next meeting in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District board of trustees has had student members 
from the high schools for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students sit at the same table as the five adult trustees, their 
main contribution at meetings has been to report the latest academic and 
athletic achievements at their schools. Students rarely participate in board 
discussions and often leave early. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members Jason Harris, a senior at Buena High, and Mike Schodorf, a 
senior at Ventura High, decided earlier this year to try to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing about students around the state who have been granted advisory 
votes on their school boards, Jason and Mike asked for the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under the plan tentatively approved Tuesday, future student 
representatives would represent not only their high schools but also younger 
students in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives would be chosen by student government leaders and the 
principals at their high schools. Now student body presidents serve as 
representatives. MAIA DAVIS

 Balboa Middle School in Ventura will become the third in the city to build a 
new high-tech lab to teach students computer-aided design and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Rotary clubs in Ventura have contributed a combined $5,200 that, along 
with state and federal funds, will allow Balboa to complete a lab for its 
"Exploration in Technology" program. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Ventura middle schools -- DeAnza and Anacapa -- already have 
technology labs. A fourth middle school, Cabrillo, is probably next in line in 
the district to receive funding for such a lab, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to introduce young students to some of the latest uses of robotics, 
electronics and computers, the technology labs at Ventura's middle schools are 
essentially an updated version of shop classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of teaching students to build objects entirely by hand as in shop, 
students in technology labs use computers to design items ranging from model 
race cars to miniature wood bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 With some of the machinery in the labs, students are able to design computer 
programs that actually drive the power tools to build mallets or other small 
wood objects, Balboa Principal Hank Robertson said. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAPTURED CONDOR RETURNED TO ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first condor released into the wilds of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in 
Ventura County is now the latest to be captured for return to the Los Angeles 
Zoo after federal biologists successfully trapped 3-year-old Xewe on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists set out the carcass of a dead calf 
to lure the hungry vulture into a cave-like structure high on a cliff.They then 
put the condor into a kennel and returned her to the Los Angeles Zoo, where she 
will become part of the condor captive breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatched at the L. A. Zoo, Xewe (pronounced GAY-wee) was one of the first two 
condors to be reintroduced to the wild in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in early 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Six more of the endangered animals were released the following year. But after 
a year of accidents that killed four of the birds, biologists moved the 
remaining four to a remote Santa Barbara County canyon. Five more young birds 
were released there last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But three of the four birds first released into the Sespe returned to the area 
and took up the same behavior -- roosting on power poles and visiting populated 
areas -- that killed the four birds earlier. Three of those birds were 
recaptured late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Xewe also recently began returning to the Sespe. She was not foraging or 
eating on her own and was roosting on power poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists feared that Xewe was endangering herself and could possibly attract 
younger condors in Santa Barbara County back to populated areas of Ventura 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our big fear was that she would take these younger birds to the site," said 
David Clendenen, a senior wildlife biologist with the Fish and Wildlife 
Service. "This was for their well-being and hers." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STUDENTS GIVE $500 TOWARD TREE 
PURCHASES

<P>
 As part of a belated Earth Day celebration, a group of Simi Valley elementary 
students Thursday donated $500 to buy trees for a vacant lot next to their 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ecology club at Abraham Lincoln School raised the money in 
February by organizing a recycling drive that involved the entire 
school.Contests were held between grade levels to determine which classes could 
bring the most cans. Then each day after school, club members would lug the 
bottles and cans to a recycling center, said Sandy Toring, a kindergarten 
teacher and the club's adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight members of the club, called Student Environmentalists Plant, Love 
and Nurture Trees, presented their profits Thursday to officials of the Rancho 
Simi Recreation and Park District. The district plans to use the money to buy 
trees for the field, which is slated to become a park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be part of it since we're also going to use it," Toring said. 
"It's really important for the children to realize they're part of this 
community and can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the money given to park officials, the club donated $500 to 
purchase birch, flowering plum and pear trees for the Abraham Lincoln campus. 
Toring said this was the fourth year that the ecology club has coordinated the 
can drive. JULIE FIELDS

NEW STREET NAMES SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking a new image to match a safer, better-tended community, homeowners in 
Newbury Park's Las Casitas neighborhood have applied to change the names of the 
tract's seven streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, city officials and residents have worked over the past few 
years to improve the 25-year-old condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents credit several city programs for helping revitalize their 
neighborhoods, including laws banning street vendors and restricting overnight 
parking. A community policing program helped cut crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, residents hope to build on their success by erasing the names that used 
to turn up frequently on police scanners. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace existing names like Calle Diamonte, homeowners association members 
voted for Western names, including Stagecoach Court and Chumash Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 246 homeowners or proxies present at the annual board meeting early 
this year, only six voted against changing the street names. A smaller group 
then picked four possible names for each street and submitted the list to city 
staff to winnow. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few weeks, staff member Donna Paschal will check to be sure 
that the names are unique to Thousand Oaks. She must also consider whether they 
are easy for children to pronounce, read and memorize. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Fire Department can scratch any name that too closely 
resembles a street in an adjacent community. Finally, the City Council must 
approve a resolution amending the names. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN FOUND GUILTY IN DRIVING DEATH 
</P>

<P>
 A repeat drunk driver pleaded no contest Thursday to vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated and evading arrest in the death of a 54-year-old Simi Valley 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 After the plea, Ventura County Municipal Judge Steven Hintz found Michael 
Rodriguez, 39, guilty and set sentencing for May 26.Rodriguez, of Simi Valley, 
faces up to 10 years and eight months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez hit several parked cars April 15 before slamming into Raphael 
Lachmiller, who was walking to his family's house on Whitcomb Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is the third Ventura County person charged with vehicular 
manslaughter to plead guilty or no contest within weeks after causing a fatal 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen James Paton, 29, of Simi Valley pleaded guilty after causing a fiery 
Christmas-week crash that took the life of a 26-year-old Thousand Oaks woman. 
Paton, who was on probation for a prior drunk-driving conviction, was sentenced 
to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Garcia, 41, of Oxnard pleaded guilty three weeks after causing a Jan. 
12 wreck in which a 24-year-old Ventura man died. Garcia, who had no prior 
convictions, was spared a prison sentence on the recommendation of the Ventura 
County district attorney's office. He received a year in jail and five years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was convicted of hit-and-run and driving under the influence in 
separate cases last year, prosecutors said. "I feel he should get the maximum," 
said Tammy van der Valk, the victim's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Finnerty of the local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving said 
Rodriguez's plea "saves the (victim's) family from having to go through these 
emotional nightmares all over again." DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CURBSIDE RECYCLING TO START IN SOME AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weekly curbside recycling for yard debris starts June 1 in several 
unincorporated areas of Ventura County, including the Santa Rosa and Ventura 
River valleys, county officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two trash companies that serve those areas, Ojai Rubbish and Rubbish 
Control, will be dropping off 95-gallon barrels for residents over the next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly yard-debris program is part of a countywide plan to meet 
state-mandated goals to recycle 25% of waste by 1995 and 50% by 2000. A county 
ordinance requires trash collectors to provide all unincorporated communities 
with the service by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Grass clippings and other yard debris, including leaves, weeds, branches and 
unpainted lumber, will be taken to a local processor, where it will be ground 
into mulch. The lumber must be small enough to fit in the provided barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Simi Valley, Ojai and Fillmore already provide yard-debris 
pickup, while Thousand Oaks and Ventura are looking into establishing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Items not accepted as part of the recycling program include tree stumps, 
roots, trash, food scraps, painted or treated lumber, rocks, dirt and heavily 
fibrous plants such as yucca and palm fronds. Livestock manure will be picked 
up only in the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbish haulers will offer reductions on trash bills for those who already do 
home composting. MARY F. POLS

YOUTHS IN BRAWL ORDERED TRIED AS ADULTS; COURT: THREE 16-YEAR-OLDS ARE CHARGED 
WITH VARIOUS CRIMES IN THE FEB. 3 MELEE NEAR WESTLAKE HIGH, IN WHICH TWO 
STUDENTS WERE SHOT. 
</P>

<P>
 Three 16-year-old youths charged with taking part in a brawl near Westlake 
High School in which two students were shot will be tried as adults, a judge 
ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III made the ruling late in the 
afternoon after listening to two days of testimony in the highly emotional 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis cited the seriousness and sophistication of the crime as reasons for 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The three -- one each from Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties -- are 
charged with various crimes relating to a Feb. 3 melee at North Ranch Park. A 
fourth boy, James Lee, was ordered tried as an adult March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl began after Lee and a school football player agreed to engage in a 
fistfight. The two students who were shot have been released from the hospital 
and are recovering, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Charles R. McGrath released Lee on $5,000 bail after finding him unfit 
to be tried in Juvenile Court. But Lee failed to make a court appearance in the 
case Wednesday, and McGrath is expected to issue a warrant for his arrest if 
Lee misses a makeup court date this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor noted Lee's absence from court when asking that bail be set at 
$200,000 for each of the other three youths -- Yohn Yi of Thousand Oaks, 
Oubonsack Sonethanouphet of Brea and William Huang of Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Vanarelli also said each of the youths is either a 
gang member or has ties to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you deal with gangs and gang members, these are the things that happen," 
Vanarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for the youths argued for bail of $5,000 for each, saying their 
clients' cases are being tried separately from Lee's. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis set bail at $50,000 for each boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The three teen-agers came to the park as part of a group of five carloads of 
Asian youths who intended to help Lee in the fight, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and football player Curtis Simmons had been involved in an ongoing feud 
when they decided to settle matters at the park, investigators have testified. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week before the brawl, Lee and his brother, Frank, telephoned the 
three teen-agers and other Asian youths and asked them to show up at the park 
on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the fight, Lee's supporters jumped out of their vehicles, 
announced: "We're the Asian Mafia," and attacked Simmons and others with 
baseball bats, sticks and gunfire, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies apprehended the two local youths within a 
day of the incident. They arrested the youths from Brea and Rowland Heights 
within six days. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the youths but Lee have been in the custody of juvenile authorities 
since their arrests.

ELECTIONS / 4TH SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT; MONTGOMERY IS CAMPAIGNING AS AN 
ADVOCATE FOR THE EAST COUNTY; POLITICS: MOORPARK COUNCILMAN SAYS MORE DECISIONS 
AFFECTING HIS AREA ARE BEING MADE BY COUNTY BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he is out campaigning, Ventura County supervisor candidate Scott 
Montgomery loves to talk trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark city councilman said one of the chief concerns east county 
residents have for the future is that the Simi Valley Landfill does not become 
the county's sole dump. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why, Montgomery said, he strongly backs a plan by a group of San Diego 
investors to develop a new west county landfill at Weldon Canyon near Ojai. The 
Bailard Landfill in Oxnard is scheduled to close in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic Resources of Del Mar will start collecting signatures this weekend to 
qualify for a November ballot initiative that would let voters decide whether a 
landfill should be developed at Weldon Canyon, which Ojai residents and 
environmental groups have so far successfully opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, who chairs the Ventura County Waste Commission, is so convinced 
that Weldon Canyon is the best site for a new landfill that he has even offered 
Taconic help in collecting signatures for its proposed ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already taking bullets from the people in Ojai about this and will 
continue to do so," he said. "But you've got to take a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, 40, said he decided to enter the supervisor's race because more 
and more decisions affecting east county cities are being made at the county 
level, such as the Weldon Canyon issue. The Board of Supervisors has debated 
the issue of a new dump at the Ojai site for the last four years without 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find this to be a very disturbing trend," said Montgomery, who is seeking 
the seat being vacated by Supervisor Vicky Howard. Her 4th District represents 
Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said another example of this trend came in March when the 
supervisors voted on how money from Proposition 172 -- a half-cent sales tax 
initiative approved by state voters in November -- would be split among public 
safety agencies. The board agreed to divide the money among law enforcement 
groups, including the Sheriff's Department, which serves Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery argued before the Board of Supervisors that the county Fire 
Department should have also received a piece of the pie in light of the 
wildfires that swept through the region in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it hadn't been for the performance of the firefighters, that measure would 
have failed," said Montgomery, who added that he would push to see that 
firefighters get a share of the sales tax money in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 While he supports increasing county health services, Montgomery said some of 
the money should be spent in the east county rather than on such projects as 
the proposed $30-million expansion of Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the priority for service of east county residents?" he said. "We 
have virtually no facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Although both Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks each have county health clinics, 
Montgomery said they are "tokenism compared to what the west county has with 
the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery expressed strong reservations about a proposal to establish a 
commercial airport at Point Mugu. Concerned about continuing defense cuts, the 
Navy has offered to share its runway with the county as a way to reduce 
operating costs. Both of Montgomery's opponents support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery said be believes that a commercial airport would invite an 
"explosion of growth" that would increase crime and decrease property values in 
the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're doing an awful lot of talking about something that will never 
happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his enthusiasm and drive, Montgomery admits that his two opponents 
have one big advantage in the June 7 election: He lives in Moorpark. They live 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A city of 26,000, Moorpark is one-fourth the size of Simi Valley, where 
Montgomery's two rivals serve on the City Council. Being from a larger city, 
both Barbara Williamson and Judy Mikels start out with more name recognition 
and more sources from which to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a supervisor elected from 
Moorpark," Montgomery said. "So I would have to rate myself an underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery said one thing he has more of than either Williamson or Mikels 
is government experience. He has served on the Moorpark City Council since 
1988. By comparison, Mikels has held public office for three years, and 
Williamson one. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his council experience, Montgomery serves on the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy's advisory committee, the Ventura County Animal 
Regulation Commission and the Waste Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to change government, you first have to know how it works," 
he said. "And I can tell you in a year and a half or three years, you're not 
going to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikels, who also sits on a number of county committees, played down 
Montgomery's City Council experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moorpark is a very small town," she said. "I don't think they have dealt with 
the same types of issues and budgets that Simi Valley has dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels and Williamson said Montgomery is counting heavily on support from the 
local chapter of the Christian Coalition -- a national conservative 
organization that seeks to elect candidates to advance an anti-abortion agenda 
and other socially conservative causes -- to help boost his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott has a certain base in the Christian Coalition, and I think he thinks 
he's going to carry Simi Valley and Moorpark because of it," she said. "But I'm 
not sure if it's enough of a base." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not a member of the coalition, Montgomery said it's mostly 
because he hasn't had time to join. "I certainly don't have much philosophical 
difference with a number of their beliefs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A staunch pro-life advocate, Montgomery is candid about his views on abortion 
but is less clear on what role county government should play in such issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recent interview, he said that, if elected, he would use his position 
as a supervisor to see that county taxpayer dollars are not used to fund 
"optional" abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors will not decide the legality of abortion, but they 
will decide whether the county spends taxpayer funds on optional abortions," he 
said. "I will be a vote to restrict taxpayer funding of abortions only to those 
cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he could not separate his personal moral beliefs from his 
duties as a public official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will bring my own beliefs and principles as an integral part of every 
decision I make," he said. "But I think it's important to realize so does 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview a few days later, however, Montgomery was asked if he 
would be willing as a county supervisor to challenge the state and perhaps even 
the federal government on how taxpayer dollars are used in local abortion 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an issue," he said. "It's an issue to the extent that voters want to 
know the character, beliefs and values of candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and supporters describe Montgomery as amiable, objective and 
hard-working. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a very balanced view and approach in solving problems," said Francis 
Okyere, former president of the Moorpark Chamber of Commerce. "He's pragmatic. 
That's one of the qualities I've always admired about him." 
</P>
<P>
 But others who have worked closely with him over the years offer a different 
view of Montgomery, whom they describe as a brash opportunist, someone more 
concerned about his political career than his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real politician, in the worse sense of that word," said Clint Harper, 
a Moorpark school board member and former councilman. "He has the ego the size 
of Mt. Everest." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that almost no local official or business organizations such as the 
Chamber of Commerce have endorsed Montgomery "should tell you something," 
Harper said. "These are the people who know him best." 
</P>
<P>
 John Wozniak, the only member of the Moorpark council to support his colleague 
in the supervisor race, said Montgomery is not brash but "gutsy . . . because 
he will say things other politicians won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery acknowledges that his sturdy self-confidence may have rubbed people 
the wrong way in the past, "but I've learned." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tendencies I had when I was first elected was to be a bit more arrogant," 
he said. "But I'm not the same person I was five or six years ago. I can tell 
you that an arrogant person does not take on a second job as I have done in 
order to have the time and to forgo the income I have just to serve their local 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 A former financial consultant, Montgomery, who works out of his house, said he 
designs and sells his own microcomputer software. He also delivers newspapers 
for the Ventura Star-Free Press in the morning to help make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hours are certainly conducive," he said of his second job. "This way, I 
can dedicate more time to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his government experience, Montgomery is not always as well-informed 
on the issues as he lets on, his opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent candidates forum in Simi Valley, Montgomery talked about forming 
county and city partnerships as a way to help reduce government expenditures 
and increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to do this, he proposed, would be for the county to contract with Simi 
Valley and Moorpark to provide building and safety services to people living in 
unincorporated areas outside those cities. This way, he said, residents would 
not have to drive 40 miles to the county's Government Center in Ventura to pull 
building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was her turn to speak, Mikels informed Montgomery that those services 
are already provided at the East County Courthouse in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At another candidates forum a few days later, Montgomery said he still 
believes that county and city partnerships can be formed in other areas to help 
reduce the cost of some services. Profile of Scott MontgomeryScott Montgomery

County Supervisor Vicky Howard. Her 4th District seat includes Simi Valley, 
Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Rosa Valley.

MISTRIAL DENIED IN CHILD-ABUSE CASE; TESTIMONY: DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR WESTLAKE 
WOMAN OBJECTS WHEN THE 16-YEAR-OLD ALLEGED VICTIM MENTIONS HER FATHER'S 
PREVIOUS CONVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge overruled a defense request for a mistrial in a child-abuse case 
against an affluent Westlake mother after the alleged victim blurted out on the 
witness stand that her father had been convicted of a similar charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old girl, testifying for the second straight day against Charlotte 
Russo, was describing a conversation with her brother when she mentioned her 
father's guilty plea and jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Incensed, defense attorney James M. Farley requested the mistrial. Richard 
Russo, 50, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of child abuse and was 
sentenced to 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This jury is going to think if the father has done something, then she's done 
something," Farley said of Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley chided Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona, saying she had a duty to keep the 
girl from making inadmissible statements. Corona said the girl's comments "were 
not orchestrated" and argued against a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles Campbell conceded that the statements have "a 
possibility of tainting the case," but reasoned that any adverse effect they 
might cause could be overcome by telling the jury that they have no bearing on 
Charlotte Russo's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the fact that they know he has served a sentence is reason 
for a mistrial," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, 52, faces one count of felony child abuse for allegedly 
biting the girl and one count of misdemeanor child abuse for incarcerating her 
in the family's back-yard racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, the only witness to take the stand so far in the 2-day-old trial, 
made several revelations on the witness stand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In one development, she testified that four times a day her mother forced her 
to eat uncooked oatmeal mixed with raw eggs and tap water from a bathroom sink. 
And once, she said, her mother dumped the meal over her head because she wasn't 
eating fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said her father walked in the bathroom of the racquetball court where 
the incident happened, inquired about it and "just sort of rolled his eyes and 
wouldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said the oatmeal made her feel like throwing up. "It was hard to 
swallow," she said. "But I had to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the girl testified that sometimes she was locked in 
the bathroom of the $75,000 racquetball court for more than a week at a time 
without being let out. Furthermore, she said her mother insisted that she 
remain seated on the stool of the toilet -- and not the floor -- during this 
incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the girl also told the jury that when her parents were out of 
town, several of her older siblings occasionally guarded her as she was jailed 
in the racquetball court bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before neighbors reported their suspicions of child abuse at the 
house, she said her parents had finally ordered her out of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad said like an employee being fired from a job, you are being fired from 
this family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Corona said she believes the girl's testimony, but will not 
seek to file charges against any other family members. The girl has six 
siblings, including several who are older. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will resume Monday, when the girl will again take the stand.

REPORTER'S DAUGHTER 'MAKES THE MAGIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER KELLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I get to stay at my mom's work, instead of going to school tomorrow," said my 
friend, Jennifer Thompson. "Why?" I asked her. "Because tomorrow is National 
Take Your Daughter to Work Day," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 So the next day I left with my dad, Daryl Kelley, for the newsroom of the Los 
Angeles Times. Before we arrived at The Times, we had to stop at my school, 
Balboa. There my dad had to go into the office to get the papers that we were 
required to fill out if I wanted to go to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
 When my dad and I arrived at the newsroom about 8:30 a.m., we found that only 
one other person was there. Her name is Desiree Dreeuws, and she was filing all 
the papers of the county in their proper stacks to keep the reporters well 
informed on the happenings around the county. And also so they had a sense of 
what they are up against. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, my dad had been reminding me of how important it is to be 
neat and organized. So I was kind of shocked when I saw his desk. It was 
covered with papers and junk! I wasn't sure how to react, but I couldn't help 
but smile. 
</P>
<P>
 More people came into the office, including Joanna Miller, Fred Alvarez, Peggy 
Lee, Larry Bessel, Alan Hagman and Bill Overend. Soon the newsroom was full of 
exciting chatter, phone interviews in progress, pictures being developed and 
stories being assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry took some pictures of my dad and I, and then showed me how he does the 
developing, enlarging and perfecting of the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been to the newsroom before, but this time was different. Instead of 
sitting around trying to bide time watching other people do the things I 
dreamed about, I was in the seat doing the writing, making the magic and having 
the best time of my life doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in my life, not like when I was 5 and wanted to be like my 
Daddy, I was sure this was why I was here, to make the magic, to have my name 
in print. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:30, while my dad was doing a story about the safety level of the cities 
in Ventura County, Bill asked me to join himself, Fred, Joanna and some others 
for the 11:30 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, we went over the different stories and decided which 
stories to do and which not to do. I was really excited to see my brief on the 
list of stories to be published the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, my dad took me out to lunch. As we were leaving, Mack Reed 
asked me if I wanted to work with a deadline. I told him that I would, and he 
asked me if I could do an interview with the daughter of a homicide detective 
who went to work with her father. 
</P>
<P>
 I was excited at that opportunity. But while I was eating my lunch, I realized 
that I couldn't do the interview because I would be in the middle of a 
volleyball match! 
</P>
<P>
 When we got back to the newsroom, my dad told Mack Reed that I wouldn't be 
able to do the interview and Bill gave me this assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the Take Your Daughter to Work Day was a great idea and I've really 
had a lot of fun because of it! 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Kelley, 12, is the daughter of staff writer Daryl Kelley.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: PACBELL SAYS PAY NOW, SUE LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yellow Pages advertisers who want to sue Pacific Bell Directory over mistakes 
must pay in advance for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee is hefty: With a minimum charge of $500, it can be up to twice the 
monthly cost of an ad. Small-business owners pay it, though, because omission 
from the Yellow Pages can hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Esther Ginsburg, owner of Golyesther, a Melrose Avenue vintage dress 
shop. She is paying Pacific Bell $703 for the right to sue the company for 
damages if it goofs up her $48.50-a-month ad in the Beverly Hills directory. 
(Her fee was set before the new rates went into effect.) 
</P>
<P>
 You might say Ginsburg is forking over money Pacific Bell might later use to 
settle or fight any disputes that arise. As Los Angeles copyright lawyer James 
W. Paul put it, "They are asking her to indemnify them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell and most other Yellow Pages publishers have clauses in their 
contracts to prevent lawsuits over mistakes. Generally, a directory publisher's 
liability is limited to the cost of an ad. This means that if a mistake occurs, 
an advertiser will receive a refund at best. Directory publishers say the 
liability limits help them keep advertising charges low. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell's contract is unusual in that it will waive the liability limit 
for customers that pay an extra fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the customer has purchased the waiver, they can take us to court and sue 
for as much damages as they can legally prove," said Sandy Kivowitz, a 
spokesman for Pacific Bell Directory. "We are giving customers an opportunity 
to tailor the contract. . . . It is a good customer service step to take." 
</P>
<P>
 The question for small-business owners is whether the right to sue Pacific 
Bell, an $8.9-billion company, is worth paying for. Paul says it isn't.  
</P>
<P>
 "Collecting from them would be difficult and expensive," he said, noting that 
an advertiser would have to hire an attorney and experts to assess damages.  
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg said she paid the fee hoping Pacific Bell will be careful with her 
advertisement. She said the phone company omitted her bridal listing from its 
1992 Greater Los Angeles Yellow Pages and that bridal sales plummeted 20%. All 
she got was a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 "They use this as a 'gotcha,' " Ginsburg said. "If I don't pay this fee, there 
is no penalty if they choose to be careless. On the other hand, I can't afford 
to sue them if they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They have a point: No-points mortgages have been a better deal for home buyers 
in recent years than mortgages with points, according to the trade newsletter 
Bank Rate Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 A point is a fee borrowers pay when a mortgage is issued. It is equal to 1% of 
the size of the loan. People who pay points are in effect prepaying a portion 
of the loan and so are charged lower interest rates than people who take out 
no-points mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newsletter found that when points are taken into account, mortgages 
with points actually cost more. In February, for example, the effective rate on 
no-points mortgages was 7.25%, while the effective rate on mortgages with 
points was about 7.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter's analysis covers 30-year mortgages issued between January, 
1992, and February, 1994. The points were amortized over 10 years, the 
newsletter said, meaning it factored the effect of paying the points into the 
rate over that period. 
</P>

 Apartment rents: Los Angeles ranks seventh in the nation in terms of apartment 
prices, a new survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The management consulting firm Runzheimer International said a Los Angeles 
renter earning $25,000 a year would pay 30% of that, or $7,880 a year, for a 
typical one-bedroom apartment. The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom 
apartment in Los Angeles was $657. According to census data, nearly six of 10 
Los Angeles residents live in rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Honolulu ranked first in the survey, with an average monthly rent of $1,040. 
It was followed by San Francisco, at $773, and Washington, at $748. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Your mother already knew this: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has 
decided that cedar wood products used to repel insects and mildew don't pose 
risks to people after all. The agency this month said natural cedar products no 
longer need to carry warning labels, unless the wood has been chemically 
treated.

 Home video: The video version of Walt Disney Co.'s animated "Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs" will be out Oct. 28, with a suggested retail price of $26.99. 
That's $2 more than "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast," but Ann Daly, 
president of Disney's Buena Vista Home Video, said "Snow White" purchasers can 
get $15 in refunds and coupons.Most stores ended up selling "Aladdin" and 
"Beauty and the Beast" for less than $24.99. Daly would not say how many copies 
of "Snow White" Disney expects to sell. Referring to the 24 million "Aladdin" 
copies sold domestically and the 22 million copies of "Beauty and the Beast, 
she said, "We'd be happy with any number that has a two in front of it." Disney 
also said it will sell Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" (suggested 
price: $19.99) starting Sept. 30. JAMES BATES

ORIOLES' FERNANDEZ REFUSES TO BECOME A STATISTIC; BASEBALL: WITH DOUBLE-DIGIT 
SCORES ALL AROUND HIM, LEFT-HANDER SUBDUES ANGELS, 4-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every time you turn on the evening news or browse through the box scores these 
days, there's another football score in a baseball game. Double- digit run 
totals are definitely in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Juiced-up baseballs? Extra hard lacquer on the bats? Theories abound, but 
Angel Manager Buck Rodgers says another factor is becoming increasingly 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitching is scarce," he said. "It's a depressed market and it's obvious 
everywhere you go. We're all in the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Orioles are doing their best to abandon that ship, however, and 
for the second night in a row, they threw an apparently live arm up against the 
Angels. Nobody's writing rave reviews about the Orioles' middle relievers, but 
who needs middle men when your starters are also finishers? 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Ben McDonald's complete game made him the American League's 
first five-game winner as Baltimore walloped the Angels, 13-1. Thursday night, 
left-hander Sid Fernandez punched another hole in Rodgers' theory and punched 
out the Angels with a sparkling display of efficient pitching for 8 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez gave up a line-drive homer to center by Chili Davis leading off the 
second inning and a bunt single by Chad Curtis leading off the fourth, then 
retired 16 of the next 17 Angels he faced. With one out in the ninth, Curtis 
hit an opposite-field homer and Oriole Manager Johnny Oates called on Lee Smith 
to get the last two outs and seal a 4-2 victory. It was Smith's 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined not to fall behind and put (Curtis) on base, so I threw 
nothing but fastballs," said Fernandez, who came off the disabled list April 17 
after suffering from tendinitis in his left biceps. "I don't consider one-run 
homers to be mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Fernandez's miscues were few and far between on this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as good a game as has been pitched against us all season," Rodgers 
said. "El Sid had good stuff tonight. We kept popping up and flying out. He had 
a good live fastball and was mixing in that slop curveball. He keeps you 
guessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez needed only 99 pitches to subdue the Angels. It was, Oates pointed 
out, a classic example of a pitcher going to the mound with a game plan and 
then "doing exactly what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't consider it easy," Fernandez protested. "A shutout, maybe, is easy. 
But I learned early in my career not to waste pitches. Guys talk about how you 
have to waste pitches, but I just go after them. As far as I'm concerned, 
pitches are too valuable to waste." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to knock Fernandez's go-get-'em style. He has allowed 6.63 hits per 
nine innings during his career, second best in major league history among 
pitchers with 1,500 or more innings. Nolan Ryan (6.55) is the all-time leader. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 seasons with the Mets, his escape from New York has landed him with a 
bona fide contender in Baltimore. Fernandez signed with the Orioles as a free 
agent last November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I departed on good terms with the Mets," he said. "It wasn't a hostile thing 
at all. We had some good times, a world championship, but it was time to move 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he think the change of scenery will rejuvenate his career? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask me in September. Better yet, ask me in October," he said, smiling.

PREP VOLLEYBALL; CANYON COMES BACK TO BEAT EL MODENA, CLOSES IN ON TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the end of a 15-year drought in sight, Canyon was understandably antsy 
before its four-game victory over host El Modena in a Century League boys' 
volleyball match Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches, ranked ninth in Orange County, lost the first game before 
rebounding for a convincing 7-15, 15-10, 15-6, 15-8 victory. Brent Nogle had 18 
kills and Joey Ramirez added 15 for Canyon, which moved within one victory of 
clinching the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 If Canyon (12-0, 6-0 in league) defeats Foothill Tuesday, the Comanches clinch 
the league championship outright. El Modena fell to 7-5, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time this school won a title was 1978 or '79," Canyon Coach Chuck 
Kaulupali said. "The seniors have worked so hard to get here and they can feel 
it coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to get too excited at the beginning of a match and they try too 
hard. But you can tell by the scores that after they settled down and played 
smooth, it was no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a big turnaround from four years ago. When Nogle, Ramirez, and setter 
Matt Cohen entered Canyon as freshmen, the Comanche program had been 
discontinued because of lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids started it themselves because of their love for the game," 
Kaulupali said. "We get no funding from the district, so the kids have to do 
all the fund-raising themselves; for the officials fees, transportation, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches have beaten everyone they've played this season with a balanced 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who had 42 assists, can set Nogle and Ramirez on the outside and Troy 
Langley gives Canyon another potent weapon in the middle. Langley had 13 kills 
and four blocks Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're an overpowering team," El Modena Coach John Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jemmett tried to keep El Modena close with his 17 kills, but Canyon was 
too much to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory Thursday would have kept the Vanguards in the league title hunt, but 
now Cahill is worried about getting his team into the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Santa Ana Valley dropped out of the league, the league might receive 
only two playoff berths, Cahill said. El Modena might have to defeat Foothill 
in the final league match next week to secure a playoff berth.

LAPD REPORTS IDENTIFY 'HOT TARGETS' FOR CRIME; VIOLENCE: THE UNRELEASED STUDIES 
GIVE STATISTICS AND OFFER SUGGESTIONS FOR DEALING WITH TROUBLED AREAS. 
HOMICIDES REMAIN A STUBBORN PROBLEM IN THE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still-unreleased reports compiled by the Los Angeles Police Department 
identify dozens of pockets of violent crime in the city and recommend an array 
of suggestions for cleaning up those problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports, reviewed Thursday by The Times, draw heavily on crime statistics 
for violent felonies such as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. 
Using the crime data and other information, most of it from the public record, 
the reports identify a number of "hot target" reporting districts, communities 
where police are combatting particularly serious problems, and they rank those 
districts by the various violent crimes committed in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports from the LAPD's 18 police stations vary widely in content and 
form. Some go into great detail about the possible causes of crime, while 
others, such as one submitted by the LAPD's West Los Angeles station, are 
extremely brief. The suggestions for action also cover a range of proposals, 
from increasing patrols in certain communities to building closer ties to 
neighborhoods so they can better protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has said it will release the reports next week after editing them to 
remove sensitive information such as details about proposed officer deployment. 
The 18 reports reviewed by The Times on Thursday were unedited. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings from those reports: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although crime in many San Fernando Valley neighborhoods is down since last 
year, homicides remain a stubborn problem, and some communities are afflicted 
by an array of other ills. Several corridors, including three in Devonshire and 
one in the Foothill Division, account for a large portion of the Valley's 
violent crime, the reports say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Commanders in the department's 77th Street station, responsible for some of 
the city's most violent neighborhoods, reported progress in most areas, but 
acknowledged that homicides are on the rise and expressed frustration about 
their inability to combat certain kinds of crime. "The number of arrests for 
rape seems to have no impact on the number of crimes committed," the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 * In that Wilshire Division, officials found that most of the division's 59 
homicides were the result of robberies, and the second-leading motive was 
gang-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Newton Division, another hotbed of violent crime, officials 
identified three major corridors of violence -- along Vernon, Broadway and 
Central avenues -- and noted that four of their "hot reporting districts" have 
been stubbornly resistant to previous efforts to root out violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD report from the Valley's Devonshire Division is typical of the 
documents, which were prepared late last year and submitted to Assistant Chief 
Bernard C. Parks, who heads the Police Department's Operations Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 In that report, Devonshire officials cite three problem areas: the community 
surrounding the Northridge Mall, another along Roscoe Boulevard and a third, 
which department officials call the "Sepulveda Corridor," a long stretch of 
land near the police division's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is inundated with prostitution activity, narcotics trafficking and 
gang-related activity," officials say in their analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanders from Devonshire recommended 11 strategies for combatting the crime 
in those three areas. They range from traditional police responses -- deploying 
additional patrol officers, detectives and vice officers -- to suggesting ways 
for engaging the community more actively in fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks received all 18 reports earlier this year but was dissatisfied with 
some. As a result, he returned the documents to each of the city's police 
stations, asking them to review their findings and submit revised copies to him 
next month. Some of those reports have been completed and go beyond ranking 
communities according to each type of crime to prioritizing the most violent 
neighborhoods in each of the 18 areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LAPD officials have pledged to release the first round of reports 
next week, they said Wednesday that they will edit the documents to ensure that 
no information is made public that might jeopardize public safety or that would 
invade privacy rights of anyone mentioned in the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. David J. Gascon, a department spokesman, declined to comment in detail 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of evaluating the reports," he said. "And we're in the 
process of living up to our promise to release them once they've been 
redacted." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials are particularly sensitive about information contained in 
the documents that might be of use to criminals or that might jeopardize police 
officers. In a number of places, the reports have recommended that special 
patrols be deployed in certain areas at certain times of day. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that type of information, Gascon said, that might jeopardize the Police 
Department's ability to fight crime. Many of the reports also list addresses 
where crimes have occurred. That information is likely to be deleted in order 
to protect crime victims, Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reports include detailed demographic information about the race, 
gender, age and other characteristics of suspects arrested by the Police 
Department. In the Newton Division, for instance, officials report that 53% of 
all violent crimes were committed by black males. Women represented only 1% of 
total suspects. More than eight out of 10 violent crime suspects were 30 or 
younger, the report adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some City Council members have expressed concern about the LAPD 
targeting people based on their race, none of the reports reviewed by The Times 
recommends taking special action against suspects of particular ethnicity or 
based on other demographic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy spoke out strongly Thursday 
against a published article on the report that he said inaccurately 
characterized a suggestion to increase the percentage of African-Americans and 
Latinos who are interviewed by police during investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy said the suggestion was made in a training exercise by an LAPD 
management analyst -- a civilian employee -- who was assigned the task of 
analyzing crime data in the Valley's North Hollywood division. 
</P>
<P>
 "To infer that this training exercise would become an operational plan for the 
LAPD is just irresponsible," Pomeroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The study of violent crime in Los Angeles is being funded by a federal grant, 
and that has given officials the ability to analyze extremely detailed 
information about crime inside the city.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Foothill Division officials identified a stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard 
from San Fernando Road to Foothill Boulevard as "a major source of violent 
crime in Foothill Area. The high concentration of low-income housing complexes, 
gangs and narcotics activities are contributing factors." 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Valley, officials identified five problem areas and proposed 
solutions for each. The problems they highlighted were street robberies in 
Canoga Park and Encino, homicides in Canoga Park, rapes in Canoga Park and 
aggravated assaults in the north end of the West Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the study, officers theorized as to the cause of those crime 
concentrations. They attributed the spate of aggravated assaults to 
concentrations of gangs near the intersection of Sherman Way and Reseda 
Boulevard. "Also, there are a variety of problem (liquor stores) in this area, 
which may be a contributing factor," the report from West Valley adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime problems in the Valley, however, pale compared to those reported 
from some of the Police Department's other divisions. In the Pacific Division, 
not one of the city's most violent, officers reported a continuing problem with 
aggravated assaults in districts near the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aggravated assaults are largely due to the hot weather and alcohol 
consumption that is readily available in this area," the document states. 
</P>
<P>
 In Central and South Los Angeles, meanwhile, gangs remain a dominant theme in 
the reports, as does the shortage of police resources to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rampart Area's workload . . . is so heavy that it causes the Patrol Division 
to be primarily reactive rather than proactive," the report from that police 
station states.

COURT VOIDS POLICEMAN'S CONVICTION; JURISPRUDENCE: APPEALS PANEL THROWS OUT THE 
CASE AGAINST A VALLEY TRAFFIC OFFICER ACCUSED OF ASSAULTING A JAYWALKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court appeals panel on Thursday threw out a battery conviction 
against a Los Angeles police officer accused of assaulting a jaywalker in 1991, 
finding that the prosecutor improperly invited jurors to reform the Police 
Department after other LAPD officers were acquitted of beating Rodney King. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also found that the judge erred by letting the prosecutor contrast 
the downtown court jurors with their Simi Valley counterparts. "This is not 
Simi Valley," the prosecutor said. "This is Los Angeles, and you people are 
smart, and you know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 When filed in Municipal Court, the case of Valley Traffic Officer Clark Baker 
was viewed as a symbol of how the justice system would treat wayward police 
officers. But Barry Levin, the lawyer who represented Baker during his appeal, 
said it now is obvious that Baker was little more than a political scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good day, a very good day," said Baker, who had received numerous 
commendations during a 10-year career. "I just want this behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's colleagues at the Valley Traffic Division in Van Nuys cheered when a 
supervisor announced at the afternoon roll call that his conviction had been 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was accused of slapping, kicking and dragging a handcuffed, 21-year-old 
Salvadoran immigrant he had ticketed for jaywalking. An internal police board 
cleared Baker, but criminal charges were filed about a year later. It was the 
first excessive force complaint against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, now 36, was convicted of battery last year in Municipal Court, but the 
jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of conviction on a charge of excessive force. 
He was sentenced to probation, counseling and 350 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 At his sentencing, Judge Veronica Simmons McBeth said she "had no confidence 
that the LAPD, if allowed to handle this internally, would take steps to make 
sure this does not happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's trial occurred eight months after a Superior Court jury in Simi Valley 
acquitted LAPD officers of abusing their authority in beating King. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing Baker's conviction, the Superior Court appeals panel observed, "This 
case involved a moderate amount of force and discourtesy by appellant and a 
moderate amount of belligerence by the jaywalker." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges ruled that prosecutor David Sotelo's repeated references to the 
King case during an emotionally charged period had denied Baker a fair trial, 
and in effect made Sotelo an unsworn witness at the trial. The judges also 
found misconduct by Judge McBeth, saying she failed to curb Sotelo's remarks, 
and ruled that defense attorney Bob Wilson, by not objecting to the remarks, 
failed to provide effective counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sotelo's remarks to the jury included the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Teach him to be responsible. That's all we're asking you. So we can bring 
in the new wind of change that's happening in that department." 
</P>
<P>
 * "What we're doing here is we're weeding out that small percentage of police 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 * "What happened to Mr. Rodney King was outrageous and makes you really sick. 
. . . But you know that same argument was made in all police cases: 'You can't 
judge us. We decide. We're the cops. We're this thin blue line. We're 
protecting you from the criminals, from the Rodney Kings of this world.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Appellate attorney Levin said Thursday: "He wasn't prosecuting Baker anymore. 
He was prosecuting those four other officers." 
</P>
<P>
 In an 18-page opinion, the judges agreed, calling the prosecutor's remarks 
improper because "they were not based on the facts in this case and appealed to 
the passions and prejudices of the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office had no comment on the 
finding of prosecutorial misconduct, and has not decided whether to refile the 
misdemeanor battery charge against Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. John Dunkin said the LAPD already was clearing the way for Baker's 
return to work. He has been suspended without pay since December, awaiting a 
hearing before a second internal police board. However, since the conviction 
against Baker no longer stands, the hearing no longer is necessary, Dunkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he already has completed his 350 hours of community service at El 
Rescate, a Pico-Union community service agency that works with Central American 
immigrants. He said his car was vandalized there three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame the city for being angry," he said. "This has been the worst 
experience I have had in my life. If anything, this has made me a better 
officer because it made me much more sensitive to the feelings of citizens who 
are charged." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I look forward to going back on the street and serving the public 
faithfully."

CONTROVERSIAL CALLING; STATE WILL LICENSE MIDWIVES BUT DEBATE CONTINUES; ' WHAT 
CAN BE MORE HOLY THAN ASSISTING THE PASSAGE OF THE SOUL THROUGH THE DOOR FROM 
HEAVEN TO EARTH?' MIDWIFE LANI J. ROSENBERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a matter of months, Lani J. Rosenberger will no longer have to worry about 
whether any of the women seeking her services are actually undercover cops 
trying to bust her for helping mothers-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a midwife, a member of an ancient calling, but one that was legally 
recognized in California this year after bitter controversy and long opposition 
by the state's organized medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The medical industry) would like everyone to think that . . . midwives are 
stupid, ignorant, barefoot old grannies. This is an old stereotype," 
Rosenberger, 48, said from her Canoga Park home, where clients are seen for 
prenatal exams. "Many individuals within the medical industry do not believe 
that, but many do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing you just go do. All of us who catch babies have been trained 
in some way, some in a more informal way than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a perfect law," she added. "I would prefer the decriminalization of 
midwives, but it's a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the profession has been placed in a legal quandary. No state law 
forbids midwifery, yet midwives can be prosecuted for practicing medicine 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 1, midwives may apply for state licensing and enjoy the right to 
practice freely, but under the supervision of licensed physicians. The state 
Medical Board, which will oversee the program, is now developing standards to 
regulate the practice for the first time since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, many lay midwives will continue working underground to help 
women deliver babies at home, without the use of drugs or medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law governs lay midwives -- a term Rosenberger finds objectionable 
because she believes it implies that she has little or no experience. Instead, 
she refers to herself as a "direct-entry" midwife, whose only training came 
from being another midwife's apprentice for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
 A second group, known as nurse-midwives, are now certified by the Board of 
Registered Nursing and usually perform deliveries in hospitals or birth 
centers. They have generally enjoyed a good working relationship with 
physicians, medical officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lay midwives, on the other hand, are still untested commodities as far as the 
medical community is concerned. Some have formal medical training, but many do 
not. They practice underground at times in communities of Latinos, Mormons and 
Christian Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 One goal of the new law -- authored by state Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego) -- 
is to provide low-income women greater access to affordable prenatal services. 
California is the 15th state in the country to allow licensing of midwives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberger's clients are mostly middle-class women who already have health 
insurance, but are dissatisfied with the medical system. She declined to 
disclose how much she earns, but said that most midwives charge $1,500 to 
$3,000 a patient -- thousands of dollars less than hospital births cost. 
</P>
<P>
 One client, Moira Bell of Canoga Park, is more than eight months pregnant with 
her fifth child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an illness and doesn't need to be treated as such," said Bell, 
36. "When I go to the hospital, I seem to relinquish myself to a system that 
believes, 'You can't possibly have a baby without us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberger hopes to become licensed after performing about 150 home births in 
15 years of practice. By this summer, she will be able to qualify for a license 
by passing a series of exams or completing a three-year accredited training 
program similar to the one now taken by nurse-midwives. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, she remains fearful of prosecution and only takes clients who have 
been referred to her by someone she knows. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6% of the home births Rosenberger has performed involved difficult 
deliveries requiring hospital care, she said. But she said that figure is low 
when compared with the number of high-risk pregnancies taking place in 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider midwifery to be a calling, very much akin to a religious calling. 
I don't know a single midwife who doesn't believe her practice is an extension 
of her religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can be more holy than assisting the passage of the soul through the door 
from heaven to earth?" 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the licensing program have not yet been settled, such as how much 
the Medical Board will charge for licenses, what type of information will be 
asked on license applications, and who will administer the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important issue that is still unresolved, many say, centers on a 
provision requiring each lay midwife to work under the supervision of a 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Killea agreed to add the provision in a compromise with the medical community 
that helped the bill pass. Now, she acknowledges it may work against midwives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board, she said, is "trying to require a written agreement between 
physicians and midwives. We know from experience that isn't going to work. 
Doctors are most reluctant to sign anything that will affect their insurance 
premiums." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Medical Assn., which represents about half of the practicing 
doctors in the state, offered its support for the proposed law only after a 
training requirement and the provision on physician supervision were added to 
the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern with the original bill was basically where physician supervision 
came into play," said Danielle Walters, a spokeswoman for the group. "What if 
there was an emergency? We believe that is too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing is there is a shortage of obstetricians. . . . Once the 
standards are established, the more the merrier. There's definitely enough 
delivery to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Walters said, physicians have complained that one problem with 
home births is "patient dumping," when a pregnant woman is dropped off at a 
hospital emergency room during complicated labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Midwives like Rosenberger oppose physician supervision partly because they say 
it interferes with their professional autonomy. And because insurance companies 
do not currently provide coverage for home births, Rosenberger wonders how many 
doctors would be willing to supervise lay midwives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board will try to define the terms of physician supervision -- 
what type is needed and how much is enough -- by the July 1 deadline, said 
Dixon Arnett, the board's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to meet the time frame," Arnett said. "One reason we may not is 
this one issue is mightily fought by the midwives themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I can reasonably predict is if the board decided not to have 
regulations on supervision, leaving it open, insurance companies wouldn't cover 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The medical industry estimates that about 200 lay midwives statewide would 
apply for a license given the opportunity, and up to 600 more are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, enforcement begins only with a complaint about the quality of 
care, said Linda Whitney, a special consultant for the Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we never got a complaint and never heard about them, we'd do nothing," she 
said. "We can't take action against someone we've never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think after we have implemented the program and there is licensing, the 
board will look more seriously at people practicing without a license. But 
again, our major concern is quality of care." 
</P>
<P>
 In a case 11 years ago, Karni Seymour, 37, of Ventura County was convicted of 
a misdemeanor charge for practicing medicine without a license after she helped 
deliver a baby at home who died. She pleaded guilty and was given three years' 
probation, about 300 hours of community service and a fine of about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even begin to explain the three years of hell my family went through, 
the degrading humiliation," said Seymour, a good friend of Rosenberger's who 
declined to say whether she is still practicing. "I feel I handled (the birth) 
as efficiently and competently as a hospital would have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you the sense of relief I had when Gov. (Pete) Wilson signed the 
bill," said Seymour, who says she is anxious about applying for a license. "We 
were validated."

2 MORE ATTACKS ON STUDENTS REVIVE FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Months after the last reported attack by the so-called Valley molester, fear 
and frustration have reappeared at some San Fernando Valley schools following 
recent attacks on two girls as they walked to class. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Los Angeles police said a sexual assault near Northridge Middle 
School and an attempted assault near Langdon Avenue school in North Hills are 
not related to each other or to the so-called Valley molester, who is blamed 
for as many as 32 attacks on children near schools from Feb. 22 to Dec. 3, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what we know, the attacks are completely different to each other and 
to the Valley molester," said Robert Peloquin of the LAPD's West Valley 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the two schools sent letters to parents, and teachers have discussed 
the attacks in class with students. Also, police officers have increased 
patrols around the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it is the return to a frustratingly necessary state of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a call to alarm again," said Northridge Middle School Principal Dan 
Balderrama. "I think everything got a little more relaxed with the passage of 
time, but this lets us know we can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
 In letters written in English and Spanish sent home with students Tuesday and 
Wednesday, school officials told parents about the attacks and warned them to 
tell their children to be vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked parents not to let their children walk to school alone, to tell them 
not to speak to strangers . . .," said Langdon Avenue Principal Beryl Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attack occurred about 8:15 a.m. Tuesday when a 13-year-old student 
from Reseda was walking alone to Northridge Middle School, 17960 Chase St., 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the girl was about two blocks from the school, a man approached her and 
asked for directions, Peloquin said. She gave him directions and continued 
walking, ignoring the man's request that she help him find the address, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man followed her, put a pistol to her head and pulled her into an alley on 
Lindley Street near Roscoe Boulevard where he sexually assaulted her, Peloquin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After she was released, the girl told school officials who called police, 
Balderrama said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was treated at a hospital and released to her father, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker, who escaped, is described as a Latino man, 20 to 24 years old, 
5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8, 130 to 140 pounds, and wearing a black-and-green baseball 
cap, long-sleeve sweat shirt and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The other attack occurred April 20 about 7:30 a.m., when a third-grader at 
Langdon Avenue school escaped unharmed after she was chased by a man who 
offered to buy her a Barbie doll if she got into his car, said Detective Sandra 
Palmer of the LAPD's Devonshire station. 
</P>
<P>
 After she refused to get in the car, the man got out and briefly ran after 
her, police said. As the man grabbed at her, he apparently unclasped her 
backpack, which the girl left on the ground after she ran away, police said. 
The girl was unharmed.

BOARD ACCUSES PSYCHOLOGIST OF BILLING FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Encino psychologist has been accused by state medical regulators of 
submitting fraudulent bills for thousands of dollars to a fund that pays for 
counseling and other help for victims of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenifer Cochagne-Olsen also peddled vitamins and face creams to patients 
during psychotherapy sessions at her home, and treated one client while 
simultaneously holding a yard sale, the state Board of Psychology charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochagne-Olsen, 44, faces revocation of her medical license if found guilty of 
the charges by an administrative judge. No hearing date has been set. She has 
held a California psychologist's license since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, Ronald A. Litt, said Cochagne-Olsen is a talented therapist who 
made some bookkeeping errors but has since instituted a better billing system 
and is repaying overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't one of those big scam things," he said. "This lady is just sloppy 
with organizational skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochagne-Olsen was convicted last year in Los Angeles Municipal Court of a 
misdemeanor count of falsely billing the state victims fund, which reimburses 
uninsured medical expenses, lost wages and funeral costs for people victimized 
by violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 She was placed on probation for three years and ordered to pay more than 
$56,000 in restitution to the state, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate disciplinary action filed by the psychology board in February, 
Cochagne-Olsen was accused of submitting phony bills for scores of 
psychotherapy sessions in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The state pays up to $90 per 
hour for such treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, she "grossly inflated" the number of therapy sessions some 
clients received, the board said. She also allegedly billed in her name for 
sessions actually conducted by an unlicensed assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 During many therapy sessions, the board charged, Cochagne-Olsen tried to sell 
her patients vitamins and face creams, or persuade them to sell vitamins for 
her. As part of one session, she even drove a patient to a vitamin distributor 
in the San Fernando Valley for a sales orientation class, the board asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cochagne-Olsen allegedly wrote personal letters while conducting 
therapy and allegedly offered to split the proceeds if one patient agreed to 
help her overcharge the victims fund. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, Cochagne-Olsen "conducted a psychotherapy session in her yard 
while simultaneously conducting a yard sale," the board's complaint charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy state Atty. Gen. Anne L. Mendoza, who represents the board, said most 
of Cochagne-Olsen's clients were low-income Latinos badly traumatized by crimes 
including rape, sexual molestation and beatings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A therapist ripped off a mental health care fund," said Mendoza. "Those funds 
have limited dollars. By diverting money from that fund, she was denying other 
victims of violent crimes mental health care coverage, which is appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Cochagne treated the victims-of-crime fund like a personal slush fund. 
Therapists are not permitted to pimp products and get a tan while billing for 
therapy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims fund paid out nearly $70 million in fiscal 1992-93, a spokesman 
said. Claims have consistently outstripped available money for several years, 
and the Legislature recently approved an emergency infusion of $44 million for 
the current fiscal year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said Cochagne-Olsen submitted claims totaling more than $100,000, and 
a "significant portion" of that was fraudulent. She added that an exact figure 
was difficult to determine since Cochagne-Olsen kept no meaningful records on 
patient visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Litt, however, said the billings came to about $56,000, and of that only 
$5,000 to $6,000 was questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochagne-Olsen has a heavy client load and sometimes tried to "reconstruct" 
her patient schedule from memory weeks after she had seen them, resulting in 
billing errors, Litt said. She has since learned to use a computer and has 
improved her record-keeping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Litt said the psychologist did try to sell her patients vitamins and face 
creams, but only before and after therapy sessions. She no longer keeps such 
products in her house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since she did everything in her home, the line was blurred. All those things, 
anyway, were holistic vitamins," Litt said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Cochagne-Olsen did counsel one patient while bustling in and 
out of the house to talk with yard sale customers. But he said that was no more 
serious an offense than a doctor interrupting a patient examination for a few 
minutes to take a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the allegation that Cochagne-Olsen billed in her name for therapy 
performed by an unlicensed assistant, Litt said she had employed a psychologist 
who was certified in another state. Cochagne-Olsen has since dismissed the 
assistant until she acquires her California license, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Litt said Cochagne-Olsen has repaid about $11,000 in overcharges and plans to 
pay more in an amount that remains to be negotiated with state officials.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; BROTHERS MAKE WAVES WITH SUB THEY DESIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people would be concerned if they were in a submarine that filled with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Bill and Bob Nicoloff. They designed their craft, the Pelagic Cruiser, 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge brothers don wet suits, scuba gear and bicycle shoes with 
cleats before cruising in their non-pressurized sub, which they have entered in 
two races against other human-powered subs since completing the craft in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nicoloffs placed second in March at the West Coast Submarine Invitational, 
a Guinness World Records challenge held in Escondido. They posted a speed of 
5.5 knots, or about 6 m.p.h., in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nicoloffs were pitted against teams from university engineering 
departments as well as employees from Boeing, Lockheed and other giants of U.S. 
industry. The Nicoloffs, by contrast, designed and built their sub in their 
parents' garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The craft, about 11 feet long, travels underwater at depths from 5 to 15 feet, 
and the Nicoloffs can stay in it for as long as their tanks will supply air. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Nicoloff, 31, saw human-powered submarine races on TV in 1991, wanted to 
compete and decided to build a sub. A 1992 graduate of Cal State Northridge, 
Bill was studying production operations management, not engineering. He now 
works for a company called Rotoflow in Gardena, which makes turbines for gas 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sub is strictly a hobby," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers are avid scuba divers. Bob, 29, a medical student at USC, ran 
regularly and competed in triathlons, so Bill had no difficulty talking his 
brother into the idea of pedaling the sub. After a month of research in the 
engineering library at UCLA and drawings on Bob's personal computer, the 
Nicoloffs made models and dragged them through their swimming pool at their 
parents' house. 
</P>
<P>
 Using their poolside observations and extensive calculations, they began the 
fabrication process. Bill and Bob took turns lying on the grass in scuba 
equipment and bending steel rods around each other. Bill was in the steering 
position and Bob pedaled. The rods were welded together and used to form the 
fiberglass hull. Bill describes the shapes in engineering terminology of "skin 
drag" and "laminar flow," then simply says, "It looks a lot like a fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob says that the submarine idea was a natural progression from a childhood of 
working with Bill on projects from rockets to go-carts and cars. The Pelagic 
Cruiser cost about $4,000 and took about 800 hours to build. Other teams, which 
often have corporate sponsors, can spend about $30,000 building their crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a lot of fun," Bob says. "We had no idea the amount of time it 
would take. It wasn't like dealing with a large group of people. Some other 
teams had a lot of difficulty producing a sub. The flow of it was very easy. It 
was just the two of us and Bill always had sort of veto power over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Nicoloffs are not sponsored, they plan to compete in the next 
human-powered submarine races in Florida in June. In 1993, they came in third 
in a field of over 40 subs at the Florida races. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob says he is quite competitive. "I'll find a way to be there," he says. RAY 
PATTERSON

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; STUDENTS PAINT A LOOK AT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some children view their neighborhoods as part of a larger city or as big, 
open playgrounds, while others envision the ocean -- replete with octopuses and 
sharks -- right in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 These images appeared in posters drawn, colored and painted by elementary 
school children for the first annual "I Love My Neighborhood" poster contest 
sponsored by the Glendale Clean Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee, composed of business people and officials from the city and the 
Glendale Unified School District, received about 3,500 entries from children in 
18 of the district's elementary schools and several parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand-prize winner Arpa Aghajani's poster depicts a towheaded youngster 
thinking about his neighborhood in a heart-shaped bubble -- a form common to 
cartoons. In the bubble are two multicolored homes smiling at one another and a 
sun with a happy face. 
</P>
<P>
 The words "I Love My Neighborhood" appear off to the side of the bubble, done 
up in bright primary colors with black polka dot and plaid patterns drawn over 
the letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpa, 11, was all smiles when committee members revealed at an awards ceremony 
last week that her first-place poster would be professionally reproduced and 
put up throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really surprised -- I had no idea," the sixth-grader at Balboa School 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpa and other schoolchildren who garnered a first, second or third prize in 
the contest received crayons, dolls and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Lurie from Monte Vista School, a third-place winner in the fifth-grade 
category, enclosed her neighborhood in a rectangle with the words "cool 
schools, no traffic, cool neighbors, nice people, nice scenery," encircling it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Marc Wells from Glenoaks School wrote on his poster "Everyone in 
the world is my neighbor." He drew a circle of people with each one 
representing a different nationality, including Vietnamese, Thai, German, 
Greek, Irish, Russian, Armenian and Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest was designed to help children take pride in their communities, 
said Lynda Rocamora, Board of Education member. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of pride will help youngsters take care of the neighborhood they live 
in by recycling, watching out for their neighbors and taking care of their 
homes, said Lin Weeshoff, a fifth-grade teacher at Cerritos School. JENNIFER

ON THE ISSUE / INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS: REJECTING A TEST MANDATED 
BY THE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District voted 3 to 2 last week not to 
administer the California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) test, which critics 
say contains essay questions challenging authority and traditional family 
values and does not adequately measure students' academic learning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should schools be allowed to refuse administering the CLAS test and if so 
what, if anything, should they do instead to measure student progress? 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Opdahl, mother of a junior at Quartz Hill High School in the Antelope 
Valley: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that they should be refusing to give the test. The test is 
state mandated and I don't think there's anything wrong with the test. The 
argument from the group objecting to it is it dealt with people's feelings. (A 
teacher meeting with parents) explained they had removed that from the CLAS 
test, but these people are using the (tactic) we're all familiar with of 
repeating things. My biggest complaint is they're taking freedom away from my 
child. My child as a high school student should have the opportunity to take a 
state-mandated test and they took that freedom away. If they want to excuse 
people from taking the test . . . that is a choice, of course, and I'm not 
going to argue with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale): 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should be allowed to make a decision as to what test they give 
to their students. There are choices as to what test they can give. . . . Essay 
questions may be better in some cases, but not all. I think there should be a 
combination. . . . There should be some time to evaluate the ability of the 
student to punctuate, spell and evaluate a sentence properly. All the questions 
that relate to family life . . . are not within the authority of the school 
system and they should not be involved in the school structure." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), author of legislation calling for the 
CLAS test: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be chaotic if school districts were to pick and choose which items 
they are going to follow. . . . We need to have some system of measuring our 
expenditure in the public school system. I'm familiar with the procedures of 
the Department of Education and there is no other test. It was determined that 
we ought to discontinue (the multiple choice) method if we are serious about 
preparing students for the 21st Century -- the multi-choice bubble won't do it. 
Life and work are serious shades of gray and we need more than anything else to 
get students to think critically and address complicated problems. . . . Part 
of my legislation to reauthorize this program would broaden the group that is 
selecting test questions . . . so it would involve parents and citizens in 
addition to educators." 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Pricer, president of the Antelope Valley Union High School District 
board, who voted not to administer the CLAS test: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what local control is all about. If something is flawed, incorrect or 
inappropriate, the board still legally has the right (to refuse to comply) 
until other legislation is pushed through. . . . We've had traditional tests 
that we've used for years that really seem to do the job to measure academics. 
. . . The CLAS tests are basically done by story lines and prompts, so there 
are actually no absolutes, no correct answers, but it prompts you towards the 
answers they want. The old tests had absolute answers. . . . This one does not 
test academics. I've talked with college professors who say this test does 
nothing to measure learning mathematically."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; GROUP TO FORM OPTIMIST CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to reach out to youths in the community, a citizens activist 
group will form the first Optimist Club in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimist Clubs develop after-school activities, build playgrounds and provide 
other services geared toward children in their community.There are more than 
4,000 clubs nationwide. Last year, Optimist Clubs raised more than $31 million 
and sponsored 55,000 youth projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big benefit for North Hills will be to get members of the community in 
one group that meet on a regular basis and to get kids involved in community 
work themselves," William Bratly, 52, governor of the Optimist Club Pacific 
Southwest District, which includes about 100 clubs with nearly 3,000 members, 
told the North Hills Community Coordinating Council's Community Outreach 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hills, apartment tenants, landlords, merchants and homeowners plan to 
focus their attention on projects tailored to the youths in their community, 
Bratly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first projects would be to raise funds to put a gym floor in the 
United Methodist Church for the kids to have a safe place to play," Bratly 
said. Cost to convert the concrete floor to a hardwood floor could reach 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fink, 38, a member of the Community Outreach Committee, believes that 
the Optimist Club will inspire youths to take pride in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to model how to become productive members of the community," 
Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first meeting of the Optimist Club will be held at 6:30 p.m. May 11 at the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 15314 Rayen St., North Hills. 
At least 25 adults are needed for a club. EFF SCHNAUFEROPTIMIST INTERNATIONAL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; DEVINE PASSED OVER AS MAYOR PRO TEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exposing fractured relations among officials in the 3-year-old city of 
Calabasas, the City Council has excluded one of its own from the post of mayor 
pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lesley Devine was passed over for the alternate mayor position, 
becoming the only member of the five-person council not to hold the job that 
usually leads to the largely ceremonial mayoral seat the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't approve of the way she handles staff, and I don't appreciate the way 
she represents the council," said Councilman Marvin Lopata, who nominated 
colleague Dennis Washburn for mayor pro tem. "It has nothing to do with the way 
she votes." 
</P>
<P>
 In small cities such as Calabasas, the council rather than the electorate 
chooses the mayor pro tem and mayor. The jobs usually are passed along on a 
rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn, who served as mayor the year after the city incorporated in 1991, 
was appointed mayor pro tem at a special April 19 meeting of the City Council 
by a 4-1 vote. Karyn Foley, who was mayor pro tem last year, replaced Lopata as 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Devine cast the lone vote against the reorganization. She said she didn't want 
to discuss her differences with other council members in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor pro tem is a ceremonial position, as is the mayor," Devine said. 
"It's not one that I particularly need." 
</P>
<P>
 Several community members who closely follow City Council business expressed 
dismay that Devine was not chosen mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for the rotation system in the city to continue," said 
Jacob E. Klein, founder of the Deer Springs Homeowners Assn. "I think if we, 
the electorate, elect a council member, they are qualified to be mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Toby Keeler, who was appointed by Devine, went further. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that this is a slap in the face to every citizen that voted for 
council member Devine," Keeler said at last week's meeting. "Not only that, I 
feel it will further divide a city that suffers feelings of 
disenfranchisement." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make," Foley 
said. "But I received many calls from private citizens who empathized with our 
having to make the decision and understood the situation." KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; ISRAELI CHIEF RABBI VISITS VALLEY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the highest figures in the Jewish religion awed a group of junior high 
students when he visited their Sherman Oaks school Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, chosen in February as one of Israel's two chief 
rabbis, spoke to students in grades six through eight at Emek Hebrew Academy, 
the oldest and largest Orthodox Jewish day school in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Bakshi-Doron stopped at the school during the first day of his visit to Los 
Angeles. Earlier this year, he was elected chief rabbi for the Sephardic Jews 
of Israel, whose roots are in North Africa and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the school, it's a tremendous honor," said Joshua Bittan, whose four 
children attend the academy, and who helped organize the chief rabbi's visit. 
"And for him to get to know the community is also an important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The junior high girls awaiting Bakshi-Doron's arrival sat stiffly and looked 
nervous until the door opened and the chief rabbi walked into the classroom 
trailer wearing a royal blue turban and a long black robe with gold embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to the girls first -- Orthodox Jewish students are seated separately 
by gender -- the chief rabbi said in Hebrew he believed it is important for him 
to visit Los Angeles because of the 600,000 Jews living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But he questioned how many strictly practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
 'Are they really Jews?" he asked. "Are they behaving like Jews? Are they 
keeping the Sabbath, are they learning the Torah, are they keeping kosher? Are 
they keeping the Jewish heritage?" 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken chief rabbi looked out at the girls in their school uniforms 
and sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can already see the answer in this room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bakshi-Doron spoke briefly on the importance of a Hebrew education, he 
allowed the students to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shy at first, they soon started raising their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Rina Raphael began her question in English, but some of the academy's rabbis 
loudly urged her to speak Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous," the 12-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 But mustering her courage, Rina asked the chief rabbi in Hebrew whether Israel 
should give up the Golan Heights to Palestinians to secure peace. 
</P>
<P>
 He answered only that it was a difficult decision because so many Jews have 
invested their lives there. The students should pray for a solution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakshi-Doron answered a few more students' inquiries and then posed a question 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which ones of you would like to go up to Israel?" 
</P>
<P>
 All the girls raised their hands as Bakshi-Doron walked out of the room to 
speak to the boys' classes.  
</P>
<P>
 As the door shut, the girls leaped from their seats to talk about the chief 
rabbi's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very special," said Hamutal Sheetrit, 11. REBECCA BRYANT

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; RECREATION CENTER WILL OPEN IN PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recreation center offering everything from karate exhibitions to dance 
courses is set to open in Pacoima's Paxton Park by early June, park officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, on 10736 Laurel Canyon Blvd., will probably be named the Ritchie 
Valens Community Center, said Paxton Park Director Art Gomez.Valens, who hailed 
from Pacoima, was a rock star.

 "It's basically going to be a recreation center to meet the needs of the 
community, from preschool to adults," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will include a preschool, a gym, a stage and sound system, and 
possibly a day-care facility, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will house dance classes for children and adults, karate and boxing classes 
and exhibitions, youth and adult basketball and volleyball leagues, and will be 
used as a multicultural conference center.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacoima's new Hispanic Chamber of Commerce will also meet at the center once a 
month, Gomez said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PROSTITUTES TOLD TO AVOID SPECIFIC AREAS

<P>
 Two convicted prostitutes Thursday became the first women in the San Fernando 
Valley to be ordered to avoid high-crime neighborhoods as part of a new program 
to crack down on streetwalking. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Greene, 42, of North Hollywood and Regina Garcia, 44, of Sun Valley both 
pleaded no contest Thursday in Van Nuys Municipal Court to misdemeanor charges 
of prostitution.It was the first prostitution conviction for each. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Martin Suits sentenced each woman to two days in County Jail, ordered 
them to submit to AIDS tests and placed them on probation for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their probation, Greene and Garcia became the first convicted 
prostitutes in the Valley to be handed maps that detail areas associated with 
prostitution. The women are prohibited from talking to motorists, sitting in 
parked cars or loitering between the hours of 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both received the three-page map outlining the area they are supposed to 
stay away from," Deputy City Atty. Kenneth D. Tso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will maintain a list of everyone who receives the map following a 
prostitution conviction and will be able to arrest women engaged in suspicious 
activity in the prohibited areas. Those arrested will be charged with violating 
probation and could be sentenced to jail for up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities insist that Greene, Garcia and those to be convicted in the future 
are not being banned from any area. Rather, they are prohibited from activities 
most often associated with prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The areas detailed on the map include most of Sepulveda, Ventura, Lankershim 
and Reseda boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program became effective last year in Hollywood, and authorities 
said it has had a noticeable effect there. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; COLLEGE'S WRITING CENTER GOES DIGITAL

 The second R now stands for ROM at Los Angeles Valley College.  
</P>
<P>
 Students who were trained on the three Rs of reading, writing and arithmetic 
now have computers to bring them up to speed in the Van Nuys community 
college's revamped Writing Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make high-tech tutoring available to students," said Lynn 
Marshall, a supervising tutor for the Writing Center, which was dedicated 
Thursday in Humanities Building Room 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Apple computers are now available to students who visit the center each 
week for writing help. The free tutorial service tackles problems in spelling, 
essay writing, grammar and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing Center officials hope the new computers will ease the burden on the 
program's 12 tutors, who see more than 250 students each week.  
</P>
<P>
 In the old room, Marshall said, the only equipment was a set of dictionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure we'll program the computers for some sort of quick tutorial service 
if we have a bunch of students who come in with the same writing problem," 
Marshall said. "It would provide basic services that we find ourselves doing 
repeatedly, and it saves us time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Writing Center, including the computers and tutors' salaries, is funded by 
a $200,000 grant from a nonprofit group, the Alliance for the Advancement of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers, which were installed Monday, also have CD-ROM drives, scanners 
and a color printer and soon could offer students access to the so-called 
information superhighway to improve composition and structure, said Steve 
Whitney, Writing Center manager. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MURDER SUSPECT TO BE TRIED AS ADULT

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a Juvenile Court judge ruled he should be prosecuted as an adult, a Van 
Nuys teen-ager was charged Thursday with murdering a 23-month-old boy who was 
allegedly thrown against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Rodriguez, who recently turned 18, was charged in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court in the Jan. 10, 1993, death of Jesus Aguilar.Rodriguez was 16 at the time 
of the child's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Rodriguez was throwing Jesus and another young child across a 
room into a pile of pillows, but Jesus missed the pillows and smashed into a 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was just playing with the child," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert 
L. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus died from a massive skull fracture and other injuries to his body, 
according to a coroner's autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rodriguez may not have had the intent to kill Jesus, prosecutors say he 
should be convicted of murder because his actions were so inherently dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was living with Josie Aguilar, the mother of the child, in an 
apartment in the 8000 block of Woodman Avenue, where the incident occurred. At 
the time, Josie Aguilar, who was then 19, was eight months pregnant with a 
child fathered by Rodriguez, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 9-year-old boy who was in the apartment at the time told police he heard 
banging coming from the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge ruled Wednesday that Rodriguez was not fit to be prosecuted in 
Juvenile Court and ordered him tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is scheduled to appear in court today for an arraignment. He is 
currently being held by juvenile authorities, and prosecutors said they will 
ask that bail be set at $1 million. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; REWARDS PLANNED FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In hopes of cleaning up streets in his district, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon announced plans Thursday to start a $5,000 reward fund for 
residents who tip police about illegal trash dumping on residential streets and 
alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference near a Sun Valley alley where dumping is common, Alarcon 
said he hopes that the reward fund will motivate residents to help police crack 
down on a problem that has been plaguing the northeast San Fernando Valley for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each person who provides police information that leads to the arrest of a 
person or persons for illegal dumping may be rewarded $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipsters who see illegal dumping should call police immediately by dialing 
911, an Alarcon spokeswoman said. But if illegally dumped trash is found on a 
street and no culprit has been seen, tipsters should call the community 
relations office of the local police division, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward money is funded from a special district cleanup account provided to 
each council member. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN, 73, ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 73-year-old North Hollywood man was charged Thursday with sexually 
assaulting three female family members, two of whom allege they were attacked 
nearly 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a felony arrest warrant filed in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Paul Edward 
Barber was charged with 10 felony counts, including charges of continuous 
sexual abuse of the three alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges carry a potential prison sentence of 60 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Details on the case were sketchy Thursday afternoon, primarily because Barber 
had not yet been taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police began investigating the case last year when a girl, now 9 years 
old, came forward and said Barber molested her from June, 1992, until 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation continued, authorities turned up two other relatives, who 
are now 23 and 25, who said they were attacked in the summer of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 These older allegations were not the result of recovered memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege the attacks took place while the girls were visiting Barber 
in his home in the 10000 block of Keswick Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the statute of limitations on sexual assault charges prevents 
prosecutors from filing charges more than six years after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But an exception that became law only this year allows a criminal complaint to 
be filed, no matter how long ago the alleged offense occurred, when an adult 
alleges they were molested while a juvenile. This exception to the statute of 
limitations requires that there be "substantial sexual conduct" as well as 
corroborating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to comment on what corroborates the allegations made in 
relation to the alleged attacks in 1976. THOM MROZEK

SUPERVISORIAL CANDIDATES SQUARE OFF AT VALLEY FORUM; ELECTION: FOUR CONTENDERS 
FOR 3RD DISTRICT SEAT MEET IN WOODLAND HILLS. RIVALS FOCUS ON COUNTY REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Board of Supervisor candidates squared off for the first 
time face-to-face Thursday night, with ex-firefighter Capt. Don Wallace trying 
to portray the front-runner, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, as a 
"career politician" who lacks the will power to reform county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, a veteran lawmaker who has raised nearly $1 million for the race, 
brushed aside Wallace's mild-mannered attacks and claimed he would use his 
experience at City Hall to bring fiscal responsibility to county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "County government has run amok," Yaroslavsky, who has been the City Council's 
budget expert for the past decade, told 50 people at a candidate's forum 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, attended by all four candidates for the 3rd District seat that 
retiring Supervisor Ed Edelman is leaving on Dec. 5, was sponsored by the 
Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In his presentation, Yaroslavsky cited recent county scandals involving secret 
pension deals and costly office remodeling as examples of excesses that would 
not escape his trained eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Also joining the fray were candidates Michael S. Hirsch, an environmental 
consultant from Van Nuys, and Elgin M. Trammell Sr., a Lake View Terrace 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the tension between Yaroslavsky and Wallace, who resigned his job 
as a top aide to Edelman to run, that dominated the evening's forensics. 
Wallace, who lives in Calabasas, claimed that he, not Yaroslavsky, was best 
equipped to shake up county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who has raised less than $20,000 for his campaign, said he was 
independent enough of special interest influence and money to bring about 
much-needed reforms. Wallace said he backed campaign finance reforms to curb 
the influence of political contributors to the supervisors and term limits for 
the county's elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yaroslavsky, who lives in the Fairfax district and has represented a 
predominantly Westside council district since 1975, has also insisted that he 
has the guts and tenacity to reform county government. 
</P>
<P>
 When he announced his candidacy on Dec. 8, Yaroslavsky said: "I am running 
because county government needs shaking up, and I intend to shake it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky also backs campaign finance reform, but told the audience he 
opposes term limits. After Wallace pointedly noted that Yaroslavsky had served 
nearly decades as a City Council member, Yaroslavsky said such longevity in 
office should not necessarily be seen as a negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge us by our performance," the city councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 3rd District includes most of the San Fernando Valley, Malibu, the Conejo 
Valley and the Westside, including Westwood, Brentwood and the Pacific 
Palisades. The contest has been a frustrating one for Wallace, who has been 
unable to raise money and has found Yaroslavsky to be an unwilling debating 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's ducking us," Wallace has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in addition to raising huge amounts of money, Yaroslavsky has 
secured a slew of endorsements, including ones from U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.), Mayor Richard Riordan, his council colleagues and from the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, the Los Angeles County 
Firefighters Assn. and the Democratic Party.

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS DAY LABORER GUIDELINES; AGOURA HILLS: CITY'S CASE HAS 
BEEN CLOSELY WATCHED BY OFFICIALS IN SEVERAL LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE 
CONSIDERING SUCH MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A state appellate court Thursday upheld an Agoura Hills law that prohibits day 
laborers from soliciting work from passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union, was previously 
upheld in 1991 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been closely watched by officials in several local cities that 
are considering similar measures. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
has also discussed a similar ordinance for the Ladera Heights area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 39-page opinion, a three-judge panel ruled that the city has the right to 
regulate the activity as it relates to local traffic safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the California and federal courts have considered ordinances which 
regulate solicitations in order to protect public safety and the free flow of 
traffic and have repeatedly held such ordinances serve the public interest," 
the court held. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also said there was insufficient evidence to prove that the Lost 
Hills-Malibu sheriff's station or any individual officer unfairly applied the 
ordinance to the mostly Latino men who congregate near the intersections of 
Kanan and Agoura roads in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the ACLU have said they had hoped to not only overturn the law 
but to also set a precedent to stifle future attempts by local governments to 
regulate day laborers' activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Toma, an attorney for the civil rights organization, said his and 
several human rights organizations that joined in filing the appeal will 
consider a number of legal options to challenge the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The group can request another appellate court hearing, ask the state Supreme 
Court to review the appellate court ruling or file a case in Superior Court 
challenging the way the Sheriff's Department applies the law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will consider all of those things very seriously because we believe it was 
incorrectly decided," Toma said. "If this law, as it's written, is enforced, 
then day laborers in Agoura Hills will be out of work, and their basic activity 
will be made a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills City Manager Terry Matz said he was pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're pleased that the ordinance that we had in place has been 
upheld again by a court of law," he said. "We always thought that the ordinance 
was valid and appropriately drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the law has been upheld, it is not easy to enforce, said Lt. Jim 
Pierson, operations commander at the Lost Hills-Malibu sheriff's station, 
because of manpower shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we probably cited more drivers than day workers," Pierson said. "In 
all the time the ordinance existed, I don't think we've issued 55 citations."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: WU TAKES CAMPAIGN BREAK TO PAY RESPECTS TO 'POLITICAL 
MENTOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 NIXON-ESQUE?: Clever, inept or sincere? Take your pick on how to describe 43rd 
Assembly District candidate Julia Wu's decision Monday to suspend her personal 
campaigning for several days to mourn the death of former President Richard M. 
Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College board trustee said she wanted to attend the 
Nixon funeral in Yorba Linda and pay her respects to her "political mentor" 
rather than campaign. Wu, an immigrant from Taiwan, said Nixon inspired her to 
get involved in GOP politics soon after she came to the United States and he 
later appointed her to a national commission of librarians. 
</P>
<P>
 On its face the move was peculiar because Wu is locked in a tight race with 
Glendale Municipal Court Judge James Rogan. Wu and Rogan are the top-ranked 
Republicans in the May 3 election, vying for the Assembly seat Pat Nolan held 
until February, when he resigned after pleading guilty to political 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 With the election only a week away, Wu seemed to be needlessly handicapping 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was she?  
</P>
<P>
 Some observers speculated that Wu may have been mixing genuine sadness with a 
large dollop of politics. In effect, was Wu trying to draw attention to her 
deep Republican roots -- and by doing so further contrast them with Rogan's 
more tenuous GOP lineage? 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, it will be recalled, was a member of the Los Angeles County Democratic 
Party Central Committee who only joined the Republican Party in 1988, albeit 
with some fanfare. Then-Sen. Pete Wilson even introduced the youthful Rogan as 
trophy convert to the GOP cause at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's switcheroo has been criticized by Wu, Los Angeles Police Department 
Officer Peter Repovich, also a Republican candidate for the 43rd District, and 
Democrat Adam Schiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney. All have said that 
Rogan's change in party registration is a character issue. Wu has even accused 
Rogan of changing parties so he could win a judgeship from Republican Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opportunist" is what Wu has called Rogan in perhaps the strongest attack yet 
on the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if it were cleverly calculated to gain some political mileage, Wu's 
gesture this week must indeed be recorded as a near-perfect tribute to Richard 
Nixon.

 HONDA PULLS OUT: Van Nuys contractor David Honda last week announced via news 
release that he has decided not to run for the 20th Senate District seat, the 
post now held by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican moderate, who ran well but out of the money in the 1992 special 
election for the same seat, said he has too many family, business and civic 
commitments on his plate to continue his political quest this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one way of putting it. 
</P>
<P>
 But not mentioned in the statement is that Honda's latest political bid has 
been under a cloud since March 21, when election officials ruled that he had 
failed to qualify for the June 7 GOP primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: Honda needed to submit a nominating petition with the names of at 
least 40 registered GOP voters. Election officials could only find 36 qualified 
names out of the 57 Honda submitted. Unless reversed, the ruling meant Honda's 
name would not be on the ballot -- a crippling blow. 
</P>
<P>
 According to people familiar with election laws, other candidates have been 
put on the ballot with fewer than the required signatures. But obtaining such 
an exception takes a lawsuit and a judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Honda statement also failed to mention that it may have been nearly 
suicidal for Honda to run now, only weeks after the defeat of the highly 
charged Roberti recall effort. Why? Because in a GOP primary dominated by 
Roberti-haters, Honda undoubtedly would have been excoriated by not a few of 
his Republican foes for his 1992 decision to endorse Roberti over Republican 
Carol Rowen in that year's runoff election. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 ENDORSEMENT DERBY: Local chapters of the California Republican Assembly, 
keepers of the conservative flame, held an endorsement convention last weekend 
and came out backing realtor Dolores White for the 20th Senate District GOP 
primary. White's victory came on the third ballot. Her major challenger was 
retired green grocer Al Dib, who is becoming a perennial candidate. Both White 
and Dib ran in the recall election against Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Also endorsed by the CRA were Municipal Judge Rogan, one of half a dozen 
Republicans running for the 43rd Assembly District seat formerly held by Nolan; 
and Mark Boos Benhard, who is running in the GOP primary for the 24th 
Congressional District. The incumbent is U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 All the prominent 24th District candidates personally showed up at the CRA 
convention to lobby for the endorsement. But Benhard, a former aide to former 
Rep. William Dannemeyer, easily vanquished the opposition, including Richard 
Sybert, whom most pundits call the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's own mistress of conservatism, Sara Hardman, a state CRA vice 
president, said Sybert failed because he is pro-choice, because he's a newcomer 
to the 24th District (having moved into the district from Pasadena a year ago) 
and, perhaps worst of all, he was a close adviser to Pete Wilson. "We in the 
CRA are not too happy with Wilson," said Hardman, who co-owns a company that 
makes infant highchairs for restaurants. At its state convention, the CRA 
earlier this month endorsed millionaire businessman Ron Unz for governor in the 
GOP primary.

 FERRARO FETE: If you ever entertained the idea that City Council President 
John Ferraro would not seek reelection next year after nearly three decades at 
City Hall, you weren't at his $250-a-plate fund-raiser Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 people showed up to pay homage to the 69-year-old Ferraro, who 
represents Toluca Lake and a good deal of North Hollywood, and to lay down cash 
to support his 1995 reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those was Mayor Richard Riordan who, with a grin, told the audience that 
he learned at Nixon's funeral that Ferraro had led the delegates in giving the 
Pledge of Allegiance at the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles that 
nominated John F. Kennedy for President. But, Riordan, a Republican, told the 
crowd that he was ready to "forgive" Ferraro for his Democratic Party roots.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, now running for the Board of 
Supervisors and seeking to become the high potentate of the cash-rich 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority if he moves to the county, was working 
the tables, shaking hands and schmoozing so hard that he probably missed the 
mayor's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's appetite for glad-handing was apparently not sated at his own 
fund-raiser (to finance his supervisorial race) among 1,000 guests at the 
Century Plaza the previous night. "I guess he didn't have enough and came back 
for more," said one observer.

WORK DELAYED ON ELECTRICAL FENCE FOR PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of a potentially lethal electrified fence around the state prison 
in Lancaster, slated to begin Wednesday, has been postponed for one month, 
interim Warden John Ratelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle said the state Department of Corrections notified him that 
construction of the fence now is set to begin on May 23.No reason for the delay 
was provided, prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the change, the fence will probably not be activated until the 
middle of next January, the warden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-foot-tall, electrified barrier will be placed between two 12-foot-tall 
chain-link fences that surround the area where nearly 4,000 medium- and 
maximum-security inmates are housed. Touching the electrified fence will cause 
immediate death, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle said the electrified fence, costing about $1 million, will allow the 
Lancaster prison to save more than $2 million annually by removing armed 
officers from 10 of the 12 watch towers surrounding the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fence is also expected to discourage escapes. A convicted murderer 
fled from the Lancaster prison last year by climbing over the chain-link 
fences. He was recaptured several hours later.

PARENT COMPLAINT HALTS WORK OF INMATES NEAR SCHOOL; SAUGUS: THE 14-MEMBER, 
SUPERVISED CREW WAS CLEARING BRUSH ON A HILLSIDE ADJACENT TO JAMES FOSTER 
ELEMENTARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The use of supervised state prison inmates to clear brush from a hillside 
surrounding a Saugus elementary school was halted after one day when a parent 
complained about the inmates' presence while students were at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Union School District officials agreed to have a Los Angeles County 
Fire Department inmate crew clear the brush after nearby homeowners expressed 
concern about a fire hazard on the hill below James M. Foster Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 14-inmate crew, who started the work Tuesday, are based at a 
camp in Acton and are assigned to work for the county Fire Department. Camp 
inmates are often used to help contain brush fires. They generally have been 
convicted of minor offenses such as drunken driving and small drug offenses, 
and are considered a low escape risk, said Ernie Golphenee, captain of the 
Acton camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmates worked during the school day but not when most students were 
arriving or leaving school and never went on school grounds, said Arthur Clark, 
assistant superintendent of business services for the school district. But he 
said district officials decided not to argue with the parent's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fire crew could finish (the brush clearance) in another three or four 
days," he said. "I only have a maintenance crew of five workers for the entire 
district, who I will have to take off other duties." 
</P>
<P>
 Golphenee said the inmates have completed similar projects in the area before, 
although never next to a school. The inmates were watched by two camp 
supervisors and a school district employee, and Golphenee said he did not 
consider the inmates a threat to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the same month we could be in the same area fighting a fire on a 
hillside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and grandparents with students enrolled at the school had mixed 
reactions to the use of the inmate crew. Pauline Adella said she saw the 
inmates when she picked her granddaughter up at midday Tuesday. Adella was not 
the parent who complained to district officials, but said she was not happy 
with the use of the inmates near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the inmates were all well-disciplined, sitting down as ordered far 
from students, but she still doesn't want them there. "I don't think it should 
be around the school," she said. "I don't think the county would bring anyone 
out here who is dangerous, but I still object to it." 
</P>
<P>
 David Herriford, a father of two boys at the school, said he is familiar with 
the county inmate crews and isn't concerned with the thought of them working 
outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent's complaint was met with anger by Jeanine Gilmore, president of the 
Saugus Canyon Homeowners Assn., who lives across the street from the school. 
She said the hillside is dangerous because numerous homes nearby have 
wood-shingle roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see one kid playing with matches or a lighter every day," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore said she is writing a letter to the school district asking them to 
bring back the inmates. She said she has one child at the school and two others 
at home, and the presence of the inmates never bothered her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They worked hard, they did a fantastic job, they didn't bother anyone," she 
said.

4 HELD IN STRING OF SANTA CLARITA BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four Santa Clarita residents have been arrested in connection with burglaries 
at more than 80 businesses in the area since December, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects, Gilbert Noriega, 38, of Newhall, was arrested early 
Wednesday morning during a burglary at a construction office, authorities 
said.Three other suspects were arrested later in the day. They are Javier 
Noriega, 37, and Thomas Allen Pitchford, 28, both of Newhall, and Adriane Donna 
Myers, 27, of Valencia, who police said owns the car used in Wednesday's 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been hurt in any of the break-ins, in which thieves tossed rocks, 
bricks or chunks of concrete to break glass doors or windows, then took 
merchandise, money and sometimes cash registers. Authorities said the thieves, 
who usually struck when the businesses were closed, took about $50,000 in cash 
and property and caused about $30,000 in damage during the five-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 A plainclothes deputy was working in the Newhall area about 2 a.m. Wednesday 
when he heard glass shattering and an alarm. Sgt. Lee White said he saw two men 
running from the office of Myler Construction Co. on Walnut Street. White said 
the pair jumped into a parked car and he chased them for about 10 blocks before 
arresting Gilbert Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchford, believed to be a passenger in the car, escaped on foot and was 
arrested later in the day as he was walking on the street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they are seeking additional suspects.

CITY COUNCIL SUPPORTS PACT TO BUILD COLLEGE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a non-binding agreement supporting the 
construction of a new community college campus on a 100-acre site just east of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote late Wednesday, the council resolved to expedite the land 
annexation and the processing of plans to construct the college, along with an 
adjacent housing and commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said it is too early to determine the traffic impact and 
increased demand for city services a college campus might create. But several 
council members said a college would enhance the quality of life in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very supportive of having a junior college in Palmdale," Mayor James 
Ledford said. "It's a plum." 
</P>
<P>
 "I completely and totally support" the agreement, Councilman David Myers 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The other parties in the pact are Lancaster-based Antelope Valley College, 
which would operate the new campus, and businessman David P. Bushnell, who has 
offered to donate 100 acres for the campus if his adjacent development project 
is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushnell, founder of the binocular company that bears his name, owns 540 acres 
in an unincorporated area near the southwest corner of 47th Street East and 
Barrel Springs Road. Bushnell has proposed the construction of a golf course, 
1,080 residential units, a small commercial center, parks and trails, all 
adjacent to the college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Kurki, president of Antelope Valley College, said he needed a show of 
support from the city before he travels to Sacramento on May 12 to ask state 
college officials to approve early plans for the Palmdale campus. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school, which would be expected to accommodate 10,000 students by 
the year 2010, is needed because enrollment at the existing campus in Lancaster 
will reach capacity within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurki said the city must complete an environmental impact review and issue a 
planning permit before Feb. 1, 1995, to allow him to apply for state funds to 
begin building roads, sewers and other infrastructure for the new campus. If 
that deadline is missed, local officials will have to wait another year to 
apply for the money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, Richard Heuser, a social worker who lives near the 
proposed campus, was the only speaker to criticize the plan. Heuser said he 
fears the college will generate traffic congestion and disrupt the rural 
lifestyle he enjoys.

PALMDALE EXTENDS FIREWORKS PERMIT DEADLINE; FUND-RAISERS: CITY ALSO DROPS 
TWO-YEAR WAIT FOR NEW NONPROFIT GROUPS TO SELL THE ITEMS. SOME HAVE TROUBLE 
FINDING LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To aid nonprofit groups that have had trouble lining up locations for selling 
Fourth of July fireworks, the Palmdale City Council has extended the deadline 
for obtaining fireworks sales permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also eliminated a two-year waiting period for new nonprofit groups 
that want to sell fireworks and erased a provision allowing groups to sell 
fireworks in the city simply because they had "Palmdale" in their names. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions were adopted unanimously by the council Wednesday as an urgency 
ordinance, so they take effect immediately. Under the revised law, the April 15 
deadline for obtaining a fireworks sales permit was extended to May 15 for this 
year only. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to do with people who have already started their applications but 
are having trouble securing the locations they've historically used," said 
Mayor James Ledford. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit groups must get a property owner's permission to set up a fireworks 
sales stand before they can obtain a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale is the only city in north Los Angeles County that allows the sale and 
use of state-approved "safe and sane" fireworks. The city permits nonprofit 
groups to sell these devices just before and after the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters oppose the products, but Palmdale residents in 1992 voted to 
continue fireworks sales, largely because of their value as a fund-raising 
tool. During a recent holiday period, fireworks sales generated more than 
$200,000 for Palmdale school groups, youth sports leagues, service clubs and 
charities.  
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, Councilman James Root said some community groups have 
had difficulty reserving sites this year because a new fireworks company has 
entered the market and leased many prime locations, often in front of 
supermarkets. Fireworks vendors lease the locations and then arrange with 
nonprofit groups to sell the supplier's products from the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are nonprofits that really got caught," Root said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Extending the permit deadline will give nonprofit groups more time to make 
arrangements to use these sites or to find new ones, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old law, nonprofit groups had to operate in Palmdale for two years 
before they could apply for a fireworks sales permit. But a parent from 
Palmdale Swim Boosters protested that after spending almost two years to obtain 
nonprofit status from the state, it was unfair to ask the group to wait another 
two years to sell fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to this complaint, the council dropped the two-year-wait 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The fireworks law requires that sellers be nonprofit groups with 20 or more 
members. The group must meet in Palmdale or draw more than 50% of its active 
members from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A third option -- merely having "Palmdale" appear in the group's official name 
-- was deleted Wednesday because council members feared than a group from 
another city could divert fireworks sales from local organizations merely by 
adding "Palmdale" to its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members asked the city staff to look into other possible changes in 
the fireworks law that would not go into effect until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 These include reducing the number of stands, imposing more restrictions on 
which nonprofit groups can sell fireworks and prohibiting the use of fireworks 
near Angeles National Forest.

MCNALL BEING INVESTIGATED BY GRAND JURY; JURISPRUDENCE: KING OWNER'S LOAN 
DOCUMENTS AT CENTER OF PROBE. SALE OF THE TEAM COULD BE IN DOUBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King owner Bruce McNall is being investigated by a federal grand jury looking 
into whether he falsified loan documents, a development that has thrown into 
doubt his plan to sell a majority interest in the hockey team in a deal that 
was to have closed today. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for McNall confirmed to The Times on Thursday that an 
investigation had started. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Tom Pollack, a partner and criminal lawyer at Irell & 
Manella who has been retained by McNall, said: "An investigation is just an 
inquiry. Many such inquiries result in no government action. Mr. McNall 
believes that once the government completes its inquiry, no action will be 
taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack added that "to the best of my knowledge, this investigation does not 
involve any alleged wrongdoing on the part of the Los Angeles Kings." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the investigation told The Times that several key McNall 
employees received subpoenas last week at home and at McNall's offices 
requesting that bank and other financial records be turned over to a grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said that individuals have not yet been subpoenaed to testify 
before a grand jury. Sources said that the subpoenas were general in nature, 
and do not list specific loans. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's single largest lender is Bank of America, which is owed $92 million. 
Other banks that do business with McNall-affiliated companies include Bank of 
California and the French bank Credit Lyonnais, according to court records and 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the specifics of the investigation have not been made public, McNall 
has been accused of bank-related irregularities in court papers before. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed in February, Ira and Lawrence Goldberg, partners with 
McNall in Superior Stamp & Coin in Beverly Hills, alleged he misused company 
money for other ventures. In a sworn statement, Ira Goldberg said that McNall 
"falsified Superior's 1993 year-end inventory statement with the intent to 
mislead Superior's auditors and the Bank of California" by listing as Superior 
inventory -- and therefore as collateral -- coins that Goldberg says really 
belonged to a McNall-organized coin fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goldbergs alleged in the now-sealed documents that McNall used $4.6 
million from a bank credit line. They also said McNall used Superior money 
because he "desperately needed funds to maintain his other ventures and his 
extraordinary life style." A tentative settlement has been agreed to, but has 
not been made final. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is the latest in a growing list of problems for McNall, who 
last June was relishing in the success of the Kings for making the Stanley Cup 
finals and who has long enjoyed a reputation as having a golden touch when it 
comes to making money in rare coins and other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, 44, is being sued in New York for $28.3 million for allegedly 
defaulting on a loan to Dutch-owned European American Bank -- a debt he 
disputes even exists -- and also has agreed to pay Torrance-based Republic Bank 
$2.1 million after defaulting on a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Other creditors suing McNall for payments allegedly owed include the owner of 
the building where his offices are located for back rent, movie studio 
Twentieth Century Fox for allegedly failing to pay back money advanced on a 
film and a company that repaired a jet engine for the Kings' team plane. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also recently told Vanity Fair magazine he once routinely broke foreign 
export laws in his transactions with overseas coin and artifacts dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has been trying to sell 65% of the Kings for $60 million to 
telecommunications executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and partner Joseph Cohen as 
part of a larger effort to rid himself of his Bank of America loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of the Kings was supposed to be a major step in addressing McNall's 
growing financial problems, which have stemmed from such factors as steep debt 
payments, a soft market in rare coins and what he has described as a 
financially unfavorable lease the Kings have with the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale was approved last week by the NHL's board of governors, of which 
McNall is the chairman, and until the last few days appeared headed for 
conclusion when the investigation came to light. Sources close to Sudikoff and 
Cohen said that Sudikoff's prospective lenders -- believed to be insurance 
companies -- have been alarmed by the news and are reluctant to finance the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Sudikoff and Cohen said that the two remain committed to doing 
the deal and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources say that Sudikoff has been involved in intense talks with Bank 
of America to possibly finance the acquisition temporarily until questions 
surrounding the McNall investigation are cleared up, at which time Sudikoff 
would then secure permanent financing to pay off the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Sudikoff and Cohen drop out as prospective buyers, the future of the 
team would be thrown into doubt. Sources confirmed that Sudikoff has already 
paid some $4 million to help cover the Kings' payroll. He also is known to have 
financed the purchase of a $275,000 Rolls-Royce convertible that McNall 
presented to Wayne Gretzky in a highly publicized ceremony on March 30 after 
Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's NHL record for goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
 An NHL spokesman said Commissioner Gary Bettman had no comment.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; AL WEST MEDIOCRITY ALREADY A SORE POINT

 It has been 48 hours or so since the Angels returned to Anaheim under the 
cover of darkness. They returned in first place in the American League West, 
but their current 9-14 record isn't going to prompt any parades. 
</P>
<P>
 As General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "It's ridiculous to be in first place 
with that kind of record, and I'm sure some people will use it to indict the 
new format, but I think it's too early. I think the Angels and the rest of the 
division will play better as the year goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to wait to see what it looks like at the All-Star break. 
Right now, I have a tough time getting excited about being in first place and a 
tough time getting depressed over our record." 
</P>
<P>
 It's definitely early in this year of realignment, but the American League 
West threatens to become baseball's worst nightmare, ammunition for those who 
insisted that the new format would cheapen the division races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be very unfortunate if one of the division winners finished 
below .500," said Toronto Blue Jay General Manager Pat Gillick, a critic of the 
concept. "I don't know about an embarrassment, but it certainly wouldn't be a 
good advertisement for baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 At 9-14, the Angels would be 4 1/2 games behind the Chicago White Sox in the 
West Division of 1993. Their pace projects to 66 victories, which would be the 
fewest for a division or league champion. The 1918 Boston Red Sox hold that 
record with 75 victories in a 126-game season. The Red Sox beat the Chicago 
Cubs that year in a six-game World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "As bad as this is right now, if the season were to shut down today, we'd be 
going to the playoffs," Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy with our record, but the goal is to win the division (title) 
and go from there. I mean, despite the record, we'd have accomplished the 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, matched against the deepest and most competitive of 
baseball's six divisions through the first month, the four AL West teams are 
18-35 against the East. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Western teams have a cumulative record of 33-52, with the Oakland 
Athletics having lost 10 in a row and the Angels six of their last seven. They 
held the division lead until losing Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the A's general manager, Sandy Alderson: "I don't care about the division 
becoming baseball's worst nightmare. We're going through our worst right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alderson cited a flameout of the pitching staff, the loss of injured second 
baseman Brent Gates for six weeks and a recurrence of the heel injury that 
sidelined Mark McGwire for most of the 1993 season, now restricting the first 
baseman to designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were capable of winning the division and still do," Alderson 
said. "We won it when it was one of the strongest in baseball, and I'd be 
satisfied to win it again no matter how many wins are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very possible that a team will win a division at some point with 
a sub-.500 record, but I don't think that has as much to do with realignment as 
with the disparities in revenue. The first three weeks are Exhibit A for 
revenue sharing. I mean, if this is baseball's worst nightmare, there's a 
fundamental explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 Alderson cited the big-market revenues -- and payrolls -- of Toronto, 
Baltimore, Boston and New York in the East, and said, "The Central is more of a 
mixed bag, while the teams in the West have a lot less spending capability. The 
won-lost records are reflective of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillick, with his nightly sellouts in SkyDome and $40-million-plus payroll, 
said he couldn't dispute Alderson on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen studies that indicate the odds of winning in today's market are a 
hell of a lot better with a $40-million payroll," Gillick said. "I mean, the 
chances of a club winning with a $20-million payroll are almost nil. The Blue 
Jays didn't create the system, but until it changes we'll use our resources to 
the best of our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Blue Jays pursue a fourth consecutive division title, baseball 
owners will cite the revenue and competitive disparities during their 
collective bargaining bid for a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 They recently presented the players' union with financial figures and will 
soon begin the long-delayed talks. In the meantime, acting Commissioner Bud 
Selig said of the seemingly woeful West: 
</P>
<P>
 "These things run in cycles. If there's a weakness in one division but the 
others are competitive, that doesn't obviate the need to do what we did, to 
realign geographically and involve more teams in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a trend in the West, we hope it doesn't continue, but there's not 
a lot of concern yet. It's early. I think most people recognized that it would 
be tough to compete with the top four clubs in the East, and when you're 
playing a balanced schedule (with as many games out of the division as in), 
that could present trouble for another division or another group of teams." 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely has, but it should come as no surprise. Only one Western team 
has emerged with a winning record in 15 of the 25 years of division play. In 
that time, Western teams have finished with a better-than-.500 record 34 times, 
and below .500 55 times. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly no surprise to Bavasi, who predicted as much on the eve of the 
season when he said the Angels might have trouble competing in any of the other 
divisions but could definitely compete in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 He now looks at the Seattle Mariners' suspect bullpen, the Texas Rangers' 
shattered rotation and the A's myriad problems and knows it to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows that if the Angels can catch and throw consistently, if Mark Langston 
and Joe Magrane can return to augment Chuck Finley and Brian Anderson in the 
rotation, if Joe Grahe can save enough games, and reliever Troy Percival and 
starter Andrew Lorraine continue their triple-A progress with the possibility 
of a second-half recall . . . well, what he knows -- or at least believes -- is 
that in time the Angels will not have to slip their record home under the cover 
of darkness. AL Worst? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four teams in the new American League West Division, only Oakland has a 
record of better than .500 over the last 10 years. A breakdown:

USC RECRUITING CLASS STILL HAS WORK TO DO; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ELEVEN OF 30 
PLAYERS SIGNED IN FEBRUARY HAVE YET TO QUALIFY FOR ADMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months before the season opener against Washington, uncertainties about 
USC's football recruiting class remain. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Coach John Robinson is not sure how many of the 30 high school 
and junior college players he signed to scholarships in February will arrive in 
August. Eleven, including two highly regarded prep running backs, have yet to 
qualify for admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many recruiting experts have ranked this class among the five most 
talented in the nation, the praise is premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the 20 high school seniors are still waiting for either qualifying 
scores on college entrance exams or a C average in core curriculum, and six of 
the 10 junior college players must complete work for Associate of Arts degrees 
before being eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is confident most will make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our staff evaluated the talent out there and felt these risks were worth it," 
Robinson said. "We know we won't get them all in, but that's a gamble I'm more 
than comfortable taking. We wanted the best players possible." 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible under NCAA guidelines, high school recruits must maintain a 2.0 
grade-point average in core classes and score at least 17 points on the 
American College Test or 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Junior college 
players who weren't eligible coming out of high school must have completed 48 
credit hours and earned a degree if transferring after two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the academic questions concerning so many recruits, some have 
suggested that USC has lowered its admission standards for athletes, a 
suggestion school officials deny. Still, Robinson acknowledges, he might have 
more latitude in recruiting players who are considered academic risks than his 
predecessor, Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 In his six seasons at USC, Smith said he followed strict guidelines in 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before he was fired in December of 1992, Smith said he told school 
officials that something had to be done: either lower entry requirements or 
lower expectations on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something had to give because the situation was getting impossible," said 
Smith, now the coach at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that when he was hired, Mike McGee, the former athletic director, 
told him improving the graduation rate among football players was a top 
priority. Smith said he was told to recruit a certain number of his players at 
the high end of academic standing, a certain number in the middle and a certain 
number at the low end. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987-92, Smith had few academic casualties. Only five players he signed 
did not qualify, and one of them, Curtis Conway, made it in a year after 
retaking the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith signed 11 junior college players, never more than three in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our administration considered junior college players risky and a back-door 
option," Smith said. "Also, after my first year, we could only sign JC players 
who were not physical education majors, since we eliminated that study. That 
made it tough, since that was a common major." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee, now the athletic director at South Carolina, said he tried to raise 
standards at USC so athletics would not overload academic support services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to limit athletes who were academic risks," said McGee, who left USC 
in January of 1993. "I think our graduation rate improved every year." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee was replaced by Mike Garrett, a former running back and Heisman Trophy 
winner at USC. As USC's associate athletic director, Garrett helped hire 
Robinson, who had previously coached the Trojans from 1976-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson had only one month to recruit after getting the job and signed only 
15 players. But two, running back Saladin McCullough of Pasadena Muir and 
linebacker Treyvone Towns of Pasadena, did not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough's case has been particularly embarrassing and frustrating for USC. 
After reportedly failing to score at least 700 on the PSAT, a preliminary test 
for high school juniors, McCullough nearly doubled his score on the SAT. But 
testing officials examined the result after someone tipped them to the 
discrepancy, and after a drawn-out investigation, nullified the result. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough has not played football or attended classes since high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McCullough probably would have played last season, the setback did 
not deter Robinson from going after more potential academic risks. Garrett has 
supported his coach's recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just more aggressive in our approach to recruiting," Garrett said. 
"The bottom line is, more kids are attracted to USC because of John Robinson. 
The quality of players we signed is stunning and a tribute to the great job the 
coaches did of selling USC." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 junior college players signed by Robinson were the most in the Pacific 
10 Conference. Garrett said USC has above average JC admission policies in the 
conference by not accepting Ds and requiring 75% of coursework to be academic 
in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 After an 8-5 season, Robinson said he recruited junior college players heavily 
because of the many immediate needs to be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a deficit position as far as talent goes, and JC players can step 
right in," Robinson said. "This is something our staff knew we'd need to do 
when we took over, so we identified several players to go after and began 
making sure they were taking the right courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just did our job. But nobody is getting in who doesn't qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also recruited some of the country's most talented high school 
players. Kicker Adam Abrams of La Jolla Bishop's, defensive lineman Darrell 
Russell of San Diego St. Augustine and running back Rodney Sermons of La Puente 
Bishop Amat were among the most recruited at their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But a quarter of those who signed have not qualified. They include defensive 
backs Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir and Prentice Hill of Dallas Carter, defensive 
lineman George Perry of San Bernardino and running backs Marlin Carey of San 
Diego Mt. Carmel and Delon Washington of Dallas Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Antoine Simpson of La Porte, Tex., had not qualified when he 
signed his letter of intent, but recently passed the ACT. 
</P>
<P>
 Because colleges can no longer offer scholarships to athletes who do not meet 
NCAA eligibility requirements, Robinson realizes some slots will go unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, this is something done all of the time," he said. "It's a 
question that we were willing to take the risks for the type of talent we're 
talking about. Other schools are also doing it. I know we won't get everybody 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the recruits who have not qualified would probably play right away. 
Carey and Washington each rushed for more than 1,500 yards last season. Haslip 
is a quick defender who has the nation's fastest times this season in the 
110-high hurdles and 300 hurdles. And Perry, 6 feet 6 and 245 pounds, is one of 
the biggest and most versatile recruits, having played six positions in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The players say USC coaches were aware of their academic troubles, but did not 
back off. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, perhaps the top prospect, said he had not taken the ACT until last 
December and needed to do so in order to visit USC. He said he scored 16 and is 
awaiting the results of his second try. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches all told me that the minute I got a 17, I was in," Washington 
said. "They told me if I didn't get in, I could go to a junior college and try 
again next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a Dallas recruit, said he was encouraged to commit to a junior college 
in case he did not make it at USC. He plans to attend Trinity Valley College 
outside of Dallas if he does not score at least 17 on the ACT. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey has already scored more than 700 on the SAT, but still needs to fulfill 
his core curriculum requirements. Perry and Haslip have retaken the SAT and are 
awaiting results. 
</P>
<P>
 USC officials said Thursday that they believe Haslip and Hill are close to 
qualifying and are awaiting their paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Robinson said his recruiting methods are common, they are different 
from UCLA's Terry Donahue. Of 19 recruits, including two junior college 
transfers, the Bruins have signed only one player who has not yet qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the students we recruited this year could have come here under Larry 
Smith," said Fred Stroock, USC's administrator for academic services. "This 
staff attracted a lot of kids that might not have otherwise thought of USC in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stroock acknowledges that Robinson's staff might have been given more 
latitude. Smith said he would never have been allowed to sign so many academic 
risks because McGee would have not given him the letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would only have been allowed to sign one or two players who were still 
awaiting their test scores," Smith said. "I didn't even bother trying for more 
than that."

school athletic events in the last year, the Southern Section council voted 
Thursday to suspend players and coaches for fighting. 
</P>

<P>
 The 1994 NFL schedule is filled with firsts, from Fox Network's opening 
telecast featuring Super Bowl champion Dallas vs. Pittsburgh to the first 
matchup of father and son coaches -- Miami's Don Shula vs.Cincinnati's David 
Shula. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, under new Coach Barry Switzer, begin their bid for an 
unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title on Sunday, Sept. 4, when they 
visit Pittsburgh. It will be the first regular-season NFL game televised by 
Fox, which outbid CBS for rights to NFC games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with our inaugural 'NFL on Fox' schedule," Fox Sports 
President David Hill said Thursday after the league released its 1994 
regular-season schedule. "We've got the Super Bowl champion Cowboys 11 times 
and some great matchups, including (Joe) Montana's first ever game against his 
old mates in San Francisco (Sept. 11) and a rematch of the NFC championship 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Sunday night game on TNT will match San Diego at Denver. ABC's 
Monday night series kicks off its 25th year with the Raiders at the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-eight games are scheduled for national television. Fox or NBC will 
televise a Sunday doubleheader game to most of the nation each week, and ABC 
will show 17 Monday night games. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC also will televise the Super Bowl and the Pro Bowl.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; STEVENS ACCUSES FORMER ADVISER OF BILKING 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney for jockey Gary Stevens charged this week that his client has been 
bilked out of more than $350,000 by his former financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Papiano, who represents Stevens, said the jockey is suing Harvey Cohen, 
an attorney who raced the stakes-winning Music Merci, for actual and punitive 
damages over pension and investment plans that disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's at least $350,000 involved," Papiano said. "All the money that Gary 
put up is gone. And I understand that there's a long list of other people that 
Cohen owes." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, 31, is riding at Hollywood Park. His horses have earned more than 
$109 million since his career began in Idaho in 1979. Generally, jockeys earn 
about 10% of what their horses make. Winner of the Kentucky Derby with the 
filly Winning Colors in 1988, Stevens will be riding Brocco, one of the 
favorites in this year's Derby, at Churchill Downs a week from Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen has been described as a heavy bettor who once cashed a Pick Six ticket 
in the low six figures. When Music Merci switched trainers last year, going 
from Armando Lage to Bill Spawr, it was explained that the move was 
necessitated by a financial disagreement between Lage and Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Music Merci, who won the 1988 Del Mar Futurity and seven other stakes, earned 
more than $1.5 million. The 8-year-old gelding ran in two Breeders' Cup races, 
finishing fourth in the Juvenile in 1988 and sixth in the Sprint last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Papiano said that Cohen's whereabouts are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to serve him (with the suit)," the attorney said. "So far, 
we've been unsuccessful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Crane, Cohen's attorney, says he does not think the case will go to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be settled," Crane said. "I don't know what Neil means about not 
being able to serve Harvey. Neil's never called me, and all he has to do is 
call. We were the ones who brought all this to Neil in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 In handling the Stevens case, Papiano was reminded of 1992, when he 
represented Laffit Pincay and Chris McCarron, both Hall of Fame jockeys, who 
charged that an investment company improperly used their money and deducted 
commissions that were higher than had been agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony in federal court in Los Angeles, Pincay and McCarron 
invested $1.7 million and $759,000, respectively. A jury awarded the jockeys 
$4.4 million in compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "No money's been paid," Papiano said this week. "The brothers who ran the 
company have gone into both personal and business bankruptcy. Property liens 
have been filed in an attempt to get as much of the award as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers -- Vincent and Robert Andrews -- represented other top jockeys, 
including Angel Cordero, Jorge Velasquez and Bill Shoemaker. From 1969 until 
1987, Pincay was represented by either the Andrews brothers or their father. 
Before the breakup, Pincay once considered putting Vincent Andrews in his will. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brothers had complete control of a money machine," Papiano said. "As long 
as Pincay and McCarron were riding, the machine spit out the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero, who retired from riding in 1992 to train horses, said that he had 
considered a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys were supposed to charge me 4% (of gross earnings) as their share," 
Cordero said. "But it turned out to be more like 8%. They didn't do right by 
me, but I didn't have the proof and the records to do anything about it. There 
was something wrong. They were handling five or six of the top riders in the 
country, and they couldn't make anything for any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull got the most first-place votes, but Brocco is in first place in the 
latest weekly Kentucky Derby poll conducted by the Louisville Courier-Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the turf writers polled, there were five first-place votes for Holy Bull, 
three for Brocco and two for Strodes Creek. Brocco led on points, picking up 
seven second-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, after Gato Del Sol ran second in the Blue Grass Stakes, extending his 
losing streak to seven races, owners Arthur B. Hancock III and Leone Peters 
considered replacing jockey Eddie Delahoussaye with Bill Shoemaker for the 
Kentucky Derby. When they called to inquire, Shoemaker said, "What do you need 
me for? Delahoussaye's one of the best riders around." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye stayed on Gato Del Sol, winning the Derby, and Shoemaker finished 
eighth with Star Gallant. Delahoussaye also won the Derby the next year, with 
Sunny's Halo. This year, Hancock and his partners wanted a jockey with more 
Derby experience than Corey Black to ride Strodes Creek and have hired 
Delahoussaye.

WEST MAINTAINS BALANCE WHILE ON TIGHTROPE; COLLEGE BASEBALL: AIDED BY THREE 
DOUBLE PLAYS, LEFT-HANDER GOES THE DISTANCE TO GIVE PIERCE A ONE-GAME 
DIVISIONAL LEAD OVER LOSING BAKERSFIELD.

 Score one for perseverance and timely defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College got a gutsy performance from left-hander Adam West and 
brilliant work with the glove to defeat Bakersfield, 6-3, in a crucial Western 
State Conference South Division game Thursday at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Brahmas (22-14, 14-7 in conference play) a one-game lead 
over Bakersfield (21-16, 13-8) in the divisional race with four games 
remaining. But West (9-4) and the Brahmas had to work out of several jams in 
the early and middle innings. 
</P>
<P>
 West, who went the distance, yielded 10 hits and seven walks, striking out 
six. He struggled from the second through the sixth, but was bailed out by 
three double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did the tightrope act," Pierce Coach Bob Lofrano said. "But that's how 
Adam is sometimes. If you don't get him early, he's tough to get." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the rally-killing double plays were started by slick-fielding second 
baseman Cesar Martinez, the first with one out and the bases loaded in the 
third inning and the last with one out and a runner at first in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar was marvelous, just awesome at second base," Pierce Coach Bob Lofrano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pierce infield also pulled off a difficult double play in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 After West walked the first two batters, George Vargas tried to advance them 
with a bunt but first baseman Kevin Milligan jumped on the ball and threw to 
Lou Tapia for the force at third. Tapia fired back to Martinez at first to 
complete the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Brian Basowski followed with a great diving catch of Todd 
Josue's liner to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas, however, could not help West escape the second inning unscathed. 
Bakersfield batted around and used four hits -- including an RBI double by 
Josue -- and two walks to take a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas answered with two runs in their half of the inning against 
right-hander Andy Bernard (9-2) on a two-base error by third baseman Jacob 
Freeman that allowed Brian Sturges to score from second and Basowski to score 
from first. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierece tied it in the third on an infield hit by Basowski and went up, 5-3, 
on a two-run home run by Sturges in the fifth. Shortstop Edgar Maldonado walked 
to lead off the sixth for Pierce, advanced to third on a hit-and-run single by 
Martinez and scored on a fielder's choice by Heath McElwee.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD; SCOUTS FLOCK TO OBSERVE CRUZ CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scouts see Arizona State center fielder Jacob Cruz swing a bat and they 
compare him to Toronto Blue Jay first baseman John Olerud, who batted .400 or 
better for a majority of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's because Cruz's swing is elegant, like Olerud's. Or maybe it's 
because the Channel Islands High graduate is batting .407 heading into a 
three-game series against UCLA that starts tonight. Fact is, scouts are 
flocking around the left-handed junior, who is expected to be selected within 
the top five rounds in this June's amateur baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, a Kansas City scout is due to be here in about 20 minutes," Cruz 
said by phone Wednesday from Tempe, Ariz. "I've got agents calling all the 
time. It's been a hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like my swing. It's fluid, easy. A couple of scouts have compared me to 
Olerud." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cruz could be just as appropriately compared to Atlanta Brave third 
baseman Terry Pendleton. Cruz and Pendleton attended Channel Islands High. Both 
were overshadowed coming out of high school: Cruz by St. Louis Cardinal minor 
leaguer Dmitri Young of Rio Mesa and Pendleton by many players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out not being a star," Cruz said. "But I remember him coming out and 
taking batting practice with us my sophomore or junior year and I remember 
(former coach) Don Cardinal telling us how hard he worked and he didn't really 
learn how to hit until after he left Oxnard College and went to Fresno State." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton was the National League's most valuable player in 1991 and led the 
Braves to the World Series in '91 and '92. He has served as inspiration to Cruz 
and other Oxnard youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy who came out of our neighborhood and our high school and 
accomplished something in athletics," Cruz said. "He's the most star-studded 
guy to come out of that place." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, who is having a star-studded season, is the neighborhood's latest 
success story. He leads the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division (the 
"Six-Pac") in batting. He has 85 hits in 209 at-bats with 54 runs batted in, 11 
home runs, 11 doubles, two triples and eight stolen bases. He bats third in the 
order for the 10th-ranked Sun Devils (35-14), who trail first-place Stanford by 
one game in the Six-Pac with a 16-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I set a goal at the beginning that I wanted to get as close to .400 at I 
could," said Cruz, who had a 30-game hitting streak (spanning two seasons) 
snapped in late February and is now on a 12-game streak. "And I also wanted to 
get 100 hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, 21, might have put up similar numbers last season except for four 
cracked ribs. He was injured in a collision at home plate. He hit .342 with 10 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking care of myself," he said. "I'm not sliding into home headfirst 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, who has a strong arm and average speed but good range in the outfield, 
lifted weights in the off-season and has been awed by the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," said Cruz, who is 6-feet, 175, 10 pounds heavier than last 
year. "It helped my running, throwing . . . every phase of my game. I didn't 
get big, but I'm stronger. Now I can dig a low ball out of the ground and hit a 
line drive. Last year, those were ground balls that never got out of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year at this time, I was physically tired. I was dragging." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coming up short: Brigham Young and Kevin Hambly missed a chance to play in the 
NCAA volleyball final four, losing to Stanford in the final of the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Hambly, a 6-7 middle blocker from Royal High, had 20 kills as the Cardinal won 
in four games. Hambly led the Cougars with 443 kills this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the tournament, Hambly had 13 kills in a four-game victory over 
Hawaii, and 17 kills with a team-best .438 attacking percentage and a team-high 
12 blocks in a four-game victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another O'Bannon: New Mexico wide receiver Turhon O'Bannon has agreed to 
contract terms with the Rams. The former Cleveland High player caught 47 passes 
for 710 yards (averaging 15.1 per catch) and seven touchdowns last season. As 
junior, O'Bannon caught only 14 passes but four of them went for scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a young guy just learning to play football while he was here," said 
Steve Landress, former Cleveland coach. "But he's a hard-working young man. He 
overcame a knee problem and was our best receiver his senior year." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, 6-foot and 192 pounds, is a half-brother of UCLA basketball players 
Ed and Charles O'Bannon.

INSIDE LINE: O.C. HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; YEAH, WE MOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, we weren't here Thursday where you're used to finding us. But you knew in 
your heart we'd be back, didn't you? Hey, Friday's a great day, too. Around and 
About 
</P>
<P>
 Some items from campus newspapers: 
</P>
<P>
 * To help keep the campus clean, Villa Park High School is considering an 
"Adopt-a-Campus" plan, similar to the Adopt-a-Freeway program. Under the plan, 
student groups would adopt mapped sections of the campus and keep those zones 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 * Voice modulation is a thing of the past at Brea Olinda High School, 
according to the Wildcat, the student newspaper. Students were apparently 
becoming a bit overzealous in the use of the voice annotation part of computers 
in the library, venting frustrations after a hard day by using the high-tech 
computers as a karaoke device. That feature on the computers has been 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 * April Fools' Day has come and gone, but a few pranks printed in Smoke 
Signals, the student newspaper at Anaheim Hills' Canyon High School, caught our 
eye -- and raised an eyebrow. The paper asked "What's the funniest joke you 
ever played on anyone?"  
</P>
<P>
 Said one student: "I hid my sister's car and told her that it was in the 
impound, completely totaled." (And she hasn't loaned it to you since, right?) 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "I made an omelet with dog food inside and gave it to my sister, 
brother and mother." (Yuck. We hope he 'fessed up before they took a bite.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned my father in to the IRS for tax evasion." (You call that a joke?) 
</P>
<P>
 And the last: "I set up a pregnancy test in my sister's bathroom that I had 
rigged to read positive." (We're sure she's still laughing.) Wearing Thin 
</P>
<P>
 Should students be required to wear uniforms to school? The questions has 
received much media attention recently, and the Shamrock paper at Kennedy High 
School in La Palma asked its readers for their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Students interviewed were against the idea. "I don't think it would work out. 
Too many people want to dress their own way," said one student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't see the point, because people are going to get mad because 
they can't wear their own clothes," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, "It's the student's choice if they want to wear them, but I don't 
want to wear them."

MY TURN: O.C. HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; CASTING A VOTE FOR SOUTH AFRICA'S 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HEYDENRYCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Heydenrych, 18, is a senior at 
St. Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To allow South African citizens in this country to vote in their nation's 
first all-race election, polling places were established at 20 locations in the 
United States, including one in Irvine. The election marks the end of four 
decades of apartheid and 300 years of white-only rule in South Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, I felt like an adult -- and an alien. As my dad and I 
stood in line at the Irvine Civic Center to vote in South Africa's first free 
election Tuesday, I listened to the accents around me. They were familiar South 
African voices, yet they made me uncomfortable. I felt like I had no right to 
vote in this election. I was born in South Africa, and I am 18 years old, but I 
consider myself an American. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, those voices excited me because they reminded me of my 
relatives, of the times I spent in South Africa and of the fact that I was 
about to take part in a historic event. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad and I continued to stand in line. We had already been there for half an 
hour. The line had barely inched forward. It was 7:05 p.m., and the polls were 
supposed to close at 7. At 7:10 a man from the embassy told us that he was 
sorry, but that because the polls were closing, we would all have to squish 
into the voting room. He apologized and explained the situation twice, but 
nothing came of his little speech. The line continued to inch forward slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad and I reached the door and read the sample ballot posted on the glass. 
There was a long list of names with a picture beside each and an empty box to 
the right for you to signify your choice. There were also maps of the various 
regions in South Africa. My dad explained that I would vote once nationally, 
and then once by region, ours being the Western Cape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally we got inside. I was asked to place my right hand under a blue light 
to check that I had not previously voted. Then I was asked to show 
identification. Because I left South Africa when I was 3 years old, I did not 
have my own passport, but I was named on my mother's. The gentleman at the desk 
told me that I would have been required to fill out a temporary voter's card, 
but they had run out. Meanwhile, the man in front of me -- one of the few black 
South Africans at the polling place -- was having a difficult time. I heard him 
say that he was from the Transkei. His only ID was an old, brown piece of 
paper. When the gentleman behind the desk asked if he had a birth certificate, 
he laughed and repeated that he was from the Transkei -- an African tribal 
homeland that does not issue birth certificates or other conventional 
identification papers. I found it somewhat ironic that even in this free 
election, it was difficult for this man to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 I moved through the line, getting closer and closer to my voting opportunity. 
My right hand was sprayed with invisible ink and then placed under a blue 
light. This ensured that I was marked and could not vote again. I was handed a 
ballot and an envelope and sent to a voting booth. The booth itself was a large 
cardboard box with a piece of black plastic in the front for privacy. I made my 
selection and placed my ballot in the envelope. Then I went to another table 
marked with each province. I received another ballot and envelope, both of 
which were stamped "Western Cape." I went to another booth and voted again. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I put the envelopes with my votes in the ballot box, which was monitored 
by a security guard. It was official. I had just voted in South Africa's first 
free election. My vote will become a part of international history, and the 
experience will remain with me forever.

NON-STOP MOUTH; ORANGE'S ARCHULETA TALKS A GOOD GAME, PLAYS IT BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saul Archuleta is talking. Then again, the Orange High second baseman is 
always talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, he's talking baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first Dodger game my pops took me to, Dusty Baker hit a home run in the 
ninth. He was the first guy I ever saw hit a home run. He just crushed the 
ball. It won the game. The crowd went crazy. Just thinking about that makes me 
tingle. Man, I love baseball . . . love it."  
</P>
<P>
 That subject runs its course. But Archuleta picks up another one. The guy is 
always talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's talking life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be a normal guy. Have a house . . . have a pickup truck . . . 
have a wife . . . yeah, and a couple of dogs. I don't want to be dodging 
bullets. I don't want to have to worry what street I can walk down."  
</P>
<P>
 He bounces like a pinball from the one topic to the other, baseball then life. 
But he's really talking about the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta grew up close to the flame. He said his five step-brothers drifted 
into gangs, taking what turned out to be an irreversible path. He chose, and 
was pushed, down a different career track -- baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "My pops got me into baseball," Archuleta said. "He saw my brothers go into 
gangs. He wanted me to be the positive one. I think he saw me as his last 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta has not wasted the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth season on the Panther varsity for Archuleta and, in some 
ways, his finest. He doesn't lead the team in any offensive category, he just 
leads the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Howard, the Panthers' coach, calls Archuleta his most important player. 
Archuleta, the team's motor mouth, provides that motivational shove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saul is always talking," pitcher Gil Gonzales said. "We can't shut him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Archuleta: "I try to keep everyone in the game. You got to be hyped to 
play this game. But sometimes, I just like to hear my own voice." 
</P>
<P>
 He may talk the talk, but he can also walk the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta hit better than .400 the previous three seasons and is hitting .375 
with 12 runs batted in this year. His ability and enthusiasm have attracted 
some attention. He is being recruited by Cal State Los Angeles and University 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one (professional) scout tell me that you could stick Saul into just 
about any college infield right now and he could play," said Dave Ochoa, an 
Orange assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Archuleta: "I never thought I would be right here. I never thought I 
would be going to college. That's all I want. I want to get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Some might say he has already had one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has been more than a game for Archuleta. It has been a haven. He 
describes a family life that was tumultuous in its best moments and dangerous 
in its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 After his parents divorced, Archuleta said he spent a good amount of time in 
South Central Los Angeles, where his step-brothers lived. All, he said, were 
deep into gangs, so finding a positive outlet was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard growing up around those guys," Archuleta said. "I'm not trying to 
put them down, but they were always trying to involve me. They would always 
say, 'Why don't you go drink with us,' or, 'Come hang out with us.' I could see 
the mistakes they were making, and I tried to stay away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 That was difficult at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta remembers waking up to shouting one night. There was glass all over 
the living-room floor, the result of a drive-by shooting. Another time, 
Archuleta said the police arrived, searching for one of his step-brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way it was there," he said. "I'd be at a playground and see a cop 
car go by. I would wonder if they were going to my house. Someone would knock 
on the door and I would wonder if one of my brothers was dead. Cars would drive 
by and I would get nervous. The only escape I had was baseball. The baseball 
field was the only place I felt safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Archuleta, who lived in Orange, took his son away from that environment. 
He also signed his son up for baseball when he was six to help divert his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just baseball," Jim Archuleta said. "When one sport was over, I 
signed him up for the next one. I never gave him the chance to hang out on 
street corners." 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta rarely sees his step-brothers these days. He said they appear out of 
nowhere at times, usually looking for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll say stuff like, 'How's it going, goody-two shoes,' " Archuleta said. 
"They used to pressure me a lot. It never worked because I didn't want baseball 
to be taken away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball engulfed Archuleta's life. He played year-round, sometimes from dawn 
to dusk and later, if there were lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Archuleta is usually the first to arrive and the last to leave the 
practice field. And prying him out of a game takes a crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Archuleta strained ligaments in his ankle. The doctor said he 
would miss eight weeks. He returned one game later. 
</P>
<P>
 During another game, Archuleta twisted an ankle on his first at-bat and hurt 
his knee the next time up. On his third at-bat, he hit a grounder and was 
knocked down on a close play at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent my assistant coach out to get him," Howard said. "He told Saul that we 
just wanted to make sure he was all right. Saul stood on first base and said, 
'I'm not leaving.' We would have had to carry him off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Archuleta saw that devotion early and used it to point his son down the 
right path. To play ball, Archuleta had to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
 If his grades slipped, no baseball. If he got into trouble, no baseball. If he 
got out of line at all, no baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't an immediate success. Archuleta was not exactly a model kid or 
student for a while. He ran with the wrong crowd, according to his father, and 
got into trouble and a few scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he needed to change his friends or he wasn't playing baseball," 
Jim Archuleta said. "He changed friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Saul Archuleta: "Pops was tough. He got through to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The change has been dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions were taut at an Orange basketball game this season, to the point 
where fans from both sides were ready to fight. Archuleta stepped in and helped 
cool down the Orange students. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how far Saul has come," Howard said. "Three years ago, he would have 
been in the middle of it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Archuleta: "I channel my aggression into other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask any Century League player or coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta is far from being the most beloved player in the league -- he may 
lead Orange County in being hit by pitches. But he is one of the most 
respected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I like the kid," Canyon Coach Mike Najera said. "Yeah, he talks a 
little, but he's not a trash talker." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he chips at players, trying to unnerve them during the game. It's a 
trait that doesn't sit well with everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He even rags on me," said one coach, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Archuleta: "When you can get in somebody's head, you got them." 
</P>
<P>
 A philosophy he doesn't reserve just for opponents.  
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta was brought up to the varsity early in his freshman year and was 
inserted into the lineup at shortstop. The move caused some grumbling among the 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them if they were doing their jobs, I wouldn't be here," Archuleta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 End of problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in charge the first minute he stepped on the field," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 That leadership guided the Panthers to the league co-championship last season. 
Archuleta was named co-player of the year. Orange also reached the 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This season has been a struggle. Orange is mired in the middle of the pack, 
fighting to make the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 If Archuleta can push the Panthers into the postseason, he will. If he can't, 
well, there are worse problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot bigger things in life than going 0 for 4," Archuleta said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that talk isn't cheap.

 What kind of baseball fan are you? A brief quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 1. A baseball stadium is:  
</P>
<P>
 a) A green cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 b) Mount Olympus with the gods at play. 
</P>
<P>
 c) A 60,000-seat edifice built of concrete and structural steel where a family 
of four can, on a good night, spend $80 and 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The James Earl Jones soliloquy in "Field of Dreams" made you:  
</P>
<P>
 a) Weep uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 c) Begin to gag, fall to your knees and pray for Shoeless Joe to stick a sock 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Spring training is:  
</P>

to. 
</P>
<P>
 If you answered c) to one or more of the above, do not panic. 
</P>
<P>
 You are not a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
 You are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Very likely, you are just another in the growing legion of Baseball Agnostics 
-- clear-thinking, well-adjusted individuals who can appreciate baseball as a 
game of keen athletic skill and strategy, same as football and hockey, but do 
not believe that time begins on opening day, or that life imitates the World 
Series, or that the smell of freshly cut ballpark grass is an intoxicating 
incense that insulates us from the stench of the outside world, whisking us 
back to a simpler, happier, more innocent era. 
</P>
<P>
 To a Baseball Agnostic, the smell of freshly cut ballpark grass means the 
grounds crew has done its job and now it is time for the Yankees and Red Sox to 
do theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his newly released book, "Field of Screams: The Dark Underside of America's 
National Pastime," Richard Scheinin has written what amounts to a manifesto for 
Baseball Agnosticism. Scheinin gets to the point immediately, firing this 
opening salvo: 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you tired of it? It's been foisted on us for years now, decades even. 
All this literary bilge about how baseball is some sort of gentle art form, the 
game for poets. . . . Well, it's time for a reality check. I appreciate a 
well-executed squeeze play as much as the next guy, but everything that happens 
between the foul lines is not pretty. It's time to put perspective on the myth: 
that's no ballet and that's no Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 380 pages, Scheinin systematically pummels what he calls the Big 
Baseball Myth, chronicling more than a century's worth of miscreants, 
criminals, substance-abusers and game-fixers, casts them against a backdrop of 
drunken hooligans in the stands, and concludes that the reality of the game is 
leagues away from the Boys of Summer gloss. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys of the Slammer are more to the point. Or, as Scheinin words it, "a 
panoply of villainy." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheinin takes Jacques Barzun's oft-repeated observation that "Whoever wants 
to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball" and turns it 
on its ear. To understand baseball, one must first understand America, "Field 
of Screams" argues. Through the years, baseball's history has mirrored the 
country's -- rooted in violence and racism, often aspiring for better, only to 
be dragged back down time and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, baseball in 1800s. A pastoral, gentlemanly endeavor, full of waxed 
handlebar mustaches, colorfully striped long stockings and picnic blankets 
behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 So what about the barbed-wire fences that had to be erected to keep 
bloodthirsty fans from maiming the umpire? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Curt Welch, center fielder for the St. Louis Browns, who kept a pint of 
whiskey stashed behind an outfield sign at Sportsman's Park for between-innings 
pick-me-ups? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Chicago Manager Cap Anson, Hall of Famer, who forced the Newark team to 
bench its black pitcher and catcher before agreeing to play an 1887 exhibition 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 Or 1890s umpire Timothy Hurst, who resorted to firing a pistol in the air to 
keep a hostile crowd at bay? 
</P>
<P>
 All the legendary louts are here. The sadistic, racist Ty Cobb, so hated by 
teammates that he slept on team train rides with a loaded Luger by his side. 
The pugnacious manager, John McGraw, who viewed clean play as a sign of 
weakness, professing that "sportsmanship and fair play are all right, but it is 
the prospect of a hot fight that brings out the crowds." The fabled first 
baseman Hal Chase, repeatedly accused of throwing games but forever cleared of 
charges because he was a "gate attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 The '40s and the '50s were baseball's Golden Age, or so we have been taught. 
When It Was A Game. The Glory of Their Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, Detroit catcher Birdie Tebbetts was nearly killed when a fan in the 
upper deck of Cleveland Stadium dropped a tomato crate on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, the first year of widespread integration in professional baseball, a 
total of 12 black non-pitchers played for Triple-A teams -- and four wound up 
being carted off on stretchers after beanings. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, Ted Williams gives fans at Fenway Park the finger. In 1956, Williams 
spits at fans at Fenway Park. In 1958, Williams flings a bat 75 feet into the 
stands, hitting the housekeeper of Red Sox General Manager Joe Cronin. 
</P>
<P>
 On to the '60s and the beanball wars that ruined Tony Conigliaro's career, the 
cruel taunting of outfielder and former mental patient Jimmy Piersall, the 
Cobb-like spikings and braggadocio of Maury Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Vignettes from the '70s, '80s and '90s: Hank Aaron receives death threats as 
he closes in on Babe Ruth's home-run record. The Texas Rangers have to defend 
themselves with bats against drunken fans on Ten-Cent Beer Night in Cleveland. 
Fans riot in Pittsburgh and Detroit after World Series victories. George 
Steinbrenner and Howard Spira. Wade Boggs and Margo Adams. Lenny Dykstra and 
his Mercedes. Pete Rose and his bookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Field of Screams" concludes that baseball and its players are not "seedier 
than society, only as seedy. In baseball, you can see the whole panorama of the 
lower end of the human experience: alcohol, drugs, wife-beating, horrible 
murders, suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a side of the game the poets and the self-assigned Bards of the Ballyard 
neatly choose to ignore, which makes "Field of Screams" a book every last one 
of them should be commanded to read, before the next genuflection.

RAMS GET TWO SHOTS TO FACE EVERETT; PRO FOOTBALL: SCHEDULE FOR 1994 HAS TWO 
DATES WITH SAINTS. TEAM OPENS AGAINST CARDINALS SEPT. 4 AT ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams' 1994 regular-season schedule was released by the NFL Thursday and 
includes Oct. 23 and Dec. 4 matchups against the New Orleans Saints and their 
new quarterback, former Ram Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams play at New Orleans Oct. 23 and play host to the Saints Dec. 4 at 
Anaheim Stadium. The Rams traded Everett, their quarterback for the last eight 
seasons, to the Saints in March for a 1995 seventh-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, 5-11 last season, open their 16-game schedule Sept. 4 at home 
against the Phoenix Cardinals and new Coach Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to open the season at home," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "Last year 
we played three out of our first four on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the two games against the Saints, and the matchup with Everett, 
Knox said: "I didn't even look at that. That's a long way off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams close the season with a Saturday, Dec. 24 home game against the 
Washington Redskins. Other home games are against the Raiders, the New York 
Giants, Denver Broncos and NFC West Division rivals Atlanta and San Francisco. 
The Rams will wear jerseys from their 1951 season and the 49ers from their 1955 
team in their Sept. 18 game in Anaheim in tribute to the 75th anniversary of 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' schedule also includes an ESPN Sunday night game Nov. 20 at San 
Francisco and a game at San Diego the following week. Other road games are 
against Atlanta, Kansas City, Green Bay, Tampa Bay and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The team plans to invoke its 15-month escape clause in its Anaheim Stadium 
lease on Tuesday and can begin entertaining offers from cities interested in 
NFL franchises, including Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis. If the Rams accept an 
offer from another city, they could leave after next season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams on Thursday offered a one-year contract worth $500,000 to linebacker 
Joe Kelly, cut by the Raiders last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Feldman, Kelly's agent, said the linebacker will decide by this morning 
whether to accept the offer. Kelly was second on the Raiders in tackles last 
season with 103.

SOUTHERN SECTION PASSES ANTI-VIOLENCE MEASURE; HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS: PLAYERS 
EJECTED FOR FIGHTING OR LEAVING TEAM AREA WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR A GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section Council trudged through a four-hour meeting Thursday, but 
it wasted little time in passing a resolution to crack down on the violence 
that has increasingly become a part of high school athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next fall, any player ejected for fighting or leaving the bench or 
team area during a fight will be suspended for a game. The same penalty applies 
to any coach who has been ejected by an official. 
</P>
<P>
 The council didn't move nearly so quickly regarding proposed playoff groupings 
for 1994-98. Although the divisions assigned to leagues for most sports passed 
without question, football playoff groupings provided for plenty of commentary 
and were ultimately sent back for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The football groupings were based almost solely on enrollment and competitive 
equity, "but it became more evident geography was more important. . . " 
Commissioner Dean Crowley said. "To be able to take a second look at it will be 
beneficial to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those pleased the playoff groupings were sent back to the drawing board 
was Loara Principal Barry Escoe, the Empire League representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new proposal, the Empire League would have been in Division IV from 
during the 1994-98 seasons. Although the league was Division II last year, it 
is losing Los Alamitos and Esperanza to the Division I Sunset League in Orange 
County realignment, and gaining Century (Division VIII) and Kennedy (Division 
VII). Los Alamitos or Esperanza has won or shared the section title since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Escoe presented a plan in which the Empire League would compete in a Division 
V grouping that includes the Century, Orange, Mission and newly formed Golden 
West leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were heard and I think there will be changes in the division playoffs," 
Escoe said. "I think we made our point that the committee needs to re-look at 
the criterion." 
</P>
<P>
 The next football playoff grouping proposal will be presented at the council's 
Oct. 20 meeting. Also at that time, the Southern Section will determine whether 
it will support the proposed Orange County Section, and the following weekend, 
Oct. 28-29, the State Federated Council will vote on the new section. 
</P>
<P>
 If the vote then is to establish an Orange County Section for the 1995-96 
school year, the Southern Section will again redraw proposed playoff groupings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the day's closest voting, the council voted 33-32 to continue to award 
co-championships to football teams that tie in title games. All Orange County 
leagues voted for the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, I would hope, we would want to recognize as many kids as 
possible," said Mark Cunningham, University football coach and athletic 
director. "I think it goes along with the ideals and the mission of the CIF. 
We're part of the educational system and winning is not what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heard from treasurer Tom Triggs that revenue from the basketball playoffs 
exceeded projections by $32,000, and that with a $20,000 windfall from winter 
T-shirt sales, "it looks like there's a possibility of cutting (a potential 
$100,000 deficit at the beginning of the year) down to zero. . . . Playing at 
The Pond was an excellent decision, financially." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elected Triggs, the principal at Buena Park, the president-elect. He will 
become the Southern Section president in two years, at the end of Ken Gunn's 
term. Gunn takes over for Gary Smiddercks, who officiated his final meeting 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Passed a $1.245 million budget proposal for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approved a two-division badminton playoff system, and a six-division format 
for water polo with an emphasis on geography between leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approved a $1 across-the-board increase in per-event fees for officials for 
the 1995-96 year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recommended that language detailing a school's responsibilities to game 
officials be softened and included in the Blue Book without a rule number.

SIMI VALLEY'S SCHEFFELS HIT WITH SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley High baseball team will be without senior Bill Scheffels, its 
leading hitter and winningest pitcher, for its crucial game at Newbury Park 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels was suspended from school indefinitely on Wednesday, reportedly for 
his involvement in a bomb threat prank at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels had a hearing with school administrators on Thursday afternoon, but 
no further decision was reached regarding his suspension, he said. Scheffels 
said he didn't know what was next in the resolution of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels refused to comment on the reason for his suspension. Simi Valley 
Coach Mike Scyphers referred inquiries to Principal Kathryn Scroggin, who said 
she could not comment on student disciplinary matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Ventura County pitcher of the year last season, Scheffels did not 
play in the Pioneers' 13-5 loss to Royal on Wednesday. Scyphers said senior 
Kary Kozlowski will start in place of Scheffels today against Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place Pioneers (14-5, 6-3 in league play) trail Newbury Park (15-5, 
8-1) by two games with five to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels, who has signed to play at Nevada Las Vegas next season, is leading 
the Marmonte League with a .517 batting average. He is 6-1 with a 2.66 
earned-run average.

BIG WEST A BIG DEAL FOR CSUN; COLLEGE ATHLETICS: MATADORS COULD LAND IN 
DIVISION I CONFERENCE BY FALL OF '96. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Athletic officials from the eight-team Big West Conference appear split as 
they prepare to meet in Los Angeles on Sunday -- and Cal State Northridge's 
hopes of being added to the league in the fall of 1996 hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference administrators seem to agree that the Big West needs to expand 
because Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State defected to the Western Athletic 
Conference. Which schools to add is the compelling question. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State, Utah State, Pacific and Nevada, the conference teams that 
play NCAA Division I-A football, prefer to consider schools with similar 
football programs. Long Beach State, Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine and UC 
Santa Barbara, schools that do not field football teams, favor additions based 
on geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which competes in numerous Division I conferences plus the I-AA 
American West Conference in football, is interested in becoming a conference 
member, as reportedly are Cal State Sacramento, Northern Arizona, Boise State, 
Idaho, North Texas and several others. 
</P>
<P>
 Big West officials hope to emerge from Sunday's meeting with a plan that 
satisfies all member schools, a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a real open discussion; one of the more important meetings 
the conference has had since its beginning," said Steve Allaback, the acting 
Big West president from UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge seems to have as much chance as any Big West candidate if the 
conference decides to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You consider things like compatibility, geography and types of sports," said 
Dan Guerrero, the athletic director at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those factors are compelling with Northridge, if indeed the conference 
decides to add schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Ault, athletic director and football coach at Nevada, said "a 
Northridge-Sacramento scenario certainly would be worth looking at." However, 
Ault said he prefers the Big West first approach schools with existing major 
college football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State Athletic Director Al Gonzales agreed with Ault. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either have a football league playing on a national basis, or you have a 
West Coast league where you can run up and down the interstate and play 
people," he said. "Those are the choices." 
</P>
<P>
 One scenario favored by many conference officials is a four- to six-team 
expansion that would include schools with Division I-A football teams along 
with others that make sense geographically and economically. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West would then be one conference for football and a conference split 
into divisions in basketball and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Shumard, Cal State Fullerton's athletic director, said he favors an 
alignment "that would localize competition in non-revenue sports." Asked 
whether Northridge might fit into such a setup, Shumard replied, "I think it 
might."

NICE GUY SHANAHAN FIRST-RATE FOR CSUN; WHEN HE STEPS INTO THE BATTER'S BOX, 
THIS MILD-MANNERED KID FROM MONTANA DONS A RED CAPE FOR THE MATADORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge outfielder Joey Arnold knows dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 He once had a roommate move out because Arnold was an inveterate slob around 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 More grunge the better. Arnold puts pine tar on top of his batting helmet 
before each at-bat, for heaven's sake. Among college ballplayers, this type of 
hygiene is hardly unique. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arnold looks at teammate Jason Shanahan, though, he sees Mr. Clean, Mr. 
Goody Two-Spikes, Opie Taylor with a first baseman's glove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't come up with any dirt on the guy," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the perception of Shanahan, a regular guy from Montana. Such is the 
reality, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might take a little dip (of chewing tobacco) now and then," Arnold said. 
"But that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's about right. Shanahan, a junior from Missoula who leads the Matadors in 
nearly every statistical category, is a homespun guy. No craving for glamour 
and glitter. Drives a four-wheel-drive truck with license plates that read, PLA 
BALL. 
</P>
<P>
 All truer than true. Just what you'd expect from a cow-milking, bronco-buster 
from the middle of the ol' rural USA, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never, ever even been close to that for me," Shanahan said, laughing. "I 
have no interest in farms and I've never even been on one." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so his teammates are off the mark about his upbringing. He didn't tip over 
sleeping Holsteins for fun. Shanahan's mom and dad own a pharmacy and he lives 
in a regular house like any garden-variety kid from the San Fernando Valley. 
But he's a farmer, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 He plants pitches over the outfield fence, harvests hits and spends the rest 
of the day sowing the seeds of his content.  
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, he goes to class. In the afternoon, he's usually the first to 
arrive for practice and the last to leave. At night, he barricades himself in 
his room and studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he's received, he's earned," Arnold said. "That's what I admire 
most about him." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, the payoff has been considerable, particularly in Western 
Athletic Conference play. In 18 conference games, he is batting .446 with five 
homers and 25 runs batted in. He has hit homers against all four teams in the 
WAC West Division. He also has driven in at least one run in all but four WAC 
games and hit safely in all but two. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince of deportment is the team's triple-crown winner entering this 
weekend's do-or-die series at Matador Field with San Diego State, the WAC West 
Division front-runner. The Matadors (22-24, 10-8 in conference play) trail the 
Aztecs (29-17, 11-4) by 2 1/2 games and Northridge has six conference games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to sweep," Shanahan said, shaking his head slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, he's already cleaned up. Shanahan, a switch-hitter, leads the 
team in batting average (.355), home runs (eight) and RBIs (44). For good 
measure, he tops the Matadors in stolen bases (seven), which is seven more than 
he attempted during his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan's work ethic is well-established, if not envied. On Wednesday, 
practice had ended and Arnold was hanging around with several teammates when he 
noticed Shanahan wasn't around. Players heard a rhythmic ping, ping, ping in 
the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing fungo golf, messing around," Arnold said. "He was still 
hitting. Here's the best hitter on the team and he's the last guy out of the 
cage." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncaged or not, Shanahan has a demeanor that is closer to lamb than lion. It's 
just his style. Introverted. Bookish. Analytical. Level-headed. Friendly, yet 
reserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go out and act like an idiot like a lot of guys do," Shanahan said. 
"I've never been somebody who does crazy things just for the sake of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, Coach Bill Kernen thought Shanahan's demeanor might lead to 
the player's downfall. Like some others, the coach thought Shanahan's internal 
fire was lacking, simply because it wasn't externalized. He never chucked a 
batting helmet, never screamed expletives at the top of his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the 1993 season, Kernen walked through a line of Matadors, 
player by player, and pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of each. He 
lauded, he chided, he prodded, he goaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh. Shanahan's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold vividly remembers the Kernen speech: "Shanahan, you gotta be more 
aggressive. If you want to run for governor, that's great. If you want to be my 
first baseman, well, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two seasons later, the coach has accepted Shanahan's understated 
manner. More importantly, the hard-working first baseman has earned the coach's 
respect -- no easy proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my kind of guy," Kernen said. "Guys with that kind of work ethic and 
those characteristics never have a problem with me." 
</P>
<P>
 To Shanahan's credit, he realized in his early teens that he wasn't going to 
achieve his long-term goal of playing professionally on tools alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since way back in grade school, I've been accustomed to working hard," 
said Shanahan, who carries a grade-point average of 3.3. "I take pride in the 
fact that the accomplishments I've made aren't because I'm God-gifted." 
</P>
<P>
 Early on this season, Shanahan's bat was hellishly uncooperative. Over the 
first 12 games, Shanahan was hitting a frigid .181 and had driven in all of 
three runs. He tumbled from fourth to eighth in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
 After two so-so seasons as a part-time starter, he had a cumulative average of 
.260 with seven homers and 44 RBIs. When he stumbled out of the gate in 1994, 
he questioned whether he could play in Southern California's college baseball 
hotbed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ready. He was willing. Was he able? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I was getting a little nervous," he said. "I was starting to 
wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 So Montana is nicknamed Big Sky Country? Somehow, Shanahan defrosted during a 
tournament at University of Florida, whereupon the batter's box became Big Fly 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the heat and humidity in Gainesville, because for Shanahan, it 
was capital gains-ville.  
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 27 doubleheader against Ohio State, Shanahan had six hits, and ever 
since, he's been the team's most productive hitter: Over the past 33 games, he 
is batting .410 with 41 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 He willed and worked his way out of the season-opening eight-for-44 slump, 
just like he taught himself to switch-hit. Shanahan is batting .328 left-handed 
and .410 as a righty. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan is the only Matador from beyond the California border. When he first 
arrived in Southern California as a naive 17-year-old, he was wide-eyed and on 
full alert, like Barney Fife on a trip to Mt. Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 A car driven by pitcher Jason Van Heerde, Shanahan's roommate of three years, 
once ran out of gas in a seedy part of San Bernardino after the pair's freshman 
season. Unsavory characters gave the duo the evil eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he had his hands on his bat the whole time," Van Heerde said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Missoula, population 60,000, Shanahan was a celebrity of sorts. As a senior 
at Sentinel High, he was an all-state basketball player who averaged 23.6 
points and 9.4 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 He was named to USA Today's honorable mention All-American team and got his 
mug shot in the national paper. 
</P>
<P>
 In football, he was a standout tight end and linebacker. There was no 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Montana is usually buried under a blanket of snow in the spring, high 
schools in the state don't field baseball teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan played American Legion ball over the summer, but lost dozens of 
valuable at-bats because he never played in high school in the spring. Kids in 
California, meanwhile, were playing 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen figures it's one reason Shanahan has been a late bloomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys out here have played zillions of innings," Kernen said. "And the 
caliber's completely different (than that of Montana)." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan will have the opportunity to gain some ground over the summer, when 
he and freshman teammate Eric Gillespie play for the Mat-su Miners of the 
Alaska Summer League, which includes some of the nation's top college players. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he needs to do is come back as a senior and just go off ," Kernen said. 
"He could make a major move toward being a very dominant college player. He's 
not reached the top of his development curve." 
</P>
<P>
 While Shanahan is a junior and eligible for the June amateur draft, few scouts 
have made Northridge a regular stop lately. On the positive side, Shanahan 
won't turn 21 until late August, which for pro scouts makes him a virtual kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid? For ballplayers who know Shanahan, that's a verb. He is razzed 
mercilessly about his home state. In 1991, while participating in the Olympic 
Festival baseball competition at USC, a player asked Shanahan where he was 
from. Shanahan answered, warily. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffed the player: "Montana. What state is that in?" 
</P>
<P>
 An altered state, say Shanahan's mates. Maybe it's all that clean air, all 
those family values. "You should see him and his girlfriend," Arnold said. 
"It's like the 'ABC After School Special' relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty much the All-American guy. Pretty much how you'd want your kids 
to turn out." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty much.

DESAUSSURE, LEANING NORTH, CHOOSES WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure, a football and track standout at Taft High, signed a 
national letter of intent with Washington on Wednesday, one day before the NCAA 
allowed USC -- his original first choice -- to recruit him again. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had stopped recruiting DeSaussure on April 11 and declared him ineligible 
at the school because of a possible rules violation after his participation in 
the Quincy Watts Invitational on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the NCAA cleared USC of wrongdoing, but DeSaussure said the 
controversy surrounding his eligibility did not influence his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, the defending City Section champion in the 100, 200 and 400, had 
been leaning toward playing football and running track for USC, but 
Washington's persistent recruiting altered his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just changed my mind, that's all," he said. "I did say I was leaning toward 
USC, but that doesn't mean I was definitely going to go there. I never made a 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure ran a leg on an unattached 400 relay team that included Watts -- 
the 1992 Olympic champion in the 400 -- in the collegiate meet at USC. The 
Trojans interpreted his actions as a possible NCAA rules violation because high 
school athletes are not allowed to compete in intercollegiate meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NCAA has determined that there was no recruiting advantage gained from 
(DeSaussure's) participation in the Quincy Watts Invitational," USC sports 
information director Tim Tessalone read from the NCAA statement, "and 
therefore, the NCAA has restored his eligibility to compete for USC should he 
choose to go there." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, who also took a recruiting trip to Arizona, is regarded as a 
project in football, but with personal bests of 10.74 seconds in the 100 
meters, 21.1 in the 200 and 47.11 in the 400, he has the speed to be a deep 
threat at wide receiver. He was the runner-up in the 400 in last year's state 
track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 27 receptions for 656 yards and five touchdowns last season.

NEWBURY PARK'S BENNETT A RELIGIOUS PRACTITIONER; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: HOPING 
IT'S HIS CALLING, CATCHER BOUND FOR MASTER'S COLLEGE WORKS ZEALOUSLY ON HIS 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bennett is a baseball-aholic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park High senior catcher has never been to a high school party, 
but he has taken batting practice in the middle of the night, illuminated only 
by car headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends his Friday and Saturday nights in a batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Geez, Jeff, do you do anything besides play baseball and go to school? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says. "Not really. But I'm pretty happy with my life the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's teammates are content with him too. He is batting .363 and leading 
the team with five home runs and 20 runs batted in, and he is one of the best 
defensive catchers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," says Shawn Adams. "It's unbelievable. He's finally hitting the 
way he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Must be because of those late-night sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Bennett and Adams took midnight batting practice only once. It was 
last summer. The two drove to the Newbury Park High batting cage and pulled the 
car up to the cage, using the headlights for light, although not much. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pitch black," Adams says. "You could just hear the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the sort of activity that typifies Bennett, who has helped lead the 
Panthers (15-5, 8-1 in Marmonte League play) into first place as they play host 
to rival Simi Valley (14-5, 6-3) today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, 17, started getting serious about baseball in the summer before his 
junior year. He and former teammate David Lamb, who is now playing in the 
Baltimore Oriole organization, would take batting practice together every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all we would do," says Bennett, who intends to play at The Master's 
next season. "He wanted to go pro and I wanted to get a scholarship and make 
something of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not hitting, Bennett is probably working on his catching. Watching 
catchers' footwork on television. Doing aerobics to quicken his feet. Working 
on keeping his hands soft, avoiding jabbing at the ball. Straightening his 
throws, which were always strong but had been wild in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a power-hitting catcher who has thrown out 36% of would-be base 
stealers, but the means to that end are sometimes irritating to those around 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom hates it," Bennett says. "She thinks I'm obsessed. I remember one time 
she was yelling at me. She said I was sick. She said I need balance in my life. 
But I just like to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Says his mother, Janet: "I really do think he needs to put a little more time 
into mowing the lawns and washing the cars, but he's never around when those 
things need to be done because he's out practicing baseball. But when I think 
of the things that he could be out doing, I'm glad he's playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 What about his girlfriend of a year and half, Robin Starkey? What does she 
think? 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very understanding," Bennett says. "At the beginning it was rocky 
because she wanted more attention, but I told her, I told her, for right now, 
baseball has to come first. She understands that's where I need to be right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Honest? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get in the way of his dream." Starkey says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of Bennett's dream is college baseball. A devout Christian, 
Bennett seems a natural for Master's. But he also would like to play 
professional baseball, so much so that he actually stopped going to church for 
a while so he could play in a scout league on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, rain washed out a batting session Bennett and Keith Smith, 
a projected second-round pick, were to take for a scout. And at least one 
person in professional baseball thinks Bennett can make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a lot better than people think," Lamb said from Florida, where 
he is playing in extended spring training with the Orioles. "He's just as good 
as the catchers down here. I think someone should draft him." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bennett is not drafted, he will happily study political science at 
Master's. His non-baseball dream -- difficult to believe he has one -- is to be 
a Secret Service agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play 'Guard the President' in the backyard," Bennett says. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard the President? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go into details," he says, "or I'll get razzed about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a change. Normally, his teammates kid him about his no-drinking, 
no-partying, no-cussing, church-going innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys give him a hard time because he's such a straight-up kid, the 
All-American boy," Adams says, "but a lot of people respect him for that too. 
There's a lot of pressure out there, but it just goes right by him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett says the razzing isn't too bad. Besides, no one is going to ride a kid 
too hard if he is 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds. Or if he is carrying the team, as 
Bennett did earlier in the season when the Panthers were heavy on pitching but 
doing little at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Thousand Oaks, Bennett was three for three with a pair of home runs, 
including a tiebreaking shot to center field in the seventh inning. Bennett's 
mother, incidentally, wrote a prayer for him before the game that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It said, 'If it be God's will, please let Jeff hit two home runs and throw 
out a runner at second,' " his mother says. "Then I showed it to him when he 
got home and he said, 'I didn't throw anyone out at second.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers might hope for similar prayer today. The team lost its first 
league game Wednesday against Camarillo and Bennett was hitless. A victory 
today against Simi Valley would give Newbury Park a three-game lead on the 
defending league champion with four to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are beating Simi," he says, "I could go 0 for 10 and be happy about 
it."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: FOR PATTLE, BASEBALL JUST ISN'T CRICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When three classmates from tiny Coutin High in Canoga Park persuaded Duncan 
Pattle to try out for the Coutin baseball team last year, Pattle was interested 
but hesitant. He had never played baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He had caught a ball before, but not with a glove. He had hit a ball before, 
but only when it was rolled on the ground toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattle was more familiar with cricket, a game he played often in his native 
Australia. Cricket includes bats, pitches and runs, but has little else in 
common with America's pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few dropped balls, awkward strikeouts and a year of schooling, the 
junior is now starting in center field for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to catch was the easy part. Pattle said he's dropped only one "easy" 
fly ball.  
</P>
<P>
 Hitting was another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt awkward to me," Pattle said. "I was used to hitting balls rolled on 
the ground to me. Adjusting the stance was the biggest thing." 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling most of last year, Pattle realized some of his potential when 
he hit his first homer in his last game. This season, the struggle continues, 
as Pattle's batting average hovers at about .215. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer Pattle returns to Australia. He's noticed that more Australians 
are getting into baseball, and attributes it to cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left we had only four stations," Pattle said. "Now there's 10 and more 
coming. There's a (baseball) game on almost every week. Everybody's wearing 
hats and knows what the game's about, but I'm learning firsthand." NORTHWEST 
VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to Catch Up 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real, which defeated West Valley League rival Chatsworth in the City 
4-A baseball final last year, has played well this season, winning 14 of its 18 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Conquistadores (6-3 in the conference) are three games behind 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making a run for themselves and putting everybody behind them," Coach 
Mike Maio said of Chatsworth. "If you get on a run and win those close ones, it 
puts you up." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real also trails Taft, another West Valley League school, which has 
played surprisingly well and has gone 7-2 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's tough," Maio said. "It's a very equal league." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how equal will be proved over the next month, when El Camino Real, 
Chatsworth and Taft all play one another three times. The top two league 
finishers will earn automatic playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how it should be," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "A battle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Weinstein and Jimmy Landress have sparked the offense of Granada Hills, 
which has played extremely well this season, beating El Camino Real twice and 
taking Chatsworth to extra innings in two losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have almost identical batting averages but different styles. Weinstein 
(.450, 18 for 40) bats leadoff and has nine stolen bases. Landress (.461, 18 
for 39) has six doubles and 13 RBIs. GOLDEN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Love That Thin Air 
</P>
<P>
 High altitude. A tough place to boil liquids. An easy place for pitchers to 
get into hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 Two area teams -- Palmdale and Quartz Hill -- have three players who are 
hitting .400 or above, and 10 players on the league's five area teams are 
hitting above .400. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's three players are Chris Paxton (.457), Jerome Payton (.436) and Bob 
Harmon (.420). Quartz Hill has Kyle Goss (.557), Aaron Brown (.471) and 
Jonathon Smith (.400). 
</P>
<P>
 The other area players are: John Hanggee (.465) of Littlerock, Casey Cheshier 
(.457) of Highland and Marcus Armstrong (.442) and Chris Tapia (.439) of 
Antelope Valley. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Baserunners Beware 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing players fortunate enough to reach base against the Royal softball 
team should be aware that they resemble sitting ducks in the mind of junior 
catcher Susan Torst.

 In 17 games, Torst has thrown out 15 runners attempting to steal. Even more 
impressive, Torst has picked off eight runners from first, second and third.

 "She's got a good arm," Coach Andy Silva said. "She's always looking to 
improve herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Highlanders expect to play without senior slugger Tricia 
Polhert for the rest of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Polhert, who has committed to Drake, suffered a broken ankle while trying to 
beat out a grounder April 5 against Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Polhert, who was batting a team-high .429 before the injury, is expected to be 
in an ankle cast another two weeks, but the Highlanders are hoping to get her 
back for the playoffs should Royal qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our fingers crossed," Silva said.

 Camarillo is the hottest baseball team in the league. The Scorpions have won 
four consecutive league games after an 0-4 start. The biggest was Wednesday's 
9-2 victory over first-place Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Jue was three for four with five runs batted in, including a grand slam. 
Ryan Bourget pitched a six-hitter in his first outing since arm problems 
sidelined him for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 And sophomores Nathan Kaup and Rodell Desamparo, who have sparked the 
turnaround, continued their hot hitting with two hits each. "We're playing as 
well as we've played all year," Coach Jack Willard said. "Hopefully, we can 
just keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
 With six games remaining, the Scorpions are a half-game behind Royal and 
Channel Islands for the third and final playoff spot in the league. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Five notable things that happened during Royal's 13-5 victory over Simi Valley 
on Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal pitcher Maki Kramer pitched the minimum four innings required to pick 
up the victory, his eighth in as many decisions. He didn't go farther because 
he was ejected for running over Simi Valley catcher Brian Kavanagh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley walked 12 batters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal center fielder Kevin Mellinger made a diving catch with his back to 
the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal's Joel Mellinger, Kevin's brother, was three for three, including his 
seventh triple of the season, and he had six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was a 25-minute rain delay, after which the Highlanders exploded for 
11 runs in three innings, overcoming a 4-2 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those games," Royal Coach Dan Maye said. "Just about everything 
you could think of happened." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A preseason article from a local publication predicted the Thousand Oaks boys' 
swimming team would be the fourth-best in Ventura County even though the 
Lancers had won 11 consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a perfect motivational tool for Lancer Coach Bill Gemberling, who 
promptly posted the article on the team's bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers dispatched two challengers last week with almost-identical scores. 
Thousand Oaks defeated Westlake, 114-73, then beat Royal, 114-72, to break a 
first-place tie and remain undefeated in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody came through real well and was ready," Gemberling said. "We've been 
looking at these meets all year." 
</P>
<P>
 The only threat remaining to catch the Lancers appeared to be Agoura, but 
Thousand Oaks thrashed the Chargers, 130-28, on Wednesday. CAMINO REAL LEAGUE

<P>
 Wet and Wild  
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff Coach Craig Sherwood called the Guards' 8-8 tie with St. Monica on 
Wednesday the weirdest game he's seen in 13 years of high school coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guards trailed St. Monica, 8-1, with two out in the fifth when rain 
started to fall. One more out and it's an official game . . . but hold on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff hit three consecutive singles to load the bases. Jason Plourde 
struck out, but the ball got away from the catcher. Plourde was safe at first 
and a run scored. 
</P>
<P>
 That was followed by a walk, a single, a walk, a walk and a two-run single by 
Dave Matekel that tied the score. Matekel was picked off first, ending the 
inning and the game. At that point, it was raining so hard the umpires called 
it a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that can match this," Sherwood said. "The old fat lady must 
have been getting wet in the rain and took off without getting a chance to 
sing."  
</P>
<P>
 Around the Leagues . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ventura boys' track team won its third consecutive Channel League title 
with a victory over Dos Pueblos and Hueneme in a triangular meet last week. The 
Cougars have posted a 21-0 record in league competition over the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Channel Islands right-hander Rene Sanchez (4-2) has back-to-back 
complete-game wins over Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks. He threw a four-hit 
shutout Wednesday against Thousand Oaks, striking out seven. Sanchez also has 
been hitting. He came into the Thousand Oaks game on a 5-for-10 streak. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agoura right-hander Cary Gallardo beat Westlake, 8-4, Wednesday. It was not 
only the Chargers' first league victory, but Gallardo's first since he threw a 
no-hitter against Van Nuys on March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's obvious which league currently dominates the Northwest Valley 
Conference. West Valley League teams (Chatsworth, Taft, El Camino Real and 
Reseda) won 22 of 32 games against North Valley League teams (Granada Hills, 
Kennedy, Cleveland and San Fernando) this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poly has won 11 consecutive games, and 15 of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doug Linde, one of Harvard-Westlake's top pitchers, will return this week 
after sitting out two weeks because of a sore ankle injured when he was hit by 
a pitch. The Wolverines need him back: They've lost four Mission League games 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pasadena has proved to be a great punching bag for Hoover's baseball team. 
In two league games against the Bulldogs, junior Ed Perez has three home runs 
and senior Ron Pirayoff has five doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hoover Coach Bob Cooper has rejoined the team after missing a chunk of the 
season because of a back injury, and junior pitcher Gerald DeLaPena is fully 
recovered from a sore elbow.

PARENTS, DISTRICTS CAN EXEMPT STUDENTS FROM STATE TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with mounting criticism, state education officials on Thursday informed 
local school officials that they may let parents exempt children from the CLAS 
student performance tests and should make samples of the exam questions 
available for scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams, given last year and under way again in thousands of California 
public schools, have sparked controversy among some parents and religious 
groups who contend that the test questions invade student privacy and promote 
anti-family values. Critics said questions were kept confidential to escape 
scrutiny and not, as officials maintained, to guard against cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're telling each district to make decisions for themselves," said Susie 
Lange, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education. "There's a bigger 
issue here for us and that's the exam. This was bogging everything down and we 
wanted the exams to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the department's decision, a San Bernardino County Superior Court 
judge demanded to review a copy of the exams and ruled that no local students 
would be required to take the tests. It was the latest of several rulings by 
judges and school boards letting parents opt out of the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams are the foundation of the California Learning Assessment System, 
which the state Legislature adopted to improve the measurement of student 
achievement in public schools. The exams are being given statewide this month 
and next to students in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Test results are used to compare student work in each school to tough 
performance standards in reading, writing, math and other subjects. Beginning 
this year, the tests are also designed to become part of a student's classroom 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Content of the exams became an issue after a reading exercise in some of last 
year's exams -- a story by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker -- was 
made public. The story, "Roselily," is about the thoughts of an unmarried 
mother on her wedding day. Some parents and religious groups complained that 
the story and some questions on the exams are inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, which said it defends religious 
liberty, said that teachers concerned about the content have leaked test copies 
to critics. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials maintain that the exams, which cost at least $15 
million to develop and administer, would become useless if actual questions 
were widely published or became known to students, teachers and parents. It is 
common practice for the questions on standardized tests to be kept 
confidential, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Thursday to local school officials, acting Supt. of Public 
Instruction William D. Dawson said that in light of the San Bernardino court 
ruling, no action would be taken against school districts that let parents 
decide whether to have their children skip the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The court action came in a suit filed by the Rutherford Institute on behalf of 
six students in San Bernardino-area school districts. Earlier this week, Judge 
Duane M. Lloyd granted a temporary restraining order letting students bow out 
of the tests, and Thursday he extended the order until a May 17 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd told the institute's attorney, Kimberly Laliberte, that other students 
could be added to the lawsuit and be immediately excused from the exams. "We'll 
be deluged," Laliberte said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Haueter, chief deputy county counsel for San Bernardino County, said that 
legal machinations were not necessary for parents who do not want their 
children to take the test, even though the state last week had threatened 
action against an Antelope Valley school board that gave parents the option of 
boycotting the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be insane for any (school) district to take any action against a 
child for refusing to take it," Haueter said. Each of the six districts that 
were sued have assured him, Haueter said, that no student will be forced to 
take the test. Moreover, it would be "unconscionable" for any district to force 
a student to take it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing portions of the exams require students to read 
passages or stories, discuss them in a group, and write answers to questions. 
To gauge writing and thinking skills, some students are asked their feelings 
about what they read and how the material relates to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Education officials say such performance-based exams provide a better measure 
of student abilities than multiple-choice exams, which are being phased out in 
several states. Nothing in the exam materials is objectionable, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Laliberte argued, however, that the exams are "inherently dangerous to the 
children, their families and their right to privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, noting that state law requires teachers to inform authorities if 
they believe students are victims of child abuse, said he was concerned how 
student responses might be interpreted. Some students might exaggerate their 
answers and trigger an investigation into abuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered San Bernardino County to turn over a copy of the test in a sealed 
envelope, and said he would consider appointing a referee -- perhaps a retired 
judge -- to review its contents and report his conclusion. County officials 
indicated that they would comply. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sacramento-area judge had also recently given parents the right to boycott 
the exams, and officials in three Ventura County districts -- Fillmore Unified, 
Oxnard Elementary and Oxnard Union High -- said this week they would let 
parents excuse students from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 A school board member in Simi Valley, however, expressed support for the exams 
after reviewing the material. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found none of the things that were alleged to be in the test by some of the 
groups" opposing CLAS, Simi Valley board member Doug Crosse said. "I found the 
literature to be age-appropriate. I found the literature to have a lot of 
socially redeeming values, to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Dacus, western regional coordinator for the Rutherford Institute, said 
the decision by the state Department of Education to allow parents to block the 
testing of their children means the state "has given in to the very fundamental 
parental rights . . . the state so grievously conspired to deprive." 
</P>
<P>
 He complained, however, that the state should have gone even further, by 
agreeing to administer the tests only after specific parental permission is 
given, rather than allowing parents the right to pull their children out of the 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the chains taken off from between our wrists, but they're still on our 
ankles," Dacus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Boards Assn., which asked the state to clarify the 
rules, said the announcement will give local school officials much-needed 
guidance and save the CLAS exams from political heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said it believes CLAS "is in serious jeopardy because of concerns 
expressed throughout the state regarding the purported content of test items 
and other political and implementation issues."

GIRLS GET A GLIMPSE OF THE WORKING WORLD; EDUCATION: 'TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO 
WORK DAY' SEEKS TO WIDEN CAREER PATHS. THE EVENT IS CUTE, BUT ALSO GETS DOWN TO

 At the restaurant Campanile, chef-owner Nancy Silverton is explaining the 
difference between Italian parsley and regular parsley to five would-be chefs, 
ages 6 to 11. "Let's go to the walk-in and pick out some vegetables," she said 
as the girls trailed behind her, some so short that their white chef's jackets 
look like nightshirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's culinary lesson was just part of Take Our Daughters to Work Day -- 
L.A.-style. On this day, girls -- and a few boys -- got to rub shoulders 
on-the-job with physicists and super-agents, dock workers and electricians, 
corporate lawyers and trendsetters. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, this being Los Angeles, the cameras were rolling. Fox television 
reporter Barbara Schroeder, on hand to chronicle the Campanile feast, did her 
stand-up with her 4-year-old daughter, Glenn, in tow. Glenn, cradled in 
Schroeder's arms and wearing a shade of hot pink lipstick that matched her 
dress, grinned deliciously, stuck the microphone in maitre d' Claudio Blotta's 
face and asked, "What does a maitre d' do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so cute," Schroeder said later. "The 'awww' factor is very big today." 
</P>
<P>
 And so was the event. No question about it, it was girls' day out. Everywhere 
you looked, from one edge of the continent to the other, there were girls at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 At BP America's headquarters in Cleveland, girls mixed chemicals to make 
slime. At the Aurora Fire Department near Denver, girls wrestled with fire 
hoses. At the New York law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, girls sat through a 
seminar called "Thinking Like a Lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, daughters of Administration officials and girls from local 
schools roamed the halls and ate sandwiches on the South Lawn, served by White 
House butlers in black ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to say to the young women of our society: You can grow up to do 
anything, to be anything, to achieve anything that your imagination and your 
effort and your talent will let you achieve," President Clinton told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the nationally observed Take Our Daughters to Work program -- the 
brainchild of the Ms. Foundation -- was a small undertaking in some Los Angeles 
offices and nonexistent in others. This year, the Hollywood Policy Center, a 
nonprofit, entertainment-community group, coordinated the event on the West 
Coast, spreading the word with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie studios and law firms and science laboratories held special programs. 
The event moved beyond an intimate family affair and became an outreach 
program. Some companies brought girls by the busload from schools -- 
particularly from lower income areas -- to serve as daughters-for-a-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent mailers saying try to find girls who might not get the chance," said 
Kathy Garmezy of the Hollywood Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us who have daughters, they've been around this stuff their whole 
lives," said actress Jill Eikenberry, who took a 16-year-old girl from Penny 
Lane, a residential treatment program in Northridge for emotionally handicapped 
girls, to work with her on the last episode of "L.A. Law." There are so many 
people who don't want to do what their mothers do or who don't have role 
models. It's nice to be able to do this for them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hollywood-area yard operated by the city's department of street 
lighting, girls took 25-foot-high rides in the "bucket" -- escorted by their 
protective fathers. (Yes, there is one woman, an electrical craft helper, and 
she went up with her niece.) 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I look?" asked Michelle Long, 14, after donning yellow helmet and 
orange safety vest. "Official," said her father, assistant electrician Tim 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Martin, on the other hand, was not particularly enthused by the peek 
that her father, Lt. Russ Martin, gave her into the Santa Monica Police 
Department, where he is executive officer in charge of operations. For one 
thing, she said, the department's sunrise briefing was "the most boring thing" 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 9-year-old said her day picked up when she hooked up with mom, Santa 
Monica park ranger supervisor Diane Martin, who arranged for a tour of the city 
jail. (It was empty.) Then came the highlight: the city animal shelter. "I love 
animals," said Katie, who is now considering a life with the park service. But 
then again, she said, maybe she'll just be a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other girls throughout the city getting a glimpse of inner sanctums 
that belonged to neither of their parents' worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the second annual Take Our Daughters to Work program -- 
expected to attract 3 million participants nationwide -- exposes young girls to 
the world of career options and begins to counteract the stunning loss of 
self-esteem that many girls undergo in adolescence, which has been reported in 
well-publicized recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The day did not pass without controversy, though: There were complaints that 
it excluded boys. For that reason, Chrysler Corp. said it was not taking part 
and was discouraging workers from bringing daughters to the office. Other 
companies, such as Rockwell International and First Interstate Bank, dubbed the 
day: Take Our Children to Work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boys complained directly to their mothers. "My son said, 'Take me to 
work' " said Eikenberry of her 12-year-old son. "But he gets to go to work with 
me all the time. I said, 'This is a thing about girls. Many girls feel they 
don't have the opportunities that boys do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for Silverton's 9-year-old son. "I think he feels today that girls get 
more special things," the chef said. "I told him that traditionally it was 
expected that men would ordinarily get a career. This whole day is for 
daughters to see what their mothers do." 
</P>
<P>
 Or to see what their mothers want them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kim Wardlaw, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, said a colleague's 
secretary asked Wardlaw to shepherd her daughter around. "She said, 'I don't 
want her to be a secretary. I want her to be a lawyer,' " Wardlow recounted. "I 
perfectly understood. My mother was a bookkeeper and a secretary, and she 
refused to let me take typing because she wanted me to be her boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents actually were ushering their daughters around in the hopes of 
discouraging them from creating a family tradition. The ploy didn't work for 
Los Angeles Police Detective Wayne Dufort, who brought his 14-year-old 
daughter, Nicole Dufort, to the Van Nuys station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a detective just like my dad," she declared. "He goes around and 
looks for criminals. He goes from house to house looking for gang members. I 
think it's fun and it's exciting," said Nicole, who said she doesn't want to be 
a nurse, like her mom, because it's too boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls stepped into completely alien worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls from Washington Irving Middle School outside Eagle Rock, for example, 
rushed to sign up for the trip to Creative Artists Agency, one of the most 
powerful talent agencies in town, although few of them had any idea what an 
agent does. Once ensconced in the art-filled interior, they were treated to 
words of wisdom -- women agents and producers talked about how they made their 
way in Hollywood -- a tour of the building, lunch in a conference room and even 
a sampling of scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch, agent Michael Ovitz, one of the founders of CAA, appeared at the 
doorway to the conference room to greet the girls and ask if they had any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael started in a mailroom -- just like the one downstairs," CAA's Anna 
Perez told the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do now?" said Stephanie Gima, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, I'm not really sure," Ovitz said with a chuckle. He then gave a more 
serious overview. "We're in all areas of the entertainment business," he 
explained.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, girls met with women scientists 
and heard stories of how they grew up hating math, of college science classes 
with 70 men and three women, and of telling guys at parties that their major 
was art in an effort not to intimidate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think of women (in JPL) as much as older men who've been doing 
something with white coats and carrying around a big notebook," said Laura 
Jones, 11, whose father, Ross M. Jones, is an aerospace engineer supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 At other offices, the opaque was made more comprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Pedro, 14-year-old Erin Boyd strapped herself into the front passenger 
seat of a Jet Ranger 206 helicopter and got to give commands. "Air 170 clear," 
she said to the radio voice. "170 Roger," the voice said to her. As commanding 
officer of operations for the Port Police, her father, Lt. Ronald Boyd, 
routinely takes a ride in the airship to monitor the port for hazardous waste 
spills or cargo theft. Having his daughter at work "takes some of the mystery 
out of dad, especially a dad who has a mysterious job," Ronald Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the copter landed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did pretty good," Ronald Boyd said to her daughter. "Some policemen, it 
takes them a lot longer to show them how to do this." 
</P>

2 YEARS AFTER RIOTS, PRIVATE SECTOR PROVES NO PANACEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Garth Brooks AstroTurf Field, situated in the side parking lot of a 
Compton shopping plaza, is not your prototypical field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Most afternoons, the unadorned hunk of green carpet sits unused as youngsters 
zip through their homework, practice computer skills and pump iron next door in 
the state-of-the-art Youth Education Town after-school complex -- a $600,000 
response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots by the National Football League, country 
music star Brooks and the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do play on the synthetic turf must watch their step while running 
pass patterns. The south end of the rug abuts a metal fence and the west 
sideline is, literally, the exterior wall of a discount department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Donated by the manufacturer and touted by RLA as a $100,000 investment in the 
inner city, the pint-sized field in many ways typifies the swirl of good 
intentions, scattered successes, slapdash execution and unabashed hype that has 
characterized efforts to revitalize riot-scarred neighborhoods of Los Angeles 
since the civil disturbances that broke out two years ago today. 
</P>
<P>
 The rioting, which left 55 dead, 2,300 injured and more than 1,100 buildings 
damaged, was not just the most deadly U.S. civil disturbance of the 20th 
Century; it was also the first disaster of its sort in which government's 
primary response was to hand over the reins of rebuilding efforts to the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks after being appointed by then-Mayor Tom Bradley and Gov. Pete 
Wilson to create Rebuild L.A., now known as RLA, 1984 Olympics czar Peter V. 
Ueberroth launched a public relations blitz trumpeting an infusion of dollars 
by major corporations to inner-city business development, job training programs 
and charities. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Ueberroth and four co-chairs announced their individual 
resignation plans last year, they insisted, in the face of criticism from 
community groups, that the private effort was an unprecedented success because 
it had netted $585 million in new corporate investments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a close analysis of the dollar tally shows that it was bloated, an 
assessment that is shared by new RLA President Linda Griego. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the mixed success of rebuilding efforts raises serious questions about 
the private sector as a panacea, particularly at a time when cities and 
counties are increasingly turning toward privatization as a solution to budget 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the reliance on the private sector has made it easy for government 
officials to rationalize their own inaction. The record also shows that the 
corporate leadership of RLA was no more reluctant than some politicians to make 
sweeping statements that don't always fit the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 One program included in the $585 million RLA total as a four-year, 
$40-million, post-riot investment was the Southern California Gas Co.'s home 
weatherization program. That program, designed to make older houses across Los 
Angeles more energy-efficient, has been in operation since 1983. Griego said 
the gas company program should never have been included in RLA's tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Another program counted by RLA as a $30-million inner-city investment was 
First Interstate Bancorp's 1992 offer to grant short-term "gap" loans to small 
businesses that suffered riot damage. Only about $5 million was ever loaned, a 
spokesman said, because the bank received fewer applications than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single investment on the RLA list was Vons' $100-million pledge to 
open new grocery stores in Los Angeles and surrounding communities. Although it 
was not made clear at a post-riot news conference, Vons is counting new stores 
in North Las Vegas and Pomona as part of the commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 When informed of the far-flung nature of Vons riot-related spending three 
months ago, then RLA Co-Chairman Bernard Kinsey said he had not been aware of 
it. Yet days later, in announcing his post-resignation plans, Kinsey failed to 
revise the RLA tally, citing the $585 million at the top of his list of 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego, who is increasingly shifting RLA's focus to expansion of small 
businesses, is conducting an audit to establish a more realistic total and to 
determine the extent of unfulfilled pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had difficulty with (the figures). . . . What did we really gain?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An early RLA report estimated that an investment of $6 billion and 75,000 to 
94,000 new jobs would be needed to revitalize the impoverished neighborhoods of 
Los Angeles. The official post-riot inquiry also cited inner-city poverty and 
unemployment as having helped turn the city into a tinderbox. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the primarily private effort has come up short. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $280 million in corporate commitments has been targeted for 
business development, RLA says. All but $60 million of that amount was in 
pledges from the Vons, Smart & Final, Ralphs and Food 4 Less chains to build 31 
new inner-city outlets. So far, 10 have been built, creating 670 jobs. Even if 
all 31 are eventually constructed, fewer than 3,330 new jobs will result. 
</P>
<P>
 William G. Ouchi, a senior adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan, calls the limited 
success of the private effort unsurprising given the lackluster business 
climate in Los Angeles. "Economic activity has been slow to come back because 
the recession has lasted so long," he said, "and because we are still in the 
defense build-down." 
</P>
<P>
 That is precisely the problem in having relied on the private sector, said 
James Johnson, director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no incentive for them to do it, and secondly, they don't have the 
tools to do it alone," Johnson said. "The civil unrest reflected years of 
neglect on a number of different fronts -- fronts that the private sector was 
not prepared to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you can pull off an Olympics in the private sector, that was fun 
and games. (The riots) were hardly fun and games." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth, in resigning from his co-chair post last May, voiced frustration 
with the lack of government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Mayor Bradley, asked Tuesday about the success of rebuilding efforts, 
refused comment, except to say, "I'm retired." Bradley now works for a private 
law firm and remains an RLA board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics released this week by Griego, who served as a deputy mayor under 
Bradley, show that the city of Los Angeles spent a mere $4.1 million from its 
own budget on specific post-riot revitalization programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure is only $300,000 more than a jury ordered the city to pay last 
week in compensatory damages to motorist Rodney G. King for his 1991 beating by 
Los Angeles police. It was the not-guilty verdicts in the first criminal trial 
of four officers that sparked the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 State funds for post-riot revitalization amounted to $68 million and federal 
funds totaled $700 million, although much of the latter spending was directed 
toward policing costs, emergency assistance and loans for riot victims. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a year, the city has yet to identify projects for a 
$60-million federal economic development loan meant to spur post-riot 
commercial development. Indeed, the City Council last January turned over half 
of the funds to the city Housing Department to construct affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi says the Riordan Administration's inner-city revitalization strategy 
leans heavily on citywide efforts, including upgrading of the Alameda Street 
industrial rail and truck corridor, improved mass transit, programs to reduce 
crime and a hoped-for $100 million in federal empowerment zone funding that 
would provide tax credits to inner-city businesses that hire neighborhood 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 With official revitalization efforts moving slowly, grass-roots community 
groups have turned elsewhere for help. The Coalition of Neighborhood 
Developers, composed of 56 nonprofit civic, church and economic development 
agencies in central and southern Los Angeles, recently received a $32-million 
commitment from the Local Initiatives Support Corp. to build affordable rental 
housing and develop a retail shopping plaza that would include a new 
supermarket. LISC is a national organization founded by the Ford Foundation 
that channels private-sector resources to nonprofit developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses have also come forward. Earvin (Magic) Johnson and officials 
of Sony Pictures Entertainment announced plans this week to bring a 12-screen 
movie theater to Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA's list of post-riot corporate investments shows a mixed record of results. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more striking failures was the Paradise Market, an open-air swap 
meet, free clinic and learning center that was the brainchild of 
then-businessman and now-mayor Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the week it opened, most of the 15 vendors reported little 
business. And several complained after it closed in June, 1993, that Riordan, 
who contributed more than $300,000 to start up the South-Central venture, did 
little to assist after reaping a flood of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan says the market failed because it was difficult to generate business 
overnight. "Things that evolve slowly tend to do better," he reflected. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other privately funded programs have been slow in getting off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A new health center in a closed-down Kaiser Permanente building in Inglewood 
was supposed to be fully operational last month. However, it is now providing 
only limited outpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after announcing the formation of the Neighborhood Beverage Co., 
officials of the African American-owned firm are still seeking financing for 
the $30-million venture. The soft drink bottling plant and warehouse will not 
open for business before early next year, they now predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron Corp. donated $1.3 million to purchase a building for a South-Central 
adult job training center to be operated by a nationally recognized training 
agency. The Opportunities Industrialization Center has so far graduated only 
nine retail sales students and helped to place four of them in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most successful inner-city ventures have been the expansions of 
chain retailers in riot-ravaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Auto Parts quickly rebuilt six of seven stores gutted during the riots, 
repaired 27 others that were looted and opened seven new outlets in south Los 
Angeles. The Smart & Final chain has added four new inner-city groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America, meanwhile, loaned $25 million to small businesses damaged in 
the riots, requiring no repayment for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most forward-thinking response has been a handful of youth 
training and job programs providing inner-city youngsters a head start toward 
college and careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakia Antee, 18, one of the first graduates of the $2-million Shell Oil Co. 
youth job training center, is the first member of her family to attend college. 
She says her part-time post in a Century City attorney's office helped set her 
sights on a career as a criminal lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of high school students don't have the opportunity to work in any 
environment," said Antee, who still works part-time while attending Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. "If you have a mentor behind you, it gives you the initiative 
to go ahead and excel." 
</P>
<P>
 Program officials help find after-school jobs for 75 South-Central high school 
students a semester and pay 50% of their salaries. Once a week, the students, 
who work in hospitals, retail stores and law offices, attend a class in the 
program's modern classroom behind a rebuilt service station. Topics include 
resume writing and dressing for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt if we start with young people, we can make a difference in changing 
their lives," Shell spokesman Bob Russ said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in it for Shell? "We feel long-term, by providing these meaningful 
opportunities for South-Central residents, it will eventually translate into 
increased gas sales," Russ said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL center in Compton provides a safe, structured after-school educational 
and physical training program for youngsters who might otherwise be tempted to 
spend the time watching cartoons at home or hanging out with friends on some of 
the community's meanest streets. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent afternoon, Floyd Hodge, a seventh-grader, sat in a classroom in the 
center, preparing a list of his personal strengths, weaknesses and goals at the 
request of a tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Hodge listed willpower, the possibility of attending college 
and people trying to encourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 On the debit side were entries that no 14-year-old in a saner world would have 
to think about: "People saying they're going to kill me," and the tragic death 
of his grandfather, a youth baseball coach who was struck by a stray bullet in 
a drive-by shooting at a city park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center gets me away from a lot of things like gang violence," Hodge said. 
"If I hang out, there's a chance of me getting shot. If I'm here, I'm safer."

RIORDAN HAS SECRETARY MONITOR HIS PHONE CALLS; PRIVACY: MAYOR SAYS HE MAY NOT 
HAVE TOLD ALL CALLERS, BUT 'THE SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL AND IT'S VERY ETHICAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has had his secretary listen in and 
summarize many of his phone conversations, at times without the knowledge of 
the callers at the other end of the line, sources close to the mayor say. 
</P>
<P>
 The behind-the-scenes note-taking, which has included candid and politically 
sensitive exchanges with top political, business and civic leaders, occurred 
throughout Riordan's campaign for mayor and has continued since he took office, 
the sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he usually notifies people that his secretary is on the line, and 
said she is simply helping him keep track of the crush of business he conducts 
over the telephone. "The system works very well and it's very ethical," the 
mayor said. "I have nothing to be ashamed about." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics in and out of City Hall questioned the practice. Five city 
officials who speak occasionally to Riordan on the phone, including MTA 
Commissioner Stan Sanders, told The Times that the mayor has not informed them 
that his secretary was monitoring their calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the city attorney's office saw potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Charles I. Goldenberg, chief of special operations, said 
the law is not altogether clear on the issue, but said he would advise against 
any monitoring without disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a better practice is to let the party know that someone is listening 
in," Goldenberg said. "My advice to someone who is doing this is not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires that all parties to a "confidential communication" be 
notified if it is being monitored by someone else. At issue is whether a phone 
conversation involving public business could be considered "confidential" and 
whether taking notes while using an extension telephone constitutes monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad S. Phillips, an attorney with Munger, Tolles & Olson and chairman of 
California Common Cause, suggested the practice could violate Penal Code 
Section 631, a wiretapping statute that forbids making "any unauthorized 
connection without the consent of all parties." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, officials in the Riordan Administration said they are 
comfortable with the note-taking process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our own legal counsel has reviewed our practice and finds that there is no 
problem and that it is perfectly legal," Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said 
Thursday. "If it has not been clear in the past (that someone else was on the 
line), the mayor will strive to make it clear in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview, Riordan said that his secretary is often on the line 
to assist him. He said she jots down telephone numbers and occasional notes but 
does not take down conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a job that requires implementing many different things every day and 
if I have to carry them around in my pocket, on a note or in my mind, I'm going 
to let a lot of them drop," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that most of the time he notifies the other party that the secretary 
is on the line, although he said there may be cases when she comes on without 
notification. "I think people know," Riordan said. "If there's any sensitivity 
at all, I would make certain they knew or make sure she did not interrupt the 
call in any way. . . . I think the office operates in a very ethical way. . . . 
We're not devious people at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that Carole Guillen, Riordan's executive secretary, has taken 
down comprehensive summaries of conversations with journalists, top corporate 
leaders and figures from the highest echelons of state and local government 
without the other party realizing that she was listening in. 
</P>
<P>
 "She pretty much takes down, almost verbatim, what's being said," said one 
official who has seen Guillen typing conversations into her computer. "And she 
does it secretly." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen, who has been Riordan's secretary for three years, previously worked 
at TRW, where she had a top security clearance, Deputy Mayor Kramer said, 
praising her discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the monitoring, Alfred R. Villalobos, a former deputy mayor to 
Riordan, said he, too, frequently had his secretary on the line when he worked 
in the mayor's office and that he rarely disclosed her presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never told anyone she was on the line because I didn't think it was 
relevant," Villalobos said. "It is the only way to function when you have more 
than 100 calls a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos, who resigned in December after five months in City Hall, said his 
secretary took down telephone numbers and other follow-up information so he 
would not have to take detailed notes when he drove in his car or paced around 
his office using the speaker phone. But he said his secretary did not take down 
conversation summaries and that he knew nothing about Riordan's secretary doing 
it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen participates in virtually all of the mayor's business calls, whether 
he is in his office, at his Brentwood home or in his Ford Explorer, mayoral 
aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen and the mayor are on the line first, the aides say. Then she creates a 
conference call with the third party, enabling her to use the mute button on 
the phone to enter or exit the conversation. Riordan has a buzzer on his phone 
to summon her onto the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in privacy law say that having a secretary listen in on an extension 
and take notes without the knowledge of both parties could be improper and a 
violation of the state privacy statute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The penal code prohibits the unauthorized listening of confidential 
conversations," said attorney Joe Posner, who specializes in employment law. 
"If I call up somebody and I want my assistant to listen I will say, 'I have 
so-and-so on the squawk box.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he routinely notifies the other person when Guillen or anybody 
else is on the line or pushes a buzzer to signal that Guillen is joining the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Guillen only writes brief remarks on conversations, not lengthy 
summaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer produced a daily message log from early April that included very brief 
notes of whom the mayor was to call on a particular matter or which aide would 
follow up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the case that Carole Guillen is a constant presence on all the 
mayor's calls," Kramer said. "To characterize it that way is just not fair or 
right or accurate. In the case where the mayor is calling in from his car, she 
does conference people in and she comes in and out of the conversation to make 
sure the mayor's needs are being taken care of. She is not a hanger-on." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials contacted by The Times said they are concerned that a computer in 
the mayor's office might contain summaries of some of their most delicate 
conversations with Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very, very difficult to believe that the mayor would do this," 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. "It is commonly understood between elected 
officials that there is no third party participating. If true, this is a breach 
of faith, a violation of privacy and just plain unethical behavior. It is also 
rank stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Commissioner Sanders, an attorney and Riordan ally, said it is common for 
corporate attorneys to have a secretary participate in conversations and even 
to summarize them. But he said it is critical that all parties know that the 
note-taking is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said Riordan has never indicated that his secretary was listening 
during their conversations. He said it would concern him if notes were compiled 
of private talks he had with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Others close to the mayor said the practice is politically unwise and ought to 
be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that's in a computer could become public," said one Riordan ally. 
"It is just plain stupid to write certain things down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times on Thursday requested copies of the phone records under the 
California Public Records Act. Deputy Mayor Kramer said the request is under 
consideration, but added that such memos are routinely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary, Guillen, 30, followed Riordan from his law firm of Riordan & 
McKinzie. Although little-known to the public, she wields considerable power 
within the mayor's office, often determining who has access to Riordan and 
participating in the planning of his daily schedule, according to aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen, who declined to be interviewed, is scheduled to start maternity leave 
soon and has been training another secretary to handle her duties during her 
absence, mayoral aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he will continue to use his secretary and other staffers to get 
the city's business done. He said he has not done anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always reach out and find people who feel any way you want on any 
subject," Riordan said of his critics. "You can have the usual 10 suspects you 
can call and get any opinion you want. I think the people who deal with me 
think I'm aboveboard, that I'm ethical, that I don't hide things from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The secretarial monitoring is not done "out of any deviousness," said Riordan, 
who estimates that he picks up the telephone more than 100 times a day. "It is 
out of efficiency to get things done. Nobody has ever been embarrassed by it or 
will be."

ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE COOLS OFF UNEXPECTEDLY; PRODUCTION: MODEST 2.6% QUARTERLY 
RISE IN THE GDP FALLS SHORT OF FORECASTS, SETTING OFF INTEREST RATE ALARMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. economy cooled surprisingly in the first three months of the year, 
after a sizzling growth surge in late 1993, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday in a report that raised alarm bells about the effect of higher 
interest rates on the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest growth rate of 2.6% in gross domestic product -- the total of all 
goods and services produced in the nation -- came in sharply below the 7% pace 
for the final quarter of last year, the government said in its first overview 
of the economy for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 And while economists greeted the data as evidence of steady growth with low 
inflation, the report sparked a heated and unusually extreme range of reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates rocketed higher, the stock market plunged and 
politicians slammed the Federal Reserve Board for interest-rate hikes that they 
claim endanger the recovery. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds soared to 
7.26% Thursday from 7.10% on Tuesday, and the Dow Jones industrial average slid 
31.23 points to 3,668.31. 
</P>
<P>
 The GDP report is a statistical snapshot and highlights how quirky and 
unpredictable the economy can be: A slip in exports that reflected conditions 
outside the United States, unusually severe winter weather and a drop in 
federal spending all exerted drag on the quarterly performance, government 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials seized on the report, which will be revised next month, 
as evidence that the national recovery is cruising ahead without new inflation. 
And they generally were backed up by private economists who had forecast a 
brisker, 3% to 3.5% growth pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a clear signal to the market that we have no inflation worry," 
President Clinton told reporters. "This rate of growth is enough to keep the 
deficit coming down and jobs coming into the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the current, jittery financial climate, some investors found cause for 
worry in the fine print of the report: A somewhat esoteric inflation gauge, 
known as the GDP price deflator, ticked up to an annual rate of 2.6%, from an 
even lower, 1.3% rate late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing in that report someone could seize on is that 2.6% deflator," 
said Jack Mackey, managing director of the Piper Jaffray investment firm in San 
Francisco. "Apparently, people thought it means more inflation, and wanted to 
sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, concerned that the late-1993 surge in growth was 
setting the stage for future inflation, has raised interest rates three times 
this year and is expected to move again soon, perhaps in May. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of the worries, however, economists generally say it can take up to a 
year for higher interest rates to restrain growth, so that recent rate hikes 
played little role in the first-quarter data. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way too early for rising interest rates to slow the economy," said 
Donald Ratajczak, an economic forecaster at Georgia State University. "Maybe at 
the end of the year -- but not now." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, news of the sudden reduction in growth was enough to spread 
worries about the recovery's longevity and to unleash a new round of criticism 
of the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy already has slowed while the Fed was acting to restrain it," said 
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), who joined Sen. Paul S. 
Sarbanes (D-Md.) in slamming the central bank. "The Fed's recent moves threaten 
to choke off the economic expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists took a more sanguine view of the overall report. Measures of 
home-building, equipment investment and consumer spending all appeared 
consistent with a stable recovery, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, slowdowns in business caused by frigid weather in much of the 
country, such as commercial construction, are likely to be made up in the 
spring, suggesting the economy is growing in the range of 3% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report has a pretty consistent message -- and it's that the U.S. economy 
is doing fine," said Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data, a 
financial advisory firm in Boston. She added: "The cherry on top of the sundae 
is that it's all happening without evidence of accelerating inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Other statistics released Thursday seemed to tell a more ambiguous tale. The 
Commerce Department said orders for big-ticket durable goods rose 0.4% in 
March, somewhat less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits last week fell 
31,000 to 333,000, suggesting strength in the job market, although a four-week 
average of new claims rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said Thursday that the 2.6% growth rate, while hardly ebullient, 
was a comfortable tempo because it falls in a range that the economy can absorb 
without overheating or going cold. "Any stronger growth, and you have fear of 
inflation. Any lower growth, and people are concerned that the recovery can't 
sustain itself," Kimelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration sought to hammer home this theme as top officials 
echoed the President's upbeat remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report confirms that the underlying fundamentals of the economy are 
sound," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers. "Growth continues to be solid and inflation continues to be modest." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, growth is expected to rise a bit in the second quarter, analysts 
said, because temporary events gave the impression that the economy is weaker 
than it actually is. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports, for example, which fell $19.7 billion in the first quarter, could 
make a comeback when overseas economies grow stronger, analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, construction of office buildings and other commercial structures 
fell $6.7 billion due to the bad winter weather, and is expected to to bounce 
back in the spring. Also, earthquake rebuilding could push up home-building in 
the coming months, a category that nonetheless rose $5 billion in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construction is a plus in the next quarter," declared Michael L. Penzer, a 
senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just some of the reasons that economists believe the recovery 
remains on a growth path of 3% or greater -- and that investors expect another 
interest-rate hike soon. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of six-month or 12-month periods, contrary to looking at just one 
quarter, depicts a steady increase in economic growth, Penzer said, suggesting 
that inflationary pressures could emerge in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed isn't looking backwards at what inflation has been," he said. "It's 
worried about where inflation is going to go."

COLUMN ONE; PUTTING THEIR TRUST IN THE GUN; IN CRIME-SCARRED MIAMI, MORE 
RESIDENTS SAY CARRYING A FIREARM IS NOW PART OF DAILY LIFE. FLORIDA LEADS A 
GROWING NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE WIDENED USE OF CONCEALED WEAPONS.

<P>
 The men of Wilbur Enterprises are never at a loss for firepower. At work in 
their fortified office, out on a job in their company trucks, off for a night 
on the town, they dress for the occasion and they always pack heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Loaded guns lay scattered, in desk drawers and under counters, throughout the 
light-construction firm's warehouse on a hardscrabble stretch of 7th Avenue in 
north Miami. Inside his waistband, the boss, Blair Wilbur, 67, keeps a .38 
Smith and Wesson, as essential in its deadly purpose as a light shirt is in 
enduring Florida's wilting climate. One son who works at the firm regularly 
carries a pistol. Another keeps a shotgun in his pickup truck. Even the 
company's 71-year-old gofer totes a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a date out one night and I had the .38 in my shoulder holster," Wilbur 
said. "I asked her if she had a problem with me carrying a gun. She says no, 
she's used to it. Everyone in Miami's used to it. That's probably because 
everyone's carrying." 
</P>
<P>
 It has come to this: In a nation where city streets are seen as stalking 
grounds for violent offenders, the pervasive fear of crime that once impelled 
Americans to buy guns to secure their homes now persuades growing numbers to 
take firearms into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Los Angeles Times Poll in January, 22% of the residents of 
gun-owning households said they sometimes carry their weapons outside for 
protection -- substantially higher than the 13% who said they did so in a 1981 
Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Law-abiding gun owners who want to carry a weapon are often forced to act like 
secret gunslingers -- hiding pistols in purses, pockets and car glove boxes -- 
to avoid arrest under local and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, those prohibitions have begun to fall. Since 1987, 
Florida and nine other states have passed laws making it easier for residents 
to carry guns. This spring, as the federal Brady Act imposed a five-day waiting 
period on handgun purchases, a gun-carrying measure prevailed in Arizona and 
similar bills gained ground in six other states. In Texas, only Gov. Ann 
Richards' veto threat stopped the creation of a statewide firearm-carrying 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people are realizing that the police won't be there when you 
need them," said Jeffrey Snyder, a Washington lawyer who has become a talk-show 
apostle for the concealed-weapons movement. "Your life is either worth 
protecting or it's not. And if it is, it's worth protecting all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of more Americans arming themselves against street crime is 
recasting the debate that has raged for years over the presence of guns in 
almost half of the nation's households. For both gun activists, who insist on 
the right to protect themselves at home, and gun-control supporters, who depict 
weapons left in the home as a primary cause of fatal accidents and suicides, 
the flow of firearms to the streets -- where 87% of violent crimes are 
committed -- poses unsettling new realities. 
</P>
<P>
 As more guns are carried legally by Americans, will they provide a strong 
deterrent to crime? Or will they provoke more bloodshed, inflaming minor 
encounters into lethal shootouts? 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years after the Florida Legislature passed a sweeping permit system 
allowing the law-abiding to carry concealed weapons, Miami and surrounding Dade 
County have become the ultimate proving grounds for these questions. Violent 
crime festers here as it does everywhere -- but in Miami the average citizen 
can fight back with the legal right to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging verdict here offers little comfort to either side. The defensive 
carrying of guns has not resulted in an upsurge in violence, but neither has it 
demonstrably reduced the city's crime rates or helped to quell fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to have a whole new class of people on the street who basically are 
carrying their guns without incident," said state Sen. Howard Forman, who had 
opposed the passage of Florida's liberalized concealed-weapons bill. "In that 
sense, I guess, it's working." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, residents over age 21 who have neither a felony record nor a history of 
drug abuse or mental illness can obtain a permit to carry a gun. They must pass 
a police background check, pay a $160 application fee and take a gun-safety 
course. Then, they are given a renewable three-year license to carry guns 
almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, by contrast, the city Police Commission has maintained a 
virtual freeze on concealed-weapons permits for years. Last year, that ban 
thawed slightly after the city was successfully sued by gun-rights activists. 
Lawyers have been working out the final terms of a settlement broadening the 
right to obtain weapons licenses, but Assistant City Atty. Byron Boeckman said 
new permits will likely be restricted to those who face an imminent threat and 
"have no other alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, 27,636 Dade County residents were licensed to carry guns. That 
is just 1.5% of nearly 2 million inhabitants, but a meteoric rise since 1987, 
when only 500 county residents had local permission to carry guns. State 
officials say 28% of Florida's concealed-weapons permits are based in Dade 
County, far outstripping any other jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The motivation is simple: People are frightened they will become victims like 
the stretcher-bound corpses they see on the nightly news. Other self-defense 
options -- dogs, whistles, blinding sprays, cellular phones -- no longer seem 
adequate. Only a gun will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in this resort of the last resort, Brian Geenty, a north Miami resident 
who works for a general contractor and rents rooms to recovering drug addicts, 
carries a pistol in a leather belt pouch as he makes his daily rounds through 
the city. Geenty curses the law that arms him, yet says he is a dead man 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would use (my gun) only to kill," he said one morning, driving by crack 
smokers huddled in the sunlight along north Biscayne Boulevard. "I made that 
decision the day I bought my gun. God, I wouldn't want to do that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Rodgers, a south Miami housewife, brings her .38 on daily walks 
through the woods near her suburban home. A year ago, the idea of packing a gun 
seemed abhorrent. But the world has changed. Her friends now talk about guns 
obsessively -- the models, the training, "the kick" of a gunshot.  
</P>
<P>
 From his office window in north Miami, Blair Wilbur points to what he sees as 
the signs of crime that keep him armed every day -- the transients who loiter 
in the empty lots near his office on N.W. 7th Avenue, the quarter-sized bullet 
hole in his firm's aluminum rear door, the vandalized fleet of cars in the 
parking lot next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur admits to having carried a gun illegally "for years." When state 
concealed-weapons licenses became available, he applied. Now he carries the 
light blue permit next to his driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the presence of the .38 under his belt, Wilbur, like many 
law-abiding Miamians who arm themselves, says his fears have not lessened much. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this gives me is the knowledge that if someone comes at me, one of us is 
going to get it and it won't be me," he said, patting the butt of his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-three percent of respondents told The Times Poll in January that they 
doubt laws making guns more available to citizens would have much effect on 
violent crime. And while even 59% of those who said they carry guns insist that 
having their weapons helps them feel safer, 35% said their fears have not been 
not quelled. 
</P>
<P>
 For most gun carriers, the moment of truth may never come. According to Sgt. 
Richard Bohan, Miami Police homicide supervisor, justifiable gun defenses by 
civilians account for 1% to 4% of the deaths his unit investigates each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good indication of how rarely people who carry guns get to use them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun-rights activists respond that a drop in Miami's violent crime shows the 
real impact that gun defenses can have. Last year, robberies dropped to 6,930 
from 7,077 in 1992, and reported rapes fell to 305 from 403. 
</P>
<P>
 But murders remained unchanged at 131, and police officials note that the 
liberalized permit law was in effect during the late 1980s, when the city's 
violent crime rate was higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really impossible to show a cause-and-effect between defensive handgun 
uses and the ups and downs of crime," Bohan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police statistics are meaningless when it comes to legitimate gun defenses, 
argues Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist whose controversial 
theories are at the center of the debate over concealed-weapons laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleck has become an academic hero to gun-rights activists for arguing that 
residents of 4% to 6% of U.S. households successfully use a gun in self-defense 
each year -- between 1 million and 2.5 million times -- in homes, cars, 
businesses and in street encounters. Critics say those incidents are rare, but 
Kleck insists they justify the use of guns for self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Using private polls and results from the U.S. National Crime Survey, Kleck 
paints a portrait of U.S. justice that few other criminologists accept -- a 
nation where gun owners face down violence daily, yet fail to report their 
secret moments of heroism to police or the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops don't hear about most defensive gun uses," Kleck said. "People who 
actually fire their guns have good reasons not to report it to police. They may 
not have a license, or they may just not want to take the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Kleck's conclusions have come under fire repeatedly from experts, most 
recently from Duke University criminologist Phillip Cook, who says data from 
the federal crime survey shows no more than 80,000 gun defenses each year. The 
survey reports that victims wield guns defensively in 1.2% of robberies and 
1.4% of assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most guns bought for self-defense will never get used in that capacity," said 
Josh Sugarman, director of the Violence Policy Center, an anti-gun research 
group, referring to a 1986 Seattle medical study that found guns are 43% more 
likely to cause an accidental death or suicide than to be used to kill an 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook is most skeptical of Kleck's inclusion of large numbers of cases where 
guns were reportedly brandished in self-defense but not fired. Kleck argues 
that "these are legitimate defenses. Whether you fire or not, the fact that you 
are able to prevent a crime with a gun is something that a lot of gun-control 
people just can't seem to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Cook, they are nebulous encounters, often distorted by the 
gun-wielder's fears. "It might be a robbery in the making. Or it might be 
something completely innocent," he said. "People often assume the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is precisely this sort of vague fear that motivated Caesar Marmolejos, 
29, to join five other men at the Tamiami gun shop in south Miami one night to 
take a firearms course required by the state to obtain a carrying permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of sitting at stop lights and looking at my side mirror, then my 
rear-view, then back again, to make sure I'm not going to get carjacked," said 
Marmolejos, an insurance clerk. "Every time some guy walks up to me, I get 
ready to gun the engine." 
</P>
<P>
 The instructor, Ray Ribas, 54, a bearded former Army weapons trainer, paced in 
front of a rack of rifles, giving his students blunt advice on how far to stand 
from a human target, the best places to hide a gun in a car, the most 
appropriate handgun to use in street confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember," he warned, "you can kill anybody with any caliber. Even a .22 is a 
good assassin's gun. Two to the head will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Oliva's days are too hectic to familiarize himself with the .38-caliber 
pistol he carries as he oversees the butcher shop and bodega he owns in Miami's 
crime-ravaged Overtown neighborhood. He says he has considered applying for a 
carrying permit, but he forgets as each workday passes. There is never any time 
for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Oliva is as battle-tested as any police officer. Twice, the 63-year-old 
Cuban emigre has wounded armed robbers inside his bodega, the Economeat Market, 
firing with the gun he hides inside the pocket of his blood-stained smock. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time, a year ago, two armed men tried to rob him as he was closing 
up. When one turned away, Oliva slipped the gun out of his pocket and shot him 
three times in the back. The other assailant fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, as Oliva walked to his car just after closing up, a gunman 
ordered him back inside. The gunman forced Oliva into a back office, patted him 
down for weapons, but somehow missed the pistol. When the intruder moved toward 
the cash register at the front of the store, Oliva made his own move, wounding 
him in the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am lucky two times," Oliva said. "But the third time?" 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he tenses when neighborhood teen-agers crowd into the store, 
pawing boxes of grits and rat poison, venting obscenities and pestering 
countermen for the prices on clearly-marked merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," Oliva said. "All the time. I don't want to shoot nobody. But I 
don't want them to shoot me, no?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida gun-carrying law was passed over the objection of those who raised 
the specter of urban anarchy. Traffic arguments would erupt into shootouts, 
they predicted. Street-corner brawls, they said, would end in fusillades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told people that once this law was passed, there would be trouble. And the 
killings that have gone on in our highways and streets are testimony to this," 
said Joe Shutt, a southern Florida gun-control leader. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Dade County is jolted regularly by fatal traffic shootings. Just 
last month, Miami resident Rudolph Cooper, 33, was gunned down after arguing 
with three men after a collision in Overtown -- less than a block from Oliva's 
bodega. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet state officials report that only 17 concealed-weapons permits have been 
revoked since 1987 because of firearms crimes -- out of 114,000 valid licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, applications to carry guns surged across Florida in the wake of 
the high-profile slayings of several European tourists. In the last 10 months 
of the fiscal year, more than 44,000 residents received permits -- 10,000 more 
than in any year since 1987, said Susan Harrel, a Florida Department of 
Licensing official. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the public's renewed obsession with crime seemed to give new 
momentum to the gun-carrying movement across the nation. Proposals for 
liberalized permits were debated in legislatures in six states -- Wyoming, 
Colorado, Missouri, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Texas -- and passed in one -- 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past eight years, eight other states -- Idaho, Georgia, Maine, North 
Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Oregon and Washington -- have enacted gun 
permit systems similar to Florida's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly an issue whose time is ripe," said James Milner, a National 
Rifle Assn. lobbyist who worked for concealed-weapons laws in several states 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, a gun-permit measure introduced by Rep. Ron Wilson, a liberal 
Democrat from Houston, gained enough bipartisan support to pass. But the 
measure never came to a final vote because of opposition from Richards, who 
scoffed that she had yet to see a purse that had enough room for a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards vetoed a proposal for a referendum on the issue, citing Texas' 
falling crime rate, opposition from police agencies and her own concern that 
"economic development would be jeopardized by the perception that Texans would 
be carrying six-shooters in real life," said Sam Russell, her legislative 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want to follow Florida's lead," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, Brian Geenty sympathizes with that worry. Despite the constant tug 
of the snub-nosed revolver he hides in a black leather belt pouch, the 
55-year-old landlord says he wishes that Florida had never legalized the 
carrying of concealed weapons -- and that there was no reason to carry a gun at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, the streets Geenty drives in his Mercury Grand Marquis 
would be swept clean of guns. No longer would he worry about the drug addicts 
who show up at his house seeking rooms. No longer would he have to nervously 
eye the hustlers who congregate near the Biscayne Boulevard Shell station where 
he buys gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miami is not a perfect place, and even for someone of Geenty's measured 
sensibilities, it can lead to the assumption that there is only one choice. One 
recent morning, Geenty set out, as he always does, with everything he needed 
for his day -- a briefcase filled with papers, a daily calendar, a loaded gun. 
</P>
<P>
 When the day is done, he keeps the pistol lying nearby. Always within reach, 
it has become his dreaded steel shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I want to carry it. I would rather society never allowed me to 
have the choice," Geenty said. "But if it comes down to my life or someone 
else's, unfortunately, I want it with me."

AMES GETS LIFE; ADMITS BETRAYING DOUBLE AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former CIA agent Aldrich H. Ames calmly admitted Thursday that he gave the KGB 
the names of Soviet officials cooperating with American intelligence -- many of 
whom were later executed -- as well as the details of super-secret U.S. 
surveillance of the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 For his crimes, Ames was sentenced by a federal judge to life in prison 
without possibility of parole, the harshest punishment possible under current 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement striking for its lack of remorse, Ames dismissed the idea that 
his actions caused any significant harm to his country, saying "there is no 
rational need" for most CIA operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had come to believe that the espionage business as carried out by the CIA 
and a few other American agencies was and is a self-serving sham," he told U.S. 
District Judge Claude M. Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information our vast intelligence network acquires at considerable human 
and ethical costs is generally insignificant or irrelevant to our 
policy-makers' needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, 52, who rose to chief of Soviet counterintelligence in the CIA's 
Soviet-East European division during 31 years with the agency, pleaded guilty 
to conspiracy to commit espionage as part of a negotiated agreement in return 
for a recommendation of leniency for his wife, Rosario. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Ames, 41, whose role was described by the government as considerably 
smaller than her husband's, also pleaded guilty Thursday, but to lesser charges 
of "aiding, advising and encouraging" her husband's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ameses, arrested Feb. 21 at their suburban Virginia home, also pleaded 
guilty to conspiring to evade federal income taxes for concealing an estimated 
$2.5 million in cash payments from the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Ames agreed to cooperate in exchange for a lighter 
sentence for his wife, who has experienced emotional problems since her 
jailing. Ames also believed their 5-year-old son, Paul, needs the care of his 
mother, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Ames will be sentenced Aug. 26 to a term of 63 to 72 months but she will 
receive credit for time served since their arrest, provided her husband 
cooperates with authorities. The four-month delay in her sentencing will allow 
prosecutors to assess Ames' cooperation in disclosing whether any colleagues at 
the CIA assisted him, either knowingly or unknowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea agreement, both of the Ameses must forfeit all of their 
remaining assets, including their $540,000 suburban home, Jaguar and Honda 
cars, Ames' pension for 31 years in the CIA, all domestic bank accounts and all 
foreign accounts and profits from any book they might write. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference following the pleas, U.S. Atty. Helen F. Fahey said that 
this was "the most damaging spy case in the history of this country." She said 
that U.S. intelligence officials now will begin "an extensive debriefing" of 
Ames to learn even more about the damage to CIA operations caused by his 
espionage and whether anyone else helped him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames has not previously cooperated with federal investigators because he was 
maintaining silence on the advice of his attorney, Plato Cacheris. 
</P>
<P>
 Espionage was a capital offense until ruled out in a series of Supreme Court 
decisions. The Senate-passed crime bill restores capital punishment for 
espionage, but even if the House agrees to the Senate language, Ames would not 
be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 A "statement of facts" filed by the government Thursday disclosed that Ames 
had caused greater damage to U.S. security than previously had been revealed. 
Ames' actions ranged from naming to the Soviets at least 11 military and 
intelligence officials in their country who spied for the CIA or other friendly 
intelligence services, to turning over "a substantial amount of top-secret 
information, including signals intelligence," a reference to the interception 
of Russian communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Those communications could range from military units in the field to more 
sophisticated links between embassies and satellite transmissions. Knowledge of 
the security breach would enable the Russians to feed disinformation, develop 
more secure methods of communication and determine which secrets had been 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ames' compromise of these penetrations of the Soviet military and 
intelligence services deprived the United States of extremely valuable 
intelligence material for years to come," prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four of the U.S. spies were arrested and executed after Ames revealed 
their identities, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames maintained that he was "never personally advised by the KGB or anyone 
else as to the disposition and fate of the sources he compromised," the 
statement of facts noted. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began spying for the KGB in the spring of 1985, Ames' CIA position 
"guaranteed him access to most information relating to penetrations of the 
Soviet military and intelligence services and intelligence operations against 
the Soviet Union," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 While stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Rome from 1986 to 1989, Ames told the 
KGB about CIA activities against the Soviet Union, including a large number of 
double-agent operations and of U.S. knowledge of double-agents working for the 
Soviets, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he returned to CIA headquarters in 1989, Ames provided the KGB with 
classified information both related and unrelated to his specific CIA 
assignments. The statement did not disclose how Ames obtained the unrelated 
material, which would be denied to him under normal CIA practices of 
"compartmentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in khaki prison garb and speaking in a low monotone, Ames said in the 
jammed courtroom that in April, 1985, "I conceived a kind of confidence game to 
play on the KGB" to obtain funds to pay personal debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In exchange for $50,000 I provided the KGB with the identities of several 
Soviet citizens who appeared to be cooperating with the CIA inside the Soviet 
Union," he said. "I suspected that their cooperation was not genuine, that 
their true loyalty was to the KGB, and therefore I could cause them no harm." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ames said that a few months later, "I did something still not entirely 
explicable even to me -- without preconditions or any demand for payment, I 
volunteered to the KGB information identifying virtually all Soviet agents of 
the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that "to my enduring surprise," the Soviets replied that they were 
paying $2 million "in gratitude for the information." 
</P>
<P>
 While expressing "deepest sympathy" for the victims of his actions, Ames 
suggested that their fate was an expected risk of the intelligence business. 
"We made similar choices and suffer similar consequences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames showed emotion only in defending his Colombian-born wife, who he insisted 
"had no knowledge of what information I furnished" to the Soviet Union and 
later the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames said he concealed his spying from his wife until the last 1 1/2 years of 
his activities. She pleaded with him to break off with the Russians but he 
manipulated and blackmailed her to avoid doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames contended that she had no knowledge of information he was furnishing to 
the Russians and, while she "knew that I had received a great deal of money, 
she had no way to associate such sums with the gravity of the information I was 
passing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the government's "statement of facts" on Mrs. Ames, prosecutors said she 
provided "advice and support" for his espionage once she learned of it. "The 
defendant did not, however, personally handle or transmit any classified 
information or documents to the Russians, nor did she meet her husband's 
Russian handlers," it noted. Code Names of 11 Compromised Agents 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven Russians, by their U.S. code names, whose spying for the United States 
was compromised by Aldrich H. Ames, according to the government: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cowl. A Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Moscow who disclosed that 
the KGB used an invisible substance known as "spy dust" to track U.S. 
officials. President Ronald Reagan at one point confronted Moscow with this 
information. Cowl was executed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickle. Described as the chief KGB officer in the United Kingdom whose 
cooperation with British intelligence was disclosed to the KGB by Ames. Fate 
unstated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accord. A Soviet GRU, or military intelligence, officer who gave classified 
information to the CIA. Executed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fitness. A KGB officer who cooperated with the CIA. Executed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Million. A lieutenant colonel in the Soviet military intelligence service 
who cooperated with the CIA. Executed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pyrrhic. Described only as a Soviet official who had cooperated with the 
CIA. Fate unstated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Motorboat. An Eastern European security officer who had cooperated with the 
CIA. Fate unstated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prologue. The government in its original affidavit in support of Ames' 
arrest in February said Prologue was an officer of the Second Chief 
Directorate, the arm of the KGB responsible for counterintelligence 
investigations in the Soviet Union. It said the officer was secretly working 
for the CIA. Fate unstated. 
</P>
<P>
 No information was provided on three others, code names Weigh, Gentile and 
Blizzard.

PROBLEMS FORCE EXTENSION OF S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT and BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Massive distribution problems, ballot shortages, long lines of voters and 
allegations of sabotage in South Africa's first democratic elections forced 
officials Thursday to extend voting for an extra day today in the Zulu 
heartland and five other rural regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, approved by President Frederik W. de Klerk and other political 
leaders, came amid reports of wide problems, though no serious violence, at 
hundreds of the nearly 10,000 polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of South Africans turned up to cast ballots Thursday, which was to be 
the final day of national voting. But election officials said ballot papers did 
not arrive at numerous polling sites in six regions, especially in remote 
villages, until late Thursday afternoon, just hours before they were due to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have strong evidence of substantial inadequacy in the voting" in those 
regions, said Johann Kriegler, head of the country's Independent Electoral 
Commission. He placed most of the blame on the commission itself, which had 
been unable to get enough ballots to some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of (our) difficulties in provisioning these areas, the voters there 
have not had a fair and free opportunity to express their views," Kriegler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension was welcomed by most political parties, including the African 
National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. It reflected the determination 
of political leaders and the electoral commission to forestall challenges to 
the elections and remove doubts about whether the polling was free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must be able to say that all South Africans who wish to vote, and were 
prepared to take the trouble to vote, were given the opportunity," said De 
Klerk, who issued the formal decree extending voting. "If we don't achieve 
that, then the election result will, right from the beginning, be in total 
jeopardy. And it would be the beginning of conflict and strife." 
</P>
<P>
 He said many South Africans "feel somewhat disillusioned because of 
irregularities that have occurred here and there." But he urged them to accept 
the extension. "We've got to make this election work," he said. "If we don't 
get a 100% perfect election, let us strive to achieve 95% and let us live with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Election Commission, which must eventually decide whether the 
elections have been free and fair, said it was satisfied that South Africans 
who wanted to vote were able to cast ballots by the time polls closed Thursday 
in most parts of the country. Many polls, which experienced shortages of 
ballots or greater-than-expected numbers of voters, stayed open well past the 7 
p.m. closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the voting had been seriously disrupted by shortages of voting materials 
in remote regions of six former black homelands. As a result, the polls will 
reopen today at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. in the eastern region of KwaZulu, in 
Natal province; in Transkei and Ciskei in the southeast, and in the region 
encompassing Lebowa, Gazankulu and Venda in the northern Transvaal. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials declined to say how many of the 21.7 million potential 
voters, about 18 million of whom are black, had voted when polls closed 
officially Thursday night. About 2 million potential voters live in the areas 
where polls will reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension of voting will mean a delay in the vote count, which is 
scheduled to begin Saturday and continue around-the-clock until a final result 
is available, probably on Sunday. At De Klerk's insistence, the votes cast 
today will be counted separately, in case of later questions about the polling. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the extra day will not protect the election results from challenges, 
officials acknowledged. The election commission said it had received hundreds 
of complaints of voting irregularities from every political party. Some related 
to late arrival of ballots; others concerned everything from allegations of 
biased conduct by election officers to missing ballot boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC President Nelson Mandela complained Thursday of "massive sabotage" at 
polling stations. Although his aides said the president had spoken out of 
frustration, Jay Naidoo, an ANC official, said the party had lodged numerous 
complaints with the election commission. Among other things, the ANC contends 
that in some areas of KwaZulu, police and other officials from Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi's outgoing homeland administration were intimidating voters. 
Naidoo also claimed Inkatha supporters had created "pirate polling stations." 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha's national political director, Ziba Jiyane, denied the charge and 
countered that the ANC was "panicking because Inkatha is about to deliver a 
resounding victory." Inkatha had complaints too, most of which centered on 
hundreds of polling stations where votes were cast on ballots that did not 
carry the party's name. Inkatha agreed to join the elections just a week ago; 
election officials had promised to add an Inkatha sticker to the bottom of each 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The electoral commission urged election officers to allow voters to write in 
Inkatha, and it said a decision would be made later on whether to accept such 
ballots. More than 9 million new ballots with Inkatha's name were printed 
overnight Wednesday and distributed by planes and helicopters across the 
country early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials said all complaints will be investigated, and the electoral 
commission asked the South African police to investigate the commission's own 
distribution procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulties, many South Africans were heartened by the 
tranquillity that prevailed as they went to the polls for a final day, and a 
new, upbeat mood was evident across the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of people have participated in this historic event in a 
remarkably disciplined and calm way," the ANC's Naidoo said. "The people, both 
black and white, are now united in their desire to build a new South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk said he was surprised to see "an atmosphere so much different from 
the atmosphere only a week before. It's almost as if the election has breathed 
an air of reconciliation. And that is what the country needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb blasts of earlier in the week, allegedly the work of right-wing 
whites bent on disrupting the elections, were largely forgotten with the arrest 
of 31 whites linked to the armed wing of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 That group's leader, Eugene Terreblanche, used the time-honored theme of swart 
gevaar , or black danger, to exhort followers Thursday to prepare for battle 
against the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 "From next week, we are not resisting the white National Party," he said. "We 
are preparing ourselves to resist the radical black Communists, who we know 
will try to drive us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Terreblanche's warnings, most South Africans were more confident than 
ever before that their elections had been a success. 
</P>
<P>
 The long waits of Wednesday, when millions turned out the vote and many were 
turned away, were gone in many areas on Thursday. A radio station was sending 
out regular "voter traffic reports" from its traffic helicopter, advising where 
the lines were shortest. 
</P>
<P>
 On the East Rand, a volatile region of black townships southeast of 
Johannesburg, dozens of polls that had been closed on Wednesday for lack of 
ballots and voting materials were open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thokoza, where hundreds of blacks have died in fighting between ANC and 
Inkatha supporters, the streets were quiet. Bongi Msimang, the presiding 
officer at a voting station there, had to fight back angry crowds Wednesday, 
when ballots failed to arrive. But on Thursday she was awakened at 4 a.m. by a 
delivery of newly printed ballots. And, by midday, more than 1,500 people had 
voted there and a long line had dwindled to a few dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much better today," Msimang said. "I am confident everyone will get the 
chance to vote here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernos Khumalo, a 50-year-old factory worker, had waited all day Wednesday to 
vote, only to be told the ballots had not arrived. But, like tens of thousands 
of South Africans, he was back Thursday and able to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, I was so upset," Khumalo said. But, he added with a smile, "today 
it is marvelous. We're all voting now."

AUDITS URGED TO FIND MEXICAN PUPILS ILLEGALLY IN U.S. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A bipartisan group of lawmakers from San Diego on Thursday urged Controller 
Gray Davis to conduct an audit to determine how many children who live in 
Mexico might be crossing the border to attend school in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, in an audit completed late last year, found widespread irregularities 
in the attendance procedures of one border school district, but then declined 
to review attendance records at seven other border-area districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have critized Davis, a Democrat running for lieutenant governor, 
for failing to follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 12 legislators who represent parts of San Diego County -- six Republicans, 
five Democrats and an independent -- have signed a letter urging Davis to go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The affected school districts have had every opportunity to be aware of their 
responsibility to establish proper procedures for verifying residency," the 
lawmakers wrote. "The taxpayers have every right to be assured that their money 
is being properly spent." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is separate from the controversy over illegal immigrants attending 
school in California. Those immigrants, whether they have legal status or not, 
are entitled to public education under a U.S. Supreme Court decision because 
they are residents of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The students at issue in this case live in Mexico and cross the border every 
morning to go to school, then return home at night. Many may be U.S. citizens 
whose parents moved south of the border because they could not find affordable 
housing in the United States. Whether or not they are citizens, however, they 
are not entitled to an education unless they reside in the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although long whispered about in education circles along the border, the 
practice was exposed last fall by Republican Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith of 
Poway, who released a videotape showing a Mountain Empire School District bus 
picking up students at the border for trips to school. 
</P>
<P>
 A controller's audit of that district found that hundreds of students were 
enrolled without providing proper documentation that they were residents of the 
district. In one case, several students listed a vacant lot as their home. 
Others used post office box numbers, which state regulations say are 
unacceptable proof of residency. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Davis sent letters notifying seven more districts that they would 
be subject to similar audits. But the audits were never done. Now Davis says 
the letters were sent by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said in an interview that his office could not afford the $500,000 the 
additional audits would cost. He said he is obligated to conduct audits for the 
federal government and to complete other audits that could result in savings of 
$30 million for the state Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he hopes to do one or two additional border school district audits 
in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, to confirm the findings from the 
Mountain Empire district. If the Legislature gives him the money he needs to do 
all the audits, he said, "We'll do them in a heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Smith, a lawyer for California Rural Legal Assistance, said her group 
interviewed the families involved in the Mountain Empire controversy and found 
that 90% of the children who were crossing the border said they were U.S. 
citizens. She said the controller's audit was flawed and led to the harassment 
of some Latino students who were eligible to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very worrisome," she said.

MEXICAN JUDGE ISSUES RULING IN U.S. KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In a case that elevated tensions in U.S.-Mexico relations, a Mexican judge has 
sentenced a former California ranch hand to a 31-year prison term after finding 
him guilty of abducting and sexually assaulting a Riverside County girl, 
Mexican authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Serapio Zuniga Rios, 28, a Mexican national, was sentenced Wednesday after he 
was convicted of sexual assault, abduction and burglary in the kidnaping of the 
4-year-old girl from a ranch near Temecula in September, 1992, the Mexican 
attorney general's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials decided Zuniga's fate on Tuesday after rejecting a request 
from Washington that he be extradited to the United States -- a request backed 
by several U.S. congressional representatives who took a strong interest in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter became an international cause celebre involving high-level 
officials in both nations at a time when Washington and Mexico City were 
renegotiating both a new extradition treaty and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. lawmaker, Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), said he swung his vote to 
support NAFTA in November only after Mexico's then-attorney general personally 
assured him that the suspect would be extradited. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has never extradited one of its citizens to the United States for 
trial, and word that the suspect might be sent north in exchange for free-trade 
votes rankled sensitive nationalist sentiments south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, many maintained that Zuniga should be tried under Mexican law, 
which allows the prosecution of its citizens for crimes committed abroad based 
on affidavits and other evidence submitted to Mexican authorities. U.S. 
officials sent a thick dossier of evidence accompanying their extradition 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican attorney general's office said Thursday that a judge rejected the 
extradition request earlier this month. But Mexican officials acknowledged 
privately that the decision in such a sensitive case probably was made at a 
much higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Krovisky, a Justice Department official, declined comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 After assaulting the girl, whom he abducted while she was sleeping, Zuniga 
wrapped her in a blanket and hanged the bundle from a tree, police said. Zuniga 
was allegedly enraged because he had been fired from a job at the ranch, which 
is owned by the girl's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 He later fled to Mexico, where he was arrested last December after an 
extensive manhunt, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl has physically healed from the assault but is still recovering 
psychologically, relatives say.

BROWN PAYS STATE $1,469 FOR TRAVEL; POLITICS: SOME OF THE TREASURER'S TRIPS TO 
HER VACATION HOME IN IDAHO WERE MADE PARTLY AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE. SHE HAS ALSO 
REIMBURSED THE GOVERNMENT FOR OTHER COSTS. 
</P>

<P>
 During her first year in office, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown traveled 
several times to her Idaho vacation home partly at taxpayers' expense, state 
records show. She reimbursed the state for those trips and other personal 
expenses in February, on the same day she announced her candidacy for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the Brown campaign said that the inappropriate charges 
came to light when Brown, like many candidates, asked her state employees and 
campaign staff to examine all of her expenditures to protect her from 
embarrassment during the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of Brown's travel claims by The Times shows that she and her staff 
may have overlooked three other trips with stopovers in Salt Lake City and 
Chicago, which appear to have involved personal business and which she has not 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said any personal charges to the state were inadvertent but declined to 
discuss any details of her travel. Campaign aides said the treasurer made the 
stopovers in Idaho and elsewhere while on otherwise legitimate trips required 
of her as an officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that in most cases there was little or no added cost to taxpayers 
and that Brown repaid $1,469 -- much more than she had to, including the entire 
air fare or automobile expense, to remove any question about her conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionable travel payments were discovered in an audit conducted by the 
treasurer's office last year, said Brown campaign press secretary John 
Whitehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any case where there was any extra cost, she reimbursed the whole thing," 
Whitehurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the treasurer has renounced many of the traditional perks 
of statewide office -- accepting a 5% salary cut, refusing the services of a 
state-paid driver and renouncing a $10,000-a-year officeholder account that she 
once used for catered meals and office receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really doing more than A, is the law, and B, is the standard, and C, 
than anybody up there (in Sacramento)," Whitehurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's reimbursement for the travel expenses was included in a Feb. 8 
personal check for $2,990 to the state treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total returned, $1,355 covered daily allowances for in-state travel -- 
the "per diems" she is entitled to collect while traveling on state business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Brown reimbursed the state $129 for a 1991 San Francisco hotel 
stay. Campaign aides said the treasurer repaid the money because a business 
meeting the next day was canceled. Also returned: $10 for a carwash, $10 for 
gasoline and $17 for a "limousine" ride in New York City, which aide Mike Rice 
said was actually a cab fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of these expenditures, Rice said, was "a symbol of someone who is 
concerned that the state money gets spent appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Brown's personal check to the state, her campaign has written a 
series of checks to the state treasury totaling $7,310. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 1992 checks totaling $3,978 were to reimburse the state for earlier 
charges made to Brown's officeholder account. Another check for $332 reimbursed 
the state for the costs of a reception initially paid for by the treasurer's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst said that although all the payments were proper and similar to 
those charged by other state officeholders -- the treasurer had simply decided 
to do "more that she was required to do. . . . She is setting a standard of 
excellence in terms of ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Brown campaign has deposited $1,000 a year -- a total of 
$3,000 -- to cover "miscellaneous non-state charges that inadvertently may be 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the added cost of stopovers while traveling on state business that 
could prove embarrassing to Brown, partly because she waited almost three years 
to reimburse the questionable expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Brown's trips: 
</P>
<P>
 * A February, 1991, stop in Sun Valley, Idaho -- where she and her husband own 
a vacation home -- while on her way to a Western State Treasurers' Assn. 
conference in Park City, Utah. She claimed no travel expenses while in Idaho. 
In February, she reimbursed the state $337.50 for the cost of her plane ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 * A May, 1991, car trip from Sun Valley to Montana for a conference on 
pensions, where she was scheduled to speak on a panel that was subsequently 
canceled. She paid her own transportation costs but reimbursed the state $270 
in living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * In early August, 1991, she flew to Boise, Idaho, from San Francisco after a 
speaking engagement in Monterey. She reimbursed the state for her $216 plane 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 * In late August, 1991, she traveled to New Hampshire for a National Assn. of 
State Treasurers conference. Instead of flying back directly to Los Angeles, 
she flew to Salt Lake City, the hub that serves Sun Valley, for Labor Day 
weekend. Brown reimbursed the state the $646 cost of her plane ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel expense claims provided to The Times under the state Public Records Act 
raise questions about three other trips as well. In each case, interruptions in 
cross-country travel appear to have added to the cost of her air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1991, Brown stopped in Salt Lake City on personal business while 
flying back from a Washington meeting of the Council on Institutional 
Investors. The total air fare for the trip was $628. 
</P>
<P>
 In March and April of 1992, Brown interrupted two cross-country trips to stop 
in Chicago, where her daughter was expecting a baby. Total air fare for the two 
trips was $1,609 -- paid by the treasurer's office and the State Teachers' 
Retirement System. That's almost $500 more than Assistant Treasurer Beverly 
Thomas paid for her round-trip tickets to the same two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign spokesman Whitehurst said that the layovers in Chicago "did not 
cost anything to the state." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that if the three stopovers did add to the state or pension fund's 
cost and were inadvertently overlooked in the treasurer's office audit of 
expenses, the added amounts would have been covered by the campaign committee's 
annual $1,000 payment to the state account. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Political Reform Act generally bars the personal use of campaign 
funds -- limiting spending to costs "directly related to a political, 
legislative or governmental purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The records also show that on the personal segments on all these trips, Brown 
did not bill the state for hotels, meals or other living expenses while in Sun 
Valley.

NEWS ANALYSIS; EXPERTS SAY SUIT OVER IMMIGRANT COSTS WILL FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's lawsuit seeking federal reimbursement for the cost of 
imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of felonies in California has little 
chance of succeeding in court, according to legal experts interviewed by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's complaint, to be filed today in U.S. District Court in San Diego, 
will quickly run into what amounts to a legal brick wall: a doctrine that says 
the federal government cannot be sued for damages unless it first consents to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the state could find a way past that obstacle, which would require 
congressional approval, the suit's central argument -- that the federal 
government is violating the state's sovereignty -- relies on a theory that the 
U.S. Supreme Court has viewed with considerable skepticism for at least half a 
century, constitutional scholars said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lawsuit really has no chance of success," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC 
constitutional law professor. "It's purely being done for political reasons. 
It's using the legal system to make a political statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides dispute that charge. Although acknowledging that the suit is 
breaking new legal ground, they contend that the complaint has considerable 
merit. The state, they say, should not abandon its case simply because it might 
have difficulty winning it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be easy," said Janice Brown, Wilson's top legal adviser. 
"But I don't concede it's not worth trying. There are some very real legal 
questions here that need to be addressed. We are not filing a lawsuit that we 
believe to be utterly frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's lawsuit seeks $377 million from the federal government to cover 
the costs of incarcerating nearly 17,000 illegal immigrants who have been 
convicted of felonies, enough inmates to fill eight prisons. The state also 
wants $1.6 billion as reimbursement for the cost of building those eight extra 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also asks the court to require the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to begin deportation proceedings against all illegal 
immigrant felons and, in the case of Mexicans, to force the INS to deport 
felons who have completed their sentences to a place deep within their home 
country, rather than at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is the first of three Wilson intends to file against the federal 
government. The other two will seek reimbursement for the cost of educating 
illegal immigrants in public schools, which the governor estimates at $1.7 
billion annually, and for providing emergency health care, which he says costs 
California $400 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several legal experts interviewed by The Times questioned whether the state 
could even get a hearing on its lawsuit. They said it seems to run counter to 
the so-called sovereign immunity of the federal government, which bars claims 
seeking monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
 That protection has been waived by Congress in limited areas, such as claims 
based on the negligence of a federal employee. A person run over by a postal 
truck, for example, could file suit and collect damages. But no such waiver 
exists for California to exploit in this instance, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've yet to hear anyone explain why this lawsuit isn't flat-out barred," 
Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Wilson's legal adviser, said the suit does not address the immunity 
issue. If federal lawyers raise it as a defense, she said, the state will 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't confront it," Brown said. "We have assumed that what we're doing can 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
 If the state is able to establish its right to sue, the real legal wrangling 
will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The California lawsuit, like one filed earlier by Florida and suits 
contemplated by several other states, seeks to reinvigorate the concept of 
federalism -- the idea that the 50 states are independent entities joined by 
mutual consent to a federal government whose powers are strictly limited. 
</P>
<P>
 In this vein, the suit argues, fixing federal immigration policy "is essential 
to the survival of California." 
</P>
<P>
 It adds: "At issue is whether the state of California will remain a sovereign 
government with the flexibility to establish policies and priorities responsive 
to the will of its electorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing the federal government to force the states to implement policies 
using state-generated tax funds, the complaint says, turns the U.S. 
Constitution into a "suicide pact." 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution's 10th Amendment assures state sovereignty, and until the 
mid-1930s it was commonly used to protect states from the intrusion of the 
federal government into their affairs. But beginning with challenges to 
President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal social programs, the high court started 
rejecting 10th Amendment claims and has been doing so ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1937, the court has ruled for the states in only two cases, and one was 
later overturned. In the one that still stands, a 1992 ruling in a case brought 
by New York, the court struck down a federal law requiring the states to build 
nuclear waste dumps or else take possession of waste generated by private 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scholars expect a similar challenge to the recently passed Brady Bill, 
which requires the states to impose waiting periods on the purchase of handguns 
and conduct background checks on the potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In both these instances, the federal requirement on the states is explicit. 
California, in contrast, is arguing that the federal government, by its 
inaction on immigration, is forcing the state to spend money it would rather 
use for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other cases, where states have asked the court to stop the federal 
government from doing something, California wants the court to require action 
on the part of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Constitution is a set of limits on the government," said Julian Eule, a 
UCLA law professor. "When you seek to force the government to do something, you 
are treading on some fairly thin ice. I don't see how you can come along and 
force the government to dole out this money." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Merritt, a University of Illinois law professor, said California's 
claim would be a "dramatic leap ahead, a shift in what the court has done so 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government, she said, probably could open its borders to everyone 
and not be liable for the added state costs. By extension, it is not likely to 
be held responsible for failing to stop those immigrants it says it would like 
to keep out. 
</P>
<P>
 An advocate of states' rights, Merritt wrote a paper cited by the court in the 
1992 New York decision. In her paper, Merritt argued that the states are 
guaranteed a Republican form of government, "where the (state) government is 
responsive to its people, not some outside (federal) government." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Merritt said she doubted that kind of case could be made by 
California, Brown said that is precisely the line of reasoning California will 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to say that the process can fail even when it seems to be 
working," said Brown. "If the decisions you make don't impose the costs 
directly on the people who elect you, then you are not politically 
accountable."

WHITE HOUSE GIVES DALAI LAMA THE RUSHDIE TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama visited the White House on Thursday and got the Salman Rushdie 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting carefully arranged to minimize offense to China, the peripatetic 
Tibetan leader was permitted 15 minutes with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was labeled "unofficial" and took place not in the Oval Office but 
down the hall in the West Wing suite of Vice President Al Gore. Clinton had 
displayed similar caution last November when he met with Rushdie, a British 
author condemned to death by Iran, which accuses him of blaspheming Islam in 
his writings. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House news release Thursday night avoided even saying directly that 
Clinton had met with the Dalai Lama. Instead, it said the Dalai Lama had met 
with Gore and the President "joined the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama's low-key, late-afternoon White House reception followed formal 
protests of the meeting by the Chinese government, which branded the Dalai Lama 
"a political exile who has for a long time engaged in activities aimed at 
splitting the motherland." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not official, in the sense that he (the Dalai Lama) is not a government 
leader," explained one senior Clinton Administration official Thursday. "This 
is a President paying his respects to a notable religious leader." 
</P>
<P>
 He volunteered the decades-old United States position that Tibet is part of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the White House skittishness, the International Campaign for Tibet, an 
advocacy group, praised Clinton's decision to meet with the Dalai Lama as "an 
important indication of the Administration's continued support for Tibet and 
for negotiations between the Dalai Lama and Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore had also met separately with the Tibetan leader. Tibetan officials hope 
the meeting will pave the way for leaders of other countries to meet with the 
Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first face-to-face session the Dalai Lama has ever had with a 
U.S. President; he had a comparable "drop-by" meeting with Clinton in Gore's 
office one year ago and met privately with President Bush in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But the session took on added importance because the Clinton Administration 
must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's U.S. trade benefits. One marker 
the President set down for making that decision is whether Beijing has made 
progress in preserving Tibet's religious heritage, of which the Dalai Lama is 
the leading symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 China's Communist regime moved troops into Tibet in 1950, shortly after it had 
won China's civil war. The Dalai Lama was forced to leave the Tibetan capital 
of Lhasa in 1959, after an unsuccessful Tibetan revolt, and has lived in exile 
since. Officials in Beijing have claimed that China has always had sovereignty 
over Tibet; Tibetans claim that their land was independent before the invasion 
of the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck 
announced that Clinton might meet with the Dalai Lama, China's Foreign Ministry 
expressed "grave concern." 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese spokesman said such a meeting would be "an interference in China's 
internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said Thursday that the Administration never 
thought about canceling the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way you can allow them (Chinese officials) to intimidate you for 
doing something you've done before, and that your predecessor did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement released by the White House on Thursday night said Clinton had 
wanted "to pay his respects to the Dalai Lama, to discuss efforts to initiate a 
dialogue with the Chinese leadership and to inquire about efforts to preserve 
Tibetan religion and culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Tibet has a number of prominent supporters on Capitol Hill, such as Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and California Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Burlingame), 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights.

 The thrilling finale to the Ramona Pageant in Hemet, where the cast of 
horseback cowboys comes thundering down off the cliff for a curtain call, had 
an even more dramatic climax at a recent Sunday performance.

 A 16-year-old cowboy went head over spurs, and in his pain, he said something 
about having had a drink beforehand; passing a bottle among the cowboy cast is 
reportedly an end-of-show tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol expects to arrest someone for providing a minor 
with an alcoholic beverage. "Everything points to the fact all the cowboys knew 
this kid was drinking, including his father and his uncle," says CHP Officer 
Ron Dahlbeck. "But we only have direct testimony that one guy handed him the 
bottle. We sort of feel sorry for the guy taking the fall for the whole bunch 
of them."

 Hot rods: The weather was downright Californian in Washington as Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-California) presided over an outdoor news conference to support 
limiting availability of military-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrayed on the table was a semiautomatic arsenal--an AK-47, a MAC-12, a 
TEC-DC9 and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reporter was asking Feinstein whether there were more weapons she would 
like to see banned, she reached for one of the gats cooking in the sun: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the legislation that we have produced is sufficient. It would do 
the job. It would ban the manufacture . . . Wow, is that hot! . . . the 
manufacture of large capacity ammunition feeding devices and it would ban the 
military-style assault weapon in the United States of America."

 Republicrats for What's-His-Name: When Richard Nixon ran for reelection to 
Congress in 1948, the now-vanished practice of cross-filing allowed Republicans 
to run in the Democratic primary and vice versa--and incumbents' names came 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 In that long-ago primary, Nixon's name appeared on both Democratic and 
Republican ballots (his party was not listed on the Democratic slate, just 
"member of Congress"). Right before the election, Nixon mailed postcards to 
Democratic voters. They began, "Fellow Democrats . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He won both primaries.

 Fire-o-fax: At 3:21 p.m. on April 13--the same day the California Labor 
Federation, AFL-CIO, endorsed Kathleen Brown for governor--Tom Rankin, a 
lobbyist for the labor group, received this fax: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Tom,  
</P>
<P>
 Your appointment to the Workers' Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau 
Governing Committee is terminated, effective immediately. Please feel free to 
call me if you have any questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely,  
</P>
<P>
 John  
</P>
<P>
 That's John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner, who did not get the labor 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "John has a very hot temper and didn't consider things very thoroughly," says 
Rankin, who intended to retire next year from the unpaid seat he has held since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 This all happened , says Garamendi spokesman Darry Sragow, because Labor 
Federation head Jack Henning had assured Garamendi that his group would endorse 
Brown and Garamendi, or no one. When that didn't happen--and they heard Henning 
was actually plumping for Brown, says Sragow--Garamendi let Henning know his 
displeasure by firing Rankin, the man Henning had recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with Rankin," Sragow said. "It has to do with 
Henning." 
</P>
<P>
 Got it? EXIT LINE 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time Nixon's come home under a dark cloud."

RELIGION; AFRICAN BISHOPS SEEK TO MATCH FAITH WITH NEEDS OF CONTINENT; 
PARTICIPANTS AT VATICAN GATHERING SPOTLIGHT TRADITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Summoned to Rome by Pope John Paul II for a special congress, Roman Catholic 
bishops from Africa are seeking to match the demands of their faith with the 
social, political and economic needs of a hungry and often violent continent. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 300 bishops from the 53 nations of Africa attending a monthlong 
synod here, "inculturation" -- melding Catholicism with African traditions -- 
emerged as an overriding concern. "It is the marriage of faith and life," said 
the group's interim document. 
</P>
<P>
 Relentless inter-ethnic violence in Rwanda, the most Christian country in 
Africa, is a tragic counterpoint to the synod's exaltation of a continent where 
Catholicism is growing quickly and the Vatican counts 80 million believers 
among 610 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 A practical advantage of holding the synod in Rome is that it exposes the 
stay-at-home Vatican curia directly to the African church. And such meetings 
provide a valuable chance for participants to compare notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exploration of common problems by bishops who didn't necessarily know one 
another should result in a stronger African church," said Rev. Tom Reese, a 
California Jesuit who is following the synod as a specialist in church 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The secular context for a church transported to Africa in the last century by 
European missionaries emerges with painful clarity as the bishops -- 90% of 
them Africans -- recite a litany of continental needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In almost all our nations, there is abject poverty, tragic mismanagement of 
available resources, political instability and social disorientation," noted 
Cardinal Hyacinthe Thiandoum of Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the blame rests with Europe and North America, which contribute 
material assistance to Africa but are also responsible for "bombs and weapons 
to destroy our people, and to create insoluble debts," observed Mozambique 
Cardinal Alexandre Jose Maria dos Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 The burden of responsibility for African trauma, however, rests heaviest not 
on outsiders but on African political leaders, the bishops warned. Bishop 
Julius Babatunde Adelakun of Nigeria assailed leaders who "are power hungry, 
greedy, corrupt, having enriched themselves at the expense of the people they 
are supposed to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops said that Catholic teaching must be presented "as a message of 
liberation and salvation. Justice and peace is at the heart of the mission in 
Africa. There is a need for a new cultural politics which accepts pluralism, 
diversity and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-point working agenda notes the great religious enthusiasm of Africa but 
also worries about a "shallow faith" among some African Christians -- what one 
bishop called "rosary beads in the morning, witchcraft in the afternoon." 
Bishops have been stunned by missionaries' reports that both catechists and 
regular worshipers in Catholic communities in some cases participated in the 
Rwanda slaughter of minority Tutsi by majority Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops' agenda observes that since the history of the church on their 
continent is short, among Africans there is "a strong feeling of having 
received a faith not yet fully at home in our life and culture." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in everyday practicalities such as liturgy, marriage and reverence for 
ancestors that Catholicism must most directly adapt to African realities, 
bishops say. They encourage a meeting ground with traditional rites 
representing "the reservoir of African religions and cultural values." 
</P>
<P>
 "Christ walks too much among the people in a European garment," said Bishop 
Bonifatius Haushiku of Namibia. One result, said Bishop Francis Mugadzi of 
Zimbabwe, is that Christians lead "double lives, one foot in African tradition, 
another one in the church."

MEDIA; RUSSIAN WOMEN WHO WANT IT ALL GET . . . COSMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A curvaceous Cindy Crawford graces the glossy cover, and the Cyrillic headline 
reads, "Sex or chocolate? A time for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty thousand copies of the first Russian edition of Cosmopolitan magazine 
hit the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg on Thursday. They seem destined to 
be snapped up as fast as Big Macs and Snickers bars in this nation whose 
fashion-conscious young women have long had to rely on such magazines as Woman 
Worker and Woman Peasant for advice on love, sex, children and career. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the thrill of a lifetime," gushed Cosmo creator Helen Gurley Brown, 
71, at a launch party for Moscow glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
 Western advertisers are eager to imprint their images on the emerging Russian 
market before consumers, who are willing to try almost anything new, develop 
strong brand preferences. And publishers aim to snap up consumer dollars by 
creating a market for glossy publications crammed with ads for imported 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Several early publishing ventures fell victim to the lack of a distribution 
system. Last year, the Hearst Corp. and the New York Times folded serious 
newspapers aimed at the Russian market. But Russians' appetite for lighter fare 
shows no signs of abating, and a host of new consumer magazines have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 These include several general-interest publications aimed at the nouveaux 
riches, a magazine devoted to four-wheel-drive vehicles and even Russian 
versions of Penthouse and Soldier of Fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo, the first to target young women, could be a gold mine for its 
co-owners, Hearst Magazines International and Independent Media, publisher of 
the Moscow Times and several new Russian magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Top 10 Western advertising agencies here billed clients more than 
$44 million, according to Advertising Age, though the oldest set foot in Russia 
just five years ago. Cosmo staffers said they sold out the 46 advertising pages 
of the 132-page first edition. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo is intended to cost the ruble equivalent of $2.40. But the street price 
will be set by retailers, who must buy the magazine outright and cannot return 
unsold copies. If vendors gouge, the publishers will force the price down by 
printing more copies. 
</P>
<P>
 If the magazine has a political subtext, it is that young Russian women can 
now join their sisters in 26 other capitalist countries in the quest for the 
perfect body, the perfect man, the perfect wardrobe and the perfectly 
fulfilling career that are the hallmarks of the "Cosmo girl." 
</P>
<P>
 The first edition includes popular standbys -- horoscopes, beauty tips and a 
compatibility quiz for lovers -- written in a breezy style.  
</P>
<P>
 A health article, "Why Am I Always Tired?" was translated from the U.S. 
edition. But most pieces are home-grown, including an interview with Irina 
Khakamada, a member of the new Parliament, a story on bicycling in the Crimea 
and a fashion spread on clothes that can be purchased in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will definitely be a huge success, because there are very few magazines 
for women here," said Tatyana Kovtunova, 25, who owns a 2-year-old modeling 
agency. "Only rich girls" can buy imported copies of Vogue, which can cost up 
to $17 -- and then they must decipher the English, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia still does not have a press of sufficient quality for Cosmo to be 
printed here, a Hearst executive said. The magazine is printed in Holland and 
imported by truck. On Newsstands Now

RUSSIAN LEADERS SIGN 'CIVIC ACCORD' AS RESPITE FROM STRIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arrayed at a gleaming Kremlin table that seemed to be the size of a football 
field, everyone who is anyone in Russia's political and social leadership 
turned out Thursday to sign a "civic accord" meant to give the country a 
two-year break from strife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is weary of torrents of mutual insults from various rostrums, of 
endless clashes in the media," President Boris N. Yeltsin told the gathering. 
"We do not want verbal wars to turn into street clashes and mass unrest." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether the civic accord, on which Yeltsin has focused 
much of his energy in recent weeks, will actually keep any of its signers from 
striking, arguing or fighting in the streets as it is supposed to do. Other 
pieces of paper, like the constitution and the legal code, have not. 
</P>
<P>
 The best that could be said for the agreement signed Thursday was that Yeltsin 
actually managed to gather such an array of leaders -- from ultranationalist 
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky to free-market economist Yegor T. Gaidar -- to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 Holdouts remained, among them the leader of Russia's Communist Party, who 
attended but did not sign, several regional chiefs and leaders of the Agrarian 
and reformist Yabloko factions of Parliament. None of the hard-core opposition 
to Yeltsin, including former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi, attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 200 individuals who did appear included representatives of 
groups such as the Union of Women of the Russian Navy, a union of private 
detectives and two groups of Cossacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who might have been some of the greatest enthusiasts of the 
accord took the grandiose ceremony with some skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar, now leader of the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice party, admitted that "I 
have never had any illusions that one document, however serious it was, could 
solve the serious problems in Russia. However, at least there will be a basis 
for transforming political confrontation from its current uncivilized nature to 
a more civilized one." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, in typical fashion, made a joke of the whole thing. He told 
reporters on his way to the ceremony that he would decide whether to sign based 
on whether Yeltsin smiled at him. Diners at the post-signing banquet quipped 
back that they were treated to Zhirinovsky-brand vodka, with a map on its label 
of Russia expanded to the old borders of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian regional leaders appeared unimpressed with Thursday's pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is arguing against accord? Accord can be achieved only by real deeds," 
said Aman Tuleyevm, a leader of the government of Kemerovo in Western Siberia. 
"Unfortunately, ordinary people downstairs will not feel better because 
(leaders) here signed something on paper and kissed each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris G. Fyodorov, the former Russian finance minister, put it even more 
bluntly: "The more we sign various documents on accord, the more rows we will 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's proceedings began with a moment of silence for a lawmaker killed by 
a shotgun blast earlier this week in an apparently mob-related murder. The 
uproar in Parliament on Wednesday over the death threatened briefly to spoil 
the ceremony for the accord. But lawmakers contented themselves with their 
still-unsatisfied demand for Yeltsin to fire his interior minister for 
allegedly failing to crack down sufficiently on organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin chaired the ceremony and emphasized in his speeches that Russia cannot 
afford violent discord when it is in the midst of sweeping economic and 
political changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want peace in Russia, we want the strengthening of our united democratic 
state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, as he presented it, appeared to be his way of trying to guarantee 
that nothing like the clashes of last October -- which began after he dissolved 
the old Parliament and ended with his ordering the storming of the rebels holed 
up in the Russian White House -- would ever be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it seemed to be drawing the battle lines all over again. Rutskoi, 
released from prison under last month's amnesty, has announced that he hopes to 
lead the opposition to Yeltsin and said he would use the accord to determine 
who his allies are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will see who signs it, who voluntarily puts a muzzle on himself," Rutskoi 
told NTV last Sunday. "And I will try to unite those left without a muzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 The text of the accord, which was still being changed as late as Wednesday 
night, requires those signing to refrain from calling for early federal 
elections or proposing consitutional amendments that could destabilize society. 
They also pledge to keep rallies peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, in turn, promises to lower inflation, improve taxes, pay 
overdue salaries and raise living standards. Unions vow not to organize strikes 
to squeeze more money out of the government. Regions promise to send taxes to 
Moscow more regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 A reconciliation commission is created to oversee how the treaty is carried 
out. Its continued last-minute metamorphosis reflected the great political 
pressures on Yeltsin stemming from Communists who wanted more mention of the 
gap between rich and poor, regional leaders worried about Moscow keeping its 
hands off their local laws, and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty appears to lack any teeth at all, providing for no sanctions 
against those who violate the accord after signing it. It also remains open 
indefinitely for more people to sign.

 Hundreds of Yemeni soldiers were killed or wounded in fierce clashes between 
northern and southern troops at a joint military camp near the capital, 
southern authorities and Western diplomats said.But northern security officials 
put the casualty toll much lower -- at dozens killed and hundreds wounded. 
Fighting has flared over the last two days at a camp about 40 miles north of 
Sana, the capital. The battles in the impoverished Red Sea nation threaten to 
unravel a nearly four-year union of the conservative north and the formerly 
Marxist south. Merging of the two countries' armies -- one of the last steps of 
the unification process -- has not been completed.

 An American teen-ager sentenced to be flogged for vandalism ended his first 
month in jail without word on whether the government will accept or reject his 
plea for mercy.An official who requested anonymity said the case of Michael 
Fay, 18, was discussed at a Cabinet meeting, but no decision had been reached 
on the clemency plea. Fay was charged with spray-painting cars and other acts 
of vandalism in October. He was sentenced to four months in jail, a fine of 
$2,244 and six lashes on the buttocks with a rattan cane. Fay's case has drawn 
international attention, particularly in the United States, where President 
Clinton has called flogging an excessive punishment.

JAPAN'S HATA FORMS MINORITY CABINET 
</P>

<P>
 Bracing himself for what he called "many extremely difficult problems," Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday appointed Japan's first minority Cabinet in 
39 years to run what was widely expected to be a short-lived government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, 58, vowed to resolve economic frictions with the United States by June, 
including fixing an outline for a major revision of Japan's tax system. Part of 
that reform will be needed to meet U.S. requests to extend a single-year income 
tax cut over several years to stimulate Japan's stagnant economy and pull in 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "If economic issues between Japan and the United States aren't handled 
smoothly, frustrations will build up among the two peoples, such as (mutual) 
feelings of dislike that occurred before," Hata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not once during a nationally televised news conference did the usually 
cheerful Hata smile. And when asked about a statement he once made describing 
himself as "an actor" to "scenarios" written by Ichiro Ozawa, his chief 
strategist, he scowled. 
</P>
<P>
 "An actor himself chooses his scripts and sometimes orders them rewritten," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deserted by the Socialists in the middle of the night earlier this week, 
Hata's coalition holds only 37% of the seats in the lower house of Parliament 
and 24% in the upper chamber. But Hata insisted that the Socialists and the 
Liberal Democratic Party agree with many of the coalition's policies and said 
he will appeal to them, bill by bill, for support in reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't given up" on the Socialists returning to the Cabinet, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate news conferences, all of Hata's new ministers said they will work 
to see to it that the Cabinet will not be short-lived. But Megumu Sato, 
National Land Agency director, slipped from the script, saying, "I don't know 
how long I will be serving." 
</P>
<P>
 Most bets were on late June, when Parliament is finally expected to enact the 
long-delayed 1994 budget, or after the July 8-10 summit of the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations in Naples, Italy, which Japan's prime minister is 
obliged to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialists promised to cooperate to pass the budget, which they helped compile 
-- but nothing else. Although parliamentary deliberations on the budget 
normally begin earlier, the process is now scheduled to get under way May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hata Cabinet, including eight ex-LDP members from the prime minister's 
Renewal Party and six from the long-established, Buddhist-backed Clean 
Government Party, "looks like a poor man's LDP government," said Tomiichi 
Murayama, the Socialists' chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister who announced his resignation 20 
days ago, won the nation's top political job last August just after his 
first-ever election to the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata moved Hiroshi Kumagai from head of the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry, where he had acted as a major opponent of U.S. demands for 
"measurable progress" in market-opening, to the position of chief Cabinet 
secretary, in which he will coordinate Cabinet actions and serve as chief 
government spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eijiro Hata traded his job at the Agriculture Ministry for the MITI post. 
Hirohisa Fujii, a tight-fisted budget-balancer, was retained as finance 
minister. And Koji Kakizawa, who defected from the LDP eight days ago, was 
picked as foreign minister. Earlier, he had served as vice foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kumagai and Fujii led the bureaucracy in fruitless, often hostile trade 
negotiations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilizing "Golden Week," a chain of holidays starting today and running 
through May 8, both Hata and Kakizawa immediately announced plans for trips 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata will visit Italy, France, Germany and Belgium on May 2-7; the new foreign 
minister will tour Egypt, Israel, the Israeli-occupied territories, Jordan and 
Syria on May 2-8.

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.N.'S AKASHI FINDING TIMIDITY, WAR DON'T MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The diminutive, bespectacled bureaucrat who heads the U.N. Protection Force 
does not look like a man who could cause the world's most powerful alliances to 
crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 But the credibility of the United Nations, as well as that of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, may well ride on judgments by Yasushi Akashi, the 
career U.N. functionary who has already twice capitulated to Serb belligerence 
on behalf of the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old Japanese diplomat -- who authorized token NATO air strikes 
against the rebels one week, then recoiled when the Serbs struck back the next 
-- is blamed by the U.N. military command here for compromising the security of 
peacekeepers and by humanitarian relief officials for abandoning thousands of 
civilians in Gorazde to a brutal fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi has since been relieved of the authority to block NATO from launching 
air operations against intransigent Serbian positions around Gorazde. His 
standing within the U.N. hierarchy is also thought to have been diminished by 
an exchange of barbed words with Madeleine Albright, the U.S. envoy to the 
world body. 
</P>
<P>
 But he remains in the position of ultimate power within the U.N. mission. And 
there has been no change in the confused U.N. Balkans policy that would prevent 
a repetition of the disastrous handling of the Gorazde crisis, in which more 
than 700 died, nearly 2,000 were wounded, Serbian rebels captured half of a 
U.N. "safe haven" and all illusions of an imminent peace treaty were shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst consequence of Akashi's refusal to stand up to the Bosnian Serbs 
when they became defiant may be the blow it has dealt NATO's reputation as a 
determined force for peace. "We didn't do everything that we could have in 
Gorazde. That's the bottom line," observed one angry U.N. officer, who accuses 
Akashi of too narrowly defining mission objectives. "He looks too much at the 
letter of the resolutions and forgets about the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council resolution passed last spring to designate Gorazde, 
Sarajevo and four other embattled enclaves as U.N. "safe havens" never spelled 
out the exact geographic coordinates of the largely Muslim pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi, who arrived at mission headquarters in Croatia in January already 
lamenting the dearth of troops and funding for its work, zeroed in on that lack 
of clarity to justify U.N. inaction when Gorazde was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 When Serbian gunmen overran strategic high ground, penetrating deep into the 
enclave, Akashi said he was uncertain what part of the government-held 
territory was supposed to be protected by U.N. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Serbs advanced on Gorazde city, the U.N. commander for Bosnia, British 
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, called on Akashi on April 15 to authorize further NATO 
air cover so a wounded British officer could be extricated and the Serbian 
gunmen driven back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Akashi was then in the company of Bosnian Serb leaders in the rebel 
stronghold of Pale. Numerous U.N. sources, including officers in the central 
command, say they believe Akashi rejected air strikes out of fear he would be 
taken hostage in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 While that first conflict over the use of air power angered the Bosnian 
government and the U.N. military here, Akashi's second veto of NATO air strikes 
upset the entire Western alliance. The 16-nation military bloc had threatened 
to bomb Serbian infantry and weapons left in central Gorazde after 2 a.m. 
Sunday. When Serbian forces were still shelling civilians, burning homes and 
blowing up utilities hours after the deadline, NATO wanted to inflict the 
punishment it had threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi, this time in Belgrade, capital of Serb-led Yugoslavia, to discuss 
NATO's ultimatum, again rejected the use of air power, insisting: "We have 
achieved effective compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali the next day announced that he 
was deeding to NATO the authority over matters of air power, cutting Akashi out 
of the decision-making loop. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. officers, Western diplomats and relief officials here warn that a 
fundamental clash between NATO and the United Nations persists and that Akashi 
remains committed to neutrality and endless diplomatic endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute centers on Akashi's fear that any use of force compromises the 
image of U.N. impartiality, while Washington and some NATO allies believe, 
after two years of fruitless negotiations and evenhanded conduct, that it is 
now time to take sides to end the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But Akashi's recent role as head of the successful U.N. mission in Cambodia 
has made it difficult for the world body to replace him. "Everyone thought 
Akashi was a miracle worker because he headed the Cambodian mission, but that 
conflict resolved itself, despite him, not because of him," one embittered aid 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after a NATO warning in January that air strikes would be considered 
if Serbs continued to bar humanitarian relief flights into beleaguered Tuzla -- 
another U.N. "safe haven" -- Akashi organized a symbolic relief flight in 
mid-March that was supposed to be swiftly followed by a daily airlift of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relief for the suffering people of Tuzla is coming soon, certainly within 
three weeks and hopefully much sooner," Akashi announced at a news conference 
six weeks ago, after flying 60 U.N. officials and a few cases of vegetable 
seeds into the city for the inaugural ceremony of an airlift that has yet to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 While Akashi seems to be emerging as the fall-guy for the latest setbacks 
suffered by the U.N. mission -- one of the largest, most expensive in U.N. 
history -- the academic-cum-diplomat, with 37 years in U.N. service, is clearly 
not alone in the matter of culpability. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose insisted, until it was too late, that the Bosnian Serbs had embarked on 
only a minor, tactical offensive in Gorazde, signaling to the advancing rebels 
that his mission didn't much care. U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry and 
Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili have been accused of 
giving the Serbs a green light to overrun Gorazde by ruling out the use of 
Western air power during the first days of the siege.NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY

SLIP OF TONGUE DOESN'T HELP EASE BOSNIA CRISIS; BALKANS: VIDEOTAPE SHOWS U.N. 
COMMANDER SAYING MUSLIM TROOPS 'BASICALLY TURNED AND RAN. . . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The stalled search for peace in Bosnia suffered more setbacks Thursday after 
the U.N. commander here insulted Muslim-led government forces and the prime 
minister said he would resume truce talks only when U.N. forces ensure security 
in battered Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also troubling reports of Serbian heavy weapons headed for another 
vulnerable stretch of government-held territory and of tanks and artillery 
pieces being repositioned in the hills around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign mediators embarked on another diplomatic initiative to end the Bosnian 
war by meeting with leaders of the warring factions. But the distrustful 
atmosphere that has pervaded this war-weary capital since the recent Gorazde 
offensive seemed unlikely to be dispelled by repackaged proposals and hopeful 
chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadly Bosnian Serb assault on Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe haven," has 
angered Bosnian government officials who believe that more could have been done 
by the peacekeeping force to deter the killing and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has also made 
clear that he is disgruntled with the government's failure to defend the mostly 
Muslim enclave, even though a U.N. arms embargo has prevented the government 
from acquiring the means of fighting off the heavily armed Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose sparked an embarrassing controversy with remarks made in a brief visit to 
Gorazde on Wednesday when he was videotaped telling British soldiers that 
government troops expected the United Nations "to fight their wars for them." 
</P>
<P>
 "They basically turned and ran and left us to pick up the bits. They weren't 
that interested," Rose said of government forces whose defenses around Gorazde 
collapsed three weeks into the Serbian offensive. He also asserted that the 
numbers of dead and wounded from the monthlong Serbian assault had been 
exaggerated and that the physical damage to the "haven" was not as considerable 
as he had been led to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the director of the Gorazde hospital, which was destroyed by Serbian 
shelling, believed that the figures of 700 killed and 2,000 wounded "were 
indeed an exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks prompted angry responses from Bosnian officials, who pointed out 
that the U.N. ban on delivery of weapons to any former Yugoslav republic has 
tied the hands of the fledgling government forces in battles with the Bosnian 
Serbs who inherited the vast arsenal of the Yugoslav People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose met with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to smooth over the 
controversy, which U.N. spokesman Cmdr. Eric Chaperon asserted was taken out of 
context. 
</P>
<P>
 "That tape should not have been released," Chaperon said, describing Rose's 
remarks as having been made in a private discussion "from soldier to soldier" 
on various theories for the government's failure to hold a key ridge around 
Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rose has often accused government forces of trying to take advantage of 
military opportunities opened by the U.N. presence, and the clear imbalance of 
armaments created by the U.N. embargo made his remarks appear insensitive, at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic used the meeting with Rose to push for more vigorous enforcement of 
U.N. and NATO orders for withdrawal of Serbian troops and heavy weapons around 
Gorazde. Chaperon conceded that some Bosnian Serb gunmen, wearing blue police 
jumpsuits instead of army camouflage, remained inside the 1.9-mile safety zone 
declared around central Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. monitors have contended that Serbian forces are in "effective 
compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have also hesitated to confirm that all artillery has been 
removed from a 12-mile weapons exclusion-zone around the city, saying bad 
weather and rough terrain prevent thorough verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic said local authorities had spotted 11 artillery pieces around 
Gorazde and complained that Serbian soldiers were being allowed to hold their 
positions simply by posing as police. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the ultimatum is complied with fully, we are ready to talk," he 
said after seeing Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources also report increasing instances of forbidden heavy weapons 
showing up within a similar exclusion zone proclaimed around Sarajevo in 
February. One senior official said the mission knows of at least five tanks, 
six antiaircraft guns and two or three howitzers over 120 millimeters in size. 
</P>
<P>
 Western-mediated peace talks have essentially been on hold since an attack on 
a Sarajevo market killed 68 people on Feb. 5, prompting the NATO threat of air 
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they moved or surrendered their heavy 
weapons attacking the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. special envoy Charles Redman returned to Sarajevo to try to restart the 
peace process, and other international mediators from a recently formed 
"contact group" were due to visit rebel Serbian leaders to gauge their 
willingness to negotiate a settlement.

JUSTICES STRESS FREE SPEECH IN ABORTION CASE; SUPREME COURT: TOUGH QUESTIONS 
FROM THE BENCH INDICATE THAT PROTESTERS' RIGHTS MAY PREVAIL IN CLINIC 'BUFFER 
ZONE' ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer defending a court-ordered "buffer zone" around an embattled Florida 
abortion clinic got some tough questioning Thursday at the Supreme Court, as 
conservative and liberal justices alike seemed to indicate that they see the 
issue as a free-speech violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Antonin Scalia openly disputed the argument, applied by the Florida 
judge who created the buffer zone, that abortion clinics and their staffs can 
be protected from hostile protesters to shield their patients from added 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "So any speech can be prohibited if it affects people's vital numbers?" Scalia 
asked. "If I have a heart condition, can I wear a badge that says, 'Heart 
Condition: Do Not Upset Me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The state judge had ordered local police to arrest any abortion protester who 
pickets within 36 feet of the entrance to the Melbourne, Fla., clinic or within 
300 feet of the residence of a clinic employee. Judge Robert McGregor imposed 
the order last April a few days after an abortion doctor was shot and killed in 
Pensacola, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Scalia, attorney Talbot D'Alemberte noted that protesters swarm 
around cars approaching the clinic and try to block patients from entering. "We 
would not tolerate this kind of conduct around a hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic doctors had testified that women set for surgery often arrived upset 
and with an elevated pulse, attributable largely to the "gantlet" of 
anti-abortion protesters, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But abortion foes have maintained that the buffer zone also bars peaceful 
protest and therefore violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's order "criminalizes their side of the debate," said Mathew Staver, 
representing the abortion protesters. "It is a prior restraint (on speech) and 
it comes to this court with a heavy presumption of unconstitutionality." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange between Scalia and D'Alemberte highlighted the arguments in the 
court's first test case involving the free-speech rights of abortion 
protesters. The comments and questions from the bench suggest that a majority 
of the justices are troubled by the broad ban on picketing and protest and are 
likely to narrow it or strike it down entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Some justices sounded a bit less certain about how those First Amendment 
rights apply to this case specifically because it involves a court injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, a law cannot single out one group for punishment. But injunctions 
specifically target people or groups that have provoked trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Solicitor Gen. Drew S. Days III, representing the Clinton Administration, 
supported the argument on behalf of the abortion clinic. A judge must have the 
power to "enjoin certain behavior that poses a threat," Days told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he saw "a certain danger" in letting 
a judge single out protesters on one side of a controversy. Courts must show a 
"special solicitude for the free speech rights" of the protesters in such 
instances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she agreed because of the "long history of this 
country" of restricting protests. She cited examples during the 1960s involving 
civil rights and the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices will meet behind closed doors today to cast votes in the case 
(Madsen vs. Women's Health Center, 93-880) and issue a written ruling by the 
end of June.

PANEL OKS RAPID-FIRE GUN BAN; CRIME: IN SURPRISE, REPUBLICAN HENRY HYDE 
ENDORSES BILL, WHICH IS SENT TO FULL HOUSE. BUT BACKERS OF MEASURE STILL NEED 
15 VOTES TO PASS IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House Judiciary Committee approved an assault weapons ban Thursday with 
the unexpected help of an influential Republican who said he was persuaded to 
support it by crime statistics from his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, which outlaws the future possession, sale or manufacture of 19 
specific assault weapons, now goes before the full House. Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) has tentatively scheduled a vote as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome will amount to a referendum on whether the House wants the assault 
weapons provision included in the final version of the omnibus crime bill when 
it reaches a Senate-House conference. The measure already has been included in 
the Senate's crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House GOP Policy Committee and a 
hard-liner on crime, broke with fellow Republicans and sided with Democrats on 
the 20-15 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his change of heart from an opponent to a supporter may help sway 
other Republicans who oppose the ban, its backers acknowledged that they are 
still about 15 votes short of the number needed for House passage, despite 
vigorous support from President Clinton and Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is moving in our direction but we would like more time to work," 
said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), sponsor of the bill in the House. He is 
pressing for a postponement of the vote until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hyde's surprising switch was a tonic for sponsors of the 
legislation as they scrambled to put together a House majority with White House 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde credited a chief advocate of the ban, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), 
for his conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Feinstein provided him with information on the number of crimes 
involving rapid-fire guns that were committed near his Chicago district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was persuaded by that," Hyde said. "I don't want people to be able to buy 
hand grenades. What's the difference between a hand grenade and an AK-47 that 
can spray a crowd and kill people?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Hyde said he expects a backlash from voters, adding: "I will catch 
unshirted hell for this." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Feinstein said that the senator, in an unusual lobbying 
effort, has called about a dozen undecided House members to try to persuade 
them to support the measure. She also has prepared thick notebooks documenting 
crimes involving use of such weapons to bolster her case, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Judiciary Committee, the ban won another convert Thursday. Rep. 
Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.) reversed her stance and declared her support, saying 
that she had done so at the request of New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must give the police the help they need to secure our streets," she said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the legislation has been spearheaded by the politically powerful 
National Rifle Assn., which argues that Congress should focus on locking up 
criminals who use the guns rather than preventing citizens from buying them for 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (bill) is not going to solve anything except to satisfy some people . . 
. politically," argued Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chief spokesman for 
Republicans on crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the GOP members of the Judiciary Committee -- except for Hyde -- voted 
against the proposed ban. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Democrats -- except Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) and Rep. Rick 
Boucher (D-Va.) -- voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who has consistently fought against gun control legislation, argued 
that the legislation is unneeded. He said that federal laws already bar 
possession of assault weapons by ex-convicts and the mentally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates of the ban said it was long overdue.

 "This bill is the first modest step toward reducing the arms race inside the 
United States," said Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.). "This is the best chance 
we have to send the message that lethal, destructive assault weapons that are 
used to kill or maim people will not be tolerated in our society."

TIJUANA POLICE CHIEF, GUARD ASSASSINATED IN AMBUSH; MEXICO: OFFICIAL IS KILLED 
BY GUNMEN IN A PASSING VEHICLE. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE ATTACK IS LINKED TO 
LAST MONTH'S SLAYING OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

<P>
 The director of Tijuana's municipal police was assassinated Thursday night in 
a bloody ambush that also claimed the life of one of his bodyguards, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Benitez Lopez, the chief of Tijuana's uniformed police force, was 
shot and killed about 9 p.m. on one of the border city's busiest thoroughfares 
as he was returning from a false bomb threat at the Tijuana airport, municipal 
police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said two men in a red Ford Bronco pulled up beside Benitez's police 
pickup truck, opened fire with a large-caliber weapon and then roared away. 
Benitez, authorities added, was struck three times, in the neck, chest and arm, 
as his pickup spun out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that Benitez was alive when officers rushed him to the Tijuana 
Red Cross but that he died of his wounds a little more than an hour later. His 
bodyguard died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying comes little more than a month after the assassination in the same 
city of Mexico's ruling party presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
Colosio, who had been the front-runner in the presidential race, was gunned 
down after a campaign rally March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether Benitez's death was in any way connected 
to Colosio's. Tijuana also has been racked in recent months by a wave of 
narcotics-related violence. Early last month, five people were killed in a 
shootout between a federal police unit and state police who were said to be 
protecting a drug lord. Among those slain in the cross-fire was a federal 
police commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez had been a high-profile figure in an aggressive campaign to clean up 
corruption in the municipal police. Since he was appointed by Tijuana's mayor 
about a year and a half ago, he has fired at least 300 police officers for 
suspected misconduct -- more than had been fired in the entire three years of 
the previous administration. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer by training, Benitez, who was in his mid-40s, had worked in the 
private security business before becoming police chief. His agency is one of 
three patrolling the Mexican city, and he has been widely quoted in recent 
weeks regarding the role his officers played in the preliminary investigation 
into Colosio's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of that shooting, city police officers helped transport the 
suspected assassin, Mario Aburto Martinez, to federal police headquarters after 
a tense confrontation with federal police. They also obtained a trunk 
containing Aburto's possessions, including a diary, and turned it over to 
federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of Benitez's agency in the Colosio investigation, however, has been 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Thursday night's shooting, Tijuana was swarming with police, as 
roads to the border and the nearby cities of Ensenada and Tecate were shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no arrests had been reported by late Thursday night.

 Months of U.N.-led diplomacy aimed at persuading Greek and Turkish Cypriots to 
agree on confidence-building measures collapsed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After separate meetings in Nicosia with Greek Cypriot President Glafkos 
Clerides and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Rauf Denktash, U.N. envoy Joe 
Clark said that he had failed to bridge their differences and saw no point in 
further talks. 
</P>

BIOCHEMIST GIVES $24 MILLION TO UC SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A biochemist famous for his pioneering work in gene splicing has donated $24 
million to UC San Francisco, setting a record for the largest gift by an 
individual to any of the nine UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation was made by Herbert W. Boyer, a professor emeritus at UC San 
Francisco and co-founder of Genentech Inc., a leading biotechnology company in 
south San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer, 57, of Mill Valley, is one of two scientists credited with a watershed 
in biomedical research that forms the foundation of today's burgeoning 
biotechnology industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Boyer and Stanley N. Cohen of Stanford University discovered ways to 
transplant genes from one living cell to another. Working collaboratively but 
in separate laboratories, they later developed the underlying scientific 
techniques for genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer's donation comes from proceeds he earned from patent rights to the 
gene-splicing process. The $24 million represents his share of proceeds over a 
17-year period that will end in 1997. The money is earmarked for biomedical 
research.

SCIENTISTS SAY NICOTINE RESEARCH WAS SUPPRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former scientists for Philip Morris USA told a House panel Thursday that 
the company suppressed their research and abruptly closed their lab after their 
studies on rats more than a decade ago raised serious questions about the 
potential addictive nature of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot prove addiction from a rat, but you can say that further work is 
needed," Victor DeNoble told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on 
health and the environment. "It is a real strong indicator." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Parrish, a senior vice president of Philip Morris, said DeNoble had 
changed his opinions over time, making his findings more dramatic than they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with fellow scientist Paul Mele, DeNoble studied whether rats would 
press levers in their cages to self-administer nicotine intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that the rats frequently self-administered nicotine, much more 
often than a saline solution made available in the same manner, and that 
nicotine had a positive reinforcing effect, DeNoble testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern indicated potential addiction to nicotine, DeNoble said. Although 
it did not follow that the same patterns would be found in humans, it did 
warrant further investigation, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoble and Mele said they had been led to believe that they could publish 
work in journals while working for Philip Morris. But company officials 
requested that they withdraw their paper after it had been accepted for 
publication in 1983, the scientists testified. They said they were also told to 
cancel a presentation to a meeting of the American Psychological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoble and Mele continued their research through the start of 1984, they 
said. But in April, 1984, their boss told them that their lab was being closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after leaving the company, when the scientists resubmitted their study 
for publication in 1985 and 1986, Philip Morris threatened legal action and 
they were forced to back down, DeNoble said.

TENNESSEE AREA CALLED VULNERABLE TO DESTRUCTIVE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A seismic zone concentrated in eastern Tennessee, the site of several nuclear 
power reactors and hydroelectric dams, poses the threat of a destructive 
earthquake, geologists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade the zone produced the second-highest amount of seismic 
activity of any region east of the Rocky Mountains, says a report in today's 
issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone, about 30 miles wide and 180 miles long, includes at least two dozen 
hydroelectric plants and several nuclear power reactors operated by the federal 
Tennessee Valley Authority, one of the largest electric utilities in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This zone has been known for some time but hasn't been described in any of 
the U.S. Geological Survey maps that engineers building dams and buildings rely 
on to figure seismic hazards," said Christine Powell, a professor of geology at 
the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was time this zone should get the attention it deserved," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Munsey, a seismologist with the Tennessee Valley Authority, said the 
dams and nuclear reactors were built to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 
5.8, the level of a temblor that occurred in neighboring southwest Virginia in 
1897. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest earthquake ever recorded in eastern Tennessee was magnitude 4.6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether (the zone) will ever generate a damaging earthquake," 
she said. But it's there, it's very distinct, and people should take it into 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 The zone is separate and distinct from the New Madrid zone in the central 
Mississippi River valley, which produced the most seismic activity in the 
eastern United States during the past decade.

24 MIDSHIPMEN IN CHEATING SCANDAL TO BE EXPELLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has decided to expel 24 midshipmen in the 
cheating scandal that has rocked the prestigious U.S. Naval Academy, service 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those expelled will not be required to repay the costs of their 
government-funded education, officials said.The costs have been estimated at 
$57,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, a graduate of the academy, also has decided to allow two other 
midshipmen to return to the academy to face discipline "short of separation" 
from the Navy, a Navy statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheating scandal sullied the reputation of the academy, which produces 
about half of the Navy's officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, the Pentagon concluded that 71 midshipmen were involved in 
cheating on a 1992 electrical engineering exam and decided that 29 should be 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those not dismissed were allowed to finish the school year and graduate, but 
faced other disciplinary actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, three of the 29 were spared expulsion, leaving 26 cases remaining 
for final determination by Dalton. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the midshipmen were identified by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a very difficult decision to make, but in my judgment it is 
both fair and just. We must strive to maintain a spirit of honor and integrity 
within the naval service," Dalton said in a written statement. "I am committed 
to fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton said he had looked at each case separately, as had the former chief of 
naval operations, Adm. Frank B. Kelso, and a variety of other officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each individual case was . . . evaluated on the specific circumstances of 
that midshipman's actions, including the serious nature of the offenses and all 
information concerning the midshipmen's involvement," Dalton said, adding that 
each student had been given an opportunity to provide information on his own 
behalf at each level of the case review.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; RHINO DELIVERS ENGAGING ROCK INSTRUMENTALS ON CD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you hate interminable drum and guitar solos in concert, the latest 
series of CD retrospectives from Rhino Records should prove engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the five-volume series is explained in its title: "Rock 
Instrumental Classics." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, however, the label's creative team hasn't simply thrown together 
dozens of instrumentals in random fashion. Producers Gary Stewart, James Austin 
and David McLees have arranged the 90 songs in the series by era and pop 
genres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volume 1: The Fifties" kicks off, appropriately, with Duane Eddy's twangy 
guitar on "Rebel-'Rouser," arguably the most influential instrumental record of 
rock's first decade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is joined in the collection by such other Top 10 singles as Sandy Nelson's 
"Teen Beat," the Champs' "Tequila" and Bill Justis' "Raunchy." The most notable 
omission: Bill Doggett's memorable "Honky Tonk (Parts 1 and 2)." 
</P>
<P>
 "Volume 2: The Sixties" checks in with 18 more singles, ranging from the 
Ventures' "Walk -- Don't Run" to the Fireballs' "Bulldog" and Mason Williams' 
"Classical Gas." 
</P>
<P>
 "Volume 3: The Seventies" offers an even more varied field, including Van 
McCoy's "The Hustle," the Edgar Winter Group's "Frankenstein" and Gary 
Glitter's "Rock and Roll, Part 2." 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup on "Volume 4: Soul" is highlighted by four tracks by Booker T. & 
the MG's, the legendary Memphis rhythm section that played on many of the 
classic Stax/Volt labels' hits. The selections include "Green Onions" and "Hang 
'Em High." Also featured: Hugh Masekela's "Grazing in the Grass" and the Ramsey 
Lewis Trio's "The 'In' Crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 "Volume 5: Surf" features such old faves as Dick Dale & the Del-Tones' 
"Miserlou," the Chantays' "Pipeline" and the Surfaris' "Wipe Out." 
</P>
<P>
 While there is an innocence and vitality to these instrumentals, you are aware 
while listening to them of their limits -- a reminder of why it's words and 
vocal character that give music its most liberating element. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cub Koda's liner notes make a spirited case for instrumentals, arguing 
that marketing was one reason the instrumental artists' careers weren't as 
dramatic as those of singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vocals belonged to singers, and singers had faces," he writes. "Instrumental 
rock was harder to market because . . . there were (for the most part) no 
pretty faces or heroes to trot out daily on 'American Bandstand.' "

GIRLS GET A GLIMPSE OF THE WORKING WORLD; OPPORTUNITY: DAUGHTERS TAG ALONG TO 
BROADEN THEIR CAREER HORIZONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On the Warner Bros. movie lot in Burbank on Thursday, 323 girls were part of a 
magical notion: All girls should be given the opportunity to have big dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Daughters of janitors were shown that they can be executives, daughters of 
executives sampled life as artists, and all the daughters were told that they 
could do anything sons can. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles and across the country, an estimated 3 million girls ages 9 
to 15 followed their parents, aunts, uncles, friends and sponsors to work 
during the second annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls followed cops and corporate lawyers, trend-setting chefs and 
tradespeople, all as part of an event sponsored by the Ms. Foundation to 
reverse an alarming trend. When girls reach their teens, tests have shown, 
their self-esteem plummets and with it go their beliefs about what they can do 
with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Burbank movie lot, after the girls broke into groups to learn about 
animation, movie marketing, post-production and music scoring, some took the 
opportunity to learn more about their parents' or sponsors' jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Giggling and hugging her father's leg, 5-year-old Jacqueline Vaca helped prune 
the cream-colored rosebushes that blanket the Warner lot. "I'm helping Daddy 
cut off the dead ones," she said, picking the trimmed flowers off the concrete 
and depositing them into a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Vaca explained that although his daughter was, like many other girls who 
came to work on Thursday, younger than the target age, it was particularly 
important for her to take advantage of this opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought her here to let her know that there are opportunities for women to 
work in the entertainment field," Vaca said, explaining that his daughter spent 
the morning learning about movie music. "If she wants to work for a studio, she 
knows she has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, girls were at work: at BP America's headquarters in 
Cleveland, girls mixed chemicals to make slime. At the Aurora Fire Department 
near Denver, girls wrestled with fire hoses. At the New York law firm of 
Debevoise & Plimpton, girls attended a seminar called "Thinking Like a Lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, daughters of Administration officials and girls from local 
schools roamed the halls and ate sandwiches on the South Lawn, served by White 
House butlers in black ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to say to the young women of our society: You can grow up to do 
anything, to be anything, to achieve anything that your imagination and your 
effort and your talent will let you achieve," President Clinton told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Take Our Daughters to Work was a small undertaking in some L.A. 
offices and nonexistent in others. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Hollywood Policy Center, a nonprofit group based in the 
entertainment community, coordinated the event on the West Coast and spread the 
word with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 As movie studios, newspapers, law firms and science laboratories held special 
programs, the event moved beyond an intimate family affair and became an 
outreach program. Some companies, such as Warner Bros., sponsored a busload of 
schoolgirls, particularly from lower-income areas, as their daughters for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent mailers saying try to find girls who might not get the chance," said 
Kathy Garmezy of the Hollywood Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us who have daughters, they've been around this stuff their whole 
lives," said actress Jill Eikenberry, who took a 16-year-old girl from Penny 
Lane, a Northridge residential treatment program for emotionally handicapped 
girls, to work with her on the last episode of "L.A. Law" on the 20th Century 
Fox lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people who don't want to do what their mothers do or who 
don't have role models," Eikenberry said. "It's nice to be able to do this for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Department of Street Lighting's equipment yard in 
Hollywood, girls got a demonstration of how cranes lift electricians to the top 
of street-light poles. They took 25-foot-high rides in the cherry picker 
bucket, protectively escorted by their fathers and an aunt. (The one woman who 
works at the yard, an electrical craft helper, went up with her niece.) 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I look?" asked Michelle Long, 14, having donned a yellow helmet and 
orange safety vest.  
</P>
<P>
 "Official," said her father, assistant electrician Tim Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 At the restaurant Campanile, chef and owner Nancy Silverton explained the 
difference between Italian parsley and regular parsley to five would-be chefs, 
ages 6 to 11.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go to the walk-in and pick out some vegetables," she said as the girls 
trailed behind her, some so short that their white chef's jackets looked like 
nightshirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Mark Peel, Silverton's husband and the restaurant's other chef and 
owner, demonstrated the fine art of using a carrot peeler. "Don't peel your 
thumb," he warned. "It doesn't peel very well." 
</P>
<P>
 This being Los Angeles, the cameras were rolling. Fox Television reporter 
Barbara Schroeder, on hand to chronicle the Campanile feast, did her stand-up 
with her 4-year-old daughter, Glenn, in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn, cradled in Schroeder's arms and wearing a shade of hot pink lipstick 
that matched her dress, stuck the microphone in maitre d' Claudio Blotta's face 
and asked, "What does a maitre d' do?"  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so cute," Schroeder said later. "The 'awww' factor is very big today."  
</P>
<P>
 The day did not pass without controversy, though. There were complaints that 
it excluded boys. For that reason, Chrysler Corp. said it was not taking part 
in the day and was discouraging workers from bringing their daughters to the 
office. Other companies like Rockwell and First Interstate made it a Take Our 
Children to Work Day.  
</P>
<P>
 Silverton's 9-year-old son wanted to be involved. "I think he feels today that 
girls get more special things," Silverton said. "I told him that traditionally 
it was expected that men would ordinarily get a career. This whole day is for 
daughters to see what their mothers do." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, like Vaca, to see what their parents want them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kim Wardlaw, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, said the secretary of 
one of her colleagues asked her to shepherd her daughter around. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I don't want her to be a secretary. I want her to be a lawyer,' " 
Wardlaw recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents were showing girls around hoping they would not like their jobs. 
When Detective Wayne Dufort of the Los Angeles Police Department brought his 
daughter, Nicole, to the Van Nuys Division, he hoped it would discourage the 
14-year-old from following in his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a detective just like my dad," she declared. "He goes around and 
looks for criminals. He goes from house to house looking for gang members. I 
think it's fun and it's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls were stepping into completely alien territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls from Washington Irving Middle School outside Eagle Rock rushed to sign 
up for the trip to Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, one of the most 
powerful talent agencies in town, although few of them had any idea what an 
agent does. 
</P>
<P>
 Once ensconced in the art-filled interior, women agents and producers talked 
to them about how they made their way in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch, super-agent and CAA chieftain Michael Ovitz, one of the agency's 
founders, appeared at the conference room doorway to greet the girls and ask if 
they had any questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael started in a mail room -- just like the one downstairs," CAA's Anna 
Perez told the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do now?" asked Stephanie Gima, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Councilwoman Laura Chick's office in Reseda, four Reseda High School 
students got to see the district representative and her staff at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she works inside an office and never goes outside," said Gail 
Duque, 17, one of the students who accompanied Chick and her planning deputy on 
a tour of three businesses applying for building permits and liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Pedro, 14-year-old Erin Boyd strapped herself into the front passenger 
seat of a Jet Ranger 206 helicopter and gave commands.  
</P>
<P>
 "Air 170 clear," she said to the radio voice.  
</P>
<P>
 "170 Roger," the voice said to her.  
</P>
<P>
 As commanding officer of operations for the port police, her father, Lt. 
Ronald Boyd, routinely rides the airship to monitor the port for hazardous 
waste spills or cargo theft. Having his daughter at work "takes some of the 
mystery out of Dad, especially a dad who has a mysterious job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the copter landed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did pretty good," he told her. "Some policemen, it takes them a lot 
longer to show them how to do this." 
</P>

 Jaclyn Dimick met with German bankers and sat in on some high-powered 
discussions about bond financing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 And what did the ninth-grader learn? It's going to take a lot more than high 
school mathematics to be like her dad, who is chief financial officer of Bergen 
Brunswick, one of the nation's largest wholesale pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was Take Our Daughters to Work Day at Bergen Brunswick and throughout 
the country. Dozens of Orange County businesses opened their doors to curious 
young girls -- and even some boys -- who saw close-up the work-a-day world of 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went into many meetings that were hard to understand and I got to see how 
important he was," said Jaclyn. "I wish to become better at mathematics to 
prepare to get a job like my dad's." 
</P>
<P>
 At AST Research in Irvine, both daughters and sons got to try out the 
computers; at Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, they checked out jobs from 
housekeeping to the front office, and for many there were opportunities to take 
tours, attend meetings and sample cafeteria food. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Dimick at Bergen Brunswick was dubious as he and his youngest daughter, a 
student at Laguna Hills High School, arrived for work at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had apprehensions to start out with that maybe it would be disruptive. But 
having her watching helped me reflect on what I was doing and make sure I was 
doing things in the right order." 
</P>
<P>
 He also wondered what visiting international bankers would think. But not for 
long, he said, "They said they have a similar program in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dimicks also left work early. "She wasn't used to my 12- to 14-hour days," 
he said. And besides, she added, homework was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jazmin Carino, the day was "pretty neat." Of course, her mother works at 
Interplay Productions Inc. of Irvine, which makes computer and video games. In 
addition to watching her mother Kim handle business calls and work on her 
office computer, Jazmin got a sneak preview of Clay Fighter II. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the next version of Clay Fighter, a Super Nintendo clay-animation video 
game that Interplay introduced last Christmas. Jazmin, a seventh-grader at 
Newhart Middle School in Mission Viejo, got to inspect the clay models for the 
still-in-production Clay Fighter II. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great experience," said her mother, who is director of marketing at 
Interplay. "She got a chance to see what Mom does." 
</P>
<P>
 AST Research changed the parameters a bit and designated the occasion "Take 
Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "In our work environment, there is no differentiation between the talents and 
skills of men and women, so we thought it would be appropriate to expose both 
sons and daughters to the opportunities here," said Michele Richards, manager 
of community relations for the computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty boys and girls ate lunch with their parents in the company cafeteria, 
then were treated to pep talks by AST executives. But the real thrill was using 
the computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids are more computer literate than their parents," Richards 
said. "They weren't intimidated at all -- they just sat down at the computers 
and started playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, in Los Angeles, the cameras were rolling Thursday morning. Fox 
television reporter Barbara Schroeder, on hand to chronicle the Campanile 
feast, did her stand-up with her 4-year-old daughter, Glenn, in tow. Glenn, 
cradled in Schroeder's arms and wearing a shade of hot pink lipstick that 
matched her dress, grinned deliciously, stuck the microphone in maitre d' 
Claudio Blotta's face and asked, "What does a maitre d' do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so cute," Schroeder said later. "The 'awww' factor is very big today." 
</P>
<P>
 And so was the event. No question about it, it was girls' day out. Everywhere 
you looked, from one edge of the continent to the other, there were girls at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 At BP America's headquarters in Cleveland, girls mixed chemicals to make 
slime. At the Aurora Fire Department near Denver, girls wrestled with fire 
hoses. At the New York law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, girls sat through a 
seminar called "Thinking Like a Lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, daughters of Administration officials and girls from local 
schools roamed the halls and ate sandwiches on the South Lawn, served by White 
House butlers in black ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to say to the young women of our society: You can grow up to do 
anything, to be anything, to achieve anything that your imagination and your 
effort and your talent will let you achieve," President Clinton told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the nationally observed Take Our Daughters to Work program -- the 
brainchild of the Ms. Foundation -- was a small undertaking in some Los Angeles 
offices and nonexistent in others. This year, the Hollywood Policy Center, a 
nonprofit, entertainment-community group, coordinated the event on the West 
Coast, spreading the word with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie studios and law firms and science laboratories held special programs. 
The event moved beyond an intimate family affair and became an outreach 
program. Some companies brought girls by the busload from schools -- 
particularly from lower income areas -- to serve as daughters-for-a-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent mailers saying try to find girls who might not get the chance," said 
Kathy Garmezy of the Hollywood Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us who have daughters, they've been around this stuff their whole 
lives," said actress Jill Eikenberry, who took a 16-year-old girl from Penny 
Lane, a residential treatment program in Northridge for emotionally handicapped 
girls, to work with her on the last episode of "L.A. Law." There are so many 
people who don't want to do what their mothers do or who don't have role 
models. It's nice to be able to do this for them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hollywood-area yard operated by the city's department of street 
lighting, girls took 25-foot-high rides in the "bucket" -- escorted by their 
protective fathers. (Yes, there is one woman, an electrical craft helper, and 
she went up with her niece.) 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I look?" asked Michelle Long, 14, after donning yellow helmet and 
orange safety vest. "Official," said her father, assistant electrician Tim 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Martin, on the other hand, was not particularly enthused by the peek 
that her father, Lt. Russ Martin, gave her into the Santa Monica Police 
Department, where he is executive officer in charge of operations. For one 
thing, she said, the department's sunrise briefing was "the most boring thing" 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 9-year-old said her day picked up when she hooked up with mom, Santa 
Monica park ranger supervisor Diane Martin, who arranged for a tour of the city 
jail. (It was empty.) Then came the highlight: the city animal shelter. "I love 
animals," said Katie, who is now considering a life with the park service. But 
then again, she said, maybe she'll just be a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other girls throughout the city getting a glimpse of inner sanctums 
that belonged to neither of their parents' worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the second annual Take Our Daughters to Work program -- 
expected to attract 3 million participants nationwide -- exposes young girls to 
the world of career options and begins to counteract the stunning loss of 
self-esteem that many girls undergo in adolescence, which has been reported in 
well-publicized recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The day did not pass without controversy, though: There were complaints that 
it excluded boys. For that reason, Chrysler Corp. said it was not taking part 
and was discouraging workers from bringing daughters to the office. Other 
companies, such as Rockwell International and First Interstate Bank, dubbed the 
day: Take Our Children to Work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boys complained directly to their mothers. "My son said, 'Take me to 
work' " said Eikenberry of her 12-year-old son. "But he gets to go to work with 
me all the time. I said, 'This is a thing about girls. Many girls feel they 
don't have the opportunities that boys do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for Silverton's 9-year-old son. "I think he feels today that girls get 
more special things," the chef said. "I told him that traditionally it was 
expected that men would ordinarily get a career. This whole day is for 
daughters to see what their mothers do." 
</P>
<P>
 Or to see what their mothers want them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kim Wardlaw, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, said a colleague's 
secretary asked Wardlaw to shepherd her daughter around. "She said, 'I don't 
want her to be a secretary. I want her to be a lawyer,' " Wardlow recounted. "I 
perfectly understood. My mother was a bookkeeper and a secretary, and she 
refused to let me take typing because she wanted me to be her boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents actually were ushering their daughters around in the hopes of 
discouraging them from creating a family tradition. The ploy didn't work for 
Los Angeles Police Detective Wayne Dufort, who brought his 14-year-old 
daughter, Nicole Dufort, to the Van Nuys station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a detective just like my dad," she declared. "He goes around and 
looks for criminals. He goes from house to house looking for gang members. I 
think it's fun and it's exciting," said Nicole, who said she doesn't want to be 
a nurse, like her mom, because it's too boring.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV GRAPPLES WITH HISTORIC STORIES FROM TWO NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 As if reality weren't dramatic enough. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's edition of "The CBS Evening News" and Thursday's morning 
news on CNN, a military trumpeter was heard playing baleful taps as a dignified 
Julie Nixon Eisenhower, finally surrendering to tears in the closing moments of 
her father's poignant funeral, received a folded U.S. flag from a major 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 In real time, however, flags that had covered their father's coffin were 
handed to the Nixon daughters some minutes after the playing of taps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steven Spielberg wanna-bes at CBS News and CNN sought to wring even more 
emotion from the moment. So, as if their minds had also merged, each network 
combined the audio from one of the taped sequences with pictures from the other 
to give the impression that they were simultaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the reality was found lacking, so they fixed it up in the 
editing room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly a dirty trick, if you get the drift. It was a trick, 
nevertheless -- a subtle sweetening, a moving of an ethical line, a glimpse of 
television news as calculated theater -- and yet another of the ironies that 
threaded this day of epic history and rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
 Healing reached a crescendo on two continents this week as both Richard Nixon 
and apartheid were given final resting places in the presence of television. 
</P>
<P>
 In no way does that equate decades of Nixon with decades of subjugation of 
non-whites in South Africa. Yet symbolically, the link between Yorba Linda and 
Johannesburg -- marking the process of coming together in distant lands -- was 
unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only nine years ago that ABC's "Nightline" aired a series of telecasts 
from South Africa creating historic public dialogue between apartheid foes and 
supporters, only four years ago that Ted Koppel returned to Johannesburg for a 
breakthrough, multiracial "town meeting" on TV just days after Nelson Mandela 
had been released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the even more unthinkable was happening. 
</P>
<P>
 In Yorba Linda, TV cameras captured thousands of mourners in a serpentine 
queue waiting to file past the coffin of the once-reviled Nixon. "He became not 
only an elder statesman, but to everyone's surprise but his, he became a 
beloved elder statesman," Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose would observe later 
on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, network cameras in South Africa showed lines of voters -- some 
dramatically silhouetted against darkening skies -- waiting their turn at the 
ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News supported its pictures with fine writing. "It is a powerful 
impression, whites in lines behind blacks," noted Peter Jennings from somewhere 
in the country. After one middle-aged white said he had been waiting in line 
four hours, Jennings added in a pointed voice-over: "His servant has been 
waiting 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this age of downsizing of network coverage, television is inevitably more 
attracted to big events than to the crumb trails that lead up to them. Give 
them a whiff of something spectacular, though, and news anchors pop up mostly 
like preening MacArthurs returning to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's network anchor contingent in South Africa consisted of Jennings, 
Dan Rather of CBS and Bernard Shaw of CNN. In contrast with the determinedly 
low-profile Shaw's interview with National Party incumbent Frederik W. de 
Klerk, there was Rather doing his usual double duty, first being interviewed by 
KCBS-TV Channel 2 anchors on the satellite, then himself interviewing ANC 
leader Mandela in a sit-down that gave the anchor as much camera time as the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception to this send-in-the-anchor, hit-and-run approach, though, has 
been Charlayne Hunter-Gault's in-depth, on-the-scene South Africa coverage for 
"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS and the human-rights series "Rights & 
Wrongs" on KCET-TV Channel 28. On "Rights & Wrongs" recently, she did a long 
interview with Judge Richard Goldstone, author of a controversial report 
allegedly linking government security forces to thousands of supposedly 
black-on-black murders in South Africa. And on "NewsHour," there she was 
lengthily revisiting South Africans she had interviewed in 1985, one of them a 
black poet who this week found himself about to vote in the very church where 
years earlier his murdered brother was laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot box replacing the burial box. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with that, KCAL-TV Channel 9 hasn't gotten a lot this week from its 
shipping of anchor Pat Harvey to South Africa, where her Los Angeles-localized 
stories in the field have been routine, and where oftentimes her voice-overs 
have been grafted onto previously broadcast CNN footage. 
</P>
<P>
 Local TV coverage of Nixon's funeral day (the ceremony was carried live by all 
major Los Angeles stations except KCOP-TV Channel 13) was also, well, spotty, 
with some anchors giving it the same chatty ambience as they would 
float-by-float commentary on the Rose Parade. The man-on-the-street-interview 
mentality prevailed, too, with someone on KNBC-TV Channel 4 even asking a flier 
expected to be in one of the F-16s scheduled to zoom over the funeral in a 
salute to Nixon: "Do the pilots, do they feel a certain emotion?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, just about every VIP in attendance was tossed the perfunctory 
"Nixon legacy" question by sound bite-seeking reporters on the run in the way 
that Hollywood's gussied-up celebrities are asked their Academy Award favorites 
outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Oscar night.  
</P>
<P>
 All in all, though, network coverage of the funeral itself was live television 
at its finest, so moving and memorable as pomp and spectacle, so interwoven 
with the threads of U.S. history and tradition, so astonishing in its 
implications, that it merited a second shot in prime time where everyone could 
see it. Someone should make it a video. Norman Rockwell would have painted it.  
</P>
<P>
 The operative adjective is astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One needs to come in from the cold," John le Carre's spymaster Control tells 
his cynical operative Leamas in "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold." Whether it 
was Nixon or everyone else who came in from the cold Wednesday wasn't clear. 
Almost as if history were being rewound, though, some of the President's men 
and women -- from Spiro T. Agnew to Rosemary Woods to G. Gordon Liddy -- 
resurfaced at Nixon's funeral like Watergate-era apparitions peeking their 
faces through the afternoon's rain clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 And with four past Presidents in attendance, their rigid profiles frozen in 
granite close-ups as they listened intently to the eulogies, it seemed almost 
that Mt. Rushmore had come to Nixon's white-frame birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those eulogies was what may have been President Clinton's greatest 
speech -- perhaps one flawed man's tribute to another.  
</P>
<P>
 A visionary Afrikaner farmer reiterated to Hunter-Gault this week that what 
South Africa needed was "a revolution of the heart and the mind." A powerful 
thought. Is that what was happening in Yorba Linda, too, a revolution of the 
heart and the mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he achieved in death something that he never quite could achieve in 
life -- that is, bring us together," reborn Watergate figure Charles Colson 
told a TV interviewer about Nixon. It's easy to get swept away by the moment. 
Just as this week will not make South Africa's problems disappear, this 
national union -- if that's what it is -- will not be lasting. Too many 
polarizing issues lie ahead, and grudges are hard to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a week when whites and non-whites at last have come together in South 
Africa -- however awkwardly and tenuously -- it does seem fitting that at least 
some anti-Nixon hard-liners have found it in themselves to finally turn the 
other cheek.

CBS, EX-CORRESPONDENT SETTLE AGE-DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT; TELEVISION: 'I CAME 
HERE TO SAY CERTAIN THINGS IN COURT, AND I SAID THEM,' JOHN SHEAHAN SAYS. TERMS 
OF THE AGREEMENT ARE NOT DISCLOSED. THE NETWORK CONTINUES TO DENY HIS 
ALLEGATIONS.

<P>
 CBS and former correspondent John Sheahan on Thursday settled an 
age-discrimination suit in the midst of a jury trial in federal court here. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS agreed to give a financial settlement to Sheahan, 56, an award-winning 
reporter who was laid off in 1991 after 23 years with the network. But as part 
of the agreement, terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahan had been seeking an estimated $1 million in damages and back pay in 
one of the first such suits to come to trial against a network news 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahan, who had said in an interview before the trial that CBS News had 
"engaged in a war against older people" in recent layoffs, expressed happiness 
with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to say certain things in court, and I said them," he said. "I 
hope that my effort contributes to the cause of honest journalism -- and 
especially to the working men and women in our profession." 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, CBS said that the lawsuit had been "amicably 
resolved" but continued to deny the charge of age discrimination. Attorney 
Douglas Jacobs said, "It is clear from the evidence admitted in federal court 
that CBS did not discriminate against anyone on the basis of age or anything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS said that Sheahan was dismissed when the network closed its Beijing 
bureau, where Sheahan was the correspondent. But Sheahan -- who lost his job at 
age 53, 17 months short of receiving lifetime health care and other benefits -- 
said that he was treated differently than other, younger correspondents who 
were offered alternative employment when they were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The network presented statistics that it said showed there was no pattern of 
age discrimination among CBS correspondents. At the end of 1991, the network 
said, CBS News had 93 correspondents, 68 of whom were over 40 and 25 of whom 
were under 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which was being carried by cable's Court TV channel, had begun 
Monday. Sheahan told the jury about his long career with CBS and what he 
described as the terrible emotional impact of unfairly losing his job "with the 
institution that I had devoted my life to."

 American Cinematheque will present "The Gay '90s: Gay and Lesbian Short Films 
& Videos" this weekend at the Raleigh Studio's Chaplin Theater, 5300 Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight will be devoted to eight lesbian-themed works, while Saturday 
showcases five gay male vignettes. Both evenings will start at 7:30, with both 
presentations repeated at 10:30. There will be a panel discussion on the 
portrayal of gays and lesbians in the media after the first program each 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Those works available for preview are characterized mainly by a humorous, 
gentle view of the vicissitudes of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially impressive among Friday's offerings are Megan Siler's "First Base," 
which tenderly pinpoints those last moments of carefree affection expressed 
between adolescent girls just as their attention starts focusing on the 
opposite sex, and Lisa Ginsburg and Michal Goralsky's four-minute "Joystick 
Blues," in which two women's lovemaking goes hilariously awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Christopher's "The Dead Boys' Club" and Christopher Newby's "Relax" offer 
reflective takes on love and sex in the age of AIDS. With images and interior 
monologues rather than dialogue, Stephen Cummins' lyrical "Resonance" tells the 
love story of two young men, one a martial arts instructor who rescues the 
other from a gay bashing, largely in mime and dance. It is highlighted by a 
boxing match that becomes a dance, transforming aggression into affection. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 466-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
 Wartime Footage: Harriet Eder and Thomas Kufus, the makers of "Mein Krieg" 
("My War") (at the Nuart Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m., this weekend only), 
were able to locate six German World War II soldiers, all of them veterans of 
the doomed invasion of Russia and all of them skilled amateur cameramen who 
preserved their footage. As a result, we're able to watch their films as we 
hear them recall their wartime experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them emerge as decent types, but only the most reflective speaks of the 
Holocaust and his sense of being an "accomplice." Although attention wanders 
when its archival footage is allowed to become overly repetitive, "Mein Krieg" 
is an invaluable historical record and a portrait of a seemingly ordinary group 
of men caught up in a devastating military campaign.

THE MEANING OF 'EARTH'? DUO ISN'T SURE; POP MUSIC: JOHN CALE AND BOB NEUWIRTH 
AREN'T CONCERNED WITH SIMPLE ANSWERS IN AN ALBUM THAT RECALLS A 
'POST-APOCALYPTIC PSYCHODRAMA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want simple answers, don't ask John Cale or Bob Neuwirth what their 
collaborative album "Last Day on Earth" is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is non-specific in time and it's an interior/exterior travelogue, as seen 
through the sensibilities of the habitues of the mythical Cafe Shabu," said 
Neuwirth with a shrug as he sat in the Universal City offices of MCA Records, 
which released the album Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cale, in a separate interview from his home in New York, wasn't any more 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's certainly a Brechtian landscape that's got a lot of Angst and 
unresolved problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, apparently, is that neither Cale, the co-founder of the Velvet 
Underground, nor Neuwirth, a songwriter and visual artist whose colleagues have 
included Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol, can really say what this piece is about.  
</P>
<P>
 The most concrete terms that either offers or accepts in discussion of the 
album run along the lines of "post-apocalyptic psychodrama." Musically, they 
both allow, the closest analogy is probably "Songs for Drella," the 1991 
tribute to Warhol by Cale and his former Velvets partner Lou Reed -- though 
with everything from folk parodies to rock 'n' roll, it covers a wider range. 
Structurally it could be likened to a "Canterbury Tales" in which all the 
pilgrims are different facets of one multiple-personality case. 
</P>
<P>
 But that still doesn't answer the question, "What is it about ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Admitted Neuwirth, "I'm hoping other writers can tell us what it's about." 
</P>
<P>
 The project began life as a theater piece, commissioned for performance at St. 
Ann's Church in Brooklyn, which has long supported avant-garde art. "Last Day 
on Earth" was originally, in Neuwirth's words, "an abstract 'Prairie Home 
Companion.' "  
</P>
<P>
 It was performed by Cale and Neuwirth both at St. Ann's and in Hamburg last 
year. MCA Records executives Paula Batson, a longtime friend of Neuwirth, and 
Kathy Nelson heard a tape of the songs and asked Cale and Neuwirth to adapt it 
for an album.  
</P>
<P>
 Cale, 52, and Neuwirth, who won't give his age but who appears to be in the 
same neighborhood, have been friends since the mid-'60s, when they were 
regulars at Warhol's Factory studio in New York. They teamed for some 
unreleased recordings in the late '70s, but "Last Day on Earth" is the first 
official project they've joined on. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, they seem to be unlikely collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuwirth, originally from Ohio, describes Cale -- a classically trained 
Welshman -- as a perfectionist who labors over every detail. Neuwirth 
admittedly has little discipline and lives, artistically speaking, for the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cale, though, says that "Last Day on Earth" is the product of shared artistic 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and I both appreciate the value of spontaneity," Cale said. "Every time 
there would be a problem, Bob would automatically have a reaction to it, and 
nine out of 10 times I'd understand. That spontaneity is what I like about 
collaborations, like in the Velvets."

DAVID WILCOX EXPANDS HIS HORIZONS; POP MUSIC: THE SINGER-SONGWRITER EXPLORES 
THE REWARDS OF EMOTIONAL INTIMACY WITH A MELLOW SOUND. BUT HIS DESIRE TO BE 
MEANINGFUL NEVER GETS IN THE WAY OF A GOOD SONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Wilcox seems remarkably happy and well-adjusted for a singer-songwriter 
who plays deeply personal pop-tinged folk music. While many modern songwriters 
deliver anger and alienation wrapped in stark, minimalist arrangements, 
Wilcox's new album, "Big Horizon," explores the rewards of emotional intimacy 
with a warm, mellow sound somewhat reminiscent of James Taylor's. 
</P>
<P>
 On previous albums, Wilcox, who will play today and Saturday at the 
Troubadour, examined such darker issues as his fear of commitment, but his 
recent marriage and the birth of his son seem to have changed his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 During "New World," the first single from "Big Horizon," Wilcox sings, "The 
ocean of my loneliness / Has carried me to land." This line and the lyrics to 
such songs as "Block Dog" and "Show the Way" seem to mark the 36-year-old 
singer's path from Angst -filled seeker to happy family man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it's time for the harvest," Wilcox says in a soft, relaxed voice 
during an interview in an A&M conference room. "I had my records of delving 
into the depths of this and that. I think it's great to offer up solutions as 
well as questions. I think I've had the time to come to some peace, to come to 
some vision of what my life means." 
</P>
<P>
 Though much of "Big Horizon" concerns Wilcox's successful search for 
contentment, it's hardly a simplistic "feel-good" album. "That's What the 
Lonely Is For" is about the singer's past feelings of emptiness, and Wilcox 
examines dark temptations on "Please Don't Call" and "Strong Chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Michelli, host of the nationally syndicated radio psychology show 
"Wishing You Well," thought highly of Wilcox's willingness to explore his 
emotions, and the singer appeared on his show to discuss some of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks (my music) is really steering people straight," Wilcox says. "I 
think he was saying that I don't tend to distort things emotionally. I will 
give the complexity of the emotion instead of just trying to make a simple 'I 
love you' sort of song." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox never lets this psychological validation or his desire to be meaningful 
get in the way of a good song though, and "Big Horizon" is as full of 
insightful lyrics as it is well-crafted pop. His music can be complex, using 
alternate tunings and jazzy inflections, but it's also catchy and inviting, 
even on "Strong Chemistry," which compares an obsessive love affair to an 
addictive drug. "The lyrics are tough, but the guitar sound sort of gives me 
permission to say what I need to say," Wilcox says.  
</P>
<P>
 He developed that guitar sound at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, 
teaching himself to play Joni Mitchell songs before learning simpler folk 
songs. After traveling, working a series of jobs and going back to school, he 
settled in Asheville, N.C., where he performed in bars and clubs, playing a 
wider area as he "got more and more reliable vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox released his first album on an independent label and was signed to A&M 
after a talent scout saw him at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe. His first A&M album, 
1989's "How Did You Find Me Here," went on to sell more than 100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Horizon," Wilcox's third album for the company, was released in early 
February and is already approaching the 100,000 mark, according to A&M. "New 
World" scored big on adult alternative radio, and A&M recently released a 
second single from the album, Wilcox's contemplative cover of the Four Tops' 
"It's the Same Old Song." 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seems to have fazed Wilcox, who still lives in Asheville, 
mountain biking and spending time with his family when he's not on tour. "I'm 
trying to stay sane, stay focused, stay humble and stay enthusiastic about 
life," Wilcox says calmly. "Life can be really good right now, in the middle of 
all this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * David Wilcox will play concerts at 7:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. today and Saturday 
at the Troubadour, 9081 Santa Monica Blvd. Tickets are $18, and are available 
at Ticketmaster outlets and from Ticketmaster by phone at (213) 480-3232.

GROWN-UP BUT STILL DOWN-HOME IN CLAY COUNTRY; POP MUSIC: WALKER, A HUMBLE YOUNG 
TEXAN WHO OPENS FOR GEORGE STRAIT TONIGHT IN ANAHEIM, IS SEEING YEARS OF HARD 
WORK BEGIN TO PAY OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Clay Walker. It's one of those names, like Merle Haggard, like Faron Young, 
like Waylon Jennings. When a boy in Beaumont, Tex., is born with such a handle, 
it's almost as though a career in country music has been preordained. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walker -- who opens for George Strait tonight at the Anaheim Arena -- 
wasn't content to let destiny and a consummate country cognomen take the reins 
of his fate. At 24, he has been working hard at his singing and songwriting 
since he was a teen-ager, and the rewards are starting to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all I've ever done, and all I ever wanted to do, really," he said 
during a recent phone interview. "I've been singing in bars since I was 17, in 
Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, then on up to to Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 His self-titled debut album, released last summer, placed him among the top 
new voices in country. Heartfelt, soulful vocals, strong material and crisp, 
radio-friendly production mark the album's sound, along with lyrics that convey 
Walker's simple, down-home values and outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy appeal of his Texas-steeped singing, engaging personality and rugged 
good looks all helped propel two singles -- "What's It to You" and "Live Until 
I Die" -- to the No. 1 position on Billboard's country charts. He has been 
touring with Strait -- a dream gig for any young country artist -- and is 
scheduled to appear on "The Tonight Show" in June. 
</P>
<P>
 For all this, he has managed to keep his feet firmly planted on the ground. 
While many of country's new breed have adopted a cocky persona more in keeping 
with a market-conscious rock 'n' roll image, the amiable, drawling Walker keeps 
an outlook that is strictly, refreshingly old school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in a rural area. My grandmother had an 84-acre tract of land 
outside the city limits. We had a farm with lots of animals. It was different 
than growing up downtown, where you might be riding a bicycle in the street and 
stuff like that. The part in 'Live Until I Die' where I talk about muddy roads 
and muddy feet -- well, I walked those muddy roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "That song is very dear to me, in fact. It's like autobiography. I think 
everybody has one point in his life when he's a child or a teen-ager that he 
wishes he could go back to, and that's mine. Those memories are very fond 
memories to me." 
</P>
<P>
 His songs also convey a vivid pop sensibility, with highly melodic hooks that 
commit themselves to memory upon first listening. Part of this, he says, is due 
to his own varied taste in music when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to a lot of George Jones (another product of Beaumont), then 
George Strait and a lot of traditional music, but I also loved listening to Bob 
Seger," he recalls. "I loved Lionel Richie too. He had a lot of influence on me 
as a writer. Listening to them made me a lot more well-rounded as far as my 
musical tastes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added, "the one thing I admire most about George Strait is that you 
can't beat the country out of his voice, and you couldn't do that to me either. 
So when George records a song, he doesn't worry whether it's too pop or too 
this or too that. And my producer, James Stroud, said the same about me -- 'No 
matter what you do, it's gonna come out country.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Walker remains confident but humble about his talents, fulfilled but grateful 
for his success at such an early age. "I don't think you can plan success," he 
said. "I believe in doing everything you possibly can to be successful, and 
then you just hope for the best. And that's what I did. I wasn't making a lot 
of money back when I was playing clubs. I was making just enough to pay the 
bills. But if I had to do that the rest of my life, I'd still die a happy 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 So now he can die an even happier person? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that's exactly right," he answered, laughing. "I look out there and 
say, 'Why me?,' and it's a wonderful feeling. Sometimes, I don't even want the 
answer. I just accept it for what it is and live every single moment, so that 
nothing passes me by." 
</P>
<P>
 * Clay Walker opens for George Strait tonight at 8 at the Anaheim Arena, 2695 
E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. $22.50. (714) 704-2500.

JAZZING UP TRIBUTE TO DUKE; SAX MAN CHARLES OWENS, WHO PLAYS WITH ELLINGTON 
BAND, WILL BRING INVIGORATING STYLE TO SYSTEM M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When saxophonist Charles Owens celebrates Duke Ellington's birthday tonight at 
System M, he'll bring more than just respect to the bandstand.  
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 years, Owens has been involved with the Ellington Orchestra 
directed by the bandleader's brother Mercer, touring the country, playing the 
charts and meeting the survivors of the most heralded jazz ensemble to ever 
appear on the planet. The bandleader was born April 29, 1899, and died in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duke Ellington invented jazz," Owens declared earlier this week in a phone 
conversation from his home in Los Angeles. "He and Louis Armstrong are the guys 
who set the whole thing up for us today. All of the great arrangers had to go 
through Duke to get their own voicings. Gil Evans, (Thelonious) Monk, (Charles) 
Mingus were all inspired to arrange music because of Duke. If you listen, you 
can hear little things here and there that they got from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he never worked with the orchestra while Ellington was alive, Owens, 
who turns 55 on Wednesday, recalls seeing the band as a fourth-grader in his 
hometown of San Diego. He credits that concert with steering him toward a 
career as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Harry Carney getting up on clarinet and playing this incredible 
circular breathing passage (a technique that allows a phrase to continue 
without a break for breath). And I thought, 'That's what I want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I began playing with Mercer, it took me a while to become sophisticated 
enough to dig Duke's music. There were so many subtle voices that it went by 
me. I remember when I first joined the band and looked at the chart I was 
supposed to play, I thought, 'This isn't going to work, it's pitched too high.' 
But once I played it with the band, it all fell together perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens' association with Mercer Ellington and the orchestra began in 1983, when 
the group was in Los Angeles for the Schubert's production of "Sophisticated 
Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 "They needed a sub on tenor and all the top guys -- Marshall Royal, Jackie 
Kelso, Herman Riley -- were working," he said, laughing modestly. "So they 
hired me. I have to tell it like it was, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the modesty disappears.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd learned the stuff, the band was hot, and one night, I got a five-minute 
ovation after soloing on 'Cottontail.' I'd put in quotes from all these other 
Ellington tunes and it really went over. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got back to the East Coast, Mercer called and said: 'What would it 
take to get you to come back and play some gigs with us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Owens jumped at the chance. The job led to his inclusion on the all-star 
recording session "Digital Duke" (GRP), which won a Grammy in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was colder than a well digger's foot when we recorded that in New York," 
recalled Owens, who played baritone, clarinet and bass clarinet on the date, 
which included such notables as saxophonist Branford Marsalis, trumpeters Clark 
Terry and Lew Soloff, clarinetist Eddie Daniels and pianist Roland Hanna. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if Duke's spirit came into the hall when we played. It was a very 
special, very reverent session, the kind of thing that makes a person want to 
leave some kind of mark of their own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Owens has made his mark with a number of bands over the years. After leaving 
the service in the mid-'60s, he traveled to Boston, where he studied his craft 
with at the Berklee College of Music with Joe Viola. In 1967, he joined the 
Buddy Rich band, and is heard on Rich's album "Mercy, Mercy," for which he 
arranged the pop lament "Ode to Billy Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 He left Rich after two years to join percussionist Mongo Santamaria's band, 
replacing saxophonist-flutist Hadley Caliman. Tiring of the road, he began to 
study oboe, clarinet and flute so that he could come to Los Angeles and "make a 
million as a studio musician." 
</P>
<P>
 During the '70s and '80s, Owens was one of the most visible reed men on the 
scene, adding his invigorating style to the bands of trumpeters Gerald Wilson 
and Bobby Bryant, singer Lorez Alexandria, pianist Horace Tapscott and the late 
composer-clarinetist John Carter. He also recorded a pair of respected albums 
with flutist-composer James Newton (now a UC Irvine instructor). 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Owens also spent time with the bands of John Mayall and Frank 
Zappa. He recorded a live album with Mayall at the Whiskey in Los Angeles that 
was never released, and when the bluesman asked him to go on the road, he 
turned the job down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That might have been a mistake," he said. "The pay was great, but his music 
was too dumb. If it wasn't hip, I wasn't going for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zappa's music was a different story.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was the 'Grand Wazoo' period. Frank's music was hip, it was hard. I could 
barely hang in the band. We played England for a week, and some other places. 
The group was happening, everything was electrified: saxes, trumpets, even 
marimbas and congas." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens was lured to Las Vegas in the late '80s to play in the house band at 
Caesar's Palace, where he backed stars ranging from Natalie Cole to George 
Burns. But he found the work largely unsatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good experience, but it was just too comfortable. Anytime you get 
satisfied, you lose your edge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Owens works and records with a number of West Coast bands, including 
the Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra and Jimmie and Jeannie Cheatham's Sweet Baby 
Blues Band. But his most satisfying work has been with Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mercer treats all the musicians like kings. You get good treatment, the money 
is good and you get to play all that good Ellington music. It's simply heaven 
for a musician." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, who will work with drummer Donald Dean and bassist Louis (Rather) Large 
at System M, says he will concentrate on the Ellington-Billy Strayhorn songbook 
for the Ellington homage.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the good thing about tributes," he said. "It opens you up to new 
music. I'll do a lot of the better-known tunes -- 'Cottontail,' 'Come Sunday,' 
'A-Train,' 'Lush Life' -- and probably a little calypso I wrote called 'For 
Duke.' One thing I can guarantee: It'll be smokin'." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Charles Owens Trio, with drummer Donald Dean and bassist Louis Large, 
plays at 9 and 11 tonight at System M, 213A Pine Ave., Long Beach. $5. Call 
(310) 435-2525.

LAPD REPORTS IDENTIFY CITY'S CRIME HOT SPOTS; POLICE: UNRELEASED DOCUMENTS FROM 
18 DIVISIONS INCLUDE STRATEGIES FOR FIGHTING SERIOUS PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still-unreleased reports compiled by the Los Angeles Police Department 
identify dozens of pockets of violent crime in the city and recommend an array 
of suggestions for cleaning up those problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports, reviewed Thursday by The Times, draw heavily on crime statistics 
for violent felonies such as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. 
Using the crime data and other information, most of it from the public record, 
the reports identify a number of "hot target" reporting districts, communities 
where police are combatting particularly serious problems, and they rank those 
districts by the various violent crimes committed in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports from the LAPD's 18 police stations vary widely in content and 
form. Some go into great detail about the possible causes of crime, while 
others, such as one submitted by the LAPD's West Los Angeles station, are 
extremely brief. The suggestions for action also cover a range of proposals, 
from increasing patrols in certain communities to building closer ties to 
neighborhoods so they can better protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has said it will release the reports next week after editing them to 
remove sensitive information such as details about proposed officer deployment. 
The 18 reports reviewed by The Times on Thursday were unedited. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings from those reports: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although crime in many San Fernando Valley neighborhoods is down since last 
year, homicides remain a stubborn problem, and some communities are afflicted 
by an array of other ills. Several corridors, including three in Devonshire and 
one in the Foothill Division, account for a large portion of the Valley's 
violent crime, the reports say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Commanders in the department's 77th Street station, responsible for some of 
the city's most violent neighborhoods, reported progress in most areas, but 
acknowledged that homicides are on the rise and expressed frustration about 
their inability to combat certain kinds of crime. "The number of arrests for 
rape seems to have no impact on the number of crimes committed," the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 * In that Wilshire Division, officials found that most of the division's 59 
homicides were the result of robberies, and the second-leading motive was 
gang-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Newton Division, another hotbed of violent crime, officials 
identified three major corridors of violence -- along Vernon, Broadway and 
Central avenues -- and noted that four of their "hot reporting districts" have 
been stubbornly resistant to previous efforts to root out violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD report from the Valley's Devonshire Division is typical of the 
documents, which were prepared late last year and submitted to Assistant Chief 
Bernard C. Parks, who heads the Police Department's Operations Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 In that report, Devonshire officials cite three problem areas: the community 
surrounding the Northridge Mall, another along Roscoe Boulevard and a third, 
which department officials call the "Sepulveda Corridor," a long stretch of 
land near the police division's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is inundated with prostitution activity, narcotics trafficking and 
gang-related activity," officials say in their analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanders from Devonshire recommended 11 strategies for combatting the crime 
in those three areas. They range from traditional police responses -- deploying 
additional patrol officers, detectives and vice officers -- to suggesting ways 
for engaging the community more actively in fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parks received all 18 reports earlier this year but was dissatisfied with 
some. As a result, he returned the documents to each of the city's police 
stations, asking them to review their findings and submit revised copies to him 
next month. Some of those reports have been completed and go beyond ranking 
communities according to each type of crime to prioritizing the most violent 
neighborhoods in each of the 18 areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LAPD officials have pledged to release the first round of reports 
next week, they said Wednesday that they will edit the documents to ensure that 
no information is made public that might jeopardize public safety or that would 
invade privacy rights of anyone mentioned in the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. David J. Gascon, a department spokesman, declined to comment in detail 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of evaluating the reports," he said. "And we're in the 
process of living up to our promise to release them once they've been 
redacted." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials are particularly sensitive about information contained in 
the documents that might be of use to criminals or that might jeopardize police 
officers. In a number of places, the reports have recommended that special 
patrols be deployed in certain areas at certain times of day. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that type of information, Gascon said, that might jeopardize the Police 
Department's ability to fight crime. Many of the reports also list addresses 
where crimes have occurred. That information is likely to be deleted in order 
to protect crime victims, Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reports include detailed demographic information about the race, 
gender, age and other characteristics of suspects arrested by the Police 
Department. In the Newton Division, for instance, officials report that 53% of 
all violent crimes were committed by black males. Women represented only 1% of 
total suspects. More than eight out of 10 violent crime suspects were 30 or 
younger, the report adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some City Council members have expressed concern about the LAPD 
targeting people based on their race, none of the reports reviewed by The Times 
recommends taking special action against suspects of particular ethnicity or 
based on other demographic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The study of violent crime in Los Angeles is being funded by a federal grant, 
and that has given officials the ability to analyze extremely detailed 
information about crime inside the city.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Foothill Division officials identified a stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard 
from San Fernando Road to Foothill Boulevard as "a major source of violent 
crime in Foothill Area. The high concentration of low-income housing complexes, 
gangs and narcotics activities are contributing factors." 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Valley, officials identified five problem areas and proposed 
solutions for each. The problems they highlighted were street robberies in 
Canoga Park and Encino, homicides in Canoga Park, rapes in Canoga Park and 
aggravated assaults in the north end of the West Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the study, officers theorized as to the cause of those crime 
concentrations. They attributed the spate of aggravated assaults to 
concentrations of gangs near the intersection of Sherman Way and Reseda 
Boulevard. "Also, there are a variety of problem (liquor stores) in this area, 
which may be a contributing factor," the report from West Valley adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime problems in the Valley, however, pale compared to those reported 
from some of the Police Department's other divisions. In the Pacific Division, 
not one of the city's most violent, officers reported a continuing problem with 
aggravated assaults in districts near the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aggravated assaults are largely due to the hot weather and alcohol 
consumption that is readily available in this area," the document states. 
</P>
<P>
 In Central and South Los Angeles, meanwhile, gangs remain a dominant theme in 
the reports, as does the shortage of police resources to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rampart Area's workload . . . is so heavy that it causes the Patrol Division 
to be primarily reactive rather than proactive," the report from that police 
station states.

MOVE OVER, MICHELANGELO; PAINTER, CREW RISE TO GREAT HEIGHTS TO RESTORE FRIEZE 
ON CEILING OF CITY HALL LOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Nicoletti may be the only worker at City Hall whom everybody looks up to. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because he's not a politician, a lobbyist or a bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a painter who is helping to launch an ambitious, $10-million City Hall 
renovation project by restoring a frieze painted 67 years ago on the Main 
Street lobby ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Working at night atop 12-foot-high scaffolding, Nicoletti and a handful of 
assistants have scrubbed away a thick layer of cigar and cigarette smoke and "a 
disgusting buildup of starch" that was used to seal decorative Greco-Roman 
stenciling. 
</P>
<P>
 They work standing up, enamel running down their arms and dripping into their 
faces and hair as they repaint the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our backs are killing us. We can't wait for the job to end," said Nicoletti, 
32, of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget Michelangelo -- we tried lying on our backs like he did at the Sistine 
Chapel, but that was a real hassle. Sometimes we wear little neck braces. I've 
got a back strain. I bought a back brace the other day." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling work is the first phase of Project Restore, a refurbishing effort 
planned since 1987 to return City Hall to its Depression-era glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicoletti won the $126,587 painting contract in September, 1991. But red tape 
and a seismic repair project in the lobby delayed the start of work until two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When City Hall was first built they approved the plans, poured the 
foundation, erected steel and had the whole thing ready to occupy in a year and 
a half," Nicoletti said. "It took me 2 1/2 years just to start my little 
painting project." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Nicoletti won his contract by outbidding the son of the original 
frieze painter. Anthony T. Heinsbergen of Los Angeles said he was irritated at 
first at not being chosen to follow in his father's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd dug up the original sketches. It would have been logical for me to do 
it," Heinsbergen said. "But Joe's certainly capable. I have high regard for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also pleased with the paint job, said Georgia Rosenberry, 
president of Project Restore. Her group plans to tackle decorative painting and 
tile work on the City Hall's third floor -- where its famed rotunda is 
frequently used as a backdrop for movies and TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done a good job in matching what was done back in the late '20s," she 
said. "That whole lobby area's going to come alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby certainly comes to life when Nicoletti and his painters roll their 
scaffolding into place. They turn on floodlights and work to the beat of a 
boombox blasting tunes by Ella Fitzgerald and the Gypsy Kings. They make 
certain that City Hall guards stationed below them stand clear of the 
paint-drip zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting usually is done from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On Thursdays, though, the 
crew knocks off early. 
</P>
<P>
 "That night we try to go to some historical spot like the Biltmore," Nicoletti 
said. "We peruse the decorative painting there -- with a drink in our hands, of 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 Night life outside City Hall is often a sight to behold too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we see people getting arrested right outside the door at night, 
we feel good about contributing to the core of the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his strained back, Nicoletti has no plans to file a disability claim. 
"You can't fight City Hall," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceiling artistry aside, some officials would say that attitude alone puts him 
head and shoulders above a lot of people.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH BAY; REMOVAL OF 
DDT-TAINTED SOIL IN BACK YARDS BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of delays, workers began removing DDT-contaminated soil on 
Thursday from two back yards near Torrance in a project ordered by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 residents living close to the site have been moved to hotels at 
federal expense until the $350,000 project is completed in two weeks.That makes 
it one of the largest temporary relocations conducted by the EPA's four-state 
western regional office, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency announced the cleanup in March after its testing found unusually 
high levels of DDT in soil behind two homes on West 204th Street between 
Normandie and New Hampshire avenues. Federal experts remain mystified about the 
source of the DDT, which was detected at levels as much as 45 times above what 
is considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was to have begun more than three weeks ago, but residents 
protested cleanup plans and persuaded the EPA to expand the number of families 
to be relocated.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL SAYS LAPD 
EXPANSION IS NOT ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Council members reviewing Mayor Richard Riordan's budget said 
Thursday that an expansion of the police force will not be enough to fight 
crime and they will consider increasing hours of operation at parks and 
recreation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky made the proposal at hearings Thursday, during 
which he also suggested that the state help pay for programs it requires, such 
as refuse recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Budget and Finance Committee, which Yaroslavsky chairs, is 
scheduled to vote next month on the $4.3-billion budget that Riordan presented. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan tilts heavily toward the Police Department, suggesting an addition 
of 450 officers in the fiscal year beginning July 1. It also promises to exempt 
parks and libraries from a continued hiring freeze that will shrink most other 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a hiring freeze continuing through July 1 even for parks, the mayor's 
budget shows that service already will have been reduced from 38 hours a week 
to 25 hours at 35 recreation centers. Attrition also will mean that restrooms 
are cleaned less often -- six days a week instead of seven -- and lawns mowed 
less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said those reductions should be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our crime-fighting strategy has to be two-pronged," he said. "We have to have 
more police, but we have to have positive, constructive programs in the parks 
and elsewhere to give kids alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alatorre also supported attempts to restore park staffing 
to the levels of July 1, 1993, to stave off the service reductions. The 
lawmakers asked for a report on how much it would cost to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
 In another action, the Budget and Finance Committee asked for research into 
the question of how the city can force the state to provide more funding for 
programs that it requires. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was inspired by Gov. Pete Wilson's own demand this week that the 
federal government pay the state for the costs of supplying services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said tens of millions of dollars could be obtained by the city if 
the state fully paid for the programs, including providing workers' 
compensation. JAMES RAINEY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HOMICIDE 
VICTIM IDENTIFIED AFTER HUNT FOR FAMILY FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county coroner's office took the unusual step Thursday of identifying a 
homicide victim before notification of relatives because his family could not 
be located. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Freddie Chavez, 16, was found about 9 a.m. April 8 on North Hicks 
Street in East Los Angeles, said coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier.The 
teen-ager had been shot and stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office normally does not release names of victims until 
relatives have been notified, but in this case family could not be found and no 
one has claimed the body, Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez had recently been arrested in San Bernardino County, but no relatives 
were listed on his official paperwork there, Carrier said. Chavez was described 
as 5 feet, 7 inches, 150 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair. He had the 
word "Vicke" tattooed on his upper right arm and "Blanca" on his inner right 
forearm. There were other tattoos on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office also was seeking the identity of a woman who died of a 
head injury at a hospital after being found at the Santa Monica Pier. She was 
described as either Hispanic or Native American, 4 feet, 11 inches, 135 pounds, 
about 45 years old, with brown eyes and salt-and-pepper hair. She was possibly 
a transient.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SLOW PACE 
OF IMPROVEMENTS IN POLICE TRAINING ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles Police Commission complained this week to Police 
Department officials about the slow pace of improvements in Police Department 
training programs on a variety of topics, including sexual harassment and 
cultural sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little frustrating to see that some of these things are still somewhat 
amorphous," said Gary Greenebaum, president of the commission."We need to see 
it sooner, rather than later." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping improvements in training were recommended by the Christopher 
Commission in 1991, but the department still has not implemented a large number 
of those recommendations. Although department officials say the holdups have 
mainly been the result of funding and staff shortages, police commissioners 
noted that the LAPD successfully trained thousands of officers in riot 
techniques because the department considered that training to be desperately 
needed. A similar effort needs to be undertaken with respect to other types of 
training, police commissioners said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends how you define a crisis," Greenebaum said. "What I think members 
of the commission are saying is that we're in a crisis situation with this type 
of training as well."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
STATE ALLOCATES $11.8 MILLION TO IMPROVE SIMI FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission allocated $11.8 million this week to 
widen portions of the Simi Valley Freeway and install car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway will be widened in both directions from just west of the border of 
Los Angeles and Ventura counties to the Golden State Freeway.The project will 
include adding two mixed-flow lanes, two car-pool lanes and two park-and-ride 
lots (one near the San Diego Freeway and another at Winnetka Avenue in the San 
Fernando Valley). The car-pool lanes, stretching 12 miles, will be reserved for 
vehicles carrying two or more people. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin in December and be completed by the end of 
1996. The total cost of the work is $27 million, with the Los Angeles County 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority contributing $15.7 million. Currently, 
there are 65 miles of car-pool lanes in Los Angeles County, a network that 
Caltrans officials plan to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 The car-pool program "is designed to significantly increase the capacity of 
the freeway system in a relatively short time and at minimal cost," said Jerry 
Baxter, director of the local Caltrans district.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN GETS 
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR CABBY'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Inglewood man was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole 
this week for robbing and killing a cabby -- a murder that led to a Los Angeles 
ordinance requiring installation of bulletproof glass in taxis.  
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Eugene Redman, 23, displayed no emotion when Superior Court Judge 
Florence-Marie Cooper sentenced him, then told him, "Good luck to you, Mr. 
Redman."Redman was convicted in January of shooting Titus Imaku twice in the 
head on May 1, 1991, and dumping his body in a Los Angeles alley.  
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Nigerian national and father of two had been moonlighting as a 
cabby for Taxi Systems of Long Beach while studying engineering at Cal State 
Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 His murder prompted the Los Angeles City Council to approve an ordinance 
requiring bulletproof glass between the front and back seats of cabs. The 
prosecutor said Imaku's widow lobbied for the law both at the city and state 
levels. Redman's lawyer, Mark Borden, said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The special circumstance allegation that led to the life without parole 
sentence was that the murder was committed during a robbery. Borden said he 
hopes to get the conviction reduced to first-degree murder, which would allow 
parole.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BAIL SET 
FOR MAN BELIEVED FALSELY CONVICTED OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Thursday ordered bail set for a 28-year-old Compton man who 
has served eight years in prison for second-degree murder, a crime to which the 
man's brother has confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Sanders, who is serving a term of 17 years to life in Soledad State 
Prison, should be released either today or Monday in lieu of a $50,000 surety 
put up by his parents, attorney Rowan Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Sanders' release, 
saying there were strong signs that he is not guilty and had received 
incompetent legal assistance. Sanders' brother, Xavier, had confessed to family 
members and to an attorney representing Sheldon Sanders, but his statement was 
never used in court. 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy district attorney told the court on Thursday that the district 
attorney's office intends to retry Sheldon Sanders.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING TRIAL 
POSTPONED AFTER ATTORNEY IS HOSPITALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies postponed Rodney G. King's lawsuit trial 
until Monday after an attorney for one of the defendants was rushed to a 
hospital after possibly suffering a minor stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Greg Peterson, who represents former officer Theodore J. Briseno, was 
taken to an undisclosed hospital where he was undergoing tests for an apparent 
minor stroke, an associate said.Briseno was not in court at the time because of 
a death in his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Davies ruled that Sgt. Mark Conta, a Los Angeles Police 
Department use-of-force expert subpoenaed by King's attorneys, must testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Conta is suffering from "situational depression," according to a diagnosis by 
Debra Glaser, who heads psychiatric services for the Police Department. She 
told the court on Wednesday that if Conta is forced to testify, he could suffer 
a psychological breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is in a second phase to determine if King should be awarded punitive 
damages from 15 current and former Los Angeles police officers. King already 
has been awarded $3.8 million in damages from the city in the March 3, 1991, 
beating.

COUNCIL PANEL OKS LOBBYING REVISIONS; ETHICS: COMMITTEE AGREES TO CHANGES IN 
LAW REGULATING CONTACT WITH CITY OFFICIALS. NEIGHBORHOOD AND SMALL NONPROFIT 
GROUPS WOULD BE EXEMPTED, BUT FULLER DISCLOSURE WOULD BE REQUIRED OF LAWYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-delayed revision of a law regulating lobbyists at Los Angeles City Hall 
moved out of a City Council committee on Thursday, with provisions designed to 
make more lawyers reveal their official contacts with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Rules and Elections Committee agreed to allow substantial 
amendments to the 27-year-old law so that neighborhood organizations and small 
nonprofit groups generally would be freed from reporting lobbying efforts; most 
professional lobbyists would still be required to file quarterly reports. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council next month, the changes would reduce by about half 
the number of people reporting their contacts at City Hall, while attempting to 
more fully reveal the lobbying activities of lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many attorneys have refused to report lobbying activities and the amounts they 
were paid, as required under the ethics law. The lawyers, such as former City 
Councilman Art Snyder, contend that such reports would violate their private 
relationships with clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments approved by the council committee seek to obtain fuller 
disclosure of lobbying by attorneys by requiring that they and their clients 
file quarterly reports with the city Ethics Commission. Currently, the clients 
are not required to file. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has used the reports to make detailed analyses of City Hall 
issues. In reports released four times a year, the commission then describes 
how much companies and special-interest groups have paid to influence 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere emergence of the ordinance from the committee, where it had been 
bottled up for more than a year, was considered an important development by 
members of the city's Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major step forward," said Ed Guthman, an ethics commissioner. "It's 
going to free up a lot of people (from reporting) who didn't get paid anything 
or who made just a couple of visits to City Hall. And it's going to focus on 
the powerful, highly paid lobbyists." 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments approved by the committee also would, for the first time, 
permit the Ethics Commission to conduct audits when it believes that lobbying 
reports are inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council committee recommended watering down two other provisions of 
the law that had been proposed by the ethics panel. Council and committee 
members Richard Alatorre and John Ferraro recommended that lobbyists only be 
required to file reports if they are paid more than $4,000 a quarter for their 
work. The Ethics Commission had suggested that the threshold be set lower, at 
more than $3,000 a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's proposed threshold would have allowed several well-known 
lobbyists -- including former City Atty. Burt Pines and former Deputy Mayor Tom 
Houston -- to avoid filing reports in the most recent quarter, according to 
Ethics Commission staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also rejected an Ethics Commission recommendation that lobbyists 
be required to report when they give elected officials tickets to charitable 
and other events. The Ethics Commission said tickets can be used to gain access 
and influence but council members said such gifts are inconsequential.

YORBA LINDA CATCHES BREATH AND TIDIES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Now that all the famous politicians and foreign dignitaries have rolled away 
in their stretch limousines, this leafy bedroom community on Thursday caught 
its breath, reflecting on the historic event that brought upon it world 
attention -- and a few headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for 41 years, and this is the most commotion I've ever seen. 
But it was real wonderful. A once-in-a-lifetime experience," said Jennie Fae 
Sprague, 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of her wood-frame home two blocks from the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace, Sprague said visitors, journalists, police and 
stern-looking Secret Service agents filled the streets on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were parked everywhere. Someone took my spot just like today," she 
said, pointing to a car in front of her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilted flowers, coffee cups, empty soda cans, half-eaten doughnuts and other 
debris covered Yorba Linda Boulevard and side streets near the library. But 
city officials said the cleanup effort was simple, requiring a 12-member 
cleaning crew about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really hasn't been that bad," said David Gruchow, the assistant city 
manager. "Nobody predicted the size of the crowds, nor which direction the line 
would go, but it wasn't too difficult to clean up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruchow said city crews spent a few hours removing street barricades, detour 
signs and orange cones to reopen Yorba Linda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Lanzi, 27, was happy about the road clearing and the end of intense 
security around the library. 
</P>
<P>
 While the increased security measures were in effect, "it took me about 30 
minutes to get to my house from Imperial Highway," said Lanzi, a computer 
programmer. Usually it takes less than a minute, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanzi, whose back yard borders the backside of the library, said many curious 
visitors tried to sneak into his back yard for a better view of the funeral 
services. Some even tried jumping onto his neighbors roofs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a people person, so the crowds didn't really bother me all that much. 
Some people around here were pretty upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of Yorba Lindans definitely not upset by the visiting masses was 
local business. Mihn Huyna, the owner of Station Donut, said she sold more 
coffee and doughnuts in two days than she does in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very many people wanted coffee. It was cold outside. The line went from here 
to the parking lot outside," Huyna said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest beneficiary of the sudden infusion of cash and people seemed to be 
nearby Yorba Linda Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sold everything from single roses to a $700 bouquet ordered by Van 
Cliburn," said employee Rhonda Boyd, 34. Around the clock, Nixon well-wishers 
purchased flowers to lay at the Nixon memorial, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notables such as former President Gerald Ford, the Emperor of Japan and the 
King of Norway had flowers ordered through the small shop, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, as this city of 57,000 returned to normalcy in appearance, Yorba 
Linda's soul and perception of itself had been forever changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think from now on, we will be the memorial for Richard Nixon," said Mayor 
Barbara Kiley. "That will be a very serious responsibility that every single 
mayor and council member in the future will carry."

A POSTSCRIPT AFTER THE FINAL CHAPTER; REMINISCENCE: RICHARD NIXON'S BROTHER AND 
COUSIN MEET AT HIS GRAVE AND RECALL TIMES LONG AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They came by the thousands Thursday to admire the flower arrangements, 
inscribe comments of grief and appreciation in the guest book, and stand at 
Richard Nixon's freshly sodded grave the day after he was laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who came to grieve for the 37th President as the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace reopened for the first time since Nixon's death knew only his public 
face and spoke quietly of the inspiration he brought them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it would be nice to pay my respects," said Jan Pitts, who was 
visiting from Hawaii and watched as workers placed the gravestone and sod on 
Nixon's resting place just before the library opened its doors about 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Others came to experience a more private grief. The former President's brother 
Edward, 63, the lone survivor of the five Nixon boys, arrived about 11 a.m. to 
startled cries of recognition and a few backslaps from the line of visitors 
snaking through the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 After an emotional embrace with his daughter at the grave, Nixon turned to 
find Charles Milhous, 82, a first cousin of the Nixons who lives in Turlock and 
took his first-ever tour of the library Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing his arm around Milhous, Nixon guided him up to the attic of the 
family's former home, a small clapboard farmhouse, to talk away from the public 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles, you've slept in the attic. Come on up with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milhous, who attended Wednesday's funeral services with his family, reminisced 
about his childhood years with Richard Nixon -- playing football, 
skinny-dipping on a summer outing near Lancaster, and working in the Nixon 
family's Whittier store when Richard went off to Duke University law school. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised the outpouring of public support for his cousin, younger by a year 
and a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Watergate, I got to thinking that would be the final thing that was 
remembered," said Milhous, a retired machinist and custodian who sported a 
windbreaker and straw hat. "I thought they gave him a great honor. Even 
President Clinton gave him credit." 
</P>
<P>
 He fondly remembered the time a dog gave him a vicious bite on the arm and 
Nixon, then practicing law in La Habra, jokingly encouraged him to sue. Milhous 
said his only criticism of his cousin was his free use of profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first hours after the reopening Thursday, more than a thousand people 
filed through the library and birthplace, snapping pictures, videotaping the 
condolence wreaths sent by governments from Poland to Morocco and shedding 
tears in remembrance of a man many said they always stood by. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands more continued coming throughout the day, a library volunteer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Debiase, 50, of Playa del Rey, clutched a single rose as an offering to 
"the most forceful and toughest President we had." Sally Lemmon of Murietta 
came with a bouquet of white and purple flowers, courtesy of her neighbors' 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw me out there clipping," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ursula Butz, 56, of Garden Grove, and Elfriede Friesenhan, 57, of Fountain 
Valley, wandered through the grounds in search of the wreath sent by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Butz, who had saved her final photo for the wreath, said she agreed 
wholeheartedly with the inscription on Nixon's gravestone: 'The greatest honor 
history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a peacemaker. He has had tremendous guts, even when he was 
maligned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass roots support visible in the mix of visitors of all ages and 
ethnicities even appeared to be working some magic on Nixon skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed, and I've changed my mind now on Nixon totally," said Mary 
Dobashi, 42, who lives right near the library. "He really wasn't such a bad 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many emerged from the library carrying the tell-tale green shopping bags from 
the library bookstore, which was swamped with visitors throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rockman, 40, of Upland, bought an 8-by-10 inch photograph of Nixon that 
he plans to frame, a ruler decorated with pictures of famous Nixon moments, and 
a copy of a 1991 speech Nixon gave on foreign policy, dubbed "A War About 
Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always brought up to kind of champion the underdog. . . . I was a Nixon 
supporter even in the days when he didn't have many," Rockman said. "He was one 
of us, one of the American people."  
</P>
<P>
 Others, whose lives had brushed even briefly with Nixon and his family, 
concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows you can come from a humble beginning and rise up," Adeline 
Aldrich-Linn, 79, said after walking through the clapboard house that Nixon's 
father had built from a kit. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich-Linn remembers those beginnings. She attended Whittier High School 
with Nixon, whom she remembered as a shy and gentle student and an ace orator 
who had signed her yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Irion, 67, a Montana delegate to the 1960 Republican National 
Convention, remembered how Nixon arranged to be photographed with each and 
every delegate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wearing a big straw hat, and he said, 'Your hat is lovely. It has a 
very attractive effect on a short lady,' " said Irion, now of Tarzana. "I 
thought that was a rather personal remark. He was a unique person. I had 
suspected there were lot more people who supported him than ever were heard 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 But as supporters took in the signs of love and support for Nixon, many had 
one regret. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate that Nixon didn't know how people felt, that the 
silent majority waited this long to speak up," said Elaine Graydon, 57, who 
flew from San Antonio to pay her respects.

POLICE LOOK FOR LINK TO FATAL ANAHEIM SHOOTINGS; VIOLENCE: TWO MEN ARE KILLED 
AND TWO OTHERS WOUNDED IN SEPARATE ATTACKS WITHIN MINUTES AND A FEW BLOCKS OF

<P>
 Police are looking for any connection between four men who were shot, two 
fatally, within 10 minutes and a few blocks of each other Wednesday night, 
including a teen-age boxer who once placed second in a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to figure this whole thing out," said police Sgt. Steve 
Rodig. "There's nothing to connect them through physical evidence, but because 
of the time and the close proximity, we are looking into the possibility that 
they are related." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have made no arrests and don't know the motive for either shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The first shooting occurred just after 8 p.m. in front of an apartment complex 
in the 1500 block of Palm Avenue and was witnessed by several residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard shots in the distance, looked out the door and saw about seven 
people running down the alley," said Bill Bangert, 70, manager of the complex. 
"We heard someone say, 'Don't! Don't!' Then we heard bang, bang. The (gunman) 
started to run, then he turned around and fired another shot. I guess he 
figured he didn't kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Flores, 19, was found a short distance away lying in the street. He had 
been shot in the torso.  
</P>
<P>
 "We ran out to him and he was begging us to call his grandmother," Bangert 
said. "We brought a blanket out to him and waited for the police to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores was in stable condition Thursday at an undisclosed local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man shot in that gunfire, Fred Leglar, 21, of Anaheim ran to his 
girlfriend's apartment in that complex, where he collapsed and died. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 minutes later and a few blocks away, in the 1500 block of Crone 
Street, police responded to more reports of gunfire. Officers found no victims 
there, but a few blocks away, in the 800 block of Aspen Street, they found two 
wounded men in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men, 19-year-old Jose Aguirre, had been shot in the head and died 
at the hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had just gone on out to buy hamburgers and he got shot in the head," said 
the victim's father, Luis Aguirre, 40, who worked with his son at the 
Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to be a mistake," the father added. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre's friend, 20-year-old Isaac Torres, was driving the car and was shot 
in the upper torso. He is in stable condition at an undisclosed hospital, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Aguirre, a 1993 graduate of Anaheim High School, was a promising boxer 
who had won 27 of 30 bouts during a successful junior career. His record 
included a runner-up finish at the 1991 Silver Gloves National Championships in 
Des Moines, Iowa, and a quarterfinal finish in the 1991 Junior Olympic 
Championships, said Rip Icenhower, the trainer who worked with Aguirre at the 
Anaheim Boxing Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had heart," Icenhower said. "He was such a beautiful kid. I loved him like 
a son. I thought he was safe. He had graduated from high school, he was 
working. When the hell is this violence going to stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Officer Lou Lopez, a 25-year member of the force, served as a 
trainer and a mentor to Aguirre at the boxing club. The officer said the 
teen-ager was considering going into professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had fought all over the United States," said Lopez, a member of the 
Anaheim Union School District Board of Education. "He was one of those kids who 
really had the potential to really get involved with gangs, but the boxing gave 
him the opportunity to travel around and to see that everything did not revolve 
around his homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodig said Aguirre was not a known gang member and that his death may have 
been a case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the Aguirre family had moved into their first home only two years 
ago after living in an apartment in Anaheim's crime-ridden Jeffrey-Lynne 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "His father worked so hard to buy that house and his parents were real 
supportive," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, family members and friends gathered in front of the slain 
teen-ager's home to grieve.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever took him out was wrong," said the victim's 17-year-old brother, Peter 
Aguirre, who is also an accomplished boxer. "My brother was one of those guys 
who shouldn't have died." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the family needs help in paying for Aguirre's funeral and is asking 
for donations. They can be sent to the Anaheim Police Department, c/o Officer 
Lou Lopez, 425 S. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim, Calif. 92805. Checks can be made out 
to the Aguirre family.

LAGUNA CHAMBER VOTES SUPPORT FOR GAY FESTIVAL; BUSINESS: THE ACTION IS TAKEN AS 
CONCERN GROWS AND DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM 68 OF 71 PEOPLE WHO TELEPHONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With concern growing over the city's first gay and lesbian festival, which 
kicks off tonight, the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce voted Thursday to 
endorse the event. 
</P>
<P>
 With business down in Laguna Beach, the festival posed a dicey dilemma for the 
chamber's board of directors. Naturally inclined to encourage an event that 
could lure 6,000 visitors to the city, they also knew some residents feared 
that Laguna Pride Weekend might redefine Laguna Beach as a gay mecca rather 
than an art colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber office manager Jan Jurcisin said 71 people called the office about the 
festival Thursday, 68 of whom opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that helps business in Laguna Beach, we're going to be for," 
Jurcisin said before the board's vote. "But anything that will hurt the 
community as a whole, as it appears this is turning out to be, the chamber 
really needs to consider that." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Reilly, co-chairman of Laguna Outreach, a gay and lesbian group 
sponsoring the festival, reminded the chamber board Thursday of the festival's 
financial benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying as much as possible to generate people coming into the city who 
will spend money here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The chamber voted 11 to 3 to endorse the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the subject of this festival has hit a lot of hot buttons in 
town," board member Jim McBride said. He urged organizers to make sure the 
event is a well-run, positive experience for Laguna Beach. "Otherwise, you're 
going to set your own cause back centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the City Council on Tuesday night, about a dozen residents had 
railed against the festival, which will start tonight with a party at the Boom 
Boom Room, a gay bar. The festival itself will be held at the Festival of Arts 
grounds on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the concern involved activities related to the festival, including 
well-publicized parties at gay bars near Mountain Street and South Coast 
Highway. Residents there say it is a constant strain to live near the bars and 
that they dread the thought of a new wave of revelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even council members Kathleen Blackburn and Wayne L. Peterson, who had joined 
their colleagues last month in giving the council's blessing to the festival, 
were less approving Tuesday night. Both objected to the emphasis placed on, as 
a festival flyer put it, "three days of parties!" 
</P>
<P>
 Neither voiced objections to the festival itself. Peterson, in fact, is 
scheduled for duty at one of the festival exhibits for the Log Cabin Club. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council unanimously approved a temporary use permit allowing 
festival organizers to erect a large tent in a liquor store parking lot, from 
which 393 exhibitors can display their wares. Food will be served in what is 
now an unused commercial space adjacent to the Boom Boom Room. City approval is 
not needed for activities on the Festival of Arts grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly has claimed the endorsement of both the city and the chamber since last 
month when chamber board members, who did not have enough members present to 
make a quorum, voted 7 to 2 to support the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber director Joe Orsak said Thursday that he gave Reilly permission to do 
so because he intended to poll other chamber board members by telephone to get 
the one other vote needed to make the quorum. However, he was called out of 
state on a family emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Orsak said some members of the gay community also are business owners and "a 
good number of them are members of the chamber." A chamber vote for or against 
the festival has no practical effect on the weekend's activities.

COUNTY GANG KILLINGS HIT RECORD HIGH; CRIME: GANG-RELATED HOMICIDES SOARED 72% 
IN 1993, ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS. SEVENTY-FOUR WERE SLAIN LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gang-related slayings in Orange County reached an all-time high last year with 
the death of 74 people -- a 72% increase from 1992, according to an annual gang 
report released Thursday by the Orange County District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of violent gang-related crimes, including homicides, 
robberies and assaults prosecuted in the county, also set a record -- a 25% 
jump from 1992, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence parallels the growing gang population, which totals 16,866 gang 
members in 293 gangs throughout the county -- double the number of gang members 
identified by authorities in 1989, said Prosecutor Douglas Woodsmall, who 
supervises the district attorney's gang unit.  
</P>
<P>
 "1993 was tragically distinguished by an unprecedented level of gang violence 
in Orange County. . . . No community was immune to this blight," the report 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad, there's no doubt about that," said Woodsmall, who said the 
increased numbers -- of crimes linked to gang involvement and prosecution of 
those cases -- also can be traced in part to more sophisticated methods of 
tracking gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's nothing that should really be surprising, given what we see in the 
newspaper each day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's 33-page report, however, found one "one ray of hope" 
in the local battle against gangs: the program known as TARGET, or the 
Tri-Agency Resources Gang Enforcement Team, a gang-suppression program that 
dispatches prosecutors, investigators and probation officers to assist police 
in gang-troubled neighborhoods. The program singles out the most violent gang 
members for investigation and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in Westminster two years ago, the city's police department has credited 
TARGET with cutting gang-related crime in Westminster by 62% and boasted a 
near-perfect record of gang prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't deny or dispute the results that they've got there in Westminster," 
Woodsmall said. "That's the impact that we would like to have countywide." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors has agreed to spend $2 million to 
expand TARGET to six other areas, including Orange, Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Garden 
Grove and parts of South County patrolled by the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department, Woodsmall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, which has the most gang-related killings, has been slated to 
receive two of the special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, the TARGET areas are the home turf of 87.6% of the gang members 
identified by authorities, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also detailed nonviolent crime by suspected gang members. In 
response to county-wide outrage over graffiti, the district attorney's office 
gave increased priority to prosecution of people, known in gang terms as 
"taggers," who defaced property with graffiti, a status reflected in the 
figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of criminal filings against graffiti vandals rose more than any 
other group, accounting for 9% of all gang-related prosecutions in 1993, as 
compared with less than 1% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, criminal filings in gang cases -- including nonviolent crimes -- 
remained stable. Prosecutors filed 3,050 felony and misdemeanor gang-related 
charges in 1991 and 3,067 in 1993, according to the report 
</P>
<P>
 The troubling increase came in the category of violent crimes. Prosecutors 
filed charges in 465 violent felonies in 1993, compared with 372 violent 
felonies in 1992, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 34 defendants were charged with gang-related murder, compared to 77 
defendants in 1993. In some murder cases, more than one defendant was charged, 
but in the majority of slayings linked to gang involvement, no charges were 
filed for lack of sufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns were used in 92% of the gang-related slayings. So-called drive-by 
shootings and shooting from one vehicle into another vehicle were reported in 
25 of the reported murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's gang unit has stepped up efforts to identify the 
number of crimes where suspected gang members are the assailants, victims or 
both in an effort to help pinpoint gang turf, Woodsmall said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how you crunch the numbers, he said, there is no denying gang 
violence is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are in fact capturing and identifying gang crimes more completely 
than in the past, but that's just a small part of it. There is more violence 
out there," Woodsmall said. More Gang Activity

DISCREPANCIES MAR ACCOUNT OF DEATH OF BOY, 7; ACCIDENT: PARENTS SAY THAT THEIR 
SON WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN KILLED AS HE STEPPED FROM SCHOOL BUS IF THE DISTRICT 
FOLLOWED SAFETY PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The school district said Thursday it is investigating the death of a 
7-year-old struck by a truck after he got off a school bus, an accident his 
parents said could have been avoided if the district had followed safety 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Lanni, 7, was hit by a pickup truck on April 22 as he crossed Aliso 
Niguel Road. He died at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the funeral, Thomas W. Lanni, 41, said he was "infuriated" by 
an account of his son's death released after the accident by the Capistrano 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incomprehensible to me that this situation should be allowed to exist," 
he said. "They're trying to blame my son, and he's totally innocent."  
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Price, a spokeswoman for the district, said last week that the 
school bus had not been displaying flashing lights to warn drivers of children 
disembarking, because all six of the children who get off at that stop live on 
the same side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents of four of those children said Thursday that they live across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires school buses to display flashing lights to stop traffic in 
both directions "when children are unloading from the school bus to cross a 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
 Price acknowledged Thursday that four students do live on the other side of 
the street. But because the bus normally has pulled away by the time they 
cross, the driver is not required by law to flash his warning lights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't know at this point is just what happened and why," Price said. 
"We're still talking to students and parents and trying to get a sense of what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Price acknowledged that there were several major discrepancies in the 
district's initial account of the accident. "We weren't intentionally 
inaccurate," she said, "but we had limited information at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lanni, 36, said her family moved to Orange County from New York only a 
week before the accident. She enrolled her son at Marian Bergeson Elementary 
School last Tuesday, and brought him to and from the school on Wednesday, his 
first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a wonderful day," she recalled. When she offered to accompany him into 
the classroom, he replied, "No, Mommy, I'll go in myself." 
</P>
<P>
 At the school's encouragement, she signed up for the bus and waited with him 
Thursday morning at the stop in front of her development.  
</P>
<P>
 "I physically got on the bus with Tommy, so he would feel OK, and introduced 
him to the other kids," she said. "I told the bus driver that I was his mother. 
I specifically told him that my son was new, and that he did not know the area 
at all, that he was completely unfamiliar with the area. He said, 'Don't worry, 
I'll take care of him.' I trusted him." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials confirmed the substance of Barbara Lanni's conversation with 
the driver, whom district officials have declined to identify. He could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m., Lanni said, she was waiting at the stop for her son, but the bus 
never arrived at Ambassador Place and Aliso Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 But one stop earlier, at El Pilar and Aliso Niguel, Thomas Lanni speculated, 
his son may have become confused as the bus passed a nearby shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew he was close to home," Lanni said, "he was just unsure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni was the first child off the bus, and was hit when a pickup truck pulled 
around the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the hill, Barbara Lanni said she waited and waited for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what happened," she said, "but I had a bad feeling. . . . I was 
at a loss as to where my little boy was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 After driving down the hill to the accident scene, she said, "I ran up to the 
bus and I looked around and Tommy wasn't on the bus -- I wished to God he was. 
I ran up to one of the officers and asked him if they had seen a little boy in 
a yellow shirt, but he didn't want to look at me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, Price said that Thomas had darted into traffic to greet 
friends across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents and children at the stop said the boy did not run into the street 
to greet friends. He had just moved to the area and knew no one, and, in any 
case, witnesses said, there were no children across the street at the time of 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the district's earlier statement "was probably conjecture. . . . We 
don't know why he ran across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Speed limit signs along Aliso Niguel Road also are a source of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the area said they have been demanding speed limit and "Children 
at Play" signs for years. They maintain that two signs bracketing the accident 
site were erected the weekend after the boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan L. Eaton, who picks up her granddaughter at the stop each day, recorded 
in a log kept since the accident that city workers erected the two signs about 
noon on Sunday following the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city Traffic Engineer Dave Rogers said the signs went up two days 
before the fatal collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a tragic coincidence, but there was nothing unusual with the 
sign posting," Rogers said. "The process for installing them had been underway 
since December." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known how fast the truck driver was going. He has not been cited.  
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department said the accident is 
still being investigated, adding, "We do have some question as to the accuracy 
of some of the information as it was related" to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father described his son as "a bright young boy, very sweet." 
Barbara Lanni said her son "had the best sense of humor and the most contagious 
laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lannis were effusive with their gratitude toward the Shepherd of the Hills 
Church, whose minister and congregation have reached out to them even though 
the couple had not had time to join the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have taken us into their church family like they have known us," Barbara 
Lanni said, holding the funeral in the church and calling and visiting their 
home to help.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUFFALO RANCH PLAN COST SURPRISES BOARD 
</P>

<P>
 Refurbishing structures from Irvine's historic Buffalo Ranch for use as 
offices and classrooms at the Costa Mesa fairgrounds would cost the Orange 
County Fair Board at least $600,000, an architectural study released Thursday 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant's report also said that moving the landmark buildings would 
provide the fair with 16,000 square feet of additional interior space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Board reacted with surprise at the high cost of the rehabilitation 
work. But the panel voted Thursday to continue negotiations with the Irvine 
Co., which owns the Buffalo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Thirtieth Street Architects of Newport Beach, was hired 
earlier this year to assess the feasibility of relocating ranch structures to 
the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm said the fair should consider moving and refurbishing just seven of 
the 14 buildings on the ranch, including the well-known silo tower. Other 
buildings in the complex are in poor condition and don't appear worth moving, 
the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 It would cost between $600,000 and $1 million to transform the ranch buildings 
into offices, classrooms and meeting rooms, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. agreed Thursday to pay for moving the structures to the 
fairgrounds, said Jill Lloyd, the fair spokeswoman. The consultant did not 
estimate how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials hope the Irvine Co. will also assist in paying for some of the 
rehabilitation work, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Ranch -- a MacArthur Boulevard landmark -- was an amusement park 
in the 1950s known for its bison and other roaming animals. In the 1960s, the 
architects who designed UC Irvine and parts of Irvine and Newport Beach used 
the ranch as their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. intends to one day build homes on the Buffalo Ranch land. 
Company officials said moving the buildings is a way of preserving them. 
</P>
<P>
 But some preservationists would prefer that the buildings remain at their 
current site, saying the ranch is one of Irvine's last remaining links with the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine City Council is expected to discuss the issue in May. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; SLAYING VICTIM'S IDENTITY DETERMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man found shot to death in the back seat of a car on Sunday has been 
identified as Gustavo Gomez, 31, a sheriff's official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini said investigators had difficulty identifying the victim, who 
had a lengthy arrest record, because he had at least six aliases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, who had been shot in the head, was found in the 7300 block of Syracuse 
Street inside a 1985 Toyota that was registered under one of his aliases, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of his criminal history, we are looking into the possibility that 
this may have been the result of a drug deal gone bad," Martini said. "But at 
this point, we have nothing to confirm that." 
</P>
<P>
 The body was discovered when a neighbor called to report that the car had not 
been moved in two days. Martini said investigators believe that Gomez was 
killed at a different location, then left on Syracuse Street.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH, COSTA MESA; SCHOOL BOARD OKS CHANGES IN 
JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The administrative shake-up that the Newport-Mesa Unified School District 
announced last week was made official Tuesday night when the school board voted 
unanimously to ratify the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the administrative realignment, the positions of deputy superintendent, 
assistant superintendent for business services and coordinator of student 
services will be eliminated.They will be replaced by three lower-level 
positions -- directors of elementary and secondary education and community 
relations, saving about $20,000 in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Jacobson, principal at Corona del Mar High School, will become director 
of secondary education, while the two other positions will be filled by a 
nationwide search. The board also voted to create a new executive director of 
planning and program development, which will be filled by Dale Woolley, 
director of student support and research services. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were facilitated because deputy superintendents Carol Berg and 
Thomas A. Godley recently announced that they are leaving the district to take 
jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other pending personnel changes will not be ratified by the school 
board until its next meeting May 10. These include a job swap between Hazel 
Rojas, principal at Adams Elementary School, and Barbara Harrington, principal 
at Kaiser Primary. Also to be ratified is the transfer of Steve Pavich, 
principal at Newport Harbor High School, to Sonora High. Sonora Principal Juan 
de Jesus will go to Whittier Elementary.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; FIREWORKS SALES OKD 3-2 BY CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a 3-2 vote, the City Council gave final approval this week to July 
fireworks sales in the city and established a flat fee of $1,051 for nonprofit 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Three members of the council voted earlier this month to allow fireworks sales 
so that nonprofit organizations could raise money. But council members said 
they are determined to recover all the costs of assuring public safety and 
approving applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Only eight groups will be allowed to sell the fireworks, and will be chosen by 
council vote. Representatives of American West Marketing Inc. and Freedom 
Fireworks Inc. announced after Tuesday's council meeting that they will advance 
the application fees for potential vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Greg Hulsizer told the council that it will cost the code 
enforcement department almost $2,000 to monitor the sales and use of the 
fireworks July 1-4. The city staff estimated it will cost them almost $1,500 to 
process the applications and oversee operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department, which provides fire protection services to 
the city, has said it will charge the city additional fees of $5,037 for 
adequate protection. The department opposed the legalization of the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sal Sapien, who said he has been criticized for voting to legalize 
fireworks, emphasized that the sales are for a trial period of one year.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will be for the benefit of the residents," Sapien told people who came to 
the council meeting. "We're going to try to educate the public, because we are 
just as concerned about the safety as you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapien said if the program does not raise money for nonprofit groups, he will 
not want to continue the sales. Council members William C. Estrada and Harry 
Dotson also voted to allow the sales. Council members Don Martinez and Linda J. 
Pappas Diaz voted to maintain the fireworks ban because of safety concerns.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TEACHERS WON'T GET PAY RAISES FOR '94-95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a new one-year contract, public high school teachers in Huntington 
Beach, Westminster and Fountain Valley will not get an across-the-board pay 
increase next school year, Supt. David Hagen said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The only teachers who stand to get raises are those who advance in education 
or seniority levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said the school board for the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District, which governs all the high schools in those three cities, voted 4-1 
on Tuesday night for the new contract with the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state gave us no money (for an across-the-board teacher pay raise), so we 
could give the teachers no more money," Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent said the one-year contract allows for increases in pay to 
some teachers who advance in seniority or additional education. Those increases 
are provided for in the district's existing contract with the teachers, and 
that formula is being extended into the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said the new contract, which extends through June 30, 1995, provides no 
increase in health and welfare benefits for any teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, a teachers' union official said the high school teachers are 
accepting the lack of a general pay raise because they know the district is 
strapped for funds.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a decline in students and flat state funding" to the 
schools, said Jim Harlan, executive director of the West Orange County United 
Teachers, an umbrella group that includes the Huntington Beach teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlan said the school board has dealt fairly with the teachers in recent 
years. "We feel (the school board members) have been reasonable and that when 
the time comes and they have more money, they will make it available to the 
teachers in higher salaries," Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract includes a retirement-incentive provision aimed at teachers 
who are 50 or older. Because of seniority, older teachers usually earn more 
than younger ones. The retirement incentive would not go into effect unless at 
least 51 teachers apply for it, thus making it cost-effective for the district, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Dirk Voss cast the lone vote against the contract. Voss 
questioned the cost of existing health-welfare benefits for the teachers, 
saying he would like a better study of alternatives. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; SHE WON'T SURRENDER IN BLIGHT FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bullets, rocks and the unleashed anger of street gangs have not stopped 
Dorothy Rush from trying to improve her city. 
</P>
<P>
 She has endured a piece of hell in her Grace/Pacific neighborhood and has been 
pressing City Hall for two years to take a bigger role in dealing with the 
area's run-down and neglected properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, a 30-year Grace Avenue resident, is again knocking on the doors at City 
Hall for help. Rush wants the city to adopt stronger local laws that would 
force residents and landlords to clean up their houses and apartments, and 
front yards. She believes improving the area's appearance would demonstrate 
that residents will not tolerate gang intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 As founder of the Grace/Pacific Neighborhood Watch, Rush persuaded police six 
months ago to step up patrols. The increased presence has resulted in a 
significant decrease in gang activity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Rush has held meetings at her house with some landlords and 
tenants to press them to maintain their properties. She has had success with 
some but failed with most. A few landlords have evicted tenants who refused to 
keep the properties clean. 
</P>
<P>
 This has lead to charges from some tenants, who accuse Rush of meddling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there is an eviction, they think I'm responsible because I head the 
Neighborhood Watch and the Grace/Pacific Community Assn.," Rush said, pointing 
out bullet holes in her walls, windows and blinds, which she says were fired at 
her home in retribution for her activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. John Rees suspects gang members who have been evicted from their 
homes. They "probably harbor some ill will toward Dorothy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent incident was 3 a.m. April 17, when melon-sized cinder blocks 
crashed through Rush's bedroom and living room windows. One hit her lower back 
while another grazed her cat and another shattered her dresser mirror. 
Panicked, Rush stepped on the broken window glass on her way to phone police. 
She still has pieces of glass embedded in her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, her house has been sprayed with bullets, and vandals in February 
smashed the living room window and scribbled the name of a neighborhood gang in 
large black letters on the front of her house. No arrests were made in the 
incidents, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost on a monthly basis, graffiti appears on Rush's driveway, home or truck 
and gunshots usually follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scary feeling and it makes me mad," Rush said. "This retaliation's got 
to stop. . . . I just want to clean up the area." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described gang member, who refused to give his name, said the 
neighborhood youths don't like Rush because "she's always thinking bad of us, 
looking down on us and calling police even when we're just talking on the 
street corner." 
</P>
<P>
 After Rush and other community activists last week blasted city officials for 
their failure to wipe out the blight, the City Council and City Manager Lee 
Risner promised to have an anti-blight ordinance in place within months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope" the promises will be fulfilled, Rush said with a hint of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am no longer going to sit quietly waiting for the city to take action. You 
haven't heard the last of me yet." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; COUNTY'S RESEARCH VESSEL DUE SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's first ship dedicated to educating the public about marine 
environment will cruise into the Dana Point Harbor on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Marine Institute's newest acquisition, a 70-foot vessel 
named the Sea Explorer, will be dedicated to ocean research, and will be used 
to take the public on educational cruises throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute officials expect the Sea Explorer to arrive about 11:30 a.m. To help 
acquaint the public with the ship, marine exhibits, talks about the ocean 
environment and tours of the institute will take place between noon and 2 p.m. 
The marine institute is at 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, the institute has taken steps to broaden its education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time last summer, field study trips at sea were enhanced with 
video equipment that showed the ocean floor and helped participants communicate 
directly with research divers. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization also started a night program called the Bioluminescene Night 
Cruise that acquainted cruise-goers with glowing undersea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the institute had to rent ships in order to conduct the cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "That limited us, particularly during the summer because charters we rented 
the vessels from do most of their business on the weekends," said Dan Stetson, 
the institute's director of maritime affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the coming of the Sea Explorer, institute workers won't have to lug 
heavy, sensitive research equipment on and off the boat constantly, Stetson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel began its trek to Dana Point from Florida almost six weeks ago. The 
institute plans to renovate the ship to accommodate its research and public 
outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Navigation and marine mammal study stations will be installed on the upper 
deck for the benefit of visitors. An on-board laboratory will be fully equipped 
with video microscopes, running seawater and dissection tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute will also convert the boat's main salon into an underwater 
viewing theater where live videos of underwater activities will be played.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GATES PROPOSES GANG EDUCATION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As gang-related violent crimes reach new highs in Orange County, Sheriff Brad 
Gates is proposing a $400,000 prevention program that stresses gang education 
and awareness on a countywide scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Project No Gangs, the proposal will go before the Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, developed by the Orange County Chiefs of Police & Sheriff's 
Assn., would involve hiring eight civilian employees, including an executive 
director and crime prevention specialists, who would work with schools and 
other organizations to increase prevention and awareness of gang violence. The 
nonprofit program is expected to pay for itself after its first year in 
operation, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a countywide approach to a countywide problem," said Sheriff's Capt. 
Doug Storm, who is helping coordinate the project. "Our first line of attack to 
gangs starts with education." 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the program would be similar to the Sheriff Department's Drug Use 
Is Life Abuse Foundation, a privately funded partnership between business and 
law enforcement leaders that has produced anti-drug brochures for students, as 
well as other educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one more piece of the puzzle toward dealing with gangs and violence 
in Orange County," said Supervisor William G. Steiner, who predicted his 
colleagues would agree to pay for the program's start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of good things are happening in the county, but people seem to be 
going in different directions. We need to have a coordinated countywide 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors have already approved a sweeping $2-million enforcement program, 
headed by Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, in which special teams 
of prosecutors, probation officers and local police are being dispatched to 
troubled neighborhoods in select areas to target gang leaders. That project is 
an extension of the successful TARGET (Tri-Agency Resources Gang Enforcement 
Team) started in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 While TARGET stresses enforcement, Project No Gangs will focus on education, 
prevention and awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Douglas Woodsmall, who supervises the district attorney's gang 
unit, said education "goes hand in hand" with enforcement measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that putting gang members in jail or in prison is the whole 
answer," he said. "It's an important part of the answer. But as long as people 
keep joining gangs, the people we put in prison are going to be replaced, (and) 
you have to do something to stem that tide."ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA / PLACENTIA; BREA OLINDA LAND TRANSFER 
RESCINDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Board of Education voted 
this week to rescind a resolution transferring an 875-acre property from the 
Brea Olinda Unified School District to the Placentia-Yorba Linda district. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the board Tuesday creates the possibility that many Yorba Linda 
students will be bused to schools in another city, a situation the district 
fought hard to correct in another area only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The undeveloped property, owned by Shell Oil, is unincorporated, but is 
expected to be annexed by the city of Yorba Linda within the next 12 months. 
When fully developed in 10 to 20 years, the project is expected to contain 
2,338 single-family houses, townhouses, apartments and condominiums, generating 
an estimated 1,000 to 1,300 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel is north of the city and is bounded by Prospect Street on the west, 
Ohio Street on the east, Wabash Avenue on the south and Carbon Canyon Regional 
Park and Chino Hills State Park on the north.  
</P>
<P>
 Though officials from both school districts and from the city of Yorba Linda 
all agree that those students should go to Placentia-Yorba Linda schools, Dist. 
Supt. James O. Fleming said Placentia-Yorba Linda could not accept the property 
without "full mitigation" of the costs of the additional students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The door is still open a little bit," Fleming said in an interview Thursday. 
"But unless Shell can come up with total mitigation, we're not going to go for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is looking for Shell to agree to pay for the cost of constructing 
and equipping a new elementary school, plus expansion of existing middle 
schools and high schools to accommodate the additional students. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the property will probably be sold to developers with whom the district 
could also negotiate for these funds, Fleming said the district wants the 
agreement in place before Yorba Linda approves the general plan for the 
property.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have an agreement with Shell, and the developers don't agree to 
full mitigation, the funds to (build and expand schools) would come out of our 
general fund," Fleming said. "We have to get full mitigation from Shell or we'd 
be gambling with money in the general fund, which could have a detrimental 
impact on the students already in the district." 
</P>
<P>
 If Shell and the district don't come to an agreement before Yorba Linda 
certifies an environmental impact report for the proposed development of the 
property, any students in the area will be assigned to Brea-Olinda schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a developmental standpoint, it could have a negative impact," said City 
Manager Arthur Simonian. "When people buy homes, and they see the kids are 
going to be bused to another city, there's a negative connotation associated 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Simonian pointed out that several years ago, the district completed a 
years-long effort to get a pocket of Yorba Linda transferred from the Fullerton 
Union High School District to the Placentia-Yorba Linda district. 
</P>
<P>
 "All (the district) is doing is creating another pocket of Yorba Linda 
residents being bused to another community," Simonian said. "The district 
worked for years to solve a similar problem." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

</P>
<P>
 Harriett M. Wieder, who has been a supervisor for 16 years, is not a candidate 
in the June 7 election. Her district includes Costa Mesa, Cypress, Huntington 
Beach, Los Alamitos, Seal Beach and Stanton, and parts of Garden Grove and 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotaping was moderated by Charles Wilson, a public affairs manager for 
Southern California Edison. He asked the candidates to give their views on 
crime, jail sites, business issues, traffic problems and uses of El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station after the military gives up the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also asked about mass transportation, air pollution and low-income 
housing, and asked the candidates what strengths they believe they would bring 
to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Littrell said every supervisorial district should have jails. He opposes toll 
roads and is critical of the Air Quality Management District, saying it has 
hurt business. He said he would like to see redevelopment money used for 
low-income housing. "This country is too great for us to let people sleep on 
the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson said her top priority is fighting crime. "That's what people 
are telling me, that they want to be safe in their neighborhoods." She said 
that jails should be in remote areas and that she would like to place 
low-income housing in commercial rather than residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he is very concerned about crime. He wants to expand the current 
jails rather than build new ones. Another top priority is to help business: "We 
have to look at ways of balancing budgets without putting an unfair burden on 
businesses." He also said the AQMD has hurt businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson said she will work to help businesses, and wants to bring a business 
mentality to government. She prefers to expand existing jails to meet the 
overcrowding problem. She also said she will work to improve safety. She 
supports the construction of single-room-occupancy dwellings for low-income 
residents, provided they are well-run. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong question-and-answer session will run on Mondays at 6 p.m. and 
Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m. during May. The show will run on Copley-Colony 
Cablevision Channel 3, which airs in Costa Mesa. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STUDENTS TO TAKE PART IN BUILDING CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon under construction: a competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In a countywide contest being held Saturday and Sunday at the Tustin Market 
Place, 12 student teams will be building mini-houses from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is the fifth annual Design/Build Competition, coordinated by the 
Home Builders Council. Contestants will be students from high schools and 
community colleges who are learning about the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the Design/Build Competition is to provide hands-on 
construction experience that is unavailable in most high school classroom 
settings," said Janice Silverman, a spokeswoman for the event. "Professional 
building inspectors will inspect structures for compliance to building and 
safety codes. On Sunday, the structures will be judged by building-industry 
professionals, and awards will be presented." 
</P>
<P>
 The contest is from 8 a.m. to 4:40 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday 
at the shopping center at Jamboree Road and El Camino Real. Awards will be 
presented at 2 p.m. Sunday. The activities, including the awards ceremony, are 
open to public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition represents one of many educational programs developed by the 
Home Builders Council in an effort to promote career awareness of the 
construction industry," Silverman said.BILL BILLITER

NONE OF 19 STUDENTS EXPOSED TO TB HAVE DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 None of the 19 Sierra Intermediate School students found to have been exposed 
to tuberculosis have the disease, health officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people who . . . have positive reactions to the TB skin test . . . never 
acquire the disease," Dr. Hugh Stallworth, county health officer, said of the 
students who recently tested positive for tuberculosis antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 They were among 146 youngsters tested after a classmate, a 12-year-old girl, 
became ill with tuberculosis. To prevent the disease's spread, school and 
health officials administered skin tests to the sick girl's classmates and 
friends, as well as any other students or staff members who asked to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Chest X-rays were then performed on the 19 students whose skin tests were 
positive, officials said, but none of the students were found to have the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the brief duration of the student's illness, we did not strongly 
anticipate that she had passed it along," Stallworth said in a press release, 
"but it was appropriate that we move forward with the investigation as a 
precautionary measure."

HANTAVIRUS FOUND IN SIX MORE RODENTS; DISEASE: FIVE OF THE ANIMALS TESTING 
POSITIVE ARE OF A SECOND VARIETY OF MICE. OFFICIALS SAY NO PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT 
IS POSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Six more rodents trapped in South County have tested positive for the 
hantavirus, perhaps the same strain responsible for 40 deaths nationwide, 
county health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings to 11 the number of rodents trapped in the county since last 
August that showed exposure to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, five of the latest six rodents to test positive were 
harvest mice, whereas all the other mice testing positive have been deer mice, 
the rodent variety believed to be the chief "reservoir" for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials, however, stressed that they believe the latest 
finding poses no health threat to county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Webb of the Orange County Vector Control District said the district staff 
only a few weeks ago decided to expand its hantavirus surveillance program 
beyond deer mice to include harvest mice. He said that when one harvest mouse 
was found positive, investigators decided to test the carcasses of others that 
had been previously trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said preliminary blood tests of five harvest mice show that they were 
probably exposed to a hantavirus similar to the kind that surfaced in May of 
last year, when victims contracted the airborne disease from exposure to 
blowing dust contaminated with mice droppings in the Four Corners area of 
Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the harvest mice testing positive for hantavirus was trapped in August, 
1992, in a rural area near San Clemente, and three were trapped between July, 
1993, and last month in Crystal Cove State Park. In addition, a deer mouse with 
positive antibodies was trapped in December, 1993, in the San Joaquin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of further laboratory tests will be required to precisely determine 
the strain of hantavirus to which all six trapped mice were exposed and how 
long their urine and feces might have carried the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms of the disease, which so far has infected five people in California, 
killing four, include breathing problems, nausea and fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County health officials said that so far there have been no reported 
cases of hantavirus in the county and thus they do not believe the public 
health risk in the area is very great. They say it is possible that mice have 
long been infected with the disease but have not passed it to humans, partly 
because the mice live in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "While many questions remain concerning the hantavirus infection, there is no 
evidence at present to suggest a significant health hazard for Orange County 
residents," Health Care Agency officials said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not an imminent high level of danger," said Dr. Hildy Meyers, a 
county epidemiologist. "We are just reminding people there is a possibility the 
hantavirus is here and to remember the precautions." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials offered these tips as "prudent steps" in avoiding the 
disease: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prevent rodents from entering buildings by covering up access holes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clean up rodent droppings and dead rodents by soaking them in household 
disinfectant or a 1:10 dilution of bleach and using waterproof gloves to place 
them in double plastic bags for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * When hiking or camping, avoid contact with rodents and their burrows and 
droppings, and store food and garbage in rodent-proof containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take special precaution when entering or cleaning buildings in rural areas 
that may be rodent infested.

RECKLESS DRIVING GUILTY PLEA BY DANA POINT CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Point City Atty. Jerry Patterson pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of 
reckless driving and paid a fine of $400 Thursday after agreeing to a plea 
bargain in connection with a drunk driving arrest Dec 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, a former congressman, was stopped around 3 a.m. on Pacific Coast 
Highway in Newport Beach and arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after he 
failed a field sobriety test, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, Patterson was driving his 1991 Volkswagen van 
about 85 m.p.h. in a 50 m.p.h. zone and failed to stop at a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson was on his way home in Huntington Beach from a City Council meeting 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporting officer said he detected an odor of alcohol and that Patterson 
"displayed symptoms of intoxication." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Patterson took a breath test at the Newport Beach police 
station that showed his blood-alcohol to be .08%, the legal limit under 
California law. Police said a blood test taken about 50 minutes later showed 
his blood-alcohol level to be .07%, which is legally permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson steadfastly maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel totally vindicated," he said Thursday. "I'm glad it's over, and I'm 
pleased with the result. I was absolutely not drunk. At a maximum, I had three 
glasses of wine over a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson's wife, Linda Moulton-Patterson, is mayor of Huntington Beach and a 
candidate for county supervisor in the 2nd District.

WOMAN, 71, BEATEN TO DEATH IN SANTA ANA APARTMENT; CRIME: RESIDENTS OF A 
HIGH-SECURITY SENIOR CITIZENS' COMPLEX ARE SHAKEN. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF A 
BREAK-IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 71-year-old woman living in a high-security apartment complex was found 
bludgeoned to death in her apartment Thursday morning, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking for a man who was seen in her apartment earlier that 
day, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was identified as Patricia Hamilton Powell. She lived at the 
Wycliffe Plaza, a 12-story housing complex for senior citizens on North Flower 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the building, which is surrounded by a high-security fence, is 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Police Lt. Bob Helton, the woman's body was found in a bedroom by 
a neighbor around 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death was blunt force trauma to the upper body and head, he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 There were no signs of a break-in, but there were indications of a struggle 
from the living room to the bedroom, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could have been a struggle, but it's difficult for us to say at this 
point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say they are looking for a white male in his 30s wearing 
light-colored trousers who was seen at the victim's apartment around 1:30 a.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Helton, a witness who is part of the building's volunteer 
security team told investigators he had gone to the woman's apartment when her 
smoke detector went off. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness said he found a young man in the woman's apartment, who told him 
he had just burned something in the kitchen, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness "then left and went about his business. Apparently he believed the 
young man," Helton said. "We don't know at this time if anything was burned."  
</P>
<P>
 John Bailey, 84, who lives three doors down from Powell's apartment, said, "I 
only met her a couple of times; nobody seems to know too much about anything. 
It makes you kind of nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to residents' jitters, the building's management kept its offices 
open all night Thursday and brought in extra security guards. Today at 2 p.m., 
residents said, a general meeting is planned on the premises to discuss the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all upset, very upset," Virginia Baker, 80, said of her neighbors. 
"I've never worried before, but this makes me feel strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsie Fielding, 87, expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit it's shocking," she said. "I was completely surprised. I'm 
hesitant about opening my door now when the bell rings." 
</P>

TEAMSTERS, SHIPPERS REACH TENTATIVE PACT; LABOR: DESPITE BITTER SPLIT, TWO KEY 
UNION FACTIONS PREDICT CONTRACT APPROVAL. SOME WORKERS COULD RETURN TO JOBS 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Teamsters union and major trucking firms reached a tentative agreement 
late Thursday on a labor contract expected to end a 23-day-old strike that has 
idled roughly 70,000 freight workers nationally. Some drivers and dockworkers 
could return to their jobs as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Teamsters bitterly split over whether the proposed settlement 
marked a victory for management or the union. But the two key union factions 
predicted that members will approve the pact, in part because of economic 
pressure on the unionized trucking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike has been the nation's biggest since the Communications Workers of 
America walked out on AT&T in 1986 and the first by the Teamsters since the 
trucking industry was deregulated in the 1980s. Yet the walkout, while hurting 
some businesses, has served as a reminder of how much the union's influence has 
waned since 1979, when a Teamsters strike strangled commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters President Ron Carey claimed a big win on what he called the chief 
issue in the contract dispute: a bid by the trucking companies involved in the 
negotiations to add lower-paid, three-hour-a-day workers who would receive no 
health or pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, union officials said, no such employees could 
be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, critics of Carey, called the agreement "concessionary." They noted that 
while the pact thwarted management's proposal for the three-hour-a-day 
part-timers, it will permit greater use of "casual" laborers who work 
intermittently and receive less than the standard Teamsters pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, critics faulted Carey's negotiators for giving up the right to 
strike over grievances and for allowing more freight to be shipped by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 R.V. Durham, a North Carolina Teamsters leader whom Carey defeated in the 
union's presidential 1991 election, said Carey "should have stayed at the 
bargaining table and fought for a contract that protects the members' job 
security. Now many members face layoffs as the carriers battle to win freight 
back from the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the four-year agreement will be unveiled today to representatives 
of 230 Teamsters freight locals. Although it will take about a month for the 
members to vote, strikers will return to work, and the industry could be in 
full swing as soon as Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Trucking Management Inc., the group representing most of the 22 
companies subject to the Teamsters contract, released a brief statement lauding 
the settlement, saying it will make the companies more competitive while 
improving employees' wages, benefits and job security. 
</P>
<P>
 Union sources said the pact would boost the average Teamster's base pay by 
about 8% over the four years of the contract, lifting it to about $18.35 an 
hour. Officials close to Carey said the union also won "the largest employer 
contributions ever" for freight workers' pensions and health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were under stiff pressure to reach a settlement. For the union, the 
walkout was a severe drain on its strike fund, which was already suffering in 
the wake of the membership's recent rejection of a dues increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking firms have been badly hurt since the early 1980s by the emergence 
of non-union companies that operate at lower costs and by other competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the 23 companies originally involved in the talks went out of 
business after the strike began. Two more carriers signed "me-too" agreements 
allowing them to bring their union employees back to work but requiring them to 
honor whatever contract settlement is reached.

DAILY PAPERLESS; GREENWIRE HELPS BLAZE TRAIL IN ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC KONIGSBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt wanted to leak his proposed new national 
grazing laws to the media last month, he had one news organ in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the Washington Post. It wasn't one of the Big Three evening news 
broadcasts. It wasn't even CNN. Important as it was to Babbitt to reach the 
right audience -- policy-makers, interest groups and other influential 
environmental players -- he took his story to Greenwire. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily newsletter covering the environment is noteworthy not just for its 
influence, but because of how it's delivered. You can get it as electronic 
mail. You can get it by fax. You can even search its database for the 
information you need. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing Greenwire isn't is printed, which makes it a good example of a 
growing new kind of publishing, one that is paperless, interactive, highly 
focused -- and very high-priced. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwire doesn't depend on any futuristic vision of the information 
superhighway. Instead, it uses established electronic delivery means. Its 
paperlessness means that no money or time is wasted on printing or mailing, 
which seems particularly apt for a publication devoted to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Greenwire is a traditional news organization. Every morning at 
5, the first of its eight employees arrives in the Washington-area office in 
jeans and sneakers to cull about 130 news sources, including television and 
radio transcripts, trade magazines, government reports, dozens of regional 
newspapers and items sent in by its international "stringers" to distill the 
day's environmental coverage -- news on politics, technology and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors also add a smattering of news analyses and interviews. By 10 a.m., 
they've put together what would be a 12-page briefing, which subscribers can 
retrieve electronically (via the Internet, for example) or have faxed directly 
by the folks at Greenwire. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwire is nothing if not focused. Circulation is only about 1,500, but as 
far as Babbitt was concerned, they are the right 1,500. Subscribers include the 
White House, Congress, the Department of Energy and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, as well as trade organizations and grass-roots groups; 
corporations such as Coca-Cola Co., Dow Chemical Co. and Toyota Motors Corp., 
and news organizations such as ABC, CNN and the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrowcasting is a growth business for companies such as Greenwire, which 
provides readers with information they apparently need at a level of 
convenience and coherence they evidently can't get elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think publishing electronically is the way of the future of journalism," 
says Greenwire's publisher, Phillip Shabecoff, who launched the newsletter in 
1991. "Even newspapers will have to do that to survive in the next century. 
We're even more on the cutting edge, because we're closely focused. As society 
gets increasingly overwhelmed by a flood of data, people will pay for 
condensed, specific information." 
</P>
<P>
 And pay they do. Corporations shell out between $1,495 and $3,000 yearly for 
the daily briefing. Federal departments, which often distribute Greenwire via 
computer to more than one office, pay as much as $6,000, and Congress pays even 
more. (Greenwire won't say how much.) 
</P>
<P>
 For its biggest subscriber, the Edison Electric Institute, Greenwire compiles 
its own subsidiary daily briefing, the six-page Energy News, which the trade 
group shares with its member utilities at a cost of more than $100,000 a year. 
Greenwire also allows subscribers, at a fee of 80 cents a minute, to search its 
database for news items. The service is available to non-subscribers at double 
the rate, plus a $100 initiation fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwire isn't unique. In recent years, many writers and publishers have 
taken to distributing market-specific newsletters by modem or fax. And as fax 
modems and membership to services such as CompuServe have grown common in 
offices and households, publishers distribute these newsletters via electronic 
bulletin board systems and fax broadcast services, which allow a publisher to 
fax a document to a single computer. The service bureau then disseminates it to 
a subscriber list by fax. 
</P>
<P>
 Publications -- from free "fanzines" to investment newsletters such as the 
Princeton Portfolio (a weekly costing $225 a year, published by Forbes 
columnist Michael Gianturco) to articles from established periodicals such as 
the New Republic -- can all be accessed by modem. Such enterprises almost 
change the meaning of publishing, often allowing consumers to decide what 
information they will receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shabecoff, a reporter who covered Vietnam and the White House for the New York 
Times, was the paper's environmental correspondent from 1977 to 1991, when the 
Times took him off the beat. At the time, Shabecoff claimed he'd been told his 
stance was "pro-environment, whatever that means." 
</P>
<P>
 So he teamed with longtime Republican political consultant Doug Bailey, owner 
of the American Political Network, which since 1987 had been putting out 
Hotline, an electronic Beltway digest for policy junkies. APN also publishes 
Health News and Abortion Report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug Bailey and I knew there was a need for expanded information about the 
environment," Shabecoff says, adding that environmental coverage "is 
shortchanged by many other publications. Media managers just didn't get it; by 
and large, many still don't. Even though what we do is narrowcast, many of our 
readers are in a position to get it out to a much wider audience."

 Bailey estimates Greenwire's operating costs at $500,000 to $1 million a year, 
mainly because the newsletter can be distributed without paying for printing or 
delivery. It carries no advertisements -- the chief source of revenue for most 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carrying ads would bring another level of issues to deal with," says Dale 
Curtis, the newsletter's co-publisher. "It would also require more staff and 
space." 
</P>
<P>
 But not relying on ads for revenue shifts the burden of paying to the readers. 
Though Greenwire just in the past year began to turn a financial corner, APN's 
four newsletters netted a combined profit of $600,000, about as much as it 
spends, on average, to operate any one of the four. Primed for Green Mail

ADMINISTRATION LOOKS TO THE FCC AS HIGH-TECH CASH COW; FUNDING: NEW AND HIGHER 
FEES ARE PROPOSED TO HELP PAY FOR PROGRAMS RANGING FROM HEALTH CARE TO 
IMMIGRATION LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission is being targeted as a high-tech piggy 
bank in the Clinton Administration's increasingly pointed search for more money 
to fund health care, immigration law enforcement and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration last week proposed that Congress raise $72.4 million in FCC 
user fees for things such as radio and TV broadcast licenses starting Oct. 1, 
in order to help states pay for the cost of jailing illegal immigrants 
convicted of felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, industry and Capitol Hill sources say the Administration plans to 
propose a spectrum royalty fee on new communications services to raise up to 
$4.8 billion over five years to help cover the estimated $13-billion cost of 
implementing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sources say privately that they believe the Administration is 
trying to encourage FCC Chairman Reed Hundt to delay and revise the forthcoming 
auction for wireless personal communications services, or PCS, in order to 
increase proceeds and make a dent in the huge cost of President Clinton's 
health care proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources, who did not want to be identified, said the plan is to divide up 
PCS licenses in such a way that the FCC would raise more than the $7 billion to 
$10 billion the Administration has previously estimated the auction will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt, who has been waging an uphill battle for money to hire more FCC staff 
to police the cable industry and oversee forthcoming PCS auctions, told a 
Senate panel Thursday that auctions for the most valuable part of PCS service 
may be pushed back to the winter from this fall, an FCC spokeswoman said. But 
she said the FCC chairman is under no Administration pressure to come up with a 
new auction scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the delay is driven by the concern that we aren't far enough along in 
selecting a firm to conduct the auction," said Susan Sallet. She said the 
agency wants to proceed more slowly to ensure that there are no glitches in the 
auction process. "It is not our goal to delay the process in order to raise 
more money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless communications services such as PCS represent one of the 
fastest-growing segments of the telecommunications industry. The Clinton 
Administration has said it wants to move quickly to reduce regulatory barriers 
to development of the industry, yet maximize fairness and revenue by auctioning 
off licenses for many new communications services rather than allocating them 
by lottery or administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, including some that have blasted the FCC's auction plans, are 
alarmed by the specter of further delays and increased bidding costs. 
Increasing fees and postponing auctions for PCS and other wireless services, 
they argue, will give an insurmountable competitive advantage to cellular 
companies and entrenched providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration runs the risk of killing the goose that has the potential 
to lay the golden egg," said Thomas A. Stroup, president of the Personal 
Communications Industry Assn., a trade group. "For them to delay the process 
and add additional fees could very well tip the scale to the point that it 
drives potential entrants away." 
</P>
<P>
 But after seeing MCI Communications Corp. recently agree to invest $1.3 
billion in the nation's largest mobile radio company -- nearly 14 times the 
amount the Administration believes an equal slice of airwaves would raise in 
the planned PCS auctions -- sources say the Administration wants to up the 
ante. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the strategy has enraged a number of industry officials and 
lawmakers, including Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich), chairman of the powerful 
House Commerce Committee. On Thursday he sent a letter to White House Budget 
Director Leon Panetta angrily decrying "this unfortunate practice of raiding 
programs within our jurisdiction to fund unrelated Administration initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell said that under current law, FCC user fees are already forecast by the 
Administration to cover all of the agency's costs except for funds to pay for 
the five FCC commissioners, their staffs and the general counsel's office. "Is 
the Administration proposing to levy a new fee on top of the processing fees" 
already in place, thus "forcing applicants to pay twice for the same service?" 
Dingell asked. 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to GATT, Dingell told Panetta, "I encourage you in the strongest 
possible terms to seek funding sources that are more closely linked to the GATT 
agreement than . . . a spectrum user fee." 
</P>
<P>
 James H. Quello, a Democrat and an FCC commissioner, added: "Charging a fee is 
OK, but using it for the detention of (illegal) aliens strikes me as hard to 
accept. The money should be used to defray the expenses of the FCC or for other 
communications purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the FCC fee increase would indeed go toward the FCC's 
$167-million annual budget. But it would free up money the government now 
spends on the FCC for use in the illegal immigrant law enforcement program, the 
White House says. The Administration has not released details on how it would 
apply the proposed spectrum royalty fee, but that plan has drawn critics as 
well.

DELTA TO JETTISON UP TO 15,000 JOBS, $2 BILLION IN COSTS; AIRLINES: STIFF 
COMPETITION FROM LOW-COST CARRIERS SUCH AS SOUTHWEST IS CITED IN BID TO RETURN 
TO PROFITABILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Reflecting the mounting pressure major carriers are feeling from low-cost 
competitors, Delta Air Lines on Thursday announced a sweeping plan to reduce 
costs by $2 billion and eliminate as many as 15,000 jobs -- or 20% of its work 
force -- during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's third-largest airline also said it will soon seek major wage and 
work rule concessions from its pilots. Delta said that without the concessions, 
it will establish a separate low-cost, non-union airline to serve certain 
highly competitive, short-haul markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta-based carrier's restructuring is only the latest by a major 
airline beset by losses. Delta said Thursday that it lost $77.9 million in its 
fiscal third quarter ended March 31, bringing total losses in the past three 
years to a staggering $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also flying in turbulent skies is UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, 
which posted a $71-million loss in the first quarter ended March 31. Echoing 
Delta, UAL blamed the loss on "the proliferation of reduced fares brought on by 
expanding low-cost carriers in domestic markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Delta shares rose $1.875 to $45.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Thursday. UAL gained $1.75 to close at $128.875. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta, United and other major carriers are feeling increasing heat from 
Southwest and lesser-known low-cost regional airlines that largely fly popular 
routes of 600 miles or less. Even the trustee and creditors of defunct Eastern 
Airlines said Thursday that they are trying to raise cash to create a new 
short-haul airline. 
</P>
<P>
 The new competitive environment has clearly caused major problems for Delta, 
which has earned a reputation in the industry for efficiency and employee 
loyalty. Up to now, Delta has earned that loyalty by avoiding major layoffs, 
although all non-pilot employees agreed to take a 5% pay cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Delta has cut 7,400 jobs since July, 1992, they came through 
attrition and voluntary separations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Delta's reservoir of employee goodwill may be tested in coming months. The 
carrier said it will resort to an unspecified number of layoffs to eliminate 
between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs by 1997. The exact mix of layoffs, retirements 
and resignations will not be disclosed until July 15, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees who escape layoffs may see their jobs change significantly, a 
spokesman said, adding that the good news is that the employees would be given 
a new profit-sharing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this demonstrates is that it is absolutely essential for big airlines to 
get costs down," said Harold E. Shenton, vice president of Avmark, an Arlington 
Va.-based aviation management consulting company. "Delta is saying, 'We will do 
this by slimming down all around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Delta said the wage and work rule concessions it wants from its pilots union 
-- the Air Line Pilots Assn. -- would save it $340 million annually. Delta also 
asked the pilots to move up scheduled contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, ALPA said it will not comment on Delta's demands until it can 
poll its members. But an ALPA spokesman said it was a favorable sign that Delta 
targeted a cost reduction in terms of dollars, not pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's costs have declined in recent years, but they are still 37% more 
expensive than industry bellwether Southwest Airlines. Delta's goal is to 
reduce its costs from 9.56 cents per passenger mile to 7.5 cents by 1997, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's chances of success are high because its workers, except the pilots, 
are largely non-union and it has tremendous goodwill among employees, said 
Glenn Engel, an airline industry analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This company has been taking care of its employees for years," he said. "This 
action may be late in coming, but Delta didn't want to hurt its people."

 IBM Job Cuts Proceed Slowly: The computer giant said it has cut 20% to 23% of 
the 35,000 jobs it said it would eliminate by year's end.International Business 
Machines Corp. set that goal last July, saying it would reduce costs by $3 
billion this year. So far, between 7,000 and 8,000 jobs have been cut, an IBM 
spokesman said. That leaves 27,000 to 28,000 jobs to go over the next eight 
months. At IBM's annual meeting earlier this week, Chairman Louis V. Gerstner 
told shareholders the company will be profitable this year for the first time 
in four years.

GM SAYS EARNINGS ROSE 66% IN 1ST QUARTER; AUTOMOBILES: NATION'S NO. 1 CAR MAKER 
EARNS $854 MILLION THANKS TO A STRONG MARKET, COST CUTTING AND INCREASED 
PRODUCTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Boosted by a strong market, continued cost cutting and improved productivity, 
General Motors Corp. on Thursday reported a 66% increase in first-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's No. 1 auto maker earned $854 million, or 81 cents a share, in the 
three months ended March 31, compared to a profit of $513 million, or 42 cents 
a share, in 1993's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings would have been even better except for a $758-million charge to 
account for future worker disability benefits. Without the onetime charge, GM 
would have earned $1.6 billion for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, we think it was a very satisfying quarter," Chief Financial 
Officer G. Richard Wagoner said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 While GM's performance was better than expected by Wall Street, the company's 
shares closed unchanged Thursday at $56.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed, given their product mix," said David Garrity, an analyst 
with McDonald & Co. Investments, a Cleveland-based brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, GM sold more small cars -- which generate less revenue 
and profit -- than its competitors. Its sales of trucks, including minivans and 
sport utility vehicles, were restrained by plant capacity limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's troubled North American auto operations continued to show 
improvement. The unit earned $511 million, excluding a $708-million charge for 
disability benefits. The company lost $170 million in North America in last 
year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's international auto operations earned $425 million, compared to $141 
million a year ago. The performance reflects a recovery beginning in Europe and 
strong sales in South America, particularly in booming Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's financial, computer service and electronics subsidiaries 
together earned $671 million. A year ago, the three units contributed profits 
of $624 million. 
</P>
<P>
 GM officials said the best indication of its improvement is in the 
3.6-percentage-point increase in its gross profit margin -- revenue minus costs 
before interest and taxes, as a percent of total sales. It moved from 14.6% a 
year ago to 18.2% in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an indication that the cost-cutting measures are working pretty good," 
Wagoner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the net profit margin in North America was only 2%, excluding the 
special charge. Though a big improvement from a year ago -- when the operations 
lost money -- it was below the 5% margin the company seeks worldwide and now 
meets in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are short of the superior margins we are looking for in a strong sales 
environment," President and Chief Executive Jack F. Smith said.

PRUDENTIAL OFFERS TO REHIRE EXECUTIVE WHO CITED FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prudential Insurance Co. of America today offered to reinstate a fired 
executive who claimed the company defrauded investors by overstating the value 
of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's biggest insurer also said it asked two executives in its real 
estate division -- Charles Lightner and Mark Clarke -- to resign and that it 
has changed its appraisal process for $3 billion worth of real estate assets in 
investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The appraisal procedures clearly do not reflect the way the Prudential should 
do business with our customers," Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Winters 
said in a letter to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The whistle-blower, Mark Jorgenson, told superiors that Prudential defrauded 
investors in the $2.3-billion Prudential Investment Separate Account, or Prisa. 
The company fired the 15-year employee in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Winters commended Jorgenson in his letter. "He took a risk and he stood up for 
what he believed in," the letter says. "That sort of courage and conviction is 
welcome at the Prudential." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorgenson was managing director in charge of Prisa until he was demoted late 
last year, before he was fired. He declined Prudential's invitation to return 
to the company. In a statement, he said he has decided to relocate in 
California for "personal reasons not involved with this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential reached a cash settlement with Jorgenson, a Prudential official 
said, but he would not disclose the amount. The company also expects to pay 
Prisa investors about $50 million for overcharging them as a result of the 
overstated values. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Zinngrabe will replace Lightner as chief executive of Prudential Real 
Estate Investors, Prudential said. Clarke had succeeded Jorgenson at Prisa. 
</P>
<P>
 The company appointed a panel headed by Gerald Corrigan, the former chief 
executive and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to recommend 
additional steps "needed to bring the Prudential Asset Management Group up to 
the highest standards of fiduciary duty." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Prudential agreed to form a Prisa advisory council to be made up 
of Prisa clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes follow a review of Prudential's investment plans for institutional 
investors by Kenneth Leventhal & Co. Jorgenson prompted the review last 
November by filing a lawsuit against the company in which he protested that he 
was demoted after he complained to superiors about the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these issues came to our attention, we commissioned an aggressive, 
independent review to determine the facts," Winters said in the letter. "I 
firmly believe our response to this issue underscores our fundamental 
commitments to our clients and to meeting the highest ethical standard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leventhal report is another embarrassment for Prudential, which prides 
itself on adhering to high ethical standards and service to its 50 million 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, its Prudential Securities Inc. subsidiary agreed to pay $371 
million to settle charges that it used fraudulent sales tactics in selling $8 
billion of limited partnerships in the 1980s.

SEC JOINS HUNT FOR $10 MILLION MISSING FROM INVESTMENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating First Pension Corp., a 
bankrupt pension fund investment firm, looking for as much as $10 million known 
to be missing, the company's trustee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking regulators reportedly have found at least $350,000 of the missing 
money in a Singapore bank, officials involved in the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty solid that the money was transferred there," said James Joseph, 
the Los Angeles lawyer appointed as First Pension's bankruptcy trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing SEC policy, agency spokeswoman Lori Richards would neither confirm nor 
deny that her office is investigating Irvine-based First Pension, but Joseph 
said he met with four SEC lawyers at company offices Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension invested about $350 million for about 8,000 private individuals, 
many of them from Southern California. The money was placed mainly in 
second-trust deeds. First Pension filed for liquidation last Friday in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana. It remains unclear what has happened to the 
investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy filing came a day after the custodian for investors' money, 
Summit Trust Co. of Englewood, Colo., was seized by state regulators -- after 
the institution's president told them that about $10 million had been 
transferred without his authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension and Summit are controlled by Villa Park businessman William E. 
Cooper. Cooper's lawyer, Milan Smith in Torrance, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is the second federal agency to become involved. FBI officials earlier 
this week said they were investigating First Pension, but they would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, meanwhile, dozens of worried investors gathered outside First 
Pension's locked office Thursday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bradshaw, a 64-year-old graphics designer, said he is owed $6,000 in 
dividend payments. He said he and others banged on the office doors until a 
woman emerged. She told them that neither Cooper nor any other executive was 
available to answer their questions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she didn't know where any of the records were," said Bradshaw, who 
is also a limited partner in First Diversified Financial Services, the holding 
company for First Pension. "I have a right to those records," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Joseph and the SEC investigators were in the closed office more than 
an hour, then left without speaking to the waiting investors.

SUBSIDIES SET FOR U.S. FLAT-PANEL MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon unveiled a $580-million, five-year subsidy program for producers 
of flat-panel display screens, which are used on laptop computers and are 
quickly moving into a broad range of products. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Japanese holding 95% of the world market for such screens, the 
Pentagon said it is important to ensure that domestic suppliers can meet the 
needs of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department plans to spend $96 million in the current fiscal year 
and increase that to $142 million by 1998. The money will be split between 
basic product research and development of high-volume production. 
</P>
<P>
 The program represents the Clinton Administration's boldest step to date into 
an industrial policy meant to ensure an adequate base to support military 
needs, according to Kenneth S. Flamm, principle deputy assistant secretary of 
defense. He said the Pentagon is generating the subsidies to ensure it access 
to the market.  
</P>
<P>
 Flamm said the goal of the program is to enable U.S. firms to build at least 
four large-scale, flat-panel production plants that would capture 15% of the 
world market. RALPH VARTABEDIAN

 AT&T Corp. Signs Agreement With China: The company said it has won a 
long-sought contract to be a prime supplier of telecommunications equipment and 
services in China -- perhaps the world's largest market, with its 1.2 billion 
people and few telephones.AT&T would not give a value for the new agreement, 
which calls for the company to invest more than $150 million in China over 24 
months. An executive would say only that it is "worth billions of dollars, over 
time." China, which has two phone lines for every 100 people, wants to increase 
that to eight lines per 100 people by 2000, and to 40 lines per 100 by 2020, 
AT&T said.

 Football Gives Fox Affiliate Boost: Fox Broadcasting Co. said its recently 
signed four-year National Football Conference contract has provided the network 
with opportunities to sign up 42 affiliates over the last four months.However, 
virtually all of the new affiliations are in small and medium-sized markets 
where Fox did not yet have an outlet carrying its programs. The additions 
include 14 primary affiliates -- stations signed exclusively to Fox -- and 28 
secondary affiliates -- stations that carry Fox programming in addition to 
shows from other broadcast networks. Fox said the expansion has boosted its 
coverage area to 96% of all viewing households.

 Two-Thirds of Euro Disney Banks Back Rescue Plan: The banks have accepted a 
financial package that will cut the debt of the cash-starved theme park outside 
Paris, and allow it to continue operating, an official at one of Euro Disney's 
main banks said. Euro Disney, owing $3.65 billion and faced with a cash crisis 
due to weak consumer spending, mapped out a rescue plan last month with its 
U.S. parent, Burbank-based Walt Disney Co., and its 63 creditor banks.The plan 
includes debt payment forgiveness and deferral of principal payments that will 
help Euro Disney regain a firm footing. Walt Disney Co. is also making 
concessions, such as waiving royalty and management fees for five years and 
reducing their amounts in subsequent years.

 Continental to Drop Meals on Short Hops: The airline will discontinue the 
service on domestic flights of less than 2 1/2 hours starting 
Sunday.Continental said dropping meals could save consumers up to $40 per 
flight. "Serving meals runs counter to any airline's ability to deliver the low 
fare that short-distance travelers say is their first priority," the carrier 
said. Continental's move is the latest effort by airlines to shave costs amid 
competition from low-cost start-up carriers. Southwest Airlines does not serve 
meals on its flights, but it does offer snacks.

 United-Lufthansa Alliance Gets Final Approval: The U.S. Department of 
Transportation gave its final approval for a code-sharing alliance between 
United Airlines and Lufthansa German Airlines, an arrangement that lets the two 
carriers sell each other's flights.Approval had been expected since March 18, 
when the United States and Germany signed an aviation agreement allowing the 
two carriers to move ahead with their joint marketing plans. Airlines covet 
code sharing because it allows quick access to foreign markets. For passengers, 
using the service is like linking flights on the same airline.

 U.S. Joins Whistle-Blower's Suit Against Rockwell: The U.S. attorney's office 
in Los Angeles said it joined the civil suit filed in 1992 by a former Rockwell 
machinist, David Vosoughkia, who worked in the company's Downey plant.His suit 
alleges that Rockwell charged to the NASA space shuttle program labor costs for 
employees who had actually been working on other programs. Seal Beach-based 
Rockwell, NASA's prime contractor, said its own investigation of the 
allegations "did not find any evidence of wrongdoing." But Rockwell added that 
it had received only limited information from the government because the suit, 
which seeks unspecified damages, was sealed for more than a year.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FUND INVESTORS RETURN TO STOCKS AS BONDS SUFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Small investors are trickling back into stock mutual funds, despite Wall 
Street's wild ride in recent months. But frightened investors continue to exit 
bond funds, as the pain of declining share prices caused by rising market 
interest rates overwhelms the lure of higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The polar difference in investors' treatment of stock funds and bond funds is 
reinforcing an idea that fund companies have been loath to discuss publicly: In 
stock funds, most people at least claim to be long-term investors. But bond 
funds may just be temporary parking places for interest rate opportunists. If 
true, that's a big potential problem for the wounded bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, fund executives say money has begun to flow back into their 
U.S. and foreign stock funds after a brief interruption in late March, when 
interest rates rocketed and stock prices dove. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the new cash entering stock funds has been seasonal -- 
individual retirement account contributions for 1993 were due by April 15 -- 
many fund firms say stock fund demand has picked up from non-retirement buyers 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that surprised me was that (stock fund inflows) were real strong up 
to April 15 and then beyond," said Andrew Ziegler, president of the 
Milwaukee-based Strong Funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, at the Kemper Financial funds in Chicago, share purchases overall 
are up in April over March's depressed levels, thanks largely to improved 
demand for stock funds, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Purchases of international stock funds have been particularly strong in April 
at many fund companies, despite the deep declines in Asian, Latin American and 
other overseas markets this year. That suggests many investors continue to 
adhere to the concept of buying stocks on dips -- not just U.S. stocks, but 
foreign ones as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Scudder Funds in Boston, purchases of international stock funds "are 
booming once again," said spokesman Gavin Quill. The company's international 
funds saw a net $8-million outflow in March (i.e., that was the difference 
between total purchases and total redemptions in the month), but this month 
those funds attracted a net $90-million inflow, Quill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Scudder's Latin American stock fund, which has dropped about 6% in value 
this year, has attracted a net inflow of $7 million this month after losing $9 
million in March, Quill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Institute, which reports total fund cash flows on a 
one-month-lag basis, issued numbers Thursday showing that stock funds in March 
still attracted more money than they lost via redemptions, despite Wall 
Street's plunge at month's end. The ICI said net new cash flow into stock funds 
was $6.7 billion in March, down from $14.4 billion in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond funds, on the other hand, experienced a huge net outflow of money in 
March. The funds' net cash flow was a negative $7.7 billion, a dramatic 
reversal from the big inflows during much of 1993 and the largest one-month 
outflow since $8.4 billion fled bond funds in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, most fund companies say their bond funds continued to see net 
outflows, though the pace appeared to slow. Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, 
Pa., says its taxable (government and corporate) bond funds had a net outflow 
of $370 million this month, down from a $770-million net outflow in March. But 
at Scudder, investor redemptions have sliced 3% from taxable bond assets this 
month, versus a 2.5% drop in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bright spot in bonds, some fund firms say, is that tax-exempt 
municipal bond funds' cash flows turned slightly positive in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any improvement in bond funds' cash flows is sustainable remains to be 
seen. With every upward turn in interest rates -- and further erosion in bond 
fund share prices -- we may discover that bond fund owners are far more 
interested in preservation of their capital than in reaping higher interest 
returns. And if the current $735 billion in bond funds continues to drain away, 
forcing fund managers to sell bonds, the upward pressure on long-term interest 
rates may not dissipate soon. 
</P>

GENERAL NUTRITION PENALIZED OVER AD CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Nutrition Inc. agreed Thursday to pay $2.4 million in civil penalties 
to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that the vitamin and food 
supplement retailer violated terms of two previous agreements with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest civil penalty for violating an advertising order in the 
commission's history," said Christian White, acting director of the FTC's 
Bureau of Consumer Protection. "We charged that GNC made a wide variety of 
deceptive claims, running across the spectrum of products commonly found in 
health food stores." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, the retail division of General Nutrition Cos. of Pittsburgh, 
failed to prove claims it made for more than 40 products covering disease 
treatment, weight loss, muscle building, increased endurance and hair loss, the 
FTC said. The claims were made in advertising, promotions and catalogue sales, 
the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FTC is dead serious about attacking deceptive advertising for dietary 
supplements and purported health remedies," White said. However, consumers must 
also be  
</P>
<P>
 responsible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a claim seems too good to be true, don't believe it," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company denied the charges but agreed to settle the case to avoid 
litigation costs, said William Watts, president and chief executive of General 
Nutrition Cos. The entire settlement is covered by reserves taken during the 
year ended Feb. 6, 1993, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While GNI believes that, at all times, it operated in material compliance 
with the orders, GNI entered into the settlement to avoid protracted 
litigation," Watts wrote in a letter to shareholders. General Nutrition intends 
to ask the FTC to clarify the 1970 agreement and modify the 1989 agreement, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC originally wanted $6 million to resolve the dispute, according to a 
filing General Nutrition made with the Securities and Exchange Commission last 
July. At the time, the company contended that amount was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 General Nutrition's stock added 12.5 cents to close at $24.25 Thursday on 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said it was particularly concerned by misrepresentations about the 
benefits of vitamin supplements in losing weight or building muscle.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CLAUDIA ELLER: NEW DUTIES LIKELY FOR KATZENBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the rough-and-tumble world of Team Disney, one of the late Frank G. Wells' 
many unrecorded acts was mediating confrontations between Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner and studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, whose long-running partnership has 
been punctuated by more than a few flare-ups. Now, as Katzenberg charts his 
future at Disney, Wells' presence may be missed more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney president's death in a helicopter crash this month contributed to a 
corporate shakeout that has so far resulted in the ouster of Hollywood Pictures 
head Ricardo Mestres and the ascent Thursday of David Hoberman to a job 
supervising all three of the company's movie divisions: Walt Disney Pictures, 
Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoberman's promotion to president of motion pictures ostensibly paves the way 
for Katzenberg to take on broader corporate responsibilities -- but just how 
broad is unclear. While Katzenberg and Sanford M. Litvack, executive vice 
president for law and human resources, are the inside favorites to assume many 
of Wells' former duties, sources close to the company say it may be months 
before Eisner fully resolves Disney's new structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still mending our wounds here," said one senior Disney executive. 
"Everyone is pitching in on a lot of different fronts. But to consider any of 
those things permanent is like playing Michael's cards before he's even decided 
to deal the deck." 
</P>
<P>
 While no one is expected to succeed Wells outright, Katzenberg could take up 
some of the slack. At 43, he's considered one of the industry's savviest 
executives. But after 10 years of running the factory-like studio, he's also 
clearly restless. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising the successful Broadway production of "Beauty and the Beast" was 
one temporary distraction. In other moves that may be intended to mollify the 
studio boss, Eisner has quietly given Katzenberg control of the company's 
non-performing Hollywood Records division. New technology, where Disney lags 
behind many of its multimedia competitors, has also been added to Katzenberg's 
kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuing Hollywood Records would be a major coup, because the start-up company 
has been a spectacular failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Katzenberg well say he will manage the record label with the 
same intensity as he's managed the studio. Said one source: "He's going to go 
out there and romance music lawyers and music agents and talent. That Hollywood 
Records was a disaster used to burn him up. He always complained he had no 
input. Now he will." 
</P>
<P>
 But some see even more opportunity for Katzenberg in new technology if he can 
persuade Eisner, a self-professed technophobe, to make a significant 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney was said to be close to a deal with one of the Baby Bells last month, 
before it fell apart for unknown reasons. Virgin Interactive worked with Disney 
on the "Aladdin" video game and is creating another game tied to this summer's 
"The Lion King." Another possible partner is Nintendo, which wants to position 
itself as the "family" video game company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources, however, are skeptical of just how far Eisner will allow 
Katzenberg to stray from the core studio operation. In a recent interview with 
The Times, Eisner intimated that he wanted Katzenberg to remain in a hands-on, 
"detail-oriented" capacity at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Katzenberg's associates said that even though his role is expanding, 
"Eisner still looks at Jeffrey as his golden retriever." And Disney insiders 
say Katzenberg is still very much involved in signing off on scripts, big stars 
and directors. One of Katzenberg's current quests is to sign a deal with the 
new production team of Michael Douglas and Steve Reuther. Disney's arch 
nemesis, Warner Bros., is also chasing the highly regarded producers. 
</P>
<P>
 While Katzenberg and studio President Richard H. Frank will continue to 
oversee Caravan Pictures, Miramax Films, feature animation and distribution and 
marketing, Hoberman is supposed to take on much of the day-to-day 
responsibility for movie operations in his new post. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the executive -- who formerly headed the Touchstone and Disney 
banners -- has been guaranteed the autonomy to make whatever films he chooses 
as long as the financial risk is covered, and as long as "Jeffrey and Michael 
don't absolutely hate the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoberman says his first goal is to revive Hollywood Pictures, which had a 
string of failures at the box office. Insiders say Michael Lynton, an executive 
at Disney's Hyperion publishing division, is Hoberman's first choice to run 
Hollywood. Lynton and Katzenberg, who have never met, are scheduled to get 
together Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoberman is also known to be committed to doing more movies with major stars 
and directors. "He wants to be in business with all the big names," said one 
knowledgeable source. "And he wants to do action movies. He feels big action 
films are less risky than bad concept movies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given Katzenberg's legendary aversion to big stars and directors, some people 
at Disney are hoping he'll be too busy making interactive deals and searching 
for the next Snoop Doggy Dogg to interfere with Hoberman's plans. They're also 
hoping he can keep the peace with Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are both huge pieces of business for him to lead the way on," one 
colleague said hopefully.

HOLLYWOOD IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN POLITICAL 'SOFT MONEY' GAME; CONTRIBUTIONS: 
INDIVIDUALS, PACS GAVE NEARLY $7 MILLION IN PAST DECADE, COMMON CAUSE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite coming out on the losing end on issues such as the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade and cable re-regulation, the hard fact is that Hollywood's 
heavyweights like to give the "soft money." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Common Cause report issued Thursday, the list of contributors 
who gave money to national political party committees -- contributions that are 
commonly called soft money -- during the past several years "reads like a who's 
who of the entertainment industry." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, nearly $4 million came from entertainment figures, including such 
prominent names as Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and MCA Inc. 
Chairman Lew R. Wasserman. Another $2.8 million came from entertainment 
industry-related political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman, a longtime political benefactor and confidant of Presidents, led 
among the studio executives and producers, with $357,730, Common Cause said. He 
was followed by movie and record executive Ted Field, who has been called one 
of the leading individual supporters of the Democratic Party, at $338,650. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Common Cause's list was former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis, at 
$410,000. Although well known in Hollywood, Davis doesn't fit the strict 
definition of an entertainment executive because his investments cover a broad 
range of areas, including real estate and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the leading Hollywood donors are known for backing Democratic

Republican support. Both are also well-known friends of former President George 
Bush. Producer Jerry Weintraub gave $140,000, according to the study, while 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga gave an even heftier 
$236,510.

million over the length of the study period. That included donations to 
telephone, computer and cable TV companies.

 Wasserman's MCA, which was acquired by Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial

entertainment companies.

 According to the study by the Washington-based group, MCA contributed $574,003 
between 1988 and 1993. Next was Time Warner Inc., at $568,333. Size didn't

FIRST PENSION FUNDS TRACED TO SINGAPORE; INVESTIGATION: BANKING REGULATORS FIND 
EVIDENCE OF WIRE TRANSFER FROM 'SOMEWHERE IN ORANGE COUNTY' OF SOME OF 
INVESTORS' MISSING $10 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Banking regulators trying to track down as much as $10 million that 
disappeared from First Pension Corp. have traced some of the money to a 
Singapore bank, a lawyer familiar with the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Joseph, the Los Angeles attorney who was appointed trustee for the 
bankrupt pension fund administration firm, said that regulators in Colorado 
have apparently found evidence of a wire transfer from "somewhere in Orange 
County" to Singapore in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty solid that the money was transferred there," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph also said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating 
First Pension, which filed for liquidation last Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
in Santa Ana. First Pension invested about $350 million for about 8,000 private 
investors, many of them in Southern California, mainly in second trust deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy filing came a day after the custodian for investors' money, 
Summit Trust Co. of Englewood, Colo., was seized by state regulators there 
after the institution's president told them that $10 million was transferred 
without his authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear Thursday what has happened to the investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing SEC policy, agency spokeswoman Lori Richards would neither confirm nor 
deny that her office is investigating First Pension. But Joseph said he met 
with four SEC lawyers at First Pension offices Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension and Summit are both controlled by Villa Park businessman William 
E. Cooper. Cooper's lawyer, Milan Smith in Torrance, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is the second federal agency to get involved. FBI officials said 
earlier this week said that they are investigating First Pension. They would 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, meanwhile, dozens of worried investors gathered outside First 
Pension's locked office Thursday morning, hoping to learn anything they could 
about where their money is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had some answers," said one man who invested $26,000 through the 
company. "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bradshaw, a 64-year-old graphic designer who said he is owed $6,000 in 
dividend payments, said he and others banged on the locked doors until a woman 
emerged. She told them that neither Cooper nor other executives were available 
to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she didn't know where any of the records were," said Bradshaw, who 
is also a limited partner in First Diversified Financial Services, the holding 
company for First Pension. "I have a right to those records." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw said that Joseph and the SEC investigators were in the closed office 
for more than an hour, then left without speaking to the assembled investors. 
</P>
<P>
 William Burd, the Santa Ana lawyer hired by Cooper to file First Pension's 
bankruptcy petition, said he was unaware of the connection between his client 
and Summit Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was given less than adequate information," he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burd said he had scheduled a meeting with trustee Joseph, Cooper and other 
First Pension officers for Tuesday, but their personal attorneys instructed 
them not to attend, so the session was canceled.

THIS ROCKWELL SECRETARY IS EPITOME OF CONFIDENTIAL; CAREERS: EXECUTIVE'S AIDE 
KNOWS HOW TO KEEP A BUSINESS SECRET -- AND DOES IT. SHE HAS HER BOSS'S 
CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They say that if you want to know what's really going on at a company, you 
should ask a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to know what's going on at Rockwell and you ask Sondra 
Williams, don't expect her to tell you. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has spent 27 years with the Seal Beach defense company, the last six 
as executive secretary to Sam Iacobellis, the Rockwell executive vice president 
known for overseeing development and production of the B-1 Bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Her secret to success: keeping secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides fielding calls from the White House, Congress, Gov. Pete Wilson, NASA 
and hordes of top corporate executives, Williams must often handle confidential 
material, either related to Rockwell's top-secret governmental projects or, 
these days, to impending Rockwell layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be discreet and make sure you don't say the wrong thing. It's 
very hard to do," Williams said. "Especially because people come up to you and 
say, 'I heard a rumor about some layoffs in one of the divisions and you have 
to say: 'Oh, I don't know anything about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But her boss has complete faith in Williams' ability to maintain 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the best, a top professional. Anything she knows, I never worry about 
getting out. People know they shouldn't try to probe. In the strictest sense 
she is a confidential secretary," Iacobellis said. "She has good judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 From her ocean-view office stocked with so many aircraft models it looks like 
an air and space museum, Williams keeps track of and arranges Iacobellis' 
chaotic travel schedule. Always on call, she often receives calls at home from 
top executives trying to track down Iacobellis, who oversees not only major 
programs like the Space Shuttle and B-1, but works actively in many 
organizations, including those involved in business retention like the 
California Chamber of Commerce and the California Business Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
 Once when he was in New York, she received a late-afternoon call from the 
White House, requesting that Iacobellis be there the next day for an 
announcement. Knowing he was dining in New York, she immediately made travel 
arrangements for him to fly to Washington the next morning, then faxed him his 
new agenda at the hotel. He called her at home when he got in from dinner, 
pleased she had taken the initiative to make travel plans, knowing he would not 
turn down a White House invite. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took the job as a high-level secretary, I knew that would be expected 
of me," Williams said. "The hardest thing is finding enough time to do all the 
things that need to be done, because everything I do reflects on the company, 
my boss and me. I'm a hard worker, dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also has the ability and the authorization to make judgments on her 
own. Several months ago, the state of Kansas made a big push to entice Rockwell 
to its borders, sending Iacobellis a letter signed by the Kansas governor every 
other week, then following up with a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Williams told the governor's office: "I hate to tell you this, but he 
is working to keep companies in California. You are wasting your time and 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams can't always be so forthright. Even this week there is something 
confidential that she knows about an international trade matter, which would 
have an impact if it was made public. 
</P>
<P>
 That she knows about it came out while she was being interviewed for this 
article. Rockwell's public relations person, trying to make points with the 
interviewer, pressed Williams, asking if the matter truly was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't say," said Williams, smiling apologetically.

million, or $1.38 a share, for last year's first quarter, which included a 
one-time gain of $15.1 million from an accounting change. Downey said that,

FAITH, HOPE, CHASTITY; THOUSANDS OF TEEN-AGERS ARE EMBRACING A NEW CHRISTIAN 
ABSTINENCE PROGRAM. WHY? MANY LONG FOR MORAL CERTAINTIES. ALSO, "SEX IS NOW A 
MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On a recent Sunday, 39 teen-agers promised to remain virgins. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives with video cameras edged in for close-ups of the girls in white 
dresses and boys in shirts and ties as they recited their vows. Younger 
brothers and sisters balanced on tiptoes to get a better view. And after the 
ceremony, the whole congregation of St. Stephen's Baptist Church in La Puente 
gave a blast of applause. 
</P>
<P>
 In the name of their Christian faith, a small but growing number of teen-agers 
are pledging to save sex for their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 The vow seals their membership in True Love Waits, an abstinence program 
introduced last year by Baptist minister Richard Ross of Nashville, Tenn. His 
is not the first campaign of its kind, but it certainly is the most visible. 
With rallies, ceremonies, T-shirts and wallet-size pledge cards, True Love 
Waits has ignited the zeal of teen-agers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard about it in Sunday school and I thought it was a cool idea," said 
Jennifer Sutherland, 14, who was among 31 young people to recently take the vow 
at El Toro Baptist Church in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the program has spread quickly. Along with his duties as youth pastor 
of Tulip Grove Baptist Church, Ross serves as consultant to the national 
Baptist Sunday School Board. From that launch pad, he promoted the program, and 
the response was swift. Within two weeks, True Love Waits went 
interdenominational. About a dozen conservative Christian communities, 
including the Pentecostal and the Assemblies of God churches, have endorsed it. 
The Roman Catholic Church also signed on. Next, Baptist missionaries will take 
it to South America, Africa and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most teen-agers learn about the campaign at Christian youth conferences that 
attract thousands -- from Anaheim to Orlando, Fla., from Falls Creek, Okla., to 
Spokane, Wash. Not everyone at a mega-meeting takes a vow. Still, half a 
million youths 12 to 19 are expected to sign pledge cards by summer's end. At a 
Youth for Christ rally scheduled for July in Washington, D.C., the cards will 
be driven into the National Mall like so many stakes in a garden.  
</P>
<P>
 The seeds being planted are already blossoming in unexpected ways. Some single 
parents, even those raised in the free-love '60s, have promised to give up 
their liberal dating habits in support of their children's pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think our values are changing," said Jim Christensen, 14, during Sunday 
school class in El Toro. "This isn't a fad. People are starting to wise up." 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Joe Howard, 17, seemed less certain. "In the crevices of their mind, 
I think teen-agers know abstinence is the solution," he said, counting unwanted 
pregnancy and AIDS first among the dangers of an active sex life. Still, he 
concluded, "it's not the popular position." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, such discussions were unheard of in most Sunday schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my church, there wasn't even a thought of talking about issues of sex," 
said E. Wilbert McCall, pastor at St. Stephen's. "Churches have changed. You 
have to talk about these things. Back then, we didn't have to worry about the 
problems kids have today. Sex is now a matter of life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said the timing for True Love Waits is right for two reasons: "Our 
concern about the consequences of teen-age sexual activity is overwhelming. And 
what we've done about it so far is not working." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent government statistics show that 54% of high school students 
have had sexual intercourse. One in 10 girls ages 15 to 19 becomes pregnant 
each year. And 86% of all sexually transmitted diseases are contracted by 15- 
to 29-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, young people are putting off marriage; the average age is 24 
for women and 26 for men. So a 14-year-old who vows to be chaste may have a 
long time to test the strength of that commitment. For this and other reasons, 
educators from both the religious and public sectors question the practicality 
of Ross' program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with abstinence, we need to supply kids with information about sexually 
transmitted disease and contraception," said Amy Hasselton, a director of 
education for Planned Parenthood. "Vows of chastity break more often than 
condoms." 
</P>
<P>
 Others worry that teen-agers won't be able to keep their promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "If youths don't have the skills to say no, a vow's not going to help them a 
whole lot," said Gilbert Rodriguez, youth director for St. Peter's Catholic 
Church in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Howe, a minister at the interdenominational Emmanuel Church in Burbank 
and a local director of the Christian club Young Life, is considering the True 
Love Waits program for his group. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a rally and get kids charged up isn't a bad thing," he said. "My 
guess is it works best for kids who've been trained in these values for a long 
time." Many of the kids in his group have not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is," he continued, "do you want to do something that looks 
really great but doesn't reach the kids on a personal level? We want them to 
adopt the values, first." 
</P>
<P>
 Young Life members discussed chastity vows at their recent weekly 
get-together. Several girls said they had made a private promise to God, as a 
gesture of self-respect. But they also agreed with 16-year-old Rebecca 
Nassaney's conclusion: "Other kids would probably say it's nice for somebody 
else, but it's not for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Gordillo, 16, doubted that he would take a vow. "It's unrealistic, in 
the society we live in," he said. "A person would have to be really strong in 
their convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Stephen's Sunday school teacher Alice Wallace has a quick response to such 
objections: "Take it off your shoulders. Tell your date, 'I would love to spend 
the night with you, but the God I serve is holy. And for God's sake I don't do 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't work? "We talk about what happens if someone breaks the vow," 
Wallace said. "I teach them about forgiveness and encourage them to pray for 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls who attend El Toro Baptist Church said they feel pressured to become 
sexually active. "Pressured, from guys, from television," said Chantal 
Armstrong, 14. "The input is sex, sex, sex." Boys feel it too. "It's not studly 
to be a virgin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments such as these encouraged Ross to launch his program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message teen-agers are receiving from parents, educators and 
policy-makers is 'we expect you to be sexually active.' Not that adults intend 
that. It's the way teens are reading it. The inference in the media, in movies, 
is that teen-agers are sexually active. They feel almost obliged to fulfill 
adults' expectations."  
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, sex frightens most teen-agers, said Los Angeles psychiatrist 
Mark Goulston. "It's too close, too scary. But if you're going to be the only 
virgin in your high school, you might have sex because of the peer pressure."  
</P>
<P>
 He believes that chastity vows offer a solution: "They give kids permission to 
be innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 True Love Waits organizers have filled 63,000 requests from pastors and youth 
directors for the curriculum. It outlines classes for parents and teen-agers to 
take together, as well as some for teen-agers to take alone. Each relies on 
Scripture readings that support sexual purity, lasting commitments and family 
values. The program ends with the church ceremony where the young people, more 
than half of them girls, make this pledge: 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, 
those I date, my future mate and my future children to be sexually pure until 
the day I enter a covenant marriage relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 Although True Love Waits is attracting the most attention, similar abstinence 
programs exist. One of the oldest is Campus Crusade, a Christian organization 
founded in 1951. Among the newest is the non-religious Athletes for Abstinence, 
founded by basketball player A.C. Green. In addition, California law holds that 
abstinence must be emphasized in the public schools' sex education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Karyn Johnson of Downey promotes abstinence on a smaller scale through her 
Garden Enclosed purity seminars. Johnson, who serves as director of an adoption 
service outreach program for Calvary Chapel, views chastity as a new form of 
sexual liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is almost like the early days of feminism. I talk to groups of girls who 
say, 'I want control. I can say no.' "  
</P>
<P>
 But even some conservatives say vows are not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's chaos out there, young people are rootless," said Lisa Sowle Cahill, 
professor of theology at Boston College and author of "Sex, Gender and 
Christian Ethics." She blames America's lust for personal freedom, which keeps 
us from exploring shared common values. Protecting free choice even affects 
family life, she said: "We find it difficult to talk positive sexual ethics to 
our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "there is a vacuum in the culture," Cahill said. "Kids are caught 
between the Hollywood myth that everybody's doing it and the very vocal, 
conservative religious groups that give them messages they can't relate to. 
Chastity becomes something to glom onto." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross struggles with no such dilemmas. He simply proclaims a moral revolution 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "True Love Waits has given teen-agers a way to communicate their values to 
society at large," he said. "These are virgins with an attitude."

LAUGH LINES; AT NEW NETWORK, 'HEEERE'S (YOUR NAME HERE)!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY ZEZIMA, THE STAMFORD ADVOCATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last thing America needs -- aside, of course, from People Who Dump Their 
Spouses to Marry Farm Animals, on the next "Geraldo!" -- is another talk-show 
host. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't stopped the good folks at America's Talking, the new all-talk 
cable network, from conducting a nationwide search for the next Maury or Leeza. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I possess what I feel is the most important qualification -- I am 
completely devoid of any shame or self-respect -- I figure I'm the man for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove it, I went to New York to audition for the America's Talking Talk 
Search Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you have been preoccupied with the plight of Adopted Dysfunctional 
Children of Cross-Dressing Stamp Collectors With Glue Addictions, on the next 
"Jenny Jones," you have probably heard about this. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't, here's the deal: America's Talking, which will be 
launched on July 4, is looking for an allegedly normal person to host an 
exciting national show. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspiring hosts must either show up for auditions in one of 10 cities or make 
audition tapes at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants will be judged on such things as creativity and originality of 
suggested show, personality and likability of the host, ability to communicate 
with guests, and (this is the one that probably dooms me) general intelligence 
and knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner, who will be chosen by a panel of celebrity judges and America's 
Talking executives, gets a one-year contract for $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I was required to take a vow of poverty when I went into journalism, 
the money sort of appealed to me. So I bought a blank videotape and headed down 
to New York, where I immediately noticed that approximately 19,000 people were 
ahead of me in line. 
</P>
<P>
 I exaggerate, of course. (Men With Acute Exaggeration Disorder, on the next 
"Jane Whitney.") Actually, I was No. 38, which meant I would have to wait at 
least four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 This gave me plenty of time to: (A) have lunch, which consisted of a bacon 
cheese hot dog, an order of french fries and not one but two live bugs (no 
kidding), and (B) watch the other contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 One was a psychobabbler who nearly put himself and everyone else to sleep. 
Another was a foul-mouthed, ratty-haired screamer who almost blew out the sound 
system. There was the guy who interviewed himself (some contestants brought 
their own guests). There was the woman who pulled someone from the audition 
line and pretended the stranger was Martha Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Talea, an Oprah wannabe who talked about people who pick their 
noses. And Linda Pendergraft, who brought a bag of props, including a giant 
baby bottle "for all the men of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of this madness, Elizabeth Tilson, vice president of programming 
for America's Talking, was being stalked by a wild-eyed wacko who wanted her to 
personally view his tape. (Serial Talk-Show Contestants, on the next "Richard 
Bey.") 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was my turn. After being introduced by the mistress of ceremonies, 
I looked straight into the camera and said I deserved a talk show because (A) I 
am shameless and (B) I really need the money. The audience liked this. They 
also appreciated it when I said that because Bisexual Space Aliens With Fallen 
Arches and People Who Date Their Pets had already been taken by all the other 
talk shows, my show would be devoted to People With No Major Personal Problems. 
I added that my show ("Jerry!") would be named after me. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, because I didn't bring my own guest, I brought up Rose and interviewed 
her, asking such probing questions as: "Why don't you have your own talk show?" 
Rose said she didn't know, but if she does get one, I'm her first guest. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, I didn't humiliate myself, which may work against me. All I can do 
now is mail my tape to America's Talking Talk Search Contest and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I am planning my first show: Shameless Newspaper Columnists Who 
Want To Be Talk-Show Hosts -- on the next "Jerry!"Tarking: Free.

O.C. HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; PAIN AND HOPE; REAL PROBLEMS WON'T JUST 
DISAPPEAR, BUT LISTENING CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARA CARCOURA, Lara Carcoura is a sophomore at St. Margaret's High School in 
San Juan Capistrano, where this article first appeared in the student 
newspaper, the Silent Majority. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Suicide is something many teen-agers hear about, talk about and think about. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that suicide claims more lives among 10- to 19-year-olds than 
anything except accidents and homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question: How to prevent it? That is nearly impossible. To prevent 
suicide, one would have to completely lift the stress of everyday teen-age life 
caused by problems with grades, relationships, family or just the feeling of 
growing up too fast. This would mean not requiring kids to go to school and 
putting us in isolation from the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that problems -- along with occasional depression -- are part 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 So we might as well stop complaining about the problems we can't avoid and 
start thinking about managing them better. No problem has ever been solved by 
ignorance or overreaction, and nothing will ever get solved with extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 A gut instinct when we run into a problem is to run away from it, but sooner 
or later we realize that we just have to face it.  
</P>
<P>
 People say counseling usually helps. But when people (especially teen-agers) 
attempt or think about suicide, the last thing they want to do is go to some 
strange old shrink with a beard telling them that everything will be OK. It 
seems more logical to go to a friend or family member you know well and trust.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying psychiatrists shouldn't be trusted, but it's hard to completely 
trust someone the first time you meet them.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was a freshman at another high school, I had a friend who slit her 
wrists during lunch period, for no apparent reason. She was bleeding through 
her shirt, and I really didn't know what to do. So I told a teacher. My friend 
was taken to a doctor and later got counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 Another friend, who was a lot closer to me, left a suicide note in my locker 
and then disappeared for a day. I got scared, but eventually she turned up OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age suicide isn't something we can run away from. It's going to happen to 
someone we know or to a celebrity we look up to. If a person really wants to 
commit suicide, it is doubtful they'll do it in front of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Most attempts are cries for help. Whether you chose to answer that cry is your 
decision but, chances are, if you hold out a branch for a person who's 
drowning, they'll grab on quicker than you expect.

 The toll suicide takes goes beyond the life lost. A national study of the 
impact of teen suicide found that it profoundly affects on average the lives of 
at least six others, including family, friends and classmates who are often 
left in shock, sorrow, confusion and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how suicide or thoughts of suicide have affected some Orange County 
teens. The names of all the students in this article have been changed to 
protect their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was Monday after school. Charles, a freshman, had an "ominous feeling" when 
he saw his friend walking alone. Charles usually walked home with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles continued on his way, not giving much more thought to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day at school, however, Charles' friend was not in class. The usual 
curiosity -- "I wonder what he's doing" -- swept through his thoughts. And then 
he became worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, a school psychologist stood in front of Charles' fifth-period 
class. She was there to tell the students that Charles' friend had committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of stories and rumors had been circulating around school. "So I didn't 
know exactly what happened," Charles said. But this is what the psychologist 
told the class: 
</P>
<P>
 It was 11:30 at night, and the family had gone to bed early. Charles' friend 
went to the family room. He knew how to use a gun. He loaded the gun with one 
bullet and shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The realization of what his friend had done made Charles feel horrible. Many 
thoughts crossed his mind: "OK, what do I do now? . . . I can't believe it's 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before his friend killed himself, Charles had been having troubles: His 
grades were falling, and he was having family conflicts, like many other teens. 
The death of his close friend didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles considered committing suicide. "I hated the world," he said. After the 
funeral, the psychologist spoke with Charles, but "I was afraid if I said 
anything I'd get in trouble."  
</P>
<P>
 Charles found comfort by talking with his friends. And a science teacher "was 
really nice, too. He told me not to do it." 
</P>
<P>

 Laura says she has contemplated suicide, but she's not as sure that she'd go 
through with it as she was a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything set me off, even little things," the sophomore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone told me my hair wasn't right, I'd think, 'Oh my gosh, I've got to 
go commit suicide.' I didn't feel necessary to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's still debating it, Laura says she now believes that she'll 
"think about what would happen if I did this." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Kathy was fed up with her life. Her mother was not often 
around, and the job of caring for herself and her sister fell on her shoulders. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided, OK, fine. If one last thing set me off, that was it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I started to commit suicide," the sophomore recalled. "But my sister took 
away my (sleeping) pills and flushed them down the toilet. I wanted to (do it), 
but I didn't. I was really scared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying to kill herself, Kathy decided it was time to make some changes 
in her life. She's one of the fortunate ones -- those with enough willpower and 
desire to improve their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did things that made me happy," Kathy said. "I moved to my dad's house and 
made a lot of friends. I cut my hair and wore the clothes that I liked. I did 
the things I liked to do. I have a lot more to live for now. Before, I just had 
myself to live for, and I decided it wasn't worth it. Now I feel a lot better 
about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on her suicide attempt, Kathy says that all that matters is what 
you think and not what everyone else thinks. "Think about your life; there will 
be many hurdles you'll have to jump. There are many things you can overcome. 
Just because this time you're climbing instead of jumping, it doesn't mean that 
you won't be able to jump the rest." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Because a life that seemed at its beginning has been lost, the tragedy of teen 
suicide is especially difficult to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County in 1992, the last year for which statistics are available, 
there were 10 suicides recorded among those age 18 or under: The youngest was 
age 12. In 1991, there were nine young suicides; in 1990, there were 14. Twice 
as many boys as girls took their lives. Countless more of both sexes attempted 
suicide.  
</P>
<P>
 Suicide counselors say teens sometimes look at extreme measures to relieve 
feelings of despair and emotional pain: They don't think they will ever get 
over the hurt they are feeling from a broken relationship, parental discord, 
substance abuse, pressure from peers, confusion over sexual roles or other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In those troubled waters, a hand held out in hope by a friend can sometimes 
make all the difference. Facts About Suicide 
</P>
<P>
 * Suicide is the third highest cause of teen-age deaths, following accidents 
and homicides, and has increased 200% among youths aged 10 to 24 since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1991, 4,751 youths age 15 to 24 took their own lives -- that's 13 deaths 
each day, or one young death every one hour and 50.6 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 * In a 1990 study of 11,631 U.S. students in ninth through 12th grades, 27.3% 
reported that they had thought seriously about attempting suicide; 16.3% said 
they had made a specific plan to attempt suicide. Of those, 8.3% said they had 
actually attempted suicide.  
</P>
<P>
 * Female students were significantly more likely than male students to have 
thought seriously about attempting suicide, to have made a suicide plan or to 
have attempted suicide one or more times during the year prior to the study. 
However, statistics show that more males than females actually commit suicide.  
</P>
<P>
 * Studies show that each suicide intimately affects at least six other people. 
If there is a suicide every 17 minutes (based on the national average for all 
ages), then there are six new survivors every 17 minutes as well. 
</P>
<P>

You Can Help 
</P>
<P>
 May 1-7 is National Suicide Prevention Week and serves as a reminder that 
there are things you can do to help a friend or family member who is deeply 
depressed or perhaps suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who are depressed or who are considering suicide may not want to 
talk about it. Some feel that their emotions are a burden to others or that 
others will make fun of them. What you can do is let them know you are there 
for them, will take them seriously and have time to listen when they feel like 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reassure them that they can get help and assist them in identifying where 
they can turn -- such as parents, counselor, teacher, doctor or a hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Help them realize that there is hope, that there is a reason to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your friend seems depressed without good reason, suggest a physical by a 
doctor. Depression can often be medically treated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Suggest counseling, which gives the person an impartial sounding board. 
Referrals are available through hot lines, doctors, school counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guard against the opportunity for a suicidal act by being with them when you 
can.

SHOULD WE ALL TAKE DOCTORS' POSITION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I never expected to find myself applauding the American Medical Assn., but I 
must voice appreciation for its ethical stand on banning physicians from 
participating in executions ("Doctors' Dilemma," April 5).  
</P>
<P>
 More praise should be heaped on those physicians like Dr. Robert Jones in 
Utah, or Dr. Dan Cashman (formerly of San Quentin) who, in increasing numbers, 
are refusing to participate in pronouncements of death after executions or the 
ludicrous act of determining the prisoner "sane" enough to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame that the rest of us aren't compelled to follow their lead by 
refusing to participate in our state killings. For like it or not, we are all 
participants in the act of taking another person's life, no matter how removed 
we may feel from the actual execution.

 Re "Doctors' Dilemma": 
</P>
<P>
 How come no quandary when it's abortion? 
</P>
<P>
 They reach inside a woman's uterus with forceps and rip out an unborn baby, 
but when it is a simple injection for a convicted murderer of another innocent 
human being then it's troubling because of their medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians usually try to preserve life, not end it, they say. How many 
executions must they participate in compared to the millions of innocent babies 
they kill? And this is not ethically troublesome to the AMA?

ARMIJO STOPS GOOSSEN IN SECOND ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Beach's John Armijo made an exciting, if not controversial, 
comeback Thursday night with a stunning second-round knockout of North 
Hollywood's Chuck Goossen that left the Irvine Marriott Ballroom crowd of 1,027 
cheering and jeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo (15-7), fighting his first bout in almost a year, spent much of the 
first round on the ropes taking hard combinations and giving little, if 
anything back. But early in the second round, he sent the charging Goossen 
(5-2) down with a straight left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen stood up at the count of eight but stumbled badly into the ropes as he 
tried to regain his balance. When referee Jose Cobian came over to Goossen, he 
asked him a question and then quickly stopped the bout 34 seconds into the 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I asked him if he was all right, he didn't respond and he was still 
leaning on the ropes," Cobian said. "His pupils were dilated. It's too bad. I'm 
not going to ruin his career, though. He can come back from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen said he thought he could have come back Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stopped it too soon," said Goossen, who weighed 141 pounds, same as 
Armijo. "They wanted the homeboy to win. I replied when he asked me if I was OK 
and said I was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo, ecstatic about his victory, wasn't about to question Cobian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised they stopped it, but that's not my job," said Armijo, who 
has lost 13 pounds since his last fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo said he was fortunate to survive the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit me with some good shots," he said. "They probably would have knocked 
most guys out. But I'm in the best shape of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 In the undercard, middleweight Rodney Toney (13-0-2) of Campo took out Luis 
Mejia of Santa Domingo in 53 seconds with a right hook. Jason Williams of Long 
Beach knocked Maurice Gray cold with a straight left hand at :48 of the second 
round.

AROUND TOWN: WHEN WE LOVED TO CURB OUR APPETITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They met on the assembly line at North American on the wing of a B-25 bomber. 
Around midnight, when the swing shift ended, they sometimes went on a date. 
Romance bloomed and, in 1943, they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, Olivia and Alphonse Heimann would tell their four children about 
their World War II-era courtship in Los Angeles. About burgers at Patmar's 
open-all-night drive-in in El Segundo and such places as Pan American Gardens 
in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Heimann, 45, a Culver City graphic designer and urban archeologist, had 
fond recollections of his parents' tales of L.A., about the drive-in and the 
culture it spawned. He yearned to "re-create something that for my generation 
never really existed." 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, he's been excavating prime archeological sites and sources -- 
swap meets, antique shops -- and collecting old scrapbooks, menus, matchbook 
covers, postcards and photographs. All this for "Car Hops and Curb Service," a 
fond and funny look back at this very American institution, scheduled to be 
published by Chronicle Books next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Heimann says, "There was a drive-in in virtually every town and city in 
the United States." California and the drive-in were meant for one another. We 
had the climate, the cars and the attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The eat-in-your-car thing began, he'll tell you, in 1921 at the Pig Stand near 
Dallas. A few years later, Tam o' Shanter on Los Feliz Boulevard introduced it 
to Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 The '30s and '40s saw an explosion of drive-ins. At their zenith in the '40s, 
they were a center of social life for the young. Where they went to see who was 
dating whom, to linger over a Coke and fries with ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, the drive-in was about cruising. It was not a place to be seen 
with your parents, God forbid. And it was not a place to be seen inside. 
</P>
<P>
 To rifle through Heimann's memorabilia is to journey back to a time when a 
Bob's Big Boy double-decker with salad and fries was 65 cents and a shrimp 
cocktail might set you back 45 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The slogans said it all: 
</P>
<P>
 Really Good Food Right in Your Car. Home of Chubby the Champ. Beautiful Girls 
to Serve You.  
</P>
<P>
 Heimann loves the menus, which were almost as rich as the food. Henry's, home 
of Chicken in the Rough, featured a golfing chicken in plaid plus-fours. 
</P>
<P>
 It was possible to get a salad at a drive-in (pineapple and cottage cheese, 
most likely), but calories and cholesterol abounded. Everything was fried. 
</P>
<P>
 One wartime menu patriotically pushed war bonds next to an apology for food 
shortages: "Our chef is doing his very best." And, oh yes, "Please do not ask 
for extra serving of butter." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive-in was more than just a place to eat. It was car hops in bell-bottom 
pants and nautical jackets or snappy braid-bedecked military outfits that 
became scantier as the years went on.  
</P>
<P>
 Drive-ins starred in films such as "American Graffiti," which looked at coming 
of age in the '60s with roller-skating car hops. But, Heimann says, "I've never 
found documentation that there were roller-skating car hops." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, gimmickry did abound. At "The Track" on Beverly Boulevard, 
customers pushed a button to order their food, which was delivered car-side by 
conveyor belt. It wasn't a big hit. After all, car hops were one reason for 
going to a drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
 There were circular drive-ins, neon-lit Art Deco drive-ins, streamlined 
drive-ins with lines like the convertibles.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the ultimate gimmick was an Indiana fly -in, for private airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a grand experience," going to the drive-in, Heimann says, "all 
kind of romantic." 
</P>
<P>
 The first car hops were men, but it wasn't long before owners discovered that 
a little cheesecake sold a lot of malts and shakes. 
</P>
<P>
 At one place in Texas, car hops were glittery majorettes who marched in 
cadence to loudspeaker music. House rules dictated that they carry their trays 
at ear level -- and no flirting with the patrons. Violators served car hop KP: 
Napkin-folding duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was seen as a glamour job. In 1940, a car hop made the cover of 
Life. Westways described car hops as "belles of the boulevards." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, they worked for mediocre wages (or just tips) and some had to pay 
for their own uniforms, as well as broken dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Car hop" wasn't just a catchy moniker. At one time, Heimann explains, they 
were expected to run out and hop onto running boards. "There was a mad dash to 
see who could get the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly to amuse patrons, car hops and cooks devised a lingo of their own: a 
"slashed cow" was a plain burger; a hot dog was a "bum pup." Milk was "Sweet 
Alice." 
</P>
<P>
 By the '50s, the drive-in was losing its luster. Families felt menaced by the 
kids who'd hang out there. The same space could be put to more profitable use 
as storefronts. But ultimately, says Heimann, "Fast foods killed it." 
</P>
<P>
 In and out, no socializing, no lingering. No car hops needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1984, Tiny Naylor's at Sunset and La Brea called it quits. It was 
L.A.'s last real drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With "Car Hops and Curb Service," Heimann hopes to put this cultural icon into 
"historical context," to set the record straight for those who think that 
today's retro-restaurants are what it was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he laments the death of the drive-in, he acknowledges that "I was 
definitely part of the problem." He recalls how, growing up in Westchester, he 
and his high school friends would cruise from the A & W on Hawthorne Boulevard 
to the Wich Stand at Slauson and Overland, car radio blaring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just cruised," he says. "We never spent." Alas, They Weren't Belles of the 
Ball 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's column, we visited the team of model Ina DiGrazia and florist 
Duane Rose as they readied their "Southern Romance" fantasy for Friday's Las 
Floristas Floral Headdress Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, they were not the winner. The sweepstakes trophy went to "Mardi Gras," 
an extravaganza in gold and white created by Maxx Cooper of Stanton and modeled 
by Sally Hazen of La Canada Flintridge.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: THE ECLIPSE CASTS IMPRESSIVE SHADOW; WITH RACE-CAR TECHNOLOGY 
AND LOOKS THAT BRING YELPS OF APPROVAL, IT JUST MIGHT BE TOUGH TO MAINTAIN YOUR 
COOL

<P>
 Accelerating hard toward a downhill corkscrew at Laguna Seca Raceway, the 
speeding car had much less scampering room than the squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ooops. Sleep tight, furry one. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, red-wrinkled turkey buzzards flew in for lunch. They pecked, 
strutted the corner in defiance of quick traffic, and brought an ominous 
presence to a recent afternoon of testing the 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was a more significant perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was a quartet of sport coupes built more for Laguna Canyon than Laguna 
Seca enduring days of torture without once shedding a wheel, exploding an 
engine or pirouetting into the weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gears were jammed and clashed; hot engines were redlined and made animal 
howls. Brakes were stomped until discs smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 And it all proved enormous prowess -- this overbuilding of track-tough 
technology into cars that in suburban trim, straight out of the showroom and on 
ordinary tires, deliver handling and personal excitement that once belonged to 
competition weekends and highly modified sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived at Mitsubishi Motors America design studio in Cypress, imported from 
Illinois and the Mitsubishi-Chrysler partnership that is Diamond-Star Motors, 
the new Eclipse will certainly overshadow the old. 
</P>
<P>
 This second generation is much more powerful than the first, with base 
horsepower up from 92 to 140; at the turbocharged top of the line, the rating 
increases from 195 to 210. 
</P>
<P>
 The car is a hair shorter overall, but its cab-forward design allows a wider 
track and longer wheelbase for a lower center of gravity and more secure 
handling. It also lowers the car's nose, heightens its haunches and creates a 
pugnacious silhouette reminiscent of a small Dino Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of thriftier times, the series has been trimmed to four models from 
five and two engines from three. As a memento of more cautious moments, the car 
that once sold behind three badges as the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Plymouth Laser 
and Eagle Talon will now be marketed only as Eclipse and Talon.  
</P>
<P>
 The alphabet soup shakes out to entry-level Eclipse RS and GS models powered 
by a double-overhead camshaft version of Chrysler's 2.0 liter. This is the 
sweet, growling little four-cylinder borrowed from the new Dodge/Plymouth Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 Variants GS-T and GSX will have turbocharged 2.0-liter engines by Mitsubishi 
-- with stronger brakes, limited slip differential and all-wheel drive on the 
GSX for motorists with tastes for sportier feel, not just the look. 
</P>
<P>
 Double air bags are standard on all models, and anti-lock brakes optional. A 
new multi-link suspension -- a replacement for MacPherson struts -- also comes 
with the sticker price and improves handling by transferring more power to 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse goes on sale in August and cost police are still massaging prices. 
But, Mitsubishi executives say, expect to pay about $14,000 for the base model 
and $20,000 for the lustier and turbocharged one. That's a jump of about $1,500 
and $2,000 from last year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When introduced in 1989, Eclipse was among the first sport coupes and became 
the nation's best-selling Mitsubishi. Five years later, the new Eclipse 
maintains those initial standards of sensible accessories and quality of 
assembly. Plus equitable pricing, peppery performance and striking styling. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it eclipse the competition? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the car is more powerful, certainly looser and more raucous than Acura's 
Integra and Honda's Prelude. The Ford Probe and Mazda MX-6 are available with 
V-6 engines but are still 46 horses shy of Mitsubishi's turbopunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's Celica is light on performance, heavy on price. Paseo is bland in 
most every department except fuel economy. And the Nissan 240SX is available 
only as a $24,000 convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 We ran all four siblings of the Mitsubishi series on rambling Carmel Valley 
roads and around Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
 Even lesser-powered, lower-echelon models were a delight, with nicely 
modulated, power-sensitive steering allowing them to take directions well. The 
multi-link suspension and lowered set of the chassis certainly reduced the slop 
and shock of weight transfer and kept maneuvering flat. There is electronic 
monitoring of the automatic transmission to guarantee smoother shifts more 
appropriate to the speed of the car, throttle settings and even brake 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The base engine showed impressive pep except under racing conditions, where 
there is no such thing as too much response and pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite, of course, was the leather-lined, full-house GSX with a 
five-speed manual and looks that bring yelps of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Most sport coupes -- indeed, most cars these days -- are a collection of 
borrowings with a few touches of distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse stands aside from the crowd with the narrow, wrap-around headlight 
lenses from last year's front end and a grille that's a broad grin between 
triangular nostrils. The rear is a chunk starting at the rear window pillar and 
flowing as a gentle glass slope into a rounded spoiler, large butt and the 
suggestion of an auspicious racing past: Zagato. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipsophiles will be happy to know that the trademark power bulge on the hood 
-- although superfluous on non-turbocharged versions of the car -- has 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The car's interior is a cockpit that cuddles. Parallel lines leading from 
doorsills and elbow rests are continued forward to merge with the arcs and 
planes of the dashboard, center console and arm rest. The arm rest is broad, 
padded, contains a cubby box, and is a partition that brings coziness to 
driving alone without creating a sense of isolation when with a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Primary instruments and dashboard controls are open to the touch and very 
visible -- although fuel, oil pressure and boost gauges are tiny to the eye. In 
first gear, the shifter crunches close to the cigarette lighter when it's used 
as a cellular phone plug. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eclipse remains a 2+2, but that's two people plus two large bags of 
laundry. Do not try to stow two extra passengers in these miniaturized rumble 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The cowl has been moved forward almost six inches, which increases interior 
room and brings the driver closer to the roadway directly in front. But a 
lowered roof line kills upper vision, and thick rear pillars make quick 
overtakes a process of hopeful glances, guesswork and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there's sufficient legroom and ample variations of seat height and 
rake to accommodate the longest of shanks, there's a sharp edge to the center 
console that becomes a constant irritation to the outside of a driver's right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The GSX is a very quick car that will accelerate from rest to 60 m.p.h. in 
less than seven seconds, by far the best in class. There's a distinct dawdle in 
first gear before the turbocharger exhales around 3,000 r.p.m., but then the 
scenery starts to blur. And the beefed up brakes -- with two-piston calipers -- 
would stop a runaway truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for pursuers of tactile pleasures, the gearbox is a toad. The 
throw has been shortened and the shifter sits a little high. That's fine. But 
cogs are overtly notchy and quick shifts from second a constant miss with much 
floundering in neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 In mitigation, all the test cars were pre-production models where mechanical 
miscues are common and usually correctable before the showroom date. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal service, the gearbox functions adequately, albeit formally. On the 
track, in competition against stopwatch and personal limits, it calls for too 
much deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that added concentration would have made much difference to the squirrel.

 Popcorn watch: How bad for you is the stuff at movie theaters? According to 
Jay Leno, the government now says you are better off healthwise if you chew the 
gum you find under your seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Leno wonders: If popcorn is so fattening and oat bran is so good for 
you, why is Wilford Brimley twice the size of Orville Redenbacher? 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills says some movie theaters have responded quickly to the 
popcorn crisis: "Now, with every ticket, you get a free EKG."

 The Source Awards, the first music prizes specifically for rap artists, were

 Jay Leno on California Congressman Ken Calvert, who was caught having sex with 
a hooker:

 "He says he had no idea that she was a prostitute or he wouldn't have done it. 
Today, the prostitute said: 'Hey, I didn't know that he was a congressman or I 
wouldn't have done it either.' "

 Speaking of Congress, Bob Mills says Thursday's national "Take Your Daughter

 Melanie Saldana of North Hollywood has often wondered at what moments she 
moved from being a girl to becoming a young woman, and finally, a woman. She is 
certain, however, about when she became a lady : 
</P>
<P>
 My sister and I were lying on the beach one spring afternoon. Several yards 
from us was a group of teen-age boys. We heard them talking and saw them point 
in our direction.  
</P>
<P>
 The boys passed by us as they went into the water, surfboards in arm, only to 
return by us again a few minutes later. When they passed us again later, we 
heard one boy comment to the others:

 "See, I TOLD you they weren't girls . They're ladies."

INK: NEW NIXON BOOK A CODA TO HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. His column is published Fridays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard M. Nixon had what Random House publisher Harold Evans calls "the 
newsman's instinct for a deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 The former president's 10th book, "Beyond Peace," was being typeset by the 
publishing house when its author returned from Russia in March and wanted to 
add about 30 pages based on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans agreed to accommodate the 11th-hour inclusion -- a decision that would 
help make Nixon's prescription for America after the Cold War the up-to-date 
coda to his life it has become. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which Time magazine rushed to excerpt in this week's issue and which 
Random House began shipping to stores this week, was originally scheduled for 
publication on the March birthday of Nixon's wife, Pat, who died last year. Its 
debut was then rescheduled for June, until the stroke that led to Nixon's own 
death last week added new urgency to publish the book soon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Evans, who was also the editor, Nixon wrote every word, welcomed 
suggested changes, signed off on the text that appears on the inside flaps (it 
had been faxed to him in Russia) and later tinkered with the choice of excerpts 
used on the back jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 In a measure of Nixon's feistiness, three of these capsule excerpts criticize 
the present administration and its principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Clinton deserves credit for her courage in articulating the absence of a 
higher purpose in life, despite the fact that since the late 1960s many of her 
most liberal supporters have relentlessly assaulted traditional values in the 
name of liberation. Unfortunately, most of the administration's remedies would 
make the problem worse." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was rather like an iceberg," Evans says. "While he might appear cold on 
the surface, he actually would be listening to your every utterance with great 
courtesy, and then from deep down he would draw on this vast amount of 
knowledge in response." 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that the flood of remembrance and media attention set in 
motion by Nixon's death will turn "Beyond Peace" into a posthumous hit. 
Although Random House is unusually guarded about the size of its printing, 
clearly the publisher will ship a six-figure number of books. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, reorders from booksellers are known to be totaling tens of 
thousands of copies. A spokeswoman for Waldenbooks said that the chain had 
increased the order for its more than 1,000 stores to a "substantial" sum.

 New Report Card on Journalists: The Forbes ink empire is out with the second 
annual issue of its Forbes MediaGuide 500, which evaluates and rates the 
nation's journalists in the manner of a restaurant reviewer. Or, as the new 
guide's preface states, "We aim to help news consumers keep tabs on some of the 
media powers that be." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 MediaGuide, which totals 344 pages and sells for $19.95, gives its 
highest praise of four stars to Patti Waldmeir, Financial Times; Carol Loomis, 
Fortune; Maggie Mahar, Barron's; George Gilder, Forbes ASAP, and three 
reporters from The New York Times: Natalie Angier, Bill Keller and Andrew 
Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual guide and the quarterly Forbes MediaCritic, which was launched last 
year, mark Forbes Inc.'s aggressive entry into the business of media watching. 
Both publications are edited by Terry Eastland.

 The Book on Tonya: Sandra Dijkstra, a West Coast literary agent who has 
represented Amy Tan, Susan Faludi, Le Ly Hayslip and other distinctive female 
voices, is now gauging New York publishers' interest in Tonya Harding's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra represents Los Angeles writer Tristine Rainer, who apparently had won 
a pledge of cooperation from the Olympic figure skater. This week, Dijkstra 
said that she is trying to determine how much Harding wants to tell before 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed book may be a tough sell. One publishing house contacted by 
Dijkstra recently nixed the idea because, an editor there said, "I just don't 
know how many readers will care."

 "Adults commonly make the mistake of assuming that their children --

 "I believe that any conception or misconception of teens has to be based on 
the idea that teens are all similar -- which is to me a more ridiculous notion

they can all be treated as equals."

 "That all teen-agers, while outside of school, stare continuously at the 
television, completely oblivious to what is actually on, and have never read 
one word of literature and can therefore make not one mature decision on their 
own without crashing a car or getting someone pregnant."

 "Everyone thinks that teen-agers have a bad attitude toward adults and school, 
and that they disrespect the environment. Many think teens have a selfish 
attitude of 'I don't care.' But not all teen-agers are like this. Everyone 
should take some time, maybe only an hour, and really try to understand the 
challenges teens are facing."

you?"

 "It's not the cavalry and the Indians anymore," said Caleb Shields, acting 
chairman of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes at his organization's 
black-tie fundraiser Wednesday at the Sheraton Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Shields was referring to the relationship between Native Americans, whose 
tribal lands hold a third of all U.S. coal and 40% of its uranium, and the 
people who buy those products. CERT advises 57 tribes on protecting and 
managing their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these extensive energy holdings, seated in the Sheraton Grande's 
ballroom were representatives of a veritable Who's Who of fuel and power 
companies, including Arco, Chevron, Peabody Western Coal and Southern 
California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Their support for CERT makes its annual American Spirit Award dinner the most 
successful Native American education fund-raiser in the country. This year more 
than $300,000 was raised for Native American students pursuing careers in 
fields related to energy resource management. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began with the posting of an eagle staff, to a drum and chanting 
accompaniment, at the same time the American flag was brought into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ceremony affirms that Indians are still a thriving part of American 
society," said CERT communication intern Felix Sanchez-Edsitty. 
</P>
<P>
 There was invocation in Cree, and award presentations to actor Wes Studi and 
Arizona Public Service Co. CEO Mark DeMichele, as well as a Crow dance 
performance by Zia Pueblo Indians. John Bryson, CEO of Southern California 
Edison, was presented with a Navajo silver belt buckle for his efforts in 
hosting the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the evening, after a video clip on CERT's scholarship program, 
there was an "honor song" with accompaniment by the Red Tipi drum group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps us remember those who have passed on," Shields said. "It 
celebrates their lives and contributions as well as those who are among us in 
this world." 
</P>
<P>
 What stood out in the evening was the graceful mixing of Native American and 
corporate cultures. "Between these two worlds, if you chose to call them two 
worlds, this is a way of melding because they have the same interests," Studi 
said.
