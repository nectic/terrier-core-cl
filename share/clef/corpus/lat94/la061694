 Refusing to heel: During the deadlocked labor negotiations between the city 
and the LAPD, police officers have warned of a possible blue flu slowdown 
during the World Cup. Such a tactic would be ironic in view of the name of the 
Cup's canine mascot:

 The fastest gun in L.A. (cont.): After reading in Only in L.A. that shootist 
Wyatt Earp lived out his final years in a cottage in L.A., City Councilman Nate 
Holden wants to erect a plaque at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Earp died at the age of 80 in 1929 at 4000 1/2 W. 17th St., near the corner of 
Crenshaw and Washington boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he died in our district we thought we'd bring him the recognition he 
deserves," said Holden press deputy Roger Galloway, a former writer on the TV 
show "Legends of the West."  
</P>
<P>
 The site is now part of Mt. Vernon Junior High School and Galloway said that 
Principal Leonard George was delighted with the idea. "He (George) said the 
school doesn't get a lot of recognition," Galloway added. 
</P>
<P>
 A plaque for Earp is overdue if only to strike a historical blow for law and 
order. After all, L.A. County already has a Vasquez Rocks Park near Saugus. 
Vasquez was an L.A. outlaw who was hanged for his misdeeds.

From Mars, Women Are From Venus.' "

 A literary leg up: Discussing the recent yard sale to raise money for 
prosecution of the Menendez brothers, we dismissed one $75 item as ugly and 
tacky -- a lamp whose base was a mannequin leg attired in a red high-heel shoe 
and fishnet stocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Rick Shafarman of Saugus tells that a shapely lamp of this type plays an 
important part in Jean Shepherd's novel "In God We Trust -- All Others Pay 
Cash," later the movie "A Christmas Story." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1930s tale recounts how the narrator's father received the leg in the mail 
as a contest prize.  
</P>
<P>
 It was so realistic, Shepherd writes, the family thought it might be the work 
of an artist "that was very active at that period -- the Trunk Murderer. . . . 
In those days something in the air caused many a parson's daughter to hack up 
her boyfriend into small segments which were then shipped separately to people 
chosen at random from the phone book." 
</P>
<P>
 The family's leg, displayed in the living room "in the soft glow of electric 
Sex," meets an untimely end when it crashes to the floor one day while the 
narrator's mother is dusting. 
</P>

 Mom claims it was an accident. There being no witnesses, she is eventually 
cleared of leg-slaughter by the family. miscelLAny:

 La Golondrina, the 70-year-old Mexican restaurant on Olvera Street, advertises

a pretty wild town back then. There are indications that the building, like the 
brick home of the present-day Philippe restaurant, was once a brothel.

ACCESS WATCH; KEEP DATA FLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public access to public records should be a given in a society that prides 
itself on being open and free. Unfortunately, two 1993 state court decisions 
allow law enforcement agencies to set strict limits on the release of even the 
most basic crime-related information.In response, a state Senate bill has been 
proposed to restore appropriate access. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1993 rulings, California law already granted police agencies broad 
power to withhold information from the public. Internal memos, records 
concerning pending litigation, personnel files and other information relating 
to security, intelligence or disciplinary actions are exempted by the state 
public records act. Such protections should be enough to safeguard police 
records. Yet the court rulings -- Williams vs. Superior Court and County of Los 
Angeles vs. Superior Court -- went further. They, in effect, allowed police 
agencies to make public only the so-called "blotter sheet" information, which 
is data concerning arrests and crimes in an area. 
</P>
<P>
 SB 1460, authored by state Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), would 
address the inequities created by the courts. The bill would amend the 
California Public Records Act by opening investigatory files to the public once 
the need for secrecy had elapsed. It would also bring the state law into 
compliance with the federal Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Like current law, Calderon's bill contains a number of provisions to deal with 
police concerns. But unlike the court decisions it also balances that against 
the public interest.

THE COSTS OF VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Column One ("Putting a Price on Violence") in The Times' June 5 
edition, I find it intriguing that the article focuses more on the funds that 
the taxpayers will dish out for the treatment of Cindy Rodriguez, the trials, 
appeals, and the incarceration of the convicted criminals in this revolting 
act, than the fact that this child has lost her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 While we taxpayers always seem to get stuck with the bill, we must also 
recognize that a totally innocent victim has been cut down. Sociologists know 
how gangs start and we know what gangs can do; now we need to find out how to 
prevent gangs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are now being taught about the repulsive life that gang members lead 
and what the consequences are. It is our job and the jobs of educators to 
encourage our youth. Most students are strong in one particular subject and 
must be encouraged. Having high self-esteem is the most important way in 
pulling students away from the gang scene and helping them have confidence in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it would be nice to have help from home, but teachers are the last line 
of defense, and in some cases the only defense. The adults of tomorrow must 
realize what their proficiencies are, and not just their deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Cindy Rodriguez, reach for your dreams, work hard and in the end, you 
will find that nothing can stop you. Work with what you have, and maybe one day 
all this madness will end. 
</P>

 * I read the entire article with sympathy for young Cindy Rodriguez while 
attempting to determine what the true motive was for the writer. Knowing the 
ideological position of The Times regarding guns, it was interesting to read 
the financially misleading article. In truth, firefighters and police officers 
are on duty and being paid whether Cindy Rodriguez is shot or not. Certainly, 
everyone wishes that she never had to experience this tragedy. But your bloated 
figures don't really represent actual costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was nothing more than a poorly disguised attempt to promote The 
Times' ill-conceived program to rid the United States of our bad, bad, guns. My 
question is, would you have spent the same time and energy doing an in-depth 
article had Cindy been injured with a knife? Sadly, the answer is in all 
likelihood, probably not.

LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Baker's article on leadership (Opinion, June 5) adds to the growing body 
of articles and discussion that all seem to ask where leadership has gone. 
Leadership in times of crisis or when a clear need to do something is present 
readily comes forth.One could argue it is relatively easy to lead in such times 
because the call to action and course of action are supported by the people who 
want someone else to lead them to the solution. It is in difficult and 
challenging times in which it's not clear either what the problem is or how to 
attack it that leadership does not seem to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty is defining what is worth sacrificing for. In our current 
environment in which the forces of greed are overwhelming the forces of 
sacrifice, it is understandable that leadership may not exist. If we cannot 
agree what is worth sacrificing for or on which way to go, how can leadership 
exist? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the problem is not leadership, it is followership. As we focus 
predominantly on fulfilling our own personal needs and desires and do not agree 
on sacrificing for anything (or anyone else), there is nothing to lead to. When 
people are led in a direction, they must willingly give something up to 
"support the cause." Is anyone willing to give anything up? If not, no 
direction -- no leadership. So perhaps the reason there is no leadership is 
because there is no one who is willing to sacrifice and be followers.

CLINTON AT OXFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am totally confounded by the continual attacks against President Clinton by 
your newspaper and the media in general. Re "Clinton Trip Ends With Oxford 
Honors" (June 9), your article begins with "Clinton returned to the scene of 
his efforts 25 years ago to avoid military service in Vietnam."This is the lead 
line for what is supposed to be a news report about an honor bestowed on the 
President by Oxford University. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of front-page news is to report current news, in an unbiased way. 
Your reporter is more concerned about events that took place when President 
Clinton was in his early 20s. Why not confine this bias to the opinion pages? 
</P>
<P>
 In his first year in office, President Clinton has fought and won the battle 
of NAFTA, which by the latest economic reports is working to the benefit of our 
country. He's passed a budget, he's working on sorely needed health-care reform 
and he's passed a gun-control law. He's working harder than many of our past 
presidents. Why the media seem determined to attack and destroy the presidency 
is really hard to fathom.

PROBLEMS OF OVERPOPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article on population, "Doomsayers of Overpopulation Sound a New Jeremiad" 
(June 7), seems to imply that if the developed countries, such as the United 
States, would reduce their overconsumption, the world could accommodate a much 
larger population. What wasn't mentioned is that the developing countries all 
want to emulate our lifestyle and are working hard to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 What all of this means is that we are giving ourselves false comfort if we 
think that we can solve the world's population problems by simply reducing our 
consumption. Even if we did succeed in passing more and more restrictive laws 
to control consumption, we will have lost some more of our freedoms and likely 
will have suffered a lowering of our quality of life besides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the very important U.N. Conference on Population and Development to be held 
in Cairo in September, I hope our delegates emphasize that: 
</P>
<P>
 * They have to plan for a world of at least 9 billion to 10 billion people, 
not the current 5.6 billion people, since it will be almost impossible to stop 
population growth before then. 
</P>
<P>
 * International migration is less and less a solution for overpopulation since 
more countries, like the U.S., are resisting immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 * The focus for population stabilization discussions should be around optimum 
population country by country, not the maximum that the world might be able to 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The more prosperous the world becomes, the fewer people the Earth can 
sustain. Technology can help reduce the impact of prosperity to a certain 
extent, but some things technology can't solve, like the overcrowding of the 
natural scenic wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only by stabilizing and cooperatively reducing the number of people in the 
world over time will the poor of the world have a chance to achieve their 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Our current and future overpopulation will be solved, either by planning and 
cooperation or by war, pestilence and starvation. The choice is up to us. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Fortunately, overall U.N. data gives a very different picture than the 
population article of June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Population growth? This year, the rate of population growth, 1.6%, has fallen 
to the lowest level in modern history. It will drop to about 1.0% within about 
25 years, then drop to zero, then be replaced by world population decline. Why? 
This year there will be fewer births in areas such as Latin America and East 
Asia than in 1993. The average fertility rate in developed countries such as 
the U.S. fell below replacement level 20 years ago and has continually dropped 
since. The Asian and African fertility rates are expected to be cut nearly in 
half in a generation. Why? There are about 25 factors that are known to 
decrease the fertility rate and all 25 are acting to decrease the fertility 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Food? Since 1947, developing countries have improved their diet by more than 
40%. Since 1960, they have increased the number of calories in an average diet 
by more than 500 per day. The average diet in each of the 20 most populous 
countries in the world exceeds U.S. government recommendations for a healthy 
diet. The world is using less than 25% of its potential cropland. 
</P>
<P>
 Resources? The reserves of every important resource increase as time goes on 
and the price adjusted for inflation decreases. Energy reserves such as oil and 
natural gas are at record high levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality of life? The U.N. measures quality of life more than 40 ways, and 
quality of life is improving and is better in more crowded countries and areas 
in all 40 ways.

SACRAMENTO HEAT OVER SMOKE; ISSUE'S PROFILE MAY RISE AS SENATE DEBATES 
ANTI-SMOKING BILL AMENDMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compared with the high-profile drama over the dangers of cigarettes now 
playing in Washington, the long-running debate over secondhand smoke in 
Sacramento has been a quiet sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no squad of tobacco executives testifying before the 
Legislature on cigarette ingredients, no industry threats to sue individuals 
accused of leaking internal documents and no discussion of regulating 
cigarettes as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Sacramento doings in recent months have centered on 
behind-the-scenes deals between legislators and lobbyists and on poison-pill 
amendments, designed to kill legislation rather than modify it. However, the 
sotto voce nature of this process could change today as the state Senate 
debates a final batch of such hostile amendments to what could become the first 
statewide workplace smoking ban in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 If AB 13, sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), survives 
these last-ditch efforts to sabotage it, the bill could be before Gov. Pete 
Wilson within weeks. Its passage, intact and unadulterated, would be -- and 
should be -- headline news hailed as a major accomplishment for the measure's 
broad coalition of supporters. More important, legislative approval would be a 
huge step forward for the health and welfare of every Californian.  
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is clearly dangerous -- to smokers and to those around them. AB 13 
would ban smoking in almost all indoor workplaces. It is supported by the 
California Restaurant Assn., the California Hotel and Motel Assn. and the 
California State Federation of Labor, not to mention scores of medical and 
public interest groups and city and county governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, because AB 13's supporters include the very groups that would be 
involved most in its implementation, contentions by legislative opponents that 
the bill would prove costly to business carry little credibility. But those 
contentions do arouse serious questions about the integrity of lawmakers who 
doggedly are trying to block a reasonable bill that would benefit so many.

HOW TO BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST COCAINE; RAND STUDY SHOWS POWER OF FIGHTING DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intuition tells us, and evidence grows, that the national policy on cocaine 
abuse is badly out of kilter. Federal and local police agencies spend about $12 
billion a year in trying to stem supply, but the supply seems endless as long 
as demand remains high. We spend about $1 billion a year in public and private 
money on treating users, but skeptics wonder whether this makes a real 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it does, and we could do well by diverting much of the money spent on 
enforcement into treatment of heavy users to cut the demand. That is the burden 
of a new statistical study from the RAND Corp. It concludes that one dollar 
spent on treatment results in $7 worth of overall savings to society. By 
contrast, the study finds, each dollar spent on control -- in helping foreign 
governments cut supply and interdicting and reducing domestic distribution -- 
returns only 99 cents in savings. In other words, the war on cocaine suppliers 
is getting us almost nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics on drug control and abuse are notoriously squishy. But the RAND 
researchers, Susan S. Evering- ham and C. Peter Rydell, have made one of the 
first attempts at systematically comparing through computer modeling the 
cost-effectiveness of various approaches to cocaine abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 They conclude that the best value for the money involves reallocating about $3 
billion, or about a quarter, of the yearly enforcement money to allow for 
treatment of nearly all of the 1.7 million heavy cocaine users. This, they 
calculate, would cut annual cocaine consumption by half by the year 2007 and 
result in a one-third ($10 billion) reduction in annual societal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such computer simulations have their limitations, but the study suggests a 
middle ground between those who would legalize cocaine altogether and those who 
would impose even harsher criminal penalties. While the RAND researchers do not 
advocate dropping enforcement, their view that treatment is more cost-effective 
is one that has gained acceptance even among many top police officials and 
prosecutors. This argument goes only so far, however, because it will never be 
possible to get all users into treatment. And indeed, RAND agrees that 
treatment is not a panacea. The real issue is how to get the most value for 
each dollar spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides of the enforcement-versus-treatment equation are imperfect. Drug 
enforcement spawns police corruption; treatment programs are often money-making 
shams. But the balance of evidence supports the Clinton Administration's 
tentative view that treatment and education must be emphasized. The cocaine 
epidemic will not end until the demand for the product does. Imbalance on 
Cocaine U.S. public and private agencies spent $13 billion combatting cocaine 
in 1992. Enforcement: 93% Treatment: 7%

accept sanctions as a last resort. Japan says it will go along with any 
sanctions voted by the U.N. Security Council. China continues to regard 
sanctions as "ineffective." Significantly, though, China chose to abstain 
rather than vote against the recent decision by the board of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to end technical assistance to North Korea because of its 
refusal to allow full international inspection of its nuclear facilities. That 
abstention strongly hints that China might well decide not to cast a veto when 
the sanctions resolution comes before the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions debate has a long way to go. The U.S. draft resolution has just 
reached the council, and it will probably be several weeks before a final 
resolution is ready to be voted on. However, it's beginning to appear that the 
Clinton Administration's efforts to line up countries whose support for 
sanctions is essential is meeting success. 
</P>
<P>
 A big reason could be that there's now a new appreciation of how appallingly 
high the stakes in this confrontation really are. A nuclear-armed North Korea 
would produce a radical shift in the balance of power in Northeast Asia, making 
it perhaps all but certain that South Korea and Japan would feel compelled to 
acquire their own nuclear arsenals. But disruptions to the international 
balance of power wouldn't end there. If Pyongyang reveals the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty to be little more than an unenforceable scrap of paper 
other nuclear wanna-bes -- Iran and Iraq among them -- could quickly try to 
realize their ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's phased-in approach is the necessary one for 
gaining political backing in the international community. Equally vital now is 
that North Korea be left in no doubt about the readiness of the United States 
and its allies to respond with overwhelming force if Pyongyang seeks to move 
this confrontation into the arena of open conflict.

COLUMN RIGHT/ GEORGE WEIGEL: A DEEP SPLIT BETWEEN U.S. AND THE VATICAN; TO 
CLINTON, THE U.N. POPULATION CONFERENCE SIGNALS A MERE DISAGREEMENT. TO THE 
CHURCH, IT IS A MORAL TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WEIGEL, George Weigel is president of the Ethics and Public Policy 
Center in Washington. He recently visited Italy to do research on the Vatican 
and international affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If President Clinton believes that he and Pope John Paul II have simply agreed 
to disagree at September's U.N. Conference on Population and Development, or 
that there has been any narrowing of the gap between U.S. population policy and 
the Vatican's rejection of abortion as a universal "reproductive right," then 
we may be heading for the most serious confrontation between the U.S. 
government and the Holy See since Woodrow Wilson helped block Pope Benedict 
XV's participation in the Versailles peace conference after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration would like to think that, in international public life as 
well as in American domestic affairs, the Catholic position on abortion is a 
sectarian anomaly of no real political consequence. The Holy See's 
understanding of the matter is entirely different. For Pope John Paul II, the 
abortion debate engages basic questions of universal human rights, including 
the integrity of the family as the basic building-block of civil society and 
democracy. Viewed through that prism, the American insistence on abortion as an 
instrument of family planning around the world is the real act of cultural 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft document that will be debated at Cairo in September was bitterly 
contested during a preparatory conference in New York in April. Those who have 
plowed through the result of those labors -- 118 pages of turgid U.N.-speak -- 
have discovered a population-control program of astonishing ambition and scope. 
Indeed, were the Cairo conference to adopt the draft document in its 
essentials, it would enshrine in international law a view of human 
relationships and human sexuality that is far more reflective of Western 
feminist orthodoxies and the eugenic fevers within the "population control" 
movement than of any sustainable international moral consensus. In that 
respect, the draft Cairo document is the worst form of elitism: the enlightened 
(upper-class Westerners and U.N. bureaucrats) instructing the benighted masses 
about the pursuit of real happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 And here -- rather than in any arcane Catholic moral theology -- is the root 
of thePope's profound concerns about the Cairo conference. For Cairo is 
emphatically not about demographics and numbers. Nor is it about the 
relationship between population and development (only six of the 118 pages of 
the draft document deal with the formal topic of the meeting). Rather, the 
Cairo conference is about lifestyles and about promoting the sexual revolution 
through coercive state power. 
</P>
<P>
 An exaggeration? Hardly. The draft document mandates states to override the 
prerogatives of parents on adolescent sexual education and envisions 
large-scale propaganda campaigns: "Governments . . . should . . . use the 
entertainment media, including radio and television soap operas and drama, folk 
theater and other traditional media" to persuade the recalcitrant.  
</P>
<P>
 In a truly Orwellian move, the document even demands that governments "ensure" 
that "health-care providers" have the proper "attitudes" toward their teen-age 
patients. That the "attitudes" in question are those in Planned Parenthood 
clinics or school-based condom-distribution offices seems a reasonable 
assumption. 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely this soft totalitarianism, which violates America's historic 
commitment to human freedom, that the Pope urged Clinton to reject. Nor is the 
Pope alone in his concerns; on the very day that John Paul met with Clinton, 
Argentina's President Carlos Menem wrote all Latin American heads of 
government, requesting that they develop a common approach to the Cairo 
conference to address problems of population, development and women's health 
without conceding the argument over humane family-planning to the most radical 
population-controllers. In an Administration not notable for its foreign-policy 
dexterity, Menem's letter ought to provoke some serious reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Clinton and his advisers would be making a grave error if they persist in 
regarding the Catholic Church's approach to the Cairo conference as tactical or 
confessional. It may be a quirk of history (though some of us believe it 
Providence) that the world's most influential moral teacher today is John Paul 
II. For the world's leading political power and the world's greatest moral 
authority to conflict on a fundamental question of human rights is a tragedy. 
And the way to resolve that conflict is not to agree to disagree. It is for the 
Clinton Administration to disentangle itself from the ideology of population 
control that it is trying to impose on the world in the name of "reproductive 
rights."

JAMES JOYCE, HIBERNIAN AND CYBERNAUT; 'ULYSSES': ON THIS YEAR'S BLOOMSDAY, 
E-MAIL IS HUMMING WITH NEW APPRECIATION FOR A MASTERPIECE PRESCIENTLY MADE FOR 
A LIFE IN CYBERSPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN STONEHILL, Brian Stonehill, coordinator of the media-studies program 
at Pomona College, is the author of The Self-Conscious Novel: Artifice in 
Fiction from Joyce to Pynchon (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan" -- the first four words of James Joyce's 
"Ulysses" -- are being intoned today in pubs and reading rooms around the 
world. Meanwhile, so-called virtual celebrations of Bloomsday are filling 
cyberspace with echoes of the novel's final word, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 What does it all mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Students of the Irish novelist, teachers of Joyce and fans of Joyce -- and 
they are numerous -- observe June 16 with marathon readings of "Ulysses" and 
celebrations in which drink plays a large role -- two activities of which Joyce 
would surely have approved. "Ulysses," a work of 800-plus pages first published 
(due to its naughtiness) in Paris in 1922 -- takes place on a single day in 
Dublin; and that day is Thursday, June 16, 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ulysses" retells Homer's epic, "The Odyssey," in modern dress, and readers 
know June 16 as "Bloomsday" because Joyce, presenting his modern Odysseus as an 
ad canvasser for Dublin daily newspapers, named him Leopold Bloom. Odysseus was 
a sailor and Bloom never ventures onto a ship, but Joyce, an incorrigible 
punster, liked the way that the phrase "ad canvasser" echoed the sails that 
propelled Homer's hero across the wine-dark sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Odysseus fights giants like the one-eyed Cyclops and must steer between 
a whirlpool and a man-eating monster while sailing home from the Trojan War, 
Leopold Bloom must contend with metaphorically one-eyed bigots (for Bloom is a 
Jew in Catholic Dublin), and he must steer a course between the teetotalers and 
the drunks. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Bloomsday has aroused unusual enthusiasm, not only because the 1994 
anniversary makes a round number with 1904 and not only because June 16 falls 
on a Thursday this year as it did in the novel. "Ulysses" is being rediscovered 
this year by the hordes of academics who have recently learned to communicate 
electronically by computer -- and what they are finding, in many cases, is that 
Joyce's novel has what they're calling a cybernetic plot. 
</P>
<P>
 By this, they mean that Joyce seems to have foreseen that moving information 
around is what culture is really about. Bloom's job, for instance, is to put 
his clients' messages into forms that are digestible by the mass medium of the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ulysses" comically documents the advertising impulse that would come to 
dominate the 20th Century -- readers have recognized that from the start. But 
what's new about the 1990s reading and makes "Ulysses" seem so fresh all over 
again is that the novel now seems to be about the sending, carrying and 
receiving of information. Joyce's characters are constantly sending letters, 
telegrams, even writing messages in the sand on the beach. In their evanescence 
they act out in turn-of-the-century dress the impulsive scribbles of e-mail -- 
a realm now known as cyberspace. The term cybernetics itself comes 
appropriately from the Greek for helmsman, and was first used for the study of 
communication by an American scholar, Norbert Wiener, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Like unfortunate sailors, some signals in Joyce's novel perish in a sea of 
noise. Bloom, for example, although married to a vivacious singer named Molly, 
is conducting a secret correspondence with Martha Clifford -- a connection he 
made by placing a personal ad. A slip of the pen causes Martha to write, "I 
called you naughty because I do not like that other world." Typographic errors 
fascinated Joyce, who saw in them the sea monsters that threaten the successful 
passage of our signals. The day's evening newspaper, in its account of a 
funeral that he attended in the morning, will nettle Leopold Bloom by noting 
the presence of one "L. Boom." Stephen Dedalus -- the sensitive young poet 
usually read as an autobiographical figure for Joyce, and the novel's third 
main character after Bloom and Molly -- has been summoned back to Dublin from 
Paris with a telegram that says (with a typo's inadvertent profundity), "NOTHER 
DYING. COME HOME. FATHER." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Joyce scholars are conducting a dialogue in the cyberspace of 
e-mail and on Joycean electronic bulletin boards -- a fast-paced communal 
discussion that is by turns jovial, pedantic, furious, obscene, tendentious -- 
just what "joco-serious Joyce" had in mind when he promised to "keep the 
professors busy for centuries" with his major novel. While newcomers still 
charmingly dare to ask how to begin reading The Book, old hands serve up the 
cream of their bibliographies. It's a sweet moment for the culture when Joyce's 
novel -- having itself, like its hero, slipped past one-eyed censors and 
piratical publishers -- finds a new way to reach the welcome harbor of freshly 
appreciative readers, both on-line and off.

 Procter & Gamble Likely to Get OK to Buy German Firm: The European Commission 
is expected to clear plans by Procter & Gamble Co. to buy hygiene products firm 
VP-Schickedanz following changes in the deal that make it compatible with 
competition rules. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert recommended to his 
fellow commissioners that the operation be allowed to go through, a senior 
commission official said. Van Miert and his staff had as recently as Monday 
planned to recommend rejection of the deal on the grounds that it would create 
a dominant position in Germany and Spain in the sale of sanitary towels.

 Entering at No. 1: "Purple," the new album by the Southern California band 
Stone Temple Pilots sold 252,000 copies last week and will enter the nation's 
pop chart at No. 1 on Saturday. The rock band's debut album, "Core," has sold 
more than 3 million copies. Other new entries bursting into the Top 10 include 
Long Beach rapper Warren G.'s "Regulate . . . G-Funk Era" at No. 2 with 176,000 
units sold, veteran rock band Boston's "Walk On" at No. 7 with 106,000, and 
country crooner Vince Gill's "When Love Finds You" at No. 10 with 82,000.

 * Late Payment: Bo Diddley's late manager siphoned at least $400,000 from the 
singer over the past decade and the manager's widow will have to repay the 
money, a Los Angeles judge ruled Wednesday. The judge also ordered Lila 
Otelsberg to turn over her husband's books and records dating to 1972 -- when 
Martin Otelsberg began managing Diddley's affairs -- to determine if even more 
money is due, said Diddley's attorney. Wednesday's judgment is based only on 
records from 1988, with some partial records from 1986 and 1987. The 
65-year-old Diddley -- known for such songs as "Hey Bo Diddley" and "Who Do You 
Love?" -- said he became suspicious of Otelsberg when Lila Otelsberg came up 
with various excuses not to return Diddley's financial records after the 
manager's death.

 * Legal Briefs: Long-grounded rock group Jefferson Airplane has filed a 
lawsuit in San Francisco against computer software company Berkeley Systems 
Inc., claiming the company stole the band's 1973 "Thirty Seconds Over 
Winterland" album cover for a "flying toaster" design used on the screen-saver 
program "After Dark." . . . New York-based 57/Sunset Entertainment Inc. has 
dropped its $76-million lawsuit against pop star Michael Jackson. The company 
had claimed Jackson reneged on a deal to let it record rap versions of about a 
dozen Beatles songs Jackson owns.

 * New Technology: "Head First," a never-before-released, broadcast-quality 
song by rock group Aerosmith, will go out on-line June 27 to members of the 
CompuServe Information Service. After typing in GO AEROSMITH, CompuServe users 
will be able to download the entire song for free in what Geffen Records says 
will make music history. Aerosmith will waive its royalties for the song, and 
CompuServe will waive its connect-time charges. Said Aerosmith singer Steven 
Tyler: "If our fans are out there driving down that information superhighway, 
then we want to be playing at the truck stop." CLASSICAL MUSIC

 Symphony Director: Gisele Ben-Dor, 39, a native of Uruguay who emigrated to 
Israel in 1973, has signed a three-year contract as music director of the Santa 
Barbara Symphony. Ben-Dor was one of nine candidates who led the orchestra 
during a 15-month search period. Trained in Uruguay and Israel and at Yale, 
Ben-Dor was a fellow at the 1984 L.A. Philharmonic Institute, where she 
conducted the Institute Orchestra at Hollywood Bowl. She has also held posts 
with orchestras in Houston and Annapolis. RADIO & TV

 New Adult Alternative: KLIT-FM (101.9) will soon abandon its easy-listening 
format for "adult alternative rock" programming, with a sound that industry 
insiders liken to a college radio station. The current format has not been a 
big ratings-getter. The new format is expected to debut July 1, with on-air 
personalities including Chris Douridas, who currently hosts KCRW's "Morning 
Becomes Eclectic," and Nicole Sandler, producer of the "Mark and Brian Show" at 
KLOS. 
</P>
<P>
 * AMA Calls for New Ratings: The American Medical Assn. is calling for new sex 
and violence ratings for TV, movies, music recordings and videos, and suggests 
that even violence on news shows should be censored. In a policy statement 
approved at the group's annual meeting on Tuesday, the group said a 
"substantial expansion" of violent and sexually explicit entertainment and 
programming has become available to children at a time when parents seem to 
have less control over what their kids watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tenors on Tape: KCET-TV Channel 28 and KOCE-TV Channel 50 will hasten to 
broadcast taped replays of "Encore! The Three Tenors," the July 16 concert 
reuniting Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo. The two local 
stations will be blacked out from a live feed to PBS stations from Dodger 
Stadium that Saturday, but both plan to air the program on tape the next day. 
KCET in Los Angeles will run it at 7 p.m.; KOCE in Huntington Beach plans two 
broadcasts, at 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * No More Shopping: "Can We Shop," the latest venture for former talk-show 
host Joan Rivers, has been canceled by producers QRT Enterprises. The daily, 
syndicated home shopping program will finish production Friday, and the last 
new show will air July 15. According to QRT, the 6-month-old show's gross sales 
totaled more than $14 million. SHAUNA SNOW

 Riedel, which many wine-lovers say makes the best wine glasses around, has 
always specialized: Bordeaux glasses, Burgundy glasses, even a special size and 
shape of glass for Zinfandel. Now it has an everyday glass (somewhat like the 
Zinfandel, actually) for any old wine.The Gourmet Glass (style 416/21) has the 
thin, polished rim of fine glassware, rather than the thick, rolled rim of the 
ordinary stuff, but it's only 6 1/4 inches high, making it easy to put in the

 Wine, long associated with quiet dinners and dark cellars, took a jolt upside 
the head June 11 at the 14th Napa Valley Wine Auction. Held at the staid 
Meadowood Country Club, it seemed less a traditional wine auction than a sort 
of non-broadcast telethon where you got either wine or a trip to hobnob with a 
Napa winemaker if you made the biggest charitable pledge.Every time $100,000 
had been raised, the auctioneers were interrupted by a blast of recorded 
symphonic fanfare and a couple of appointed celebrants got up and danced in the 
aisles. A number of the older vintners cringed at the shameless hype; a few 
left early. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but behind it all was the "good cause" dangled as a carrot for the 
bidders: the various hospitals and clinics who benefit from the funds. Of the 
$1.66 million raised in the auction, 90% will go to the charities in one form 
or another, said a spokeswoman. Another $1.3 million, derived from registration 
fees, was spent promoting and producing the extravaganza. DAN BERGER

AMERICA'S BEST: YOU CAN'T BE TOO THIN OR TOO CRISP; MRS. TRAVIS HANES' MORAVIAN

 A lack of money and a great recipe are what got Evva Hanes into the cookie 
business. Using an old family recipe, Hanes' mother, Bertha Crouch Foltz, began 
baking sugar crisp cookies at Christmastime to supplement the income from the 
family's small North Carolina dairy farm.Hanes took over the cookie business in 
1960, and it's been steadily growing ever since. So far, 30,000 people have 
sent away for the paper-thin Moravian cookies. Pretty amazing, considering the 
small, family-run company doesn't advertise or wholesale its products. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanes is a seventh-generation Moravian-American. The Moravians, persecuted for 
their religious beliefs throughout their history, first settled in this country 
more than 250 years ago. Today there are large Moravian communities in 
Pennsylvania and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 True paper-thin Moravian cookies are difficult to roll, yet the women who bake 
cookies for Moravian Sugar Crisp hand-make each batch, which is then cut into 
rounds, hearts and scallops. 
</P>
<P>
 You can tell that the company is a serious operation when your first order 
arrives: It comes in a no-frills tin, without a fancy label or pretty tissue. 
The delicate cookies are stacked and cushioned in plain paper napkins, yet very 
few of the fragile cookies are broken.  
</P>
<P>
 The original sugar crisps are still the company's best seller, but we prefer 
the spicy ginger crisps -- the cookie has an astonishing gingery bite. Both are 
worth trying. Hanes makes chocolate, lemon, butterscotch and black walnut 
versions too. A one-pound tin costs $14, plus $1.50 postage and handling.

CALIFORNIANS FLOCK TO CAPITOL CHICKEN HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Feathers may fly in the halls of Congress today as Washington takes a crack at 
solving the fresh-versus-frozen controversy that has ruffled the nation's 
poultry industry for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck is making the trip to testify.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Modesto) organized today's House Government Operations 
subcommittee hearing to air complaints from his chicken-producing constituents; 
they claim federal regulations fail to distinguish between fresh and frozen 
birds in supermarket meat counters. 
</P>
<P>
 Former and current U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, consumer 
advocates, a California contingent of poultry producers and other interested 
parties are scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not fair for U.S. consumers to buy a chicken labeled 'fresh,' " Condit 
said, "and not realize that just a few hours before the chicken could have been 
used as a cannonball."  
</P>
<P>
 As reported in The Times last month, California producers want to define 
"fresh" as any bird refrigerated and stored at 26 degrees or higher. The effort 
received unanimous support from the Legislature in Sacramento and Gov. Pete 
Wilson last year. Yet federal courts have thwarted the implementation of the 
regulation, claiming it would interfere with interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of trade groups representing the leading poultry-producing states 
-- including Arkansas and Georgia -- successfully filed suit to overturn the 
California law. An appeal is pending and will be heard sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeastern producers -- who truck their broilers to the West Coast -- 
prefer the current federal definition that says a chicken is fresh if it is 
refrigerated at temperatures above zero degrees. Their representatives claim 
that the average temperature of Southeastern chickens reaching the West Coast 
is in the mid-20-degree range and deny that the birds are frozen during 
transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of the dispute is the Clinton Administration's USDA. For 
months, department officials have denied that they favor Southeastern chicken 
producers, particularly those from the President's home state of Arkansas, in 
regulations and inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fresh versus frozen) is a very serious topic," said Mary Dixon, USDA 
spokeswoman in Washington. "The issue is under discussion and review here. We 
did not develop the original policy but we are definitely questioning the 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Secretary Richard Rominger, the No. 2 official at USDA, will testify at 
the hearing. Dixon points out that the presence of Rominger, former director of 
California's Department of Food and Agriculture, indicates how seriously USDA 
is approaching the session. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key witness in the dispute is a former top USDA official who attempted to 
address the issue six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester Crawford, administrator of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service from 1986 to 1991, said that several regional poultry producers, 
including some non-Californians, petitioned his agency in 1988 to legally 
define "fresh" as chicken refrigerated and held at 26 degrees or above. 
</P>
<P>
 After considering the request, Crawford's staff issued a policy memo that 
supported the 26-degree definition. However, it was intended only as a labeling 
guideline and not as a formal change in the federal Poultry Products Inspection 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the major national chicken producers from the Southeast 
pleaded their case with Crawford's superior, Agriculture Secretary Richard 
Lyng. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was present at the meeting," Crawford recalled in a recent telephone 
interview. "The national chicken shippers said the policy memo would create 
chaos in the marketplace and would disparage their product. . . . Lyng clearly 
told me to reach agreement with these people and that it should be up to the 
National Broiler Council (an industry-wide trade group with members on both 
sides of the issue) to present some form of standard. But we could not reach a 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said the policy memo was withdrawn in August, 1988. "Fresh" has been 
defined as anything above zero degrees ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than issue a policy memo, which is not binding, Crawford said that in 
retrospect his agency should have gone through the formal regulatory process 
and amended the Poultry Products Inspection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think we should define the middle (temperature range)," said Crawford, 
currently executive director of the Assn. of American Veterinary Medical 
Colleges in Washington. "We know that fresh is anything above 26 degrees and 
that frozen is anything below zero. But what about the range from zero to 26 
degrees? I think it should be called 'fresh frozen' or some other appropriate 
name." 
</P>
<P>
 Puck thinks the word "fresh" is much easier to describe and says the current 
stalemate is misleading the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "That people can call something with a temperature of 1 degree 'fresh' is 
ridiculous," he said. "At 25 degrees chicken gets hard, frozen. And when you 
thaw the meat the cells break after converting from ice to water. And that's 
why you get a lot of water from frozen chickens. The texture becomes dry, with 
much less taste. There should be a choice between frozen and fresh chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Puck said that the California Poultry Industry Federation is paying his 
expenses to travel from Los Angeles to Washington, but he is not getting an 
appearance fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I had to pay for everything I wouldn't care," said Puck, no stranger 
to quarrels with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 (He was initially prevented from using the word "pizza" to label his signature 
line of California-style frozen pizzas in 1989 because the pies had no tomato 
sauce. The issue was eventually resolved when Puck agreed to put a spoonful of 
fresh tomatoes, basil and olive on each pizza.) 
</P>
<P>
 Puck said that if some producers want to sell chicken below 26 degrees, they 
should charge less for the product. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go out to buy something leather," he said, "you don't want plastic."

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: CHARRO-BROILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JONATHAN GOLD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here we are, at the Mexican steakhouse La Parrilla, on the newly renamed Cesar 
E. Chavez Avenue, once Brooklyn, in East L.A. And here come the mariachis, the 
sixth or seventh crew within a couple of hours, crossing the street from a set 
at El Apetito, looking for some customers who might buy a song or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the trio, handsome in his charro vest, nods a hello to an 
itinerant stuffed-animal salesman as he enters the restaurant; then he groans. 
At the moment, the place is populated mostly with non-Mexicans, who are rarely 
in the market for his songs or, almost as bad, request things like "La Bamba" 
or "Guantanamera," which he sometimes has to play more than 10 times a night. 
</P>
<P>
 We in the restaurant, though, are happy to see him. Usually, the bands are 
wonderful -- sweet close-harmony crooners or piercing trumpet-led trios, ready 
to play almost anything from the last century of Mexican music for a $5 
donation. But the previous band, a ragged quartet, featured perhaps the worst 
saxophone player on the planet, a man whose entire repertoire consisted of a 
single descending scale that he felt appropriate to just about any open space 
in any song his colleagues played.  
</P>
<P>
 La Parrilla is a wonderful place, with smooth, cool guacamole mashed to order 
in giant stone mortars, with Mexican beer served so cold that it crusts over 
with ice crystals on a hot afternoon. The restaurant, like El Chamizal in 
Huntington Park, specializes in marinated, charcoal-grilled meats -- thin beef 
fillets, pork coated in a ruddy chile paste, chorizo sausage, sweetly sauced 
spare ribs, and chicken served in various combinations. If you order a 
parrillada al brasero , the meat comes to the table piled on a little grill. 
There are hand-patted corn tortillas unless they've run out. Combinations are 
served with rice, grilled scallions and little bowls of spicy charro beans made 
smoky with bacon, and mostly the grilled meat is very good.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond grilled meat, La Parrilla serves the usual sort of upscale Mexican 
entrees, chicken in a wan pumpkin-seed-based pipian sauce, dry-ish grilled 
Cornish game hen, bland chicken mole , most of them prepared to more or less 
chain-restaurant standards. Better are the many dishes based around grilled 
beef: puntas de filete (grilled chunks of steak tossed with pickled jalapenos 
and topped with melted cheese); fillet in a smoky sauce of chipotle chiles; 
fillet in a spicy Veracruz-style tomato sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 And between Norteno ballads, the waitresses are likely to push something 
called molcajete Azteca , a large granite mortar heated to a ferocious 
temperature, then filled with, among other things, bits of steak, grilled 
cactus paddles, chicken, a thin smoked-chile salsa and a big slab of panela 
cheese that bubbles and smokes where it touches the hot stone. It might seem 
peculiar, this Mexican variant of the Korean bibimbap , and you might wish for 
a longer fork, better to avoid scorching your wrist, but the molcajete is a 
delicious bowl of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sing something sweet," the man at the next table asks the leader of the trio. 
"Something for my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 The leader smiles and strums the opening chords of "Agua Dulce" on his guitar. 
Suddenly, everyone here is happy. 
</P>

WINE: DE GUSTIBUS DEGUSTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A caller complained: I had recommended 1991 Silverado Cabernet Sauvignon and 
he and some of his friends disliked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting he would pick that wine, since it's one of my favorites of the 
vintage, and a great vintage it was. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him that Silverado is one of the top producers of Cabernet in the Napa 
Valley and every year its Cabernet is highly regarded by wine lovers; 
collectors line the walls of their cellars with it, and it sells out soon after 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller admitted that maybe he wasn't used to a wine like that. As he 
spoke, for the thousandth time I relived one of the pitfalls of writing a 
column in which you put your palate on the line. De gustibus non est 
disputandum -- there's no arguing about taste. Not every reader will like every 
wine I do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Siskel and Ebert's two-thumbs-down films are liked by some people. But 
film reviewers have an edge over wine writers. They don't have to evaluate a 
film in the dark, so to speak; they know the names of the producer, director 
and actors even before the lights go down. When I evaluate wines, I do so in a 
blind tasting, so I don't know which wine is in which glass. Usually I do this 
double-blind, meaning that I don't even know what wines we're tasting that day. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But pangs of conscience are inevitable in this job, and the caller's 
complaint, duly noted, prompted me to assemble another series of tastings of 
recent California Cabernets, Merlots and similar wines to see if I could have 
been wrong about the Silverado the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluated double-blind, in three sessions spanning 11 hours, the following 
wines (all Cabernet Sauvignons unless otherwise noted) got high scores from all 
judges and were rated as having potential to age well. They are listed in 
approximate rank of scores: 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Clos du Bois, Sonoma County ($12.75) -- Smoky notes from oak aging, but 
with loads of fruit and complexity. Exceptional winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Silverado Vineyards Merlot, Napa Valley ($17) -- Excellent cherry-like 
fruit and notes of oak that aren't too strong. A rich and rewarding wine to 
drink soon. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Girard Winery, Napa Valley ($22) -- Huge red currant fruit and rich 
flavors, offset by a layer of tannin that will subside with some aging. The 
best Girard Cabernet yet. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Silverado Vineyards, Napa Valley ($17) -- Gorgeous herbal/cherry notes 
and generous fruit in a compact wine, with graceful texture and a long way to 
go before reaching a peak. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Cosentino Cellars, Napa County ($16) -- Violet-laced fruit and deep 
flavors; a wine to age. May be difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Shafer Vineyards, Napa Valley ($21) -- Exceptional fruit and elegance; a 
sweet entry with perfect balance. A wine to drink soon or in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 The Gainey Vineyard Merlot "Limited Selection" ($18) -- Oak notes in 
first whiff, but then you get mint, blackberry and a myriad of flavors. Needs a 
year or two to smooth out. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Geyser Peak Winery "Reserve Alexandre" ($24) -- Rich scents of black 
cherry and toasted oak. A bit one-dimensional, but with great fruit in the 
mouth. A wine to age a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Cafaro Cellars Merlot, Napa Valley ($20) -- Very young and dense wine, a 
lot of oak and fruit that needs time to knit. Powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following wines all scored well and are rated as wines to consume soon 
because they are lighter in weight and probably won't age very long: 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Round Hill Cellars Merlot, California ($7) -- Trace of herbs and cherry, 
with perfect texture. Stunning example of Merlot flavors in a perfectly 
balanced wine.  
</P>
<P>
 1991 Callaway Vineyards, California ($8) -- Tarragon notes interplay with 
elegant fruit and fine finish. Delightful flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 J. Lohr Winery "Cypress," California ($7.75) -- Loads of fruit and deep, 
concentrated, complex flavors. Good value. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Kendall-Jackson Vineyards "Vintner's Reserve" Merlot, California ($9) -- 
Fruity/grape-y aroma and simple taste, but fresh, lively and balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members differed about which wine was best, but one wine scored worst on 
all cards: the 1990 Dominus Estate, Napa Valley ($47). My notes read: "Powerful 
aroma of wet horse blanket and earth intermingled with some fruit and cedar-y 
notes. The texture was odd -- lower acid made the wine taste 'soft' on first 
taste, but the lasting impression was of very high tannins and an almost gritty 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
 The wine improved with a lot of aeration and when tasted the next day wasn't 
as astringent or coarse, with some fruit still evident. 
</P>
<P>
 I called Daniel Baron, general manager of Dominus, to chat about the wine. 
Baron pointed out that like all great works in progress, Dominus was evolving 
into a decidedly distinctive product, loved by some, disliked by others. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that since its 1983 inception, Dominus has been a pretty tough wine in 
tannin structure, but that the vision of the owner, Christian Moueix, was to 
develop a consistency from the same Yountville-area fruit and to make for a 
wine that ages well. That, he said, has been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the controversy Dominus has created, he suggested an analogy to art: 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the art critic," he said. "He says of a painting: 'This is one of the 
greatest artists, you need to have one of these paintings in your home.' Then 
you have the art dealer, who says: 'I need to sell it at this price because 
it's a world-class painting,' and then you have the artist, who is just 
expressing his or her vision of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's how I see Christian Moueix, the artist. One may argue with the 
critic, or with the agent over the price attached to the work, but they are 
separate from the artist and his integrity and his interpretation of his 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you disagree with the critic, don't hold it against the artist." He said 
each wine lover should judge the wine on his or her own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Over that I have no quarrel. I agree with Baron that Dominus is Moueix's 
personal statement. And I agree with Moueix's aging of the wine in older oak 
barrels as well as the fact that he doesn't add acid, a tactic that might make 
them too tart. The aroma and sandpaper-y texture of Dominus is what I find too 
challenging to spend a lot of money on -- yet I realize that some people simply 
love this wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, de gustibus . . . .

GOOD COOKING: SALADS AS GOOD AS STORE-BOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The salads, cooked foods and baked goods from the Paris food shops of renowned 
French pastry-maker and caterer Gaston Lenotre make bountiful buffets; they're 
also great for informal meals.  
</P>
<P>
 These three salads, influenced by Lenotre's style, can be made at least a day 
head and are appropriate for a vast range of entertaining -- summer parties, 
picnics and barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 The multicolored potato salad with vegetables and sausage can be served as a 
first course; it will also stand on its own as a main course for an informal 
lunch. A salad of shredded carrots is present at every carry-out shop in Paris; 
this one is greatly enhanced by toasted pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When fennel is blanched, it becomes incredibly sweet and delicate. As a 
result, this fennel salad is the simplest combination of lemon juice and olive 
oil, bringing out the inherent flavor of the fennel. MULTICOLORED POTATO SALAD

IN THE KITCHEN; I JAM, I SAID

 If strawberry jam is the essence of sweetness and innocence, why does it cause 
so much trouble in the kitchen? 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberries are high in water and low in pectin and acid. As any jam and 
jelly maker will tell you, that spells trouble with a capital T, which in this 
case stands for "thin." In fact, most jelly makers add pectin to strawberry jam 
to make it thicker. But when you add pectin, you have to add more sugar, and 
then all that sweetness clouds a strawberry's sunny taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I've investigated different methods of making strawberry jam 
-- everything from the almost-instant quick-boiling technique to the 
comparatively glacial "sun preserves" (you set the berries outside, uncovered, 
and let the sun evaporate the liquid). The first method consistently failed to 
jell, yielding a pretty tasty syrup. The latter I didn't even attempt. Maybe if 
I lived someplace with no bugs . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This year, I tried a new way, and I think it works the best so far. An 
adaptation of a recipe from Helen Witty's "Fancy Pantry" -- a great guide for 
those starting to can and pickle -- it's kind of a combination of the 
quick-boil and sun-dried methods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberries and sugar are macerated overnight, then brought to a quick boil 
and poured into a large, shallow pan where they cool quickly and set out 
(unrefrigerated but indoors) for several days. Finally, the strawberry juice is 
drained into a preserving pan and cooked to the jellying point (between 220 and 
225 degrees). The strawberries are added to the syrup, then the lot is brought 
back to a boil. Finally, it is canned. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a lot of trouble, but you do it over several days. Believe me, 
after five batches this spring, the family got used to having trays of cooling 
berries sitting around the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an interesting process. First, unless you have tried it, you can't 
imagine how much liquid a strawberry gives off when macerated with sugar. After 
12 hours from a completely dry start, a half flat of strawberries mixed with 
five cups of sugar will swim in liquid -- roughly 6 1/2 cups -- while the 
berries have reduced to only six cups. 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, I can't figure the purpose of the next step, the initial 
boiling, except that perhaps the fruit breaks down more to allow better 
penetration of the sugar (sugar, of course, is quite literally what preserves 
jams and jellies, preventing molds from forming). 
</P>
<P>
 Something certainly happens. In the cooling and rest period that follow, the 
mass of the jam reduces by about one-third -- the result of a combination of 
evaporation and the fruit reabsorbing the liquid it earlier gave off. In one 
test run, the amount of liquid reduced from 6 1/2 cups to 4. Curiously, the 
solids reduced as well, by almost an identical amount -- from 6 cups to 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though it may not seem so, leaving the fruit at room temperature is safe -- 
the presence of so much sugar discourages anything from growing. Besides, 
anything that does grow will surely be killed as the jam is later heated to 
between 220 degrees and 225 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The heating process, which calls for a balancing of several factors, is the 
most complicated part of making the jam. First, you want to cook the jelly as 
quickly as possible, to keep the taste as fresh as you can. But if the heat is 
too high, the jelly scorches. At the same time, the jellying point for this 
sugar syrup should be 220 degrees (at sea level, anyway; at higher altitudes, 
add eight degrees to the boiling point of water). If it fails to reach that 
temperature, the jelly surely won't hold and you'll be left with a very syrupy 
jam. But if you cook it too far past that temperature, the jelly will be tough 
and the flavor, of course, will be even more cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see the physical changes in the sugar solution as it progresses from 
liquid to syrup to jelly. At first, the sugar syrup bubbles thinly like boiling 
water, though, thanks to the sugar, at a much lower temperature -- roughly 180 
degrees. After a couple of minutes, as the temperature climbs to 200 degrees, 
the frothy bubbles start to build structure, more than doubling in volume and 
taking on an almost plastic appearance. (It is at this point that you must be 
diligent in watching for boil-overs. You don't know sticky until you've cleaned 
up baked-on, boiled-over jelly.) 
</P>
<P>
 This plasticity increases until the foam looks almost like marshmallows, 
though the volume subsides as the temperature approaches 210 degrees. The 
hotter the syrup gets, the smaller the bubbles become. At 215 degrees, the 
syrup is thick enough to coat the holes in a slotted spoon. At 217 degrees, the 
syrup suddenly smells a little burnt and deep stirring shows a bit of scorch on 
the tip of the spoon, so I take the pot off the heat to cool. Before putting it 
back on, I reduce the heat to medium-low and begin stirring constantly to keep 
it from scorching further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 220 degrees -- which, if the thermometer is accurate, should be the 
jellying point -- the syrup starts to bubble more, in big bubbles that seem to 
push through the foam from the bottom. The syrup turns darker. When I tilt the 
pan from side to side, I can see the bottom cleanly as the big bubbles come 
through the thick foam. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure the temperature is sufficient, I push it a little further, then 
add the strawberries all at once. There is much hissing, the foam goes 
completely away and I stir madly to keep it from scorching more. I return the 
heat to high and just barely bring the berries to the boil. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 12 1/2 cups I started with, the jam has reduced to 6 1/2 cups -- 
liquids and solids combined. (In this test batch, it turns out, the jam cooked 
a bit too long. There is a hint of scorch in the taste, but most importantly, 
the flavor is not as fresh as it would be if it had cooked less.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think canning requires a lot of fancy equipment but, in truth (as 
in any kind of cooking), special equipment only makes the job easier -- it 
doesn't necessarily make the finished product any better. Still, at times I 
would give anything for a good canning funnel and jar lifter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, at my house I make do with a couple of battered spaghetti pots -- 
one wider than it is tall, with non-stick coating; the other taller than it is 
wide, and with a steamer insert. While the jam cooks in the first (the 
non-stick finish is very handy for clean-up), the second is filled with water, 
then heated to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
 After the jam has finished cooking, I ladle it into sterilized jars while the 
jam is still hot, wipe the rims clean, fasten the lids and carefully lower the 
jars into the boiling water (when all the jars are in the pot, the water must 
cover the tops). I let it boil for 20 minutes, then use the steamer insert to 
remove the jars all at once. The jars are wiped clean (inevitably, you'll spill 
some strawberry schmutz on the outside when you're ladling them full) and set 
aside to cool. The next morning, I press each jar lid. If one pops back up, the 
boiling procedure needs to be repeated (in my five batches this spring, this 
has yet to happen). 
</P>
<P>
 Does this method make the perfect strawberry jam? I won't go that far, but 
it's the best I've yet made. The taste is usually fresh and bright, and it has 
hit a really nice jell four tries out of five. From my experience, that's a 
pretty good percentage when working with something as devilish as strawberries. 
And the way I figure it, all I have to do with the flop is make up labels for 
"Strawberry Sauce" instead of "Strawberry Jam."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the fruit is extremely important in making any kind of 
preserve. Carefully cull the strawberries, removing any bruises and soft spots. 
You want berries that are ripe, but it is better that they be slightly 
underripe than over -- the pectin is higher in the former. While I prefer the 
Chandler variety of strawberries for eating raw, I find the Seascape variety 
works better in jam -- it's drier and less sweet, and I think it gives a 
slightly spicier preserve.  
</P>
<P>
 STRAWBERRY JAM 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 flat strawberries (6 pints) 
</P>
<P>
 5 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Juice 1/2 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse, drain and hull strawberries. Cut each strawberry in half. Layer 
strawberries in large mixing bowl with sugar. Mix well and let set overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Next day, bring strawberry mixture to boil and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Remove 
from heat, stir in lemon juice and pour into large, flat container. Let cool in 
container. Let stand, unrefrigerated, at least 3 days. 
</P>
<P>
 To make preserves, prepare large canning kettle full of boiling water and 6 
clean, scalded 8-ounce jelly jars and lids. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain liquid from strawberries and bring liquid to boil over medium-high heat. 
Watch carefully or it will boil over. Maintain at full boil until candy 
thermometer reaches 220 degrees. Add reserved strawberries, stir in thoroughly, 
reduce heat to medium and boil, stirring constantly, until berries come back to 
full boil, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat and ladle hot mixture into jars. With clean, damp cloth, wipe 
rims of jars. Attach lids and screw tight. Put jars in boiling water in canning 
kettle and boil 20 minutes. Remove from water, wipe clean and leave to cool. 
When cool, check lids. Lids should not spring back when pressed down. Store in 
cool, dry place until opened, then in refrigerator. Makes 6 (8-ounce) jars.

SIMPSON'S NEW LAWYER SEEKS SECOND AUTOPSY; INQUIRY: ATTORNEY ROBERT SHAPIRO IS 
HIRED BY EX-FOOTBALL STAR, WHO IS REPORTEDLY BEING TREATED FOR DEPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As authorities sifted through evidence Wednesday in a double slaying 
attracting international attention, O.J. Simpson hired a new lawyer who said he 
will seek a second autopsy and private forensic tests and announced that the 
ex-football great is under treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 'He is deeply upset," said Robert L. Shapiro, one of Los Angeles' best-known 
lawyers, whom Simpson retained early Wednesday. "He is under a doctor's care 
for depression. . . . He is going to be in seclusion with his family to grieve 
over the loss of the mother of his children." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he told Simpson, who has not emerged in public since Monday: 
"Don't turn on the TV, don't read the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has spent the night with his two young children and with his family," 
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a source close to Simpson said the former football player slipped out 
of his Brentwood home Tuesday to meet the children at another location. He 
returned home Wednesday, the source said, and they went back to their 
grandparents' house in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement released after he took over the case, Shapiro said 
Simpson was at his Brentwood home waiting for a limousine when his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and a 25-year-old male friend were killed Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson traveled to the airport late that evening and caught a "red eye" 
flight for Chicago. A source said he was the only passenger to travel in the 
first-class section of the American Airlines flight from Los Angeles 
International Airport to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's previous attorney, Howard Weitzman, had said he believed that 
Simpson was in the limousine or at the airport when the killings occurred. So 
far, an exact time of death has not been released by authorities, although 
Weitzman has said he was told that it was about 11 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police discovered the bodies after midnight and called Simpson at 
his Chicago hotel Monday morning to tell him that his ex-wife had been found 
dead in Brentwood. Simpson, who made a number of phone calls from the hotel, 
returned to Los Angeles that morning and was questioned by police the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 As Simpson remained secluded Wednesday, the family of his ex-wife's friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman, held an emotional news conference. Goldman, 25, was a 
waiter at a Brentwood restaurant and, his friends said, a frequent companion of 
Nicole Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening he was killed, he had gone to her house to return a pair of 
glasses that someone in her party had left at the restaurant that night. 
Wednesday, Goldman's family gathered outside their Oak Park home in Ventura 
County to talk about his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron was a special human being who didn't deserve what's happened," said the 
victim's father, Fred Goldman, as his wife wiped tears from his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simpson's young children were staying out of sight at the Monarch 
Bay home of Nicole Simpson's parents. A woman who identified herself as a 
friend of the family answered the phone there and said the children had been 
told that their mother was dead. The children -- Sidney, 9, and Justin, 6 -- 
were doing as well as could be expected, the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the family will have nothing further to say until next week 
after funeral services. They issued a statement Tuesday expressing sadness at 
the loss of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles Police Department has not officially declared O.J. 
Simpson as a suspect in the killings, sources close to the case have said he is 
a suspect. Weitzman -- who has vigorously defended Simpson's innocence over the 
past three tumultuous days -- is to remain as an adviser, but he has given up 
the lead role to Shapiro, a celebrated Century City lawyer whose clients have 
included Darryl Strawberry and Tina Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he has stepped down, Weitzman said in a statement: "I have 
decided because of my personal relationship with O.J. Simpson and my many other 
professional commitments I can no longer give O.J. the attention he both 
deserves and needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Shapiro's first moves were to solicit the services of a criminologist 
and a pathologist, whom he would not identify except to say that each is a top 
professional. They will respectively review the findings of the police and 
perform a second autopsy on the two victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts would only have standing in the case if Simpson were to face 
charges, as witnesses are not entitled to bring in their own experts to review 
evidence. Nevertheless, Shapiro said he had no information indicating that 
Simpson's arrest is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro met with police Wednesday, saying afterward that he had pledged 
Simpson's full cooperation during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have introduced myself to the members of the Los Angeles Police 
Department," Shapiro said, "and to offer our complete cooperation with them in 
their investigation to solve this crime." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little word from investigators Wednesday. Sources said they were 
continuing to interview witnesses -- including a therapist who said she treated 
Nicole Simpson on two occasions. Simpson's ex-wife said during the sessions 
that he was stalking her, the therapist has said. 
</P>
<P>
 But police were waiting on results of blood tests and other forensic evidence. 
Sources inside the Police Department have said that if blood samples taken from 
Simpson's car and home match those of either victim, investigators will move 
quickly to arrest Simpson or to arrange for his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, if any of the blood samples taken from the scene match Simpson's, 
investigators are expected to move quickly against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary results from those blood tests could be ready as early as today, 
sources said, though other forensic work such as microscopic searches of 
Simpson's shoes and clothing could take longer, as will detailed DNA testing of 
the blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Once police make an arrest, they have 48 hours to present a case to the 
district attorney's office for prosecution.

 ENDLESS RACE: Appointed Ventura County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon will 
have to wait a few more days to find out who he will face in a November runoff. 
. . . Last week, with 8,000 absentee ballots still uncounted, Scott Weiss held 
a slim 74-vote lead over Richard Morrisset for second place in the June 
primary.Now with all but 500 votes counted, Morrisset is ahead by five votes. 
The final results are scheduled to be released Tuesday. "It's frustrating," 
Weiss said. "But then I guess it's better to be in this position than to have 
been eliminated from the race already."

 POPPIN' PURPLE: Stone Temple Pilots, whose lead singer, known just as Weiland, 
hails from Huntington Beach and Orange Coast College, have made a name for 
themselves. Their new album, "Purple," sold 252,000 copies last week and enters 
the nation's pop chart at No. 1 on Saturday. . . . The group plays at Irvine 
Meadows on July 17. Their opening act will be Wiskey Biscuit, from Huntington 
Beach. Its drummer is Weiland's younger brother Michael.

 BY THE SCORE? You know it would be silly to try to count the fish in a sea. Or 
is it? There's a divers' meeting tonight at the Orange County Marine Institute 
in Dana Point to prepare for the Great American Fish Count, July 1-14. . . . 
Its purpose is to identify and count the variety of sea life. It was started up 
the coast at Channel Islands National Park two years ago but now has divers 
involved up and down the coast. Organizer Gary Davis hopes to increase public 
awareness of marine life.

self-proclaimed "originator, architect and emancipator of rock 'n' roll," will

 DIAL-A-SMITH: Opponents of Steve Smith's proposed "bikini bar" in La Habra 
decided one good way to rattle him was to call him on the phone to protest 
their concerns. Only problem is, Steve Smith lives in Fullerton, not La Habra. 
And Judy Smith, the wife of a La Habra Steve Smith, is seething at the flood of 
calls: "Open a bikini bar? Give me a break. That's not what Mormons usually 
do." . . . At least something came from the calls: Steve and Judy Smith have 
joined the protest against the bar.

 Hundreds of Rwandans crowded elbow to elbow in Kigali's open-air market 
Wednesday, determined to fill their cupboards despite warfare that has ripped 
apart their country. 
</P>
<P>
 The next moment they cringed in the dirt or ran for their lives as an 
artillery shell howled toward them.The shell, which wounded several people, 
provoked a retaliatory barrage from nearby government guns, which earlier had 
peppered Rwandan Patriotic Front positions on the next ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing violence brutally contradicted a cease-fire pledged Tuesday in 
Tunis, Tunisia, between representatives of Hutu-dominated government forces and 
rebels of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France is ready to 
intervene if the cease-fire fails and the killings continue. 
</P>
<P>
 France would organize "with its principal European or African partners an 
intervention on the ground aiming to protect groups threatened with 
extermination," Juppe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of French and Belgian troops left Rwanda after evacuating thousands 
of foreigners two months ago, early in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasteur Bizimungu, head of the rebel delegation at the Organization of African 
Unity summit in Tunis, said Tuesday he would order his troops to respect the 
truce immediately. But other officials from both sides said they had no plans 
to silence their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be a cease-fire in Tunis, but not here," said Capt. Nakoura 
Katanga, 28, a Togolese officer in the lightly armed 450-member U.N. monitoring 
force, as he sped in his white U.N. truck away from the market.

GOP BID TO CUT WHITE HOUSE'S BUDGET REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House refused to trim the White House budget by the cost of last month's 
helicopter golf outing as Democrats staved off Republican attempts Wednesday to 
embarrass President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 By a nearly party-line 236-195 vote, lawmakers rejected a GOP proposal to 
reduce next year's planned $270-million spending for the White House by 
$13,129.66. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the cost of a May 24 ride David Watkins, director of White House 
administration, and two other aides took on a military helicopter to the 
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., and on to Holly Hills Country Club 
near New Market, Md., for a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans said the wrist-slap provision was aimed at forcing the White House 
to reveal more information about the use of government helicopters. It was one 
of several GOP measures aimed at forcing disclosure of internal information by 
a White House they said was overly secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a partisan amendment," said Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R-Md.), who 
sponsored the provision. "All of us in government are affected when trips like 
this helicopter golfing trip occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said he was scouting the golf course for a possible presidential 
visit. He was fired over the incident and eventually agreed to repay the cost 
of the flight. The White House has since limited staff use of military 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, Democrats said Bartlett's proposal was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House was properly embarrassed by this incident," said Rep. Steny 
H. Hoyer (D-Md.). "It was wrong. . . . This incident is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rejected Republican provisions was an amendment by Rep. Dan Burton 
(R-Ind.) trimming $5 million because he said the White House has not provided 
full information on the people who accompanied Clinton on his D-day anniversary 
trip to France.

GATHERING STORM ADDS TO ANGELS' FRUSTRATION; BASEBALL: AFTER 4-3 LOSS TO 
ROYALS, TEAM HEADS TO CHICAGO TO AWAIT WORD ON POSSIBLE STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hotel operator will leave early wake-up calls in Chicago this morning for 
the Angels, and some time around 9:30 they will groggily begin boarding the 
team bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of departing for Comiskey Park, the Angels will be heading to Chicago 
O'Hare Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where they might learn how much longer they'll be playing baseball 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels surely could choose better ways to spend their mornings, 
particularly after losing again Wednesday night, 4-3 to the Kansas City Royals 
at Kauffman Stadium, and taking a late-night flight to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Angels say this could be the most critical meeting in their baseball 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I've been trying to put it out of my mind as much as possible," 
Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said, "but these may be our last games of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Said pitcher Chuck Finley: "It's like seeing a storm rolling in from two or 
three miles away. You see it coming, but there's nothing you can do about it 
but get ready to put the tarp on." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players Assn., will address 
the Angels and many player-representatives about the owners' new labor 
proposal. It's possible that a strike date will be set. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep talking about a competitive balance, and that really bothers me," 
said Mark Langston, Angel player-representative. "I'm not buying that, because 
there is competitive balance. Look at how many different teams keep winning. 
It's not like the big-market teams are dominating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the competitive-balance concept is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (27-39) believe a strike is a certainty, with a maximum of $147,000 
reserved in the strike fund for each veteran player who has been in the big 
leagues since 1990. Angel management says a work stoppage could be just as 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Angels' $23-million payroll, the fourth lowest in the major 
leagues, the Angels could lose in excess of $8 million if there is a prolonged 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel President Richard Brown could not comment on how much the club could 
lose, but did say that a lengthy strike could result in personnel layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a strike," Brown said, "we'll lose significant dollars. That would 
take away a lot of revenue, and we're cutting very few expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You run into a situation where your revenue sources are gone, and you may 
have to lay off employees to reduce expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if a salary cap is put in place as the owners desire, Brown believes the 
Angels' fate could soon change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teams that have the ability for big payrolls are fielding far superior 
teams than us," Brown said. "We're just hopeful we can play on a level playing 
field some day." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, that is not occurring these days, with the Angels losing for the 
13th time in the last 17 games. It's only the seventh time this season they 
lost a game when they yielded four or fewer runs, but it hardly eased their 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have lost 32 of 33 games when trailing after the seventh 
inning, overcame a 3-1 deficit. Jim Edmonds hit a run-scoring double in the 
eighth. And in the ninth, Bo Jackson led off with a pinch-hit double. DiSarcina 
sacrificed pinch-runner Mark Dalesandro to third, and he scored on Spike Owen's 
single. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Royals made it moot when Hubie Brooks led off the ninth with a 
pinch-hit single off reliever Craig Lefferts. Felix Jose grounded into a 
fielder's choice, but former Angel Wally Joyner followed with a single to 
right, advancing Jose to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann summoned right-hander Mark Leiter to face Jose 
Lind. Leiter quickly got ahead on an 0-and-2 count, but Lind was able to hit a 
slider into shallow center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Curtis caught the ball, but his throw to the plate was about 20 feet up 
the line, and Jose scored easily with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Joe Magrane yielded seven hits and three earned runs in 7 1/3 
innings.

MOMENTUM RUNS OVER TO KNICKS; NBA FINALS: NEW YORK DOMINATES BOARDS AND GETS 
EVEN WITH ROCKETS, 91-82, DESPITE OLAJUWON'S BIG GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT-HOWARD COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Garden party stretched from Tuesday into Wednesday and from hockey into 
basketball, all the way to that halftime collision of the sports when the 
Rangers' Mark Messier walked the Stanley Cup on to the court. The crowd roared, 
then turned its attention back to the matter at hand, the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah. The NBA finals. No longer an undercard in their own building, the 
pressure to win suddenly fell to the Knicks, who in turn survived Hakeem 
Olajuwon's first real fourth-quarter appearance to beat the Houston Rockets, 
91-82, in Game 4 before 19,763 at Madison Square Garden and even the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers a Knick setback would present were obvious: Lose and be one game 
away from elimination with three to play, two in Houston. Olajuwon heaped it on 
the other day by saying going down 3-1 would "demoralize their confidence" and 
that the Knicks would "choke" from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, from which they have flourished before, the Knicks 
responded again. Charles Oakley had 20 rebounds, nine on offense, and 16 
points. Derek Harper scored 21 points and made five three-pointers, one away 
from the finals record shared by Michael Cooper, Bill Laimbeer and Michael 
Jordan. Patrick Ewing had 16 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, they rebounded from the Game 3 loss here because they rebounded, 
dominating the Rockets on the boards, 50-33. That included a 21-7 margin on the 
offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the deciding factor in this game was rebounding," Rocket Coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich said. "We knew coming into this series that they were the No. 1 
rebounding team in the league. The first three games, we did a good job in that 
area. Tonight, it was like they just wanted it more. But being down 21-7 on the 
offensive boards, it was sort of amazing we were even in the basketball game." 
</P>
<P>
 They were more than in it. Recovering from a 17-2 start, the Rockets had 
earned a 72-72 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ewing scored from the lane, John Starks made one free throw and Oakley 
made two from the line. The Knicks were suddenly up by five. Olajuwon responded 
with a short fallaway to cut the deficit to 77-74, part of his 14 points in the 
fourth quarter after coming in with only two field goals combined in the final 
quarters of the first three games, and Houston seemed in great position to get 
closer when Ewing missed both free throws with 3:54 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem. Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing despite a sprained ankle and a sore heel, he controlled the offensive 
rebound enough to tip it out to Starks, who converted Oakley's hustle into a 
three-pointer from the right side that built the lead back to five. It was the 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oak is the heart and soul of the basketball team," said Starks, who finished 
with 20 points. "He was playing on a bad ankle, but he didn't let it affect his 
game. He was still doing a number on the boards. We don't want to let him down, 
knowing he's out there giving it his all." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. But just to make sure, when the Rockets got within 82-78 on a 
basket and subsequent free throw from Carl Herrera with 2:50 to go, Starks 
answered with another three-pointer from the right side. That seven-point 
advantage proved insurmountable, even with Ewing fouling out with 1:13 left and 
Olajuwon powering his way to a game-high 32 points and five blocked shots, 
though the regular-season most valuable player had only eight rebounds and none 
on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 No demoralizing situations here, and any choke will have to wait. The Knicks 
had earned, at the very least, a trip back to the Summit, where they split the 
first two games of the series, and the opportunity to take a lead along as 
carry-on baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to us to create that momentum," Starks said. "We can do that come 
Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets played most of the final 15:25 without starting small forward 
Robert Horry, who suffered a bruised wrist and hand and bruised lower back 
after a flagrant foul by Anthony Mason under the basket late in the third 
quarter. Horry came out and tried to return in the fourth quarter, but lasted 
only 44 seconds before leaving again, this time for good. He is scheduled to 
have X-rays today. "The pain was so terrible, I thought something must be 
broken," he said. . . . Houston's 14 first-quarter points were one above the 
finals record for fewest in an opening quarter, set by Ft. Wayne in 1955 and 
matched by Milwaukee in 1974. The 33 first-half points were three away from the 
record, set by the Rockets in 1981. . . . Pat Riley solved his problem on 
whether to use Rolando Blackman ahead of struggling Hubert Davis as the backup 
shooting guard. He didn't play either. . . . The Knicks have held 21 of 22 
playoff opponents to less than 100 points.

MORNING BRIEFING: MAKING SOCCER POPULAR HERE DEFINITELY ISN'T CHILD'S PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution writes that the World Cup is 
soccer's last chance to gain popularity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have tried to get to the children, hustling them onto the nation's flat 
places where they can swarm around the ball like ants on a sugar cube. 
</P>
<P>
 "But eventually, American kids outgrow soccer, just as they do acne and 
politeness." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the only major league pitcher to start 400 games and 
relieve in 400 games? 
</P>
<P>
 Bon appetit: Patrick Ewing, dining out last week in Houston with his wife and 
two children, ordered cheesecake for dessert. When it arrived at his table, 
someone in the kitchen had spelled out "Go Rockets" in strawberry syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was reportedly not amused and stormed out of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare cases: Joe Girardi, player representative for the Colorado Rockies, 
warning his teammates of a potential baseball strike this summer: "What I've 
told the guys is to be ready to live on two-thirds of your salary," he said. 
"Plan for that. And don't make any large purchases." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Collier of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writes: "Imagine, the minimum 
wagers are preparing to live on $70,000, Bobby Bonilla on $4.2 million and the 
average player on about $800,000. Do you think the International Red Cross 
should know about this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Little League item: Bernie Lincicome of the Chicago Tribune, on a Bat Day 
promotion at Wrigley Field: "The bat was a present of this newspaper, though it 
is so short that what use it might be put to is unclear. Maybe as a baton or 
tongue depressor." 
</P>
<P>
 Big D's legacy: It could be said that Roger Clemens, hard-throwing Boston Red 
Sox pitcher, is a disciple of the late Don Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Drysdale) said something I've always enjoyed," Clemens said. "He said, 'The 
most important pitch of the game is the second knockdown pitch.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the hitter knows the first one wasn't an accident. That's the way it is 
when I bust a guy twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? Larry Nelson, who won the U.S. Open in 1983 at Oakmont Country 
Club, has a special exemption to play in this year's Open at the same site. 
</P>
<P>
 He's constantly reminded of his Open victory. His home along the 18th fairway 
at Atlanta Country Club is on Oakmont Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1968, Lee Trevino became the first golfer to play 
all four rounds of the U.S. Open under par, defeating runner-up Jack Nicklaus 
by four strokes at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Charlie Hough of the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Bob Uecker, on the Philadelphia Phillies' fans: "You know what they 
do when the game is rained out? They go to the airport and boo bad landings."

 Dan O'Brien flirted with his world record in the decathlon for nine events 
before succumbing to heat and dehydration at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 With only the 1,500-meter run remaining in the USA-Mobil Outdoor Track and 
Field Championships on Wednesday night, O'Brien was 14 points ahead of his 
world-record pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had nothing left for the 1,500, struggling home in 5 minutes 16.42 
seconds. The weary O'Brien needed a 4:44.29 to break the record of 8,891 points 
he set at Talence, France, Sept. 4-5, 1992.

 "I was just plain old tired," he said, after finishing with 8,707 points, best 
by an American this year and sixth-best ever by an American.

 Linebacker Alfred Williams, an inconsistent performer since the Cincinnati

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is fashionable for sportswriters to say they don't give a damn, whether 
there is a baseball strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but I do. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Summer wouldn't be the same without the summer game, especially this summer. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 No box scores in the morning. No debates in the afternoon about whether Tom 
Lasorda should have gone to his bullpen. No scoring explosions in the evening. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 No Ken Griffey Jr. going for 60 home runs. No Paul O'Neill or Tony Gwynn going 
for .400. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm even starting to like the three-division alignment. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers wouldn't be within shouting distance of the Atlanta Braves if 
there were still only two divisions in the National League. Instead, they have 
a nice lead in the West. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There figure to be some exciting races for division championships and 
wild-card berths in September and October -- if there is a September and an 
October, that is. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 How strange that a superbly conditioned athlete such as Ryne Sandberg retired 
at 34 and a playboy such as Babe Ruth didn't retire until he was 40. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was the 56th anniversary of Johnny Vander Meer's second consecutive 
no-hitter, 6-0, over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Otherwise, that would have been best 
remembered as the first night game at Ebbets Field. . . .

 Jose Rijo is teaching Cincinnati Red rookie Hector Carrasco to throw a slider 
to go along with his 95-m.p.h. fastball. . . .

 Biggest joke in the voting for the All-Star game is that San Francisco Giant 
catcher Kirt Manwaring has 199,000 more votes than Mike Piazza. . . .

 It's surprising that Delino DeShields, who has missed 22 of the Dodgers' 65 
games, still ranks among the top 10 in stolen bases. . . .

 After faltering in the discus and falling behind in his bid to break his world 
record in the decathlon, Dan O'Brien picked up enough steam to stand 14 points 
ahead of the pace with only the 1,500 meters remaining Wednesday in the 
USA-Mobil Track & Field Championships at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien began the day 18 points ahead of his world-record pace after the first 
five decathlon events, in which he compiled a world-best 4,738 points, but he 
fell 28 points behind after seven events.

his time during his world-record performance at Talence, France, in September, 
1992.

 But his discus throw was only 152 feet, compared to 159-4 two years ago, and 
his seven-event total was 6,509 points, down from 6,537.

ASTROS' DRABEK SHOWS GIANTS THAT 1993 IS ONLY A MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Staked to an early 3-0 lead Wednesday, Doug Drabek showed off the aggressive 
pitching style that is helping him and the Houston Astros forget about his 
dismal 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (9-3) allowed just one earned run and pitched his league-leading fifth 
complete game to lead the Astros to a 7-2 win over the San Francisco Giants. 
The game provided a perfect example of why the former Cy Young winner, who lost 
an NL-high 18 games last season, is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was staying ahead of the hitters, Houston pounded out 12 hits, and 
the heart of the Astros' order drove in six runs. The defense turned two double 
plays behind him, and catcher Scott Servais cut down two would-be base 
stealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some good defensive plays behind me," Drabek said. "When you know 
that's happening, you can go after a team and not give them a chance to get 
back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're scoring for me and that makes me more aggressive, but you can't let 
your guard down." 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek never allowed the punchless Giants, losers of 11 of their last 15 
games, more than one hit an inning. He scattered eight hits, walked one and 
struck out five, even adding two hits of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it a lot easier for him to pitch and a lot harder for us to hit when 
Drabek gets the lead like he had early today. Then he can use all his pitches 
and you don't know what he's going to throw at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 At the plate, Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Luis Gonzalez did most of the 
damage against the Giants for the second day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 With Houston leading 3-1, Caminiti led off the sixth against John Burkett 
(4-5) with his 12th homer. Gonzalez followed with a double and scored on 
Servais' perfect squeeze bunt to give Houston a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh, Craig Biggio's double and an intentional walk to Jeff Bagwell 
ended Burkett's outing. Left-hander Pat Gomez's wild pitch moved up the 
runners, and Gonzalez hit a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start swinging the bats as a team, that's what makes it difficult" 
on other teams, Astros manager Terry Collins said. "Now they have to think 
about who they want to pitch to." 
</P>
<P>
 Burkett, who has only one victory since April 30, allowed a season-high seven 
runs on 10 hits in six-plus innings. Knowing that Houston is a better offensive 
team this season didn't make him any less frustrated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good offensive teams," Burkett said. "If you give up seven 
runs in six innings, that's not good no matter who you're playing." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco rallied for one run in the seventh when Barry Bonds doubled, 
went to second on a groundout and scored on shortstop Andujar Cedeno's fielding 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting two doubles Tuesday, Bagwell doubled again in the first and 
scored on Caminiti's single. The Astros took a 3-0 lead in the third on an RBI 
double by Bagwell, who later came home on Gonzalez's fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bottom of the third, Kirt Manwaring led off with a double and scored on 
Darren Lewis' double-play ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlins 13, Cardinals 3 -- The Florida Marlins limped into St. Louis and left 
on top of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Colbrunn drove in four runs and Jeff Conine went 4-for-6 with three RBIs 
as the Marlins set four team records. The Marlins had lost five in a row before 
wining the last two games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while you're going to have one of those games where 
everything goes right and everything works for you," Conine said. "Today was 
one of those days for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little grueling," Manager Joe Torre said. "It happens. You get your 
butt kicked and come back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Marlins starter had a hit by the third inning as they roughed up Rick 
Sutcliffe (3-3) and reliever Bryan Eversgerd.

<P>
 The Florida Marlins were almost as hot as the weather in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Colbrunn drove in four runs and Jeff Conine went four for six with three 
runs batted in Wednesday as the Marlins set four team records in a 13-3 rout of 
the Cardinals on the 133-degree artificial surface at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while you're going to have one of those games where 
everything goes right and everything works for you," Conine said. "Today was 
one of those days for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those days to forget for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little grueling," Manager Joe Torre said. "It happens. You get your 
butt kicked and come back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Marlin starter had a hit by the third inning as they roughed up Rick 
Sutcliffe (3-3) -- who has given up 13 earned runs in 8 1/3 innings this month 
-- and reliever Bryan Eversgerd. The Marlins had a team-record eight doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 They also set team records with 22 hits -- nine in a seven-run third inning -- 
and 10 extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbrunn went three for four with a double and a sacrifice fly. Conine had 
three doubles and has 15 RBIs in his last 14 games. Kurt Abbott homered for the 
second consecutive day, doubled and singled in his first three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, San Francisco 2 -- Staked to an early 3-0 lead at San Francisco, 
Doug Drabek showed off the aggressive pitching style that is helping him and 
the Astros forget about a 1993 season in which he lost 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (9-3) allowed only one earned run and pitched his league-leading fifth 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros pounded out 12 hits, and Drabek never allowed the Giants, losers of 
11 of their last 15 games, more than one an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 1, Philadelphia 0 -- Bobby Jones and John Franco combined on a 
four-hitter and Todd Hundley drove in the game's only run at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (7-5) retired 17 batters in a row at one point and left after eight 
innings. Franco pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 252nd save, tying him 
with Dave Righetti for most by a left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, Colorado 0 -- David Justice had two solo homers and three RBIs and 
John Smoltz (5-6) won his third consecutive game, leading the Braves at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice raised his lifetime average against the Rockies to .417 (30 for 72). 
The two home runs -- Nos. 9 and 10 of the season -- gave him nine homers and 25 
RBIs against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 13, Pittsburgh 2 -- Ken Hill became the league's second 10-game 
winner and Darrin Fletcher had four RBIs at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Moises Alou went three for four, hit his 11th homer, scored three times and 
drove in two runs as the Expos completed a three-game sweep of the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, San Diego 0 -- The Cubs took advantage of three Padre errors at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After Rick Wilkins tripled in the second inning, he scored on an error by 
Scott Livingstone for a 1-0 Chicago lead. Wilkins singled in two runs in the 
eighth inning after Ricky Gutierrez set up the runs by booting Kevin Roberson's 
ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs added two runs in the ninth inning when Shawon Dunston's bases-loaded 
grounder went through the legs of second baseman Bip Roberts.

 Chicago Cub second baseman Ryne Sandberg is being admired for retiring this 
week and forfeiting a potential $16 million, but Angel batting coach Rod Carew 
has difficulty respecting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy who had eight good years in the big leagues," Carew said."He has 
one bad year, and he walks out on his teammates. If I was on the team, I would 
have felt like he let me down as one of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say he doesn't care about money. How about the guys around him? What 
about them?

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GRIFFEY IS DEEP IN HEART OF TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Seattle Mariners played the Texas Rangers all the time, you could lock 
up the American League pennant race now. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ken Griffey Jr. hit only against Texas pitching, there isn't a record he 
wouldn't break. 
</P>
<P>
 If Randy Johnson, well, Randy Johnson can pitch against anybody. He had no 
trouble with the Rangers on Wednesday, winning, 5-2, at Arlington, Tex. Johnson 
is 8-3 in his career against the Rangers and 8-3 this season against everybody. 
He gave up six hits in eight innings for his sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It cut Seattle's deficit to four games behind the Rangers in the American 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much is made of the (poor quality of the) American League West, and that's 
why it's important to beat the teams in our division," Johnson said. "A lot of 
teams think we're pushovers, but when I go out there I can tell you, nobody is 
going to push me over." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's homer was his 29th, best in baseball, and he finished three for 
four. In seven games against the Rangers -- six of them won by Seattle -- 
Griffey has hit .531 with seven homers and 14 RBIs. He has 19 homers against 
Texas in his career, most against any team. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 7, Boston 5 -- Kent Hrbek and Shane Mack homered as the Twins won 
their seventh in a row and sent the Red Sox to their seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston has lost nine games in a row at Fenway Park, tying a similar streak in 
July of 1991. Those skids are the longest at home for the Red Sox since 1927, 
when they lost 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek hit a two-run homer into the center-field bleachers in the first inning 
and Mack capped a three-run third with a solo homer into the Red Sox bullpen in 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 4, Toronto 3 -- Jim Thome's 417-foot solo homer with one out in the 
bottom of the 13th inning gave the Indians their 14th consecutive home victory 
and first home sweep of the Blue Jays since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Mesa (7-3) pitched three scoreless innings for the victory, the Indians' 
fifth in a row and eighth in nine extra-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 8, New York 4 -- Chris Hoiles, who homered earlier, hit a sacrifice 
fly in a five-run eighth inning that sent the Orioles past the Yankees at 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoiles had two hits and two RBIs, ending a two-for-21 slump. Chris Sabo also 
homered for the Orioles, who rebounded from two losses to New York to win their 
seventh game in the last 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Gomez tied the score with an RBI double, and Hoiles gave Baltimore the 
lead with a sacrifice fly. Tim Hulett followed with an RBI double and Jack 
Voigt hit a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 11, Detroit 7 -- Greg Vaughn hit his 12th homer and Dave Nilsson 
went four for four as the Brewers won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Fielder and Junior Felix hit home runs for the Tigers, who have homered 
in 21 consecutive games, four short of the major league record set by the 1941 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 7, Chicago 5 -- Ruben Sierra hit a three-run homer, capping a four-run 
rally in the ninth inning for the Athletics at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's trailed, 5-3, in the ninth when Rickey Henderson singled with one. 
Roberto Hernandez (1-2) walked Stan Javier and gave up an RBI single to Brent 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra then homered.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; PRINCESS STAKES AMONG NATIONAL BEST-SEVEN RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Park has signed an agreement with the California Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Assn. that will permit certain races at the Inglewood 
track to be part of the National Best Seven, starting Saturday with the 
$100,000 Princess Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park has accepted wagers on the National Best Seven since it began 
three weeks ago, but the track's races have not been included. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both parties negotiated in good faith," said Eual Wyatt, Hollywood Park's 
general manager. "We're delighted to be a part of it after being out (as a host 
track) the first three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think our participation as a host track will make the bet much more 
appealing to fans in Southern California, as well as to fans in other parts of 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the National Best Seven, the Princess Stakes will be run as 
Hollywood Park's fifth race. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Princess, in which Sardula figures to be heavily favored, the 
other races in the National Best Seven this week are the Maxxam Gold Cup from 
Sam Houston, the Brooklyn Handicap from Belmont Park, the Ohio Derby from 
Thistledown, the Swoon's Son Handicap from Arlington, the Honeymoon Stakes from 
Louisiana Downs and the Chieftain Handicap from Pimlico.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the upsets by Romy ($69.40) at Arlington and Pleasant Dilemma 
($20.80) at Monmouth Park, no one had all seven winners last Saturday, so there 
is a carryover of $106,819.11 in the National Best Seven. There is also a 
jackpot pool of $43,177.10, which will be paid if there is only one ticket with 
seven winners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to miss the Belmont Stakes because of a bruised right front foot, 
Brocco will probably make his next start in the Swaps Stakes on July 23 at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Second to Valiant Nature in the Hollywood Futurity in his only start at 
Inglewood, Brocco is back in trainer Randy Winick's barn at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Swaps) would never have been in our game plan if he hadn't missed the 
Preakness and Belmont," Winick said. "But if he's ever going to get ready for 
fall, he needs that race. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing fine now. He's walking well and everything is back on course." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings for the trainers whose horses tested positive for scopolamine, a 
prohibited drug, have been delayed until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the hearings for Mark Hennig, Richard Mandella, Willard Proctor 
and Ron McAnally were to have been held next week before the Hollywood Park 
stewards, but they have been continued at the request of attorney Donald 
Calabria. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings for Lewis Cenicola and Bill Shoemaker, who had later scopolamine 
positives, have also been delayed until after the hearings for Hennig, 
Mandella, Proctor and McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, who dominated Inside Information and the rest of the field in last 
Sunday's Mother Goose Stakes at Belmont Park, has returned to Hollywood Park 
and could make her next start in the Hollywood Oaks on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the 3-year-old Seattle Slew filly, who has five victories and a 
second to Sardula in the Kentucky Oaks in six starts, may also return to New 
York for the $250,000 Coaching Club American Oaks on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaning toward running her here," trainer Gary Jones said. "But that will 
be (owner Mike) Rutherford's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a big meeting for mares in foal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after a pregnant Mittens And Mink won in her first start since last 
Sept. 12, two more expectant mothers scored victories Wednesday at Hollywood 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Splendid Dream, a 7-year-old Bel Bolide mare racing for the first time since 
April 1, 1993, won the seventh race, a $25,000 claimer. Ridden by Chris 
McCarron, she was making her first start for owner Winning Ways Stable and 
trainer Sandy Shulman, who claimed her for $40,000 from Golden Eagle Farm more 
than 14 months ago. She is in foal to Native Prospector. 
</P>
<P>
 A race later, Miss High Blade, who is in foal to Houston, led every step of 
the way under Kent Desormeaux and scored a $24.60 upset in the $60,000-added 
Estrapade Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux rode three winners Wednesday. His final victory came on Mr. 
Dipper, a 4-year-old first-time starter who is owned in part by Wilt 
Chamberlain. The gelded son of Java Gold, trained by Richard Mandella, won in 
1:16 for the 6 1/2 furlongs. . . . Eddie Delahoussaye, whose lingering ailment 
was recently diagnosed as sinusitis, was off his mounts Wednesday. . . . First 
post time will be 12:30 p.m. on July 15, rather than 7 p.m., because of the 
Riddick Bowe fight scheduled for that evening at Hollywood Park. Because the 
boxing ring will be placed on the main track, there will be eight turf races 
that day. First post time will also be 12:30 p.m. on July 14. . . . Megan's 
Interco, who was placed on the vet's list after winning the Shoemaker Handicap 
last month when he lost a shoe during the race, worked five furlongs in 59 4/5 
Wednesday for trainer Jenine Sahadi. . . . Semillon, who is expected to return 
in the American Handicap on July 4, worked six furlongs in 1:14 4/5 for trainer 
Mike Mitchell.

GRIFFIN HAS MORTIFYING FIRST IN FIRST AS WEST'S ALL-STARS FALL TO EAST, 7-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All things considered, pitching aces Sara Griffin of Simi Valley High and 
Jennifer Gould of El Camino Real would probably rather have had their own teams 
playing behind them instead of a bunch of senior all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by nine hits (four that didn't leave the infield) and five errors, the 
East scored a 7-0 victory against Griffin, Gould and the West in the Daily News 
all-star softball game Wednesday at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, Cal-Hi Sports state player of the year in 1993, had not given up 
three runs in an inning during her four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it her farewell remembrance. The East took advantage of extremely slow 
corners and the inexperience of catcher Brahna Pastorini, who played only one 
season on the Taft varsity, to score three runs in the first inning on three 
hits and two passed balls. Pastorini had trouble handling Griffin's 60 m.p.h. 
riseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the all-star game is in the name of fun, it was a bitter pill to 
swallow for Griffin, who was almost completely limited to pitching "meatballs," 
as she called it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take it personally when a team gets three runs off me," said Griffin, who 
was 62-6 in four seasons at Simi Valley. "If it was league or (playoffs), I 
would have been (upset). But, considering we've been put together like a 
collage. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Darleen Anderson ripped a two-run single up the middle with nobody 
out to key the East's three-run first inning. Anderson, who took home the 
game's most valuable player trophy, pitched the fourth, fifth and sixth 
innings, struck out three, allowed two hits and no runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The East added three runs in the seventh, taking advantage of three errors and 
two hits off Gould. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Sims of Quartz Hill went two for two for the East, then left the game 35 
minutes after it started. Sims, class valedictorian, had to hustle back to 
school to make a graduation speech.

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; BLESZYNSKI PREPARES FOR FESTIVAL HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Ania Bleszynski about her experience playing in the 1993 U.S. Olympic 
Festival and prepare for an unexpected response. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no mention of the two bronze medals she won last summer in San 
Antonio, Tex. Instead, she will discuss the bad food, hot weather, tight 
scheduling and lack of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 16, and like most teen-agers, Bleszynski probably would have preferred 
lying around the pool that week in July. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the United States Tennis Assn. and the U.S. Olympic Committee 
recently invited the Thousand Oaks resident to return for the 1995 Festival in 
St. Louis July 1-6, she gladly accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski appreciated the honor, knowing that only the top 16 girls in the 
nation not playing on the Junior National team receive invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a neat tournament," Bleszynski said. "I just hope it turns out better. 
We had three matches a day last year. It was hot. We all had to get up at 6:30 
in the morning every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski, the top-seeded girls' 18-and-under singles player in Southern 
California, earned bronze medals in women's doubles and mixed doubles last 
year. But she might have fared better had she not been so fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still upset that I let the heat and stuff distract me," she said. "The 
whole arrangement was weird. Those were minor things (that I couldn't control). 
If I can't control those things this year, I won't let it get to me like I did 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski will travel to St. Louis with close friend Philip Tseng. Both are 
seniors at Harvard-Westlake High. Bleszynski is headed to Stanford and Tseng to 
Harvard next fall. Like Bleszynski, Tseng is one of Southern California's top 
18-and-under players. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tseng learned he had been selected to the South team for the Olympic 
Festival, he called Bleszynski, who will play for the West squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's preparing me for what I should bring and what I should do and not do," 
Tseng said. "I'll bring a camera and I'll bring back lots of souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm honored. A lot of young athletes want to go and only one or two get to 
come out of each section of the country. I'm looking forward to the opening 
ceremonies and seeing other events like baseball, basketball and track -- the 
top athletes in other sports." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A leg down: Tseng is seeded No. 4 by the Southern California Tennis Assn. By 
rights he should be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished 1993 ranked second behind Eric Lin, who has turned 19. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tseng has been derailed by a broken leg suffered in a spring vacation 
skiing accident. He returned to the court 2 1/2 weeks ago and is trying to 
regain his form not only for the festival but for next week's Southern 
California Sectional tournament in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Players to watch: The following players are seeded among the top eight in 
their respective divisions in the Southern California Sectional, which starts 
Friday with qualifying rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 18s: No. 3 -- Tseng, who moved up from No. 4 when Carlos Sarmiento of 
Newport Beach was disqualified because he is not a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' 18s: No. 1 -- Bleszynski; No. 2 -- Krissy Hamilton (Agoura Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 16s: No. 2 -- Nick Varsais (Simi Valley); No. 3 -- Dylan Mann (Canoga 
Park). 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' 16s: No. 5 -- Jessica Kessler (Studio City); No. 6 -- Kirsten Gross 
(Calabasas). 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 14s: No. 8 -- Michael Marquez (Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 12s: No. 4 -- Travis Rettenmaier (Camarillo); No. 8 -- Michael Sperry 
(Westlake). 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' 12s: No. 2 -- Maureen Diaz (Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing abroad: Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo have reached the second and 
third round, respectively, in boys' 16 singles at an international juniors 
tournament in Milan, Italy, this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in Toren, Italy, the twins each lost in the second round of singles 
play. In doubles last week, Mike Bryan, playing with Kevin Kim of Fullerton, 
advanced to the semifinals and Bob Bryan, playing with Keith Brill of Columbia, 
S.C., reached the quarterfinals before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing in Toren was Erin Boisclair of Agoura Hills, who reached the 
semifinals of the girls' 16 division. Boisclair and the Bryans will miss the 
Southern California Sectional because they will play in Labaule, France, next 
week. But all three will get wild-card berths in USTA National events this 
summer.

ENCINO GOLFER SHOOTS A 71 IN JUNIOR EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Cherney of Encino fired a second-round 71 Wednesday to lead the 
four-player California-Oregon team into fourth place with one round remaining 
in the American Junior Golf Assn. Northern Telecom Tournament at Brentwood 
Country Club in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherney, who will be a senior next fall at Brentwood High, shot a 79 in the 
opening round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In another tournament, Greg Bell of Studio City earned a berth in the 95th 
Southern California Golf Assn. amateur championship by firing a one-over-par 73 
at Lake San Marcos Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell was one of 10 players in a field of 64 to advance to the SCGA Amateur, to 
be held July 22-24 at Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra Heights.

WESTSIDE WATCH: NEVER TOO SOON FOR ALUMNI ASSOCIATION TO SEEK RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of UCLA's Class of 1994 are ready to take on the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to gain new recruits, the UCLA Alumni Assn. flew a banner over Bruin 
Walk emblazoned with the words: "Are You Ready for Life After UCLA?" Then, 
below that: "We Can Help. Join Your UCLA Alumni Association." Jeez, lighten up 
-- the kids just tossed their mortarboards. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 QUICK OFF THE MARK: Less than 36 hours after Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky had been elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 
the June 7 balloting, candidate Michael Feuer said he had raised $21,500 to run 
for Yaroslavsky's 5th District council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 That the executive director of Bet Tzedek, a legal services group, would be 
out of the gate raising money early was no surprise. Feuer had earlier asked 
the city Ethics Commission to issue a ruling about when the fund-raising 
stampede might begin in the yet-to-be-set special election to fill 
Yaroslavsky's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling: It could begin as soon as Yaroslavsky was elected and a candidate 
filed the necessary paperwork with the commission. At 9:08 a.m. on June 8, 
Feuer filed the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides making a beeline for the cash, Feuer has put together a list of 
top-drawer supporters, including Bruce Corwin of Metropolitan Theatres, a 
confidant of former Mayor Tom Bradley; Rabbi Allen I. Freehling of University 
Synagogue; Heal the Bay leader Dorothy Green; Laurie Levinson, a Loyola 
University law professor; former U.S. Secretary of Education Shirley 
Hufstedler; former U.S. Atty. Andrea Ordin; Tom Quinn, president of a media 
company and a top aide to former Gov. Jerry Brown, and Tom Umberg, the 
Democratic Party's nominee for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feuer, an attorney, is only one of many wanna-bes burning up calories to 
line up backers in the half-Westside, half-Valley 5th District, which includes 
Westwood, the Fairfax area, Bel-Air, Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Others eyeing Yaroslavsky's seat are former Los Angeles school board President 
Roberta Weintraub; Leah Purwin D'Agostino, a deputy district attorney who is 
assigned to the Van Nuys Courthouse, and possibly a few others, including 
Barbara Yaroslavsky, the councilman's own wife. 
</P>
<P>
 By early this week, only Feuer and Ryan Snyder, a transportation consultant 
who ran against Yaroslavsky previously, had filed the requisite paperwork at 
City Hall to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash-strapped city is expected to consolidate the Yaroslavsky succession 
race with other Los Angeles races next spring. In April, 1995, seven City 
Council seats will be up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NEW DEMOCRAT: Roberta Weintraub, the former conservative Republican, has 
certainly changed since switching to the Democratic Party in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub's name and photo appeared on political mail endorsing Sheila Kuehl, 
the Santa Monica progressive and former TV actress who won the Democratic 
nomination for the 41st Assembly District seat in last week's balloting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sheila has been a devoted educator both in our colleges and junior highs," 
said the quote attributed to Weintraub in a mailer targeting Democratic voters 
in the Valley. "I trust her to be a strong voice for Valley schools and to 
fight to decentralize the LAUSD."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: THOUGH BANDIT IS ROBBED OF HIS CAREER, HE HAS STOLEN 
OFFICER'S HEART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 POLICE POOCH: Bandit and his canine handler Officer Joe Hall have shared a 
special partnership at the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The German shepherd has helped in the arrest of nearly 500 suspects and 
performed 1,203 searches for narcotics and people. He's saved the life of his 
human partner so many times that Hall says he has lost count. 
</P>
<P>
 But 9-year-old Bandit, who has been showered with accolades, seems to have 
come to the end of his career. An operation for back pain in April has left his 
hind legs paralyzed. The vet says the dog has a 20% chance of recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much a tragic end to a really brilliant career for Bandit," Hall 
said. "This is not the way I wanted him to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, he's not giving up on his friend. Bandit gets around in a 
specially crafted device and undergoes therapy -- including acupuncture -- 
twice a week. Hall massages the dog's legs and helps him in and out of his 
rolling walker.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Gary Johansen said the Palos Verdes Police K-9 unit will get 
another cop dog within the next two to three months. But Hall still takes 
Bandit on ride-a-longs occasionally. "He can't function without his back legs, 
but it's good therapy for him to be in the car," Hall said. "He still thinks he 
can do the job." 
</P>

 FUTURE POLS: Former Vice President Dan Quayle declines to say whether he'll 
run for President in 1996, but Redondo Beach Councilman Stevan Colin is no Dan 
Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 The District 3 councilman announced recently his plans to run for mayor of 
Redondo -- in 1997. That is when incumbent Brad Parton's term expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin, whose second term on the council expires in 1995, dropped the bombshell 
during a city meeting while officials were discussing whether to make the city 
attorney's post an elected position. Colin, an attorney himself, wanted 
everyone to know he had no interest in running for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the word is out on his bid for the mayor's seat, Colin said the 
campaign signs won't be popping up anytime soon. Maybe in '96, he said.

 SOCCER SPHERE: The Unocal refinery in Wilmington has its hands on an 
all-purpose promotion for big events. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil giant's 76-foot-tall sphere, a tank used to capture refinery gases, 
was recently painted to look like a soccer ball, in honor of the upcoming World 
Cup and the American Youth Soccer Organization World Games. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the company has made the tank a pumpkin for Halloween, a 
baseball for the World Series and the Earth for Earth Day, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The sphere -- which the company calls the world's largest soccer ball -- is 
painted orange and features the company's "76" logo and a four-foot-high "Play 
Soccer" slogan. The company also has ordered more than 100,000 soccer balls 
with the "76" logo, to be sold at its service stations. 
</P>

<P>
 SHIP TO SHOOT: The ship didn't make it to D-day festivities at Normandy, but 
the SS Lane Victory, which is berthed in San Pedro, is still making a name for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Show Biz Expo in Los Angeles last weekend, the ship's operators pitched 
it as a venue for location shoots. U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans, a volunteer 
organization that runs the historic vessel, used a scale model of the ship to 
try to impress producers, directors and location managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in that 30-mile ring around Hollywood, so it's a very good location," 
said Capt. John O. Smith, first vice president of the Merchant Marine 
organization. "There's nothing else like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The group charges producers $500 to $5,000 per day, depending on the size of 
the production. And although the Lane Victory's brochures don't match the slick 
material of city and state film conventions at the Expo, the vessel has had a 
steady stream of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amelia Earhart: Her Final Flight," a movie that debuted Sunday on TNT, used 
it. Other productions have included "Naked Gun 2 1/2" and "Double Impact." 
Several weeks ago, when Francis Ford Coppola was filming a new version of "Don 
Juan," buildings near the Lane Victory's berth were given face lifts to make it 
look as if the ship were in Arabian and Spanish ports. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 30 productions in the past five years have used the ship, enough to 
make Smith and other shipmates old pros at making deals with show-biz types.

STATE WON'T SUE DISTRICT OVER REFUSAL TO GIVE CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State education officials said this week they will not sue Redondo Beach 
schools to force officials to administer the controversial CLAS tests to 
eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 The state had threatened the district with a lawsuit after trustees voted last 
month to ban English and writing portions of the tests, but state officials 
said they were running out of time. Classes at Redondo schools end June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in Antelope Valley lost a battle with the state over testing 
last week when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the district to 
administer the tests. Redondo is one of six districts in the state to ban the 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Redondo schools, acting state Supt. William D. Dawson urged 
Redondo trustees to reinstate the tests, arguing that the ruling against 
Antelope Valley also applied to Redondo schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials balked, arguing the two cases were different. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo trustees said the tests' credibility and validity have been 
compromised by parental confusion and reports of controversy surrounding the 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics throughout the state have charged that the English and writing 
portions of the tests invade student privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Dawson last week, Supt. Beverly J. Rohrer asked that Redondo be 
excused from administering the remainder of the tests. She said many of the 
district's students have already taken the exams, providing the state with a 
representative sampling of students' abilities. The district had received no 
response from the state as of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has neither the time nor the attorneys to sue every district that 
refused to comply, Department of Education spokeswoman Susie Lange said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be foolish to pursue a legal action there is no remedy for," Lange 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials consider last week's court ruling against Antelope Valley 
schools a precedent, she said. "There is no need to belabor this point by going 
at it school district to school district." 
</P>
<P>
 In Redondo's 6,500-student district, about 155 eighth-graders have not taken 
any of the reading and writing portions of the exam, while about 300 
eighth-graders have taken most sections of the exams, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo trustee Rebecca Sargent said she believes the tests need to be 
reviewed by an independent panel before they are administered next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent, who represents more than 5,000 trustees statewide as a member of the 
California School Boards Assn., said she disagreed with portions of the tests, 
but would not specify her complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials, who say they are considering critics' concerns, 
plan to produce "a better exam next year," Lange said.

LEAGUE HELPS EXPAND ENVELOPE OF VOLUNTEERISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of San Pedro women has been operating a post office on 8th Street ever 
since local residents and business owners first filtered through its doors in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
 But not one of the 26 women from the San Pedro Assistance League has been paid 
for her work in 30 years. The league, which runs the only contract post office 
in the United States staffed solely by volunteers, raises money for needy 
families in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to the post office, more volunteers work in the league's gift shop. 
Money is also generated by an additional five auxiliaries that organize 
fund-raising events every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro chapter of the assistance league has 528 members who have 
contributed 160,000 hours of their time over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds generated since the chapter's founding in 1936 have allowed it to create 
and continue supporting four local philanthropies: the Frances Johnson Dental 
Center; Operation School Bell, which supplies school clothes to needy children; 
Operation Hug, which buys teddy bears for traumatized children, and the 
Weavers, a service for the visually impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's big business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount we received for the post office contract last year was enough to 
run the dental service," President Sandy Hollingsworth said. The Frances 
Johnson Dental Center on Deep Valley Road provides dental care for children at 
a cost to their families of only $5. It handled more than 2,000 appointments 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the post office and gift shop, new children's 
underwear, shoes, dresses, sweats and school uniforms are stacked in a storage 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where 1,152 needy children were outfitted last year through Operation 
School Bell. Each child got two sets of clothing, a grooming kit and a 
backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs $50 to clothe each child, and it is money well spent, Hollingsworth 
said, to help children attend one of the 50 schools in the area that refer them 
to the assistance league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids have never had brand-new clothes," she said. "Many of our 
referrals come when a neighbor will call the school and say, 'How come this kid 
isn't going to school?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because they don't have any clothes to wear, or one will go to school 
and a sibling will the next day because they're sharing clothes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women also organize Operation Hug. In 1993, local police and medical 
professionals distributed 715 teddy bears to children suffering from accidents 
or sexual abuse, Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the Weavers, a club that began in 1936 for visually handicapped 
adults who need a hot meal prepared or want to enjoy some recreational 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 All these community services will come under one roof by November. A little 
farther up 8th Street, where the original post office stood, a building is 
being remodeled at a cost of $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollingsworth said all the money has been raised by donations. Two-thirds of 
the cost has come from the pockets of league members.

LANDOWNERS DIVIDED; SAFETY: COUNTY APPROVES BUILDING RESTRICTIONS TO CURB 
BLAZES AT MALIBOU LAKE. ABSENTEE LANDLORDS SUPPORT THE PLAN, BUT RESIDENTS 
ASSAIL IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a controversial set 
of building restrictions intended to ease the danger of wildfires around 
Malibou Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But last-minute changes to the plan, which officials hope can be applied to 
other areas prone to brush fires such as Topanga Canyon, provoked fear among 
residents that it will do little to protect their mountain hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 During an hourlong board hearing last week, residents who showed up intending 
to support the restrictions did an abrupt about-face and vowed to fight the new 
rules in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, owners of vacant property who originally threatened to mount legal 
challenges against the building restrictions walked away satisfied with the 
board's unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has come back to where it is reasonable," said Phyllis Daugherty, a vacant 
property owner who represents a group of other landowners in the area. "You 
can't just take away people's property rights completely." 
</P>
<P>
 The rules, technically known as the Malibou Lake Community Standards District, 
slightly change and make permanent a set of temporary restrictions in effect 
since January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who have supported tougher restrictions for more than two years 
complained that the new rules -- proposed as a compromise by retiring 
Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman -- came as a surprise and will do little to 
protect them from fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who live there deserve to be protected," Malibou Lake resident 
Joel Schulman said. "Fire knows no compromise. . . . With these changes you're 
proposing, it's over. This is so completely toothless that it's useless." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing his critics, Edelman said: "We don't live in a perfect world. We 
live in a world we try to make more perfect, as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman and others specifically took issue with a loosening of rules 
governing how much of a lot could be covered by a new house. Under earlier 
proposals attacked by vacant landowners, new homes would be allowed to cover 
just 15% of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules allow 25% lot coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lot coverage is significant because if buildings occupy too much of the hilly 
terrain, it becomes difficult for firefighters and other rescue crews to 
maneuver around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bailey, the Los Angeles County Fire Department's head of fire safety, 
agreed to the increased lot coverage as long as other elements of the community 
standards district remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Those elements include requirements for fire sprinklers in new homes and a 
virtual ban on street parking to allow big emergency vehicles room to negotiate 
the narrow, winding roads that surround the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another contentious issue -- road widening -- was also diluted by Edelman. In 
earlier proposals, new builders were required to widen the road fronting their 
lot, often at substantial cost. Any builder seeking an exception would be 
required to go through the county's costly conditional use permit process, 
which can cost as much as $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Edelman's compromise allows a fire department review board to 
determine whether road widening would be required. Only if that failed would 
the builder have to seek a conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the earlier guidelines was 
thrown out by a judge last July because the woman who filed it did not pursue 
all of the administrative options at her disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who once supported the restrictions now say they will try to 
challenge them in court. "This is putting our whole community in jeopardy," 
said resident Mary Altmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents started a push for stricter guidelines three years ago, complaining 
that proposed construction projects would make it nearly impossible to escape 
during a brush fire.

ADDING NIGHT LIFE OFFERED AS WAY TO REVITALIZE AREA HIT HARD BY RECESSION; 
DEVELOPMENT: THEATERS AND UPSCALE RESTAURANTS ARE PLANNED IN EL SEGUNDO AS PART 
OF A STRATEGY TO BOLSTER RETAIL AND OFFICE MARKETS FROM LAX TO MANHATTAN BEACH.

<P>
 Real estate developers have a strategy to boost the sagging retail and office 
market between L.A. International Airport and Manhattan Beach: Add more night 
life.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Theatres Corp. plans to build an 18-screen multiplex in El Segundo. 
The complex would be the South Bay's largest and would be built across the 
street from a new Wolfgang Puck restaurant due to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Far less certain, but still on the drawing board, are plans for Fashion Walk, 
a nearby entertainment and retail attraction modeled after CityWalk in 
Universal City. The project, to be built on Rosecrans Avenue at the San Diego 
(405) Freeway, would go forward if a development group persuades Los Angeles 
fashion wholesalers to move to a proposed showroom complex called Fashion City. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a crying need for (the entertainment projects) in the South Bay," 
said Alan Schwartz, president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes are that the retail and entertainment projects will bring new energy to 
an area that has been suffering from cuts in the aerospace industry and other 
manufacturing firms. Even in better times, business and industrial parks lacked 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession left business owners and developers with large chunks of empty 
space. Office vacancy in the El Segundo and Manhattan Beach area was 20% in the 
first three months of this year, compared to 14.9% a year earlier, according to 
the real estate brokerage firm of Grubb & Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Continental Development Corp. was left with an empty, 
475,000-square-foot office building at Rosecrans Avenue and Nash Street after 
TRW and Hughes moved out. So it embarked on a $7-million project to market the 
building to companies that need smaller space, or to professionals such as 
lawyers, doctors and accountants. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the company remodeled its ground floor for retailers and 
restaurants. Among the first to sign up was Puck, whose renowned restaurants 
include Spago in West Hollywood, an entertainment industry nightspot. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from Puck's eatery will be the $12.5-million Beach Cities Cinema, 
scheduled to open around Christmas, 1995. It will have digital sound, 
70-millimeter projectors, automatic ticket dispensers and two snack bars. The 
complex, which has an atrium lobby, would have 1,500 parking spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just felt the area needed a theater of this magnitude," said Milt Moritz, 
vice president of advertising for Pacific. "We'll be able to offer everything 
from art house films to commercial movies. There won't be any need to go beyond 
(the South Bay)." 
</P>
<P>
 Continental is working to sign up other tenants for the complex, Moritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental hopes that the Puck restaurant, movie theater and other projects 
in the works will give the stretch of Rosecrans Avenue more night life. 
Already, there is a Houston's restaurant across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming a destination area," said Janet Lowder, a restaurant consultant 
in Rancho Palos Verdes. "It's becoming a draw for restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 The new El Segundo projects also could draw travelers from Los Angeles 
International Airport, who have few entertainment options other than hotel 
restaurants and in-room movies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a short taxi ride away," Lowder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant and retail businesses have been going through tough times as 
families have cut back on spending. And developers have not found it easy to 
line up financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion City has been trying to attract enough tenants to persuade a potential 
financing partner that the project would be viable. Tenants, primarily fashion 
wholesalers, would be housed in a showroom building where fashion buyers from 
across the country could select their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like swimming through molasses to get where we want to go," Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, he said, is the perception that there won't be much else 
for the fashion buyers to do once the workday is over. Their solution: Fashion 
Walk, to be built next door and open to the public, would include restaurants, 
bars, shops and flight-simulator rides. Fashion videos could be displayed on 
large outdoor TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Fashion City isn't built, Schwartz said, developers may create another 
project for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it makes more sense when you tie it in to an industry in the area," he 
said. "I guess we could do Aerospace Walk, but it might not have the same 
pizazz."

DORSEY STUDENTS BEMOAN KILLING OF 2 CLASSMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 By all accounts, they were outgoing, friendly students. One was set to 
graduate today and planned to attend college. The other was a junior who had 
yet to commit himself to his studies but was filled with potential. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Dorsey High School students' lives ended in a hail of gunfire 
Friday, apparently innocent victims caught in a bloody street war between black 
and Latino gangs in Venice. Their slayings have shocked students and teachers 
at the Crenshaw district school and caused them to question why two young lives 
so full of promise could end so tragically. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Tizcareno, 17, of Venice, and 18-year-old Jose Alvarez, of the 
Mid-Wilshire area, died at the scene, police said. Two other Dorsey students -- 
Rafael Campoy, 17, and Javier Lopez, 18 -- suffered minor gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time," Los Angeles Police 
Detective Wayne Blandon said of the youths, who were in Venice to buy a pager 
during a school break when several gunmen opened fire. "They were caught like 
fish out of water." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, no arrests had been made in the case.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the shootings were widely reported over the weekend, not all Dorsey 
High students were aware as they returned to school Monday of the deaths of 
Tizcareno and Alvarez. Early that day, the news was announced over the school's 
public address system, and many students broke out in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't believe it. You keep thinking they are still alive," said 
junior Maurice Guifarro, 16, a friend of Alvarez. "It's really sad. They didn't 
have to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Guifarro said his class went silent when the news was broadcast. One girl 
began sobbing and hugged Guifarro for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were so upset that they had a hard time taking finals," said a 
17-year-old student who asked not to be identified. "We have a good school, and 
this kind of stuff doesn't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Though violence has scarred other central Los Angeles high schools in recent 
months, Dorsey officials said this was the first shooting incident this year 
involving Dorsey students. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the school held a memorial service at its library, where 
students read poetry they had written about their slain and wounded friends. 
That service was closed to all but Dorsey students and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno had bought his graduation cap and gown and was set to attend 
commencement services today. He planned to work full time during the day and 
enroll in night classes at Los Angeles City College. "This was a kid who was on 
his way. . . . He was very reliable, dependable and set to make a contribution 
to society," said Assistant Principal Beverly Clarkson. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before he died, Tizcareno had graduated from a learning academy 
sponsored by Shell Oil Co. The program places students in jobs and provides 
personal-skills training to prepare them for careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno, who was placed at the Continental Cablevision offices in Crenshaw, 
did such a good job that the studio offered him a permanent job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of our best students," said Shell spokesman Robert Russ. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Shell is paying the $3,500 cost of Tizcareno's funeral, which the 
family was unable to afford. Family members were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarkson said Alvarez was not as studious as Tizcareno but had a lot of 
potential. "He was personable and well-liked. He just hadn't made the 
commitment (to school)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to get along with people pretty good," said Guifarro, who played 
touch football with Alvarez. Alvarez's family also was not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and officials say the killings have cast a pall over what would 
normally have been a joyous time -- graduation and summer vacation.

SCHOOL BOND OK IS HELD UP BY 18 VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne School District officials have a dream of schools where clocks tick, 
drinking fountains run cold water and the electrical system can power 
up-to-date technology in the classrooms. But 18 votes stand in the way.  
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, the $15-million bond question presented in the June 8 election 
was still shy 18 ballots of the necessary two-thirds' approval. Of the votes 
counted, 2,476 were in favor of passage and 1,265 were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said all absentee ballots were expected to be counted by 
Friday; results of the vote, however, are not official until June 28. Should it 
pass, property owners would be taxed an average of $20 a year for the next 25 
years to pay for the bonds.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we are somewhat disappointed," Assistant Supt. Donald Carrington 
said, "but they still haven't completed counting all the absentee ballots, so 
we're still hoping for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Tuesday that if the bond question loses, they will 
probably ask for a recount of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bond measure passes, it would provide $15 million for the renovation 
and modernization of the elementary district's nine schools. Carrington said 
the buildings, all between 40 and 50 years old, have not had a major renovation 
since they were built. 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the schools, clocks don't work, drinking fountains do not cool the 
water and computers and video equipment overpower the electrical system. In 
addition to new electrical and plumbing systems, the bond issue would pay for 
flooring, roofing and new classroom space for the rapidly growing school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had hoped to add a two-story building to one of the schools, 
Carrington said, but that project was feasible only if Hawthorne received state 
matching funds. The failure of a separate state bond means matching funds will 
be difficult to get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're just one other (school district) standing in a long line of people 
asking for money," Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the local bond does not pass, Carrington said, school officials will 
consider seeking the money from private businesses or grants. Whatever happens, 
the district's buildings must be overhauled and more space found for 
Hawthorne's 7,200 students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment has grown by 2,000 students in the past eight years. The district 
began year-round operation in 1992 to accommodate the extra students.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the (state of disrepair) negatively impacts the education 
children are receiving," Carrington said. "But in terms of the aesthetics, 
there are real obvious needs and shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does a student feel sitting in a classroom if the clock doesn't work?" he 
asked.

LOCAL NAACP HEAD OUSTED FOR ATTEMPTED ASSAULT ON MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of the Carson/Torrance branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People has been removed from office for attempting to 
hit another member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Clayton, 53, was informed of his immediate removal in a May 24 letter 
from William H. Penn, a director in the NAACP'S national office in Baltimore. 
Clayton, who admitted this week that he lost his temper and tried to hit 
Executive Committee member Joe Alford, said he would abide by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the feeling of the national office, I'll just yield," Clayton said. 
"If they feel someone else can do it better, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn would not comment on the letter, which directed Clayton to turn over the 
branch's records to the group's first vice president, Shirley Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, who works in the community development department of the Friendship 
Children's Center in Carson, also owns a private security firm. He said that in 
1978 he helped found the Carson chapter, which has grown to 200 members. It is 
one of 72 NAACP chapters in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Citing the national organization's rules against members talking to the news 
media, none of the local members contacted this week would comment on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a copy of Penn's letter obtained by The Times said a complaint filed 
against Clayton accused him of misappropriating funds from the branch, refusing 
to operate within the group's bylaws, improperly recruiting members and 
"attempting an assault upon another member of the Carson/Torrance branch during 
an executive committee meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted assault was the basis for Clayton's removal, the letter said. 
The letter did not address the other charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Clayton said Alford accused him of using chapter money for personal reasons. 
During an argument over the allegations during a Dec. 9, 1993, committee 
meeting, Clayton said he lost his temper and tried to grab Alford, but was 
restrained by other members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more verbal than anything," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a complaint was filed with the national office, Penn traveled to Carson 
to hear arguments from both sides. The national board of the NAACP later voted 
to remove Clayton from office.  
</P>
<P>
 Clayton said the fact that he didn't actually hit Alford is grounds for 
appeal, but he will not pursue it because he is too busy with other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intended to hurt him . . . but I didn't," Clayton said. "That's my whole 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the other accusations against him were not valid. Clayton said he 
would retain his membership and support the group's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that (an) NAACP chapter exist in the city of Carson -- 
whoever is president," Clayton said.

MAYOR VETOES REDONDO BEACH SEWER MAINTENANCE FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton this week vetoed a plan to charge residents 
and businesses a monthly fee to fund maintenance and repairs to the city's 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Parton was absent the previous week when the City Council narrowly approved 
the new fees.As the council considers next year's budget over the next two 
weeks, the members are expected to discuss again how to fund an estimated $16 
million in repairs to the aging system. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs are in addition to the proposed $53.8-million budget for fiscal 
year 1994-95, which begins next month.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget, which is about $400,000 more than last year's budget, 
calls for the city to end a cost-cutting attrition program that has eliminated 
77 positions over three years. The council decided this week not to cut several 
positions from the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council scheduled a meeting on June 28 to make final budget decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also expected to decide whether to add $100,000 to the city 
treasurer's budget. The proposed budget eliminates one position from the 
treasurer's office through a retirement, but the treasurer has asked that the 
position be reinstated and has requested several salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
 At a budget workshop this week, the council voted to set aside $500,000 to 
recruit city workers and offer incentives to productive staff members. JAMES 
BENNING

BRIEFLY; MEDICINE: RED CROSS SEEKING MARROW DONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GRIMM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay Red Cross workers will devote Father's Day to finding a potential 
bone marrow donor that might save the life of a San Pedro man. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Rogosic, a 25-year-old father of twin boys, has exhausted a national 
registry containing 1.2 million donors without finding a match.Friends have 
raised more than $14,700, enough to test an additional 655 potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross workers will administer the tests, which consist of drawing about 
two tablespoons of blood, at Peck Park Recreation Center, 560 N. Western Ave., 
between noon and 3 p.m. Possible matches will require further testing for 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery is required to extract bone marrow. The donor is often left with the 
equivalent of a "very bad backache," depending on their physical condition, 
said Barbara Wilks, Red Cross spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Matches are more likely to be found among people with Irish or other Caucasian 
heritage, said Wilks. Those tested will be put on the registry to find other 
potential matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested may call (800) MARROW2 to schedule an appointment or learn 
more about the process. Members of Friends of Gary Rogosic ask that those 
tested donate some or all of the $22.50 cost of the test, if possible, so more 
people can be tested. DAVE GRIMM

TOPICS; FINE ARTS; PRINT TECHNIQUE POSES QUESTION: IS IT REAL OR IS IT A 
SERIGRAPH?; A TORRANCE STUDIO USES A PAINSTAKING PROCEDURE TO REPRODUCE DESIGNS 
IN SMALLER SIZES. FEW STUDIOS IN THE L.A. AREA ARE EQUIPPED TO DO SUCH WORK, 
WHICH CAN TAKE UP TO THREE MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Painter Leslie Sayour likes to splash color across big canvases when she 
paints. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japanese consumers, who pay as much as $55,000 for her impressionistic oil 
paintings, want art that fits into their small homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So Sayour, who sells most of her work in Japan, takes her paintings to Kolibri 
Art Studio in Torrance, where Herta Hedrick uses a painstaking printing 
technique called serigraphy to reproduce the designs in smaller sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The prints, valued between $2,500 and $3,500, look so much like an original 
painting that it can be hard to tell the two apart. Typically artists request 
200 to 500 copies of each work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the studio opened at 2908 Oregon Court 3 1/2 years ago, it has 
reproduced about 55 works. Only about five studios in the Los Angeles area do 
fine-art serigraph printing.  
</P>
<P>
 Serigraphers separate and print each color in a painting. For brightly colored 
works such as Sayour's, each print passes through the press more than 100 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The layers of ink coat the canvas and combine colors to duplicate the effects 
created by an oil painter. Special overlays of web-like black lines imitate the 
artist's brush strokes. Five artists work full time for Hedrick to separate the 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes up to three months to complete a reproduction. Because of the hour it 
takes to set up the machine and the time it takes to dry, only about three 
colors can be put on each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick said the hardest part of her business is finding workers patient 
enough to endure the handiwork who also have an artistic sense. It takes 
technical skills and a good eye to do the work well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to be an artist is almost too imaginative and creative," Hedrick said. 
"It's just so much discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 For each color, Hedrick's artists black out portions of a transparent sheet, 
which is then used to make the plate that goes on the press. They rely on their 
own color sense to differentiate between similar tones on the canvas. The 
workers also mix the ink to exactly match the original. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the press takes equal skill. Each print must be placed in the printer 
exactly right or the colors won't end up in the right place. The process is so 
exacting that even a Santa Ana wind causing a drop in humidity can shrink the 
paper enough to ruin the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding ways to duplicate each artist's style keeps the work interesting, 
Hedrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my choice I would love to work with one artist and really perfect 
his work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayour said that sometimes the copies of her work outshine her originals. "If 
I ever notice differences, it's always for the better."

BRIEFLY; CRIME: FILM SERIES TO HONOR SLAIN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the school attended by two students who were slain early this year in a 
carjacking, plans are under way to make sure the 19-year-olds are always 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito were fans and students of film, so Marymount 
College is trying to establish an endowment fund to create the Ito/Matsuura 
Film Series. 
</P>
<P>
 It hopes the event will become an annual film and lecture series featuring the 
work of American directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the funeral services, I met with their parents (from Japan) and all 
members of their families and we talked about ways to remember them," college 
President Thomas McFadden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discussed many ideas, and I suggested a series on Japanese films, but they 
said no, they liked American films." The school is trying to raise $20,000 to 
$30,000 to fund the film festival.  
</P>
<P>
 Matsuura and Ito were slain in a San Pedro carjacking on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations can be made to the Ito/Matsuura Film Series, Marymount College, 
30800 Palos Verdes Drive East, Rancho Palos Verdes 90274. Information: (310)

TOPICS; CERAMICS; POTTERY IS BAKING ITS MARK IN WORLD OF FINE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If you're a gallery that sells paintings, people think you're an art 
gallery," says Garth Clark, sitting in his smallish second-story gallery 
situated along a trendy stretch of La Brea Avenue. "But if you're a gallery 
that sells ceramics, well, people's immediate assumption is that you're a craft 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, the Garth Clark Gallery is no craft shop. The first ceramics 
fine arts gallery in the nation when it opened in 1981, it has become the focal 
point in the growing awareness by the mainstream art world of pottery as a fine 
art. Here is where now-celebrated artists such as Adrian Saxe and Richard 
Notkin began regularly selling their works -- and where aficionados worldwide 
now pay up to $75,000 for some pieces. And despite the burgeoning interest in 
ceramics, here is one of the few places nationwide exclusively devoted to 
pottery as fine art. Two of the others, in Manhattan and in Kansas City, also 
belong to Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Methodically, the soft-spoken gallery owner recounts some of the recent 
victories in securing a measure of acceptance for pottery in the mainstream art 
world. For three months last year, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art staged 
a well-received exhibit of works by Saxe. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, some ceramic works command 10 times the price they did just a decade 
ago, heightening the movement's legitimacy in the eyes of some collectors. And, 
Clark notes, after years of running reviews of ceramics shows on its "Home" 
page, now the New York Times reviews pottery in its arts section. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists and colleagues say the emerging appreciation for pottery -- both 
economic as well as artistic -- is largely due to Clark's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's created the market for people like myself," Saxe said. "He's done the 
educating, the dealing and the connoisseurship. He's never made it fashionable. 
He just stepped in and made a case for the significance of some ceramics." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice artist Cindy Kolodziejski agrees. "If you didn't have a gallery here, 
there just wouldn't be as many people making ceramics," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In marked contrast to the influence it would later wield, however, Clark's 
gallery began modestly. It was originally intended solely as a space to sell 
the works of famed potter Beatrice Wood, then in her 80s and having difficulty 
selling her work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Clark was a noted art historian who funneled most of his efforts 
into writing books on ceramics and curating ceramics exhibits. But from the 
opening show, the gallery, originally located across from the L.A. County 
Museum, quickly branched out, featuring works of both established artists and 
younger potters. Since then, Clark's galleries have had a singular presence, 
presenting more than 300 exhibitions, placing about 500 works in various 
museums, and organizing dozens of shows for other galleries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really did have a mission. We wanted to present ceramics as fine art," 
said Clark, who co-founded the gallery with his partner Mark Del Vecchio. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and Del Vecchio say the gallery's success is largely attributable to its 
location. Not only did Los Angeles' relative lack of an entrenched art 
tradition enable the gallery to flourish without critical constraints, but 
historically the city has been the lone center in the country for 
non-traditional ceramics artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a new generation of artists stretched the long-held view of pottery, 
introducing abstract Expressionism into ceramics to create often bizarrely 
shaped pots whose primary appeal was their sculptural form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone assumes we began in New York and moved to L.A.," said Clark, who has 
been author of 14 books on ceramics. "But it's very important that this 
happened here. It didn't happen in San Francisco, and you couldn't do it (then) 
in New York." Even today, Del Vecchio adds, about half of the pottery being 
made in art-conscious New York is still of the traditional kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Vecchio attributes some of the mainstream art world's reluctance to 
embrace pottery is its functionality. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're still looking at pottery, but it's not functional pottery," Del 
Vecchio said. "This is more about ideas."  
</P>
<P>
 In a world where the latest and most extreme offerings are unhesitatingly 
accepted as "art," both Clark and Del Vecchio recognize the irony in the fact 
that ceramics -- the product of a 10,000-year-old tradition -- is still 
struggling to be celebrated as such. Clark acknowledges that the prices for top 
works in the field are still relatively low compared to those fetched in other 
disciplines, and that many casual art lovers still think of ceramics as just 
cups and pots. But, he adds, the battle for acceptance is inexorably being won.

REDONDO BEACH TO BEGIN ENFORCING ITS CURFEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warning: If you're under 18 and it's after 10 p.m. and you're in the city of 
Redondo Beach, you'd better have a good explanation. Otherwise the police may 
hang a $135 citation on you. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this weekend, the Redondo Beach Police Department will begin 
stepped-up enforcement of the city's curfew law, sending a task force of 
patrol, reserve and juvenile officers out on the streets to question and, if 
necessary, detain and issue tickets to unsupervised juveniles who are out after 
10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Police Chief Mel Nichols said the program is necessary because 
of increased numbers of youths on the streets -- including some who apparently 
moved to Redondo Beach after other communities began enforcing curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Inglewood started aggressively enforcing its curfew (earlier this year), 
we started seeing some spillover," Nichols said. In trial runs of the curfew 
enforcement program over the past three weekends, nearly two-thirds of the 34 
youths who were ticketed were not Redondo Beach residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Redondo Beach curfew ordinance dates to the mid-1980s, Nichols 
said, until now it has been enforced sparingly by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew ordinance exempts youths who are on their way to or from work or 
organized school or social activities. Youths detained under the curfew law 
will be issued tickets and then released unless they are under 14 or are on 
probation, in which case they will be held until they can be turned over to a 
responsible adult.

$112 MILLION SPENT IN AREA BY FILM, TV FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The motion picture and television industry spent $112 million in South Bay 
communities in 1992, according to a study released this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The study was the first attempt by the Hollywood entertainment industry to 
pinpoint how much it contributes to the economy in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned by the Public Affairs Coalition of the Alliance of Motion Picture 
& Television Producers, the study's figures are three times previous estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Total payroll by all movie, television and commercial production companies in 
California was $7.4 billion, the study reveals. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies paid another $8.9 billion to suppliers for goods and services 
related to production. And the industry generated more than 534,000 direct and 
related jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Money spent on payrolls and goods and services in the South Bay: $38 million 
in Manhattan Beach, $8 million in Rancho Palos Verdes, $26 million in Torrance, 
$21 million in Redondo Beach and $19 million in Hermosa Beach.

 Paramount TV Group Chairman Kerry McCluggage said California is weakest in 
retaining TV location work, such as television movies and one-hour dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 "While 95% of sitcoms are made here, California is losing 60% of TV movies (to 
other areas)," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; STUDENTS DESIGN GATE THAT DISPLAYS SYMBOLS OF HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAMITA J. QUASHIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For third- and fourth-grade students at Westwood Charter School, two steel 
gates they designed and painted allow them to touch history, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying what they learned in social studies classes, 62 students designed and 
painted the gates to symbolize California and its history. There are depictions 
of Mickey Mouse, a mission bell, a California gray whale, a Spanish galleon, a 
Hollywood Walk of Fame star and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were optimistic that their work will be long-lasting. "We did 
something that's not going to fade away," Zoe Rosenblum, 10, said at a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Michelle Bennett said it was "so enriching designing gates that will 
live on. All the kids will be able to look back and say, 'I did something,' 
some years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 The gates, each 42 inches by 88 inches, are located at the south end of the 
campus near Selby Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The project began about three weeks ago when sculptor James Wolfe, whose son 
Rowie attends the school, decided to help teach students about sculpture art. 
Wolfe has been a professional sculptor for 27 years and has created about 300 
artworks. Some of his pieces are at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New 
York and the Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Students drew their design ideas on paper in class. Later, they visited 
Wolfe's Inglewood art studio to mold their ideas onto steel. Wolfe welded the 
pieces together and filed and smoothed the surfaces so students would not hurt 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Students freshened up the work with paint Monday under the guidance of 
teachers Selma Rappaport and Barbara Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Students such as Caitlin Rapoport, showed their creativity. Caitlin painted a 
Native American in traditional dress. "I thought of Native Americans. That's 
what California was," she said. DAMITA J. QUASHIE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Chief Michael Olson has been placed on administrative leave pending the 
outcome of a city investigation into allegations that he allowed the misuse of 
city property. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials met in closed session Monday before and after the City Council 
meeting to discuss the fate of Olson, 51, who has been chief for nine years and 
a department employee for 26.Olson was placed on paid administrative leave May 
30, although he has been out on a stress-related disability since May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "New things have come up" in the city attorney's investigation, Mayor Albert 
Vera said Wednesday, adding that the city is investigating similar allegations 
against other Fire Department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera and other city officials declined to elaborate on the investigation. City 
officials will probably meet again Monday to continue the discussion on Olson, 
the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unfortunate," Vera said of the Olson investigation. "I feel bad for 
Culver City." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department employees remained tight-lipped about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is talking about it," said Wayne Bueltel, a Culver City firefighter 
who has been on the force 20 years. "These are all allegations. (Olson is) 
innocent until proven guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hoover, an assistant fire chief, will serve as the acting chief. CAROL

SOUTH BAY COVER STORY; SINK OR SWIM; A ROOKIE BRAVES THE RIGORS OF LIFEGUARD 
ACADEMY AND LEARNS IT 'AIN'T BAYWATCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CLUTCHING A RED FLOTATION CAN AND rescue line, I stagger into the surf off 
Zuma Beach and flop through the breakers. An instructor is posing as a scuba 
diver in distress, and it is my job as a lifeguard trainee to save him. I churn 
toward the flailing victim, but somehow the rescue line gets wrapped around my 
neck and tightens with each crashing wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fellow cadets sprint toward the water. Normally, the drill would call for 
them to help save the diver, but this time they've got a real rescue on their 
hands: me. 
</P>
<P>
 What else is new? I've been outclassed and on the edge of panic every weekend 
in May, struggling to survive the Los Angeles County Lifeguard Academy against 
hellish odds. 
</P>
<P>
 I fit the profile of a lifeguard about as well as Tommy Lasorda. I swim like a 
stranded freighter. I surf strictly with my TV remote. The only foam I enjoy 
floats atop a 16-ounce stein. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wanted to learn firsthand what it takes to join what is arguably the 
best lifeguard service in the world, an elite corps of about 600 men and women 
that makes an average of 11,000 rescues a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitted against 50 of the best swimmers in the state, pummeled by cold, 
unforgiving surf, doomed to leap off Hermosa Beach Pier -- not to mention a 
speeding Baywatch rescue boat -- I challenged the elements and my own physical 
limits and learned two valuable lessons. The first: life-guarding is complex 
and demanding work. The second: Sometimes it's better to stay in the office and 
report by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Little in my background prepared me for the academy. At age 2, I learned to 
swim, but not competitively and certainly not in the ocean. Over the years, I 
amassed multiple layers of abdominal padding, giving me buoyancy, insulation -- 
and the speed of plankton. And frankly, the only life I've been interested in 
saving has been my own. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was with palpable consternation that agency officials agreed to let 
me audit their rookie class, the county's first in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Already beleaguered by threatened budget cuts, millions of unappreciative 
beach-goers and an image warped by television's hyper-sexed "Baywatch" 
phenomenon, the last thing administrators needed was the headline, "Reporter 
Drowns at Lifeguard School." 
</P>
<P>
 Precautions were in order. Starting with a 1,000-meter tryout swim off Santa 
Monica in April, a career lifeguard would accompany me in the ocean at all 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No less than 225 candidates were on hand that gloomy morning for what 
literally amounted to a race for work. One of them, Lars Gronholm, flew all the 
way from Philadelphia to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who finished in the top 80 would be granted job interviews and physical 
exams. About 50 of those would be sent to rookie school. The prize for 
successfully completing the academy: a $14.71-an-hour summer job consisting 
mostly of sporadic shifts doled out on an on-call basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they limbered up for the big swim, it was clear that what motivated 
many of the competitors was the chance to become part of Southern California's 
proud lifesaving tradition. Last year, almost 60 million people visited 
county-guarded beaches and only two drowned, an achievement tragically 
underscored on Memorial Day when five drowned in a riptide at an unguarded 
beach near Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's lifeguards, said Tom Rauth, 17, of Santa Monica, "just seem like 
a great group of people to work with."  
</P>
<P>
 But what price glory? Before the race, we must all sign a waiver acknowledging 
the risk of drowning, overexertion, exposure, injuries and illness. A small 
flotilla of guards on paddleboards bobs in the bay, ready to pluck distressed 
swimmers from the drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Swim coordinator Terry Hearst urges caution and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great job, but it's not that great to lose your life for," he tells 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the only thing I lose is pride, finishing 206th out of 211 
finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly seasick from the swells and disoriented by a strong current, I zigzag 
northward toward Santa Monica Pier for nearly 40 minutes, reality sinking in 
with each sloppy stroke. Unlike Rauth and Gronholm, who both made the cut, my 
entrance to the academy will be based on press credentials, not aquatic 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is cause for hope as rookie school opens on May 1 for the first of 
seven 10-hour sessions, spread out over four consecutive weekends. I'm no Mark 
Spitz, but I've survived nearly two-thirds of a mile in the ocean, more than 
can be said of the 14 participants who failed to finish the tryout. 
Nevertheless, it's intimidating to be thrown in with these 50 cadets, on paper 
the most physically gifted rookie class the agency has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the trainees have worked as ocean lifeguards before or are working 
for other services. Two trainees are Olympic athletes. Eleven are All-American 
swimmers at either the junior college or NCAA level. 
</P>
<P>
 More humbling still: At 32, I'm not even the oldest rookie. Mark Montgomery, a 
returning county guard, is the most senior professional triathlete in the 
world, still competing in the open division at age 38. Bonnie Spivey, 35, of 
Torrance is the mother of a three-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the candidates are in such superior condition that during 
county-required physicals, they outlasted treadmill tests aimed at pushing them 
to their maximum heart rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But even our best performers are put on notice when the nine instructors start 
outlining the rules to live by in the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lifeguard Division," according to a handout passed out in class, "is a 
paramilitary organization. . . . Harassment is not part of the training, 
however discipline is." 
</P>
<P>
 We are to respond unquestioningly to instructors' orders, and refer to them by 
"Mr." "Ms." or appropriate rank. Missing a day of class without permission, or 
refusing to perform a water drill, is grounds for expulsion. Ditto for cheating 
on a test. 
</P>
<P>
 Only county-issue swimsuits and sweat suits may be worn. No goggles or wet 
suits. No hats or sunglasses indoors. No sleeping in class. No personal phone 
calls. No chatting up members of the opposite sex while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ain't 'Baywatch,' " lead instructor Steve Page growls. He adds: "We 
don't allow wimps, whiners or snivelers." 
</P>
<P>
 The rigor is not without reason. From Day 1, fledgling guards will be expected 
to arrive on time, back up fellow lifeguards, deal firmly but courteously with 
the public, enforce beach ordinances, perform CPR and other lifesaving measures 
if necessary, spot gang activity, contend with lost children and, above all, 
"Watch the Water." 
</P>
<P>
 If the academy has an official credo, "Watch the Water" is it. As the days 
unfold, our instructors will bellow it as we're running to drills, climbing 
towers, even while eating lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards can expect distractions ranging from being asked the time of day to 
being asked to revive a blue-lipped infant, but none of that releases them from 
their primary duty -- to scan the water for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you miss a rescue, you should . . . beat yourself with a club," Page tells 
the hushed class. He adds: "The first time you look a dead person in the face, 
you'll never want to see that again." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, in addition to watching the water, we must also spend time 
actually in it. One of the toughest exercises on the first day was to cut 
through the surf using a technique known as "porpoising." Second nature to most 
of the trainees, it involves diving under large waves, grasping the bottom with 
the hands to keep from being swept backward, then springing up and out with the 
legs to swim before the next breaker comes. 
</P>
<P>
 For several hundred yards, we porpoise off Venice Beach, lunging, gasping and 
being battered by choppy surf. Of all possible marine mammals, the porpoise is 
not the one I bring to mind, but I gradually catch on and even manage to finish 
ahead of a few cadets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hearst is not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of you were beaten by our gentleman from the L.A. Times," he says 
contemptuously. "And that's not acceptable.' 
</P>
<P>
 It is a proud moment. After just one day, I have emerged as the universal 
standard of failure. It is the last time I will finish an event anywhere but 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second training weekend takes us to Santa Monica, where, after another 
1,000-meter ocean swim, Lt. Mickey Gallagher of the agency's rough-and-tumble 
Central Section gives us a cheerful rundown of the area extending from Las 
Tunas Beach south to Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Section presents something of a socioeconomic challenge for 
lifeguards. It is a destination for everyone from the most affluent to "the 
lowest of the food chain," in Gallagher's delicate phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 People have a tendency to take drugs and swim naked here. Transients love 
Central Section beaches. Cross-country travelers often punctuate their voyage 
with a dip here. Fun-seekers who may lack familiarity with the ocean arrive in 
droves each sunny weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nuts down here," Gallagher concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Films and lectures on cardiopulmonary resuscitation come next, followed by 
hands-on practice on flesh-colored dummies. Lt. Kenny Atkins, our CPR 
instructor, gets graphic, explaining at one point the intricacies of 
resuscitating a victim whose false teeth have come loose.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to scoop up those gums and blow in their mouth like a 
paper bag," he chirps brightly, shortly before lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, we head down to the beach, where our teachers enthusiastically 
point out "potential victims" -- young children playing near a drop in the 
ocean floor, drunk bathers, body-boarders edging near a riptide and even a 
textbook "elbow slapper," defined as a bad swimmer whose elbows habitually 
strike the surface of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 During the exercise, several cadets actually sprint into the surf to help a 
couple who have strayed into neck-deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 As trainees, we have been taught never to underestimate the stupidity of the 
beach-going public, and now I see why. The swimmers, looking a bit bedraggled 
as the trainees escort them from the water, are wearing waterlogged shirts and 
jeans, clothing likely to bog down even the best of swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The next exercise is the "saddleback carry," a technique lifeguards use to 
haul unconscious victims onto the beach. To impress upon us the effectiveness 
of the carry, instructor Lee Davis chooses me -- by far the beefiest trainee -- 
as a mock victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaying impeccable form perfected through years of experience, Davis 
effortlessly scoops me off the beach onto his hips, pauses, groans and spins 
madly out of control like a chopper hit by a mortar round. We crash to the 
sand, providing another important lesson: Never underestimate the weight of the 
beach-going public, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By now we are learning the lingo of lifeguard school, especially the dreaded 
RSR -- which stands for Run/Swim/Run. These timed events require us to dash in 
soft sand about 150 yards, swim to a distant buoy and back, then sprint another 
150 yards to the finish line. Demanding under any circumstances, RSR takes on 
near-Sisyphean dimensions for me in our third weekend outing -- in the numbing 
surf of Zuma Beach, heart of the Northern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Winded by the run, I trot into the ocean well behind my classmates, taking a 
last longing look back toward the beach. The 57-degree water makes it harder 
still to catch my breath. 
</P>
<P>
 I am close to outright panic, too cold and scared to put my head under for 
more than an instant. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time I try, an ice creamheadache shoots through my skull. I resort to the 
sidestroke, thebreaststroke, even the lowly dog paddle -- anything to avoid 
putting my head down. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, clad in a wet suit and riding a paddleboard, exhorts me to start 
stroking, but it is not until the buoy is well within reach that I feel 
confident enough to try a tentative crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back in, the senior ocean lifeguard skillfully steers me around a 
riptide, but in my hurry to get out of the water, I lose track of a big wave 
rolling in behind me. 
</P>
<P>
 Not good. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive breaker sends me cork-screwing out of control, and for a few 
terrifying moments I have no idea which way is up. Then physics takes over and 
suddenly I am standing dazedly in knee-deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the best beaches in the nation and spared many of the 
crowd-control issues common to Central Section, Zuma nevertheless has powerful 
riptides and surf that breaks in dangerously shallow water, often pounding 
surfers and swimmers into the sand. It is life-guarding at its purest and most 
demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect 1,000%," Northern Section Capt. Steve Saylors says in our dank 
makeshift classroom, a diving equipment storage room at Zuma. "There's no room 
for failure in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 the next morning we are back in the same place doing another RSR, a 
paddleboard race and still more CPR practice.  
</P>
<P>
 We also get to drive the yellow lifeguard trucks, which, like everything else 
here, is not as easy as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the verge of getting stuck, I punch the accelerator and skid sideways 
through deep sand, causing a cluster of astonished sunbathers to rear back on 
their beach blanket in fear. "We're learning to drive!" instructor Chris Rowley 
assures them from the passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the fourth weekend, three rookies have dropped out, but the miseries of the 
Northern Section have forged a camaraderie among those who remain. It doesn't 
hurt that the water off Manhattan Beach, our new training site, is five degrees 
warmer than Zuma. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Southern Section, that atmosphere remains intense, but our 
instructors have loosened up a bit, trading wisecracks and asides with the 
class as the personalities of individual cadets emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Stoker, an amiable 18-year-old from the Palos Verdes Peninsula, elicits 
sighs of genuine sympathy when we learn that his longtime girlfriend broke up 
with him the weekend before, apparently because rookie school ran late, making 
the couple late for their high school prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Phil Topar decrees that anyone with a prom on this night is exempt from 
end-of-the-day cleanup duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, I am winning the respect of the class, which now applauds in 
unison each time I complete a distance event. During an extended RSR at 
Manhattan Beach, several finishers actually re-enter the water and swim the 
final leg with me for moral support. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, rookie Jason Leroy promises, "We'll teach you how to surf, dude. It's 
rad." 
</P>
<P>
 Lectures fill the weekend, everything from first aid to self-defense to 
personal grooming. None of it, however, is as thrilling as our Sunday morning 
agenda at Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV news cameras are out in force as we huddle atop the pier, stepping off 
one at a time like sailors walking the plank. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everything else we do, the exercise has a practical application: It's far 
quicker to run out on a pier and jump off to rescue a swimmer struggling nearby 
than to swim out from the beach. But this matters not a whit to me as I drop 
like a sack of spuds toward the hard, green water, wishing I had been nicer to 
my parents and done more traveling over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon resurfacing, I climb aboard a Baywatch boat, whose skipper, in the true 
tradition of nautical hospitality, promptly sets the throttle at Mach 9 and 
orders everyone to leap overboard. By the time I come up for air the craft is 
several hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later we are immersed in a new activity -- and, as always, the water 
-- yanking a panicky swimmer, portrayed by Mr. Hearst, off a barnacle-encrusted 
pier piling. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we practice jetty rescues, a risky maneuver that requires us to 
belly-flop from the rocks onto a swell to avoid bashing our heads on submerged 
boulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving the old saw that fear is sometimes the best motivator, my leap is 
deemed by instructor Terry Yamamoto "the best rock jump of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The frantic morning marks the climax of rookie school. Only one full session 
remains, most of which is spent reviewing for the all-important written and 
practical exams, which everyone, except for me, will pass. 
</P>
<P>
 We're down to the mundane now -- how to line up work with supervisors, fill 
out time cards, build up seniority, deal with press inquiries. A race around 
the treacherous Venice Breakwater marks the final water event of the Class of 
'94. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is in a giddy mood. The ordeal is ending, and a long, action-packed 
summer stretches out before us -- well, most of us. "It's like joining a new 
family," says 23-year-old trainee Heidi Hannenian. 
</P>
<P>
 A budget crisis that had earlier threatened to decimate the service has been 
essentially resolved by an organizational switch: starting July 1, lifeguards 
will be part of the County Fire Department rather than the Department of 
Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a twinge of sadness. After the exam, everyone will go their own 
way, the new guards dispersing among the three sections, and I, despite my 
improved swimming and hard-won knowledge of the ocean, returning to the ranks 
of potential drowning victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A symbol of closure is in order. Gathering us together for the last time, Mr. 
Page calls me to the front of the class to present a plaque, a lasting reminder 
of what really matters in life. It says: 
</P>
<P>
 "When the last word is writ 
</P>
<P>
 Who gives a $&? 
</P>
<P>
 Just watch the water!"

 "No school" doesn't mean "no reading" -- thanks to a variety of free, 
book-related activities at local libraries this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most libraries participate in the Los Angeles County system's summer reading 
program. This year's theme is "Reading Is a Magic Trip," and many branches are 
spicing up book activities with magic shows and other performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading program is free and open to children of all ages. Here's how it 
works: Children read books at their own pace and keep track in a special 
folder. They get a small prize for completing each book, then receive a 
certificate during a ceremony at summer's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Events will vary from branch to branch, but the following "reading roundup" 
should help you choose the best plan for your child. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of libraries is not restricted, so you're free to enjoy the best events 
from each. Mar Vista 
</P>
<P>
 The Mar Vista branch of the Los Angeles library system begins its summer 
reading program with puppet shows and a "bubble-ologist" on July 5. The program 
ends with a party, magic show and certificate ceremony on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A bilingual story time for preschoolers is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. on July 19, 
Aug. 2 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Craft workshops for all ages start at 3:30 p.m. on July 12 and 26, Aug. 8 and 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program called Grandparents and Books, senior citizens read to children. 
It is an unusual program, but the Mar Vista library offers it every day at 3 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For more reading practice, try the library's computer reading games.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; $32.8-MILLION BUDGET IS OKD BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach will spend about $2.8 million on capital improvements next 
year that include $250,000 in work to the city's pier and $100,000 in 
improvements to tennis courts at Mira Costa High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements are included in a $32.8-million budget unanimously approved 
by the City Council this week for fiscal year 1994-95.The new budget is about 
1% more than last year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The city anticipates that revenues will decline by about $1 million next year, 
mainly as a result of cuts in federal transportation funds. But an increase in 
property tax revenues last year will help offset the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Several positions that were eliminated through attrition last year when the 
city's Department of Public Works was reorganized will not be replaced under 
the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget includes a general fund reserve of $3.2 million. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; RESIDENTS MAY GET UTILITY TAX BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city hopes to give residents a $500,000 tax break on utilities next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public hearing on the city's budget last week, council members decided 
that an expected $500,000 surplus from this year's utility user tax should go 
into a special reserve so the tax can be reduced in 1994-95 from 3% to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Paul Bussey said the tax cut will depend on how much money 
the city gets from the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Bussey said the council made several changes to budgeted expenditures to save 
about $800,000. It plans to spend $100,000 of that money on street 
improvements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $200,000 will go into a special reserve for future improvements to Palos 
Verdes Drive South on the southeast boundary of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to adopt the budget Tuesday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will continue to fund dial-a-ride 
bus service on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and in six other Los Angeles County 
areas over the next fiscal year. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The county has pledged $90,000 to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Transit

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: DINNER CROWD LOVES THIS LA TRAVIATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of "La Traviata": A young woman breaks off with the only man she has 
ever loved at the instigation of the man's family. When the broken-hearted man 
sees her dancing at a party, he yells at her and scornfully throws money in her 
face. Eventually he finds out that she truly loves him and rushes to her side, 
but by that point in Verdi's opera she is, naturally, just working up to her 
death aria. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Hermosa Beach restaurant La Traviata: A young man named 
Carlos Elfego works side by side in an Anaheim restaurant with a 75-year-old 
Italian chef who's so grouchy that nobody else wants to be near him. Elfego 
learns so much that he goes on to cook at Prego, opens La Traviata in 1991 and 
serves solid Italian food at good prices. People don't yell at him, but they do 
happily throw money. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers include red bell peppers sauteed with fresh basil, garlic, olive 
oil and balsamic vinegar and topped with anchovies ($6.25) and mozzarella 
bufala alla caprese ($6.25), slices of Roma tomatoes topped with mozzarella 
made from water buffalo milk (only the brave milk a water buffalo), fresh basil 
and olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular linguine pescatore ($10.50) is loaded with littleneck clams, 
green-lipped mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari. The chicken-stuffed 
tri-color ravioli ($9) is made with three different pasta doughs: plain, red 
(colored with red bell pepper) and green (colored with spinach). 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken comes four ways: marsala, piccata , parmigiana and cacciatore ($9.50). 
The last is sauteed with white wine, mushroom, onions, tomatoes and rosemary. 
Paella, the Spanish rice dish flavored with saffron and heaped with shrimp, 
scallops, calamari and chicken, is a frequent special. 
</P>
<P>
 La Traviata is at 934 Hermosa Ave., Hermosa Beach. 379-8309. Open Tuesday 
through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday 5 p.m. to 10 
p.m., Friday and Saturday 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.

'HARDWOOD DREAMS' IS A GYM-DANDY FOR FILMGOERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BAUM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stars of this movie never had to audition. They didn't have to memorize 
lines or hire an agent or worry about "becoming" their character. 
</P>
<P>
 They only had to be themselves. Easy enough. Lights, camera, tip-off! 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardwood Dreams," a 47-minute documentary, is the story of the starting five 
of Morningside High's basketball team during the 1992-93 season. Interestingly, 
few basketball scenes are shown; the film's focus is on the lives of the 
players away from the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1992, Brian Robbins and Mike Tollin had the idea of spending a 
season making a television special chronicling a tradition-filled Southland 
inner-city high school basketball team. They pitched the idea to the Fox 
Network and were given the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the easy part. Then they had to find a school willing to allow them 
access to classes, practices, games, players, coaches and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins and Tollin were considering schools such as Crenshaw and Manual Arts 
when they stumbled across Morningside. The drab Inglewood campus seemed perfect 
and they knew that the Monarchs were the defending State Division III 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 They met with Principal Liza Daniels, who cautiously endorsed granting the 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a gamble," Daniels said. "But I thought it was important for the 
community to see another side of Morningside High. We're a school that has been 
neglected. People don't know the energy generated by the positive things that 
go on." 
</P>
<P>
 The team and its coach, Carl Franklin, were enthusiastic about the potential 
exposure and agreed wholeheartedly to having their lives documented. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting was set up for Robbins, a former actor in ABC's "Head of the Class," 
and Tollin, the film's director, to meet the school board, which had the final 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to convince the school board," Robbins said. "They watched some of the 
other shows we had done. We made an impassioned pitch and they had faith." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie begins with the start of the season. Narrator Wesley Snipes 
introduces the five players: Stais Boseman, Sean Harris, Corey Saffold, 
Donminic Ellison and Dwight Curry. They are all seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player is separately shown in situations: during classes; games; 
motivational speeches by NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown, former Notre Dame 
basketball coach Digger Phelps and then-Laker guard Byron Scott; private 
interviews, and just walking around campus. Teachers, administrators and 
coaches are interviewed about the five players. Everyone seems candid. 
</P>
<P>
 Boseman, the Monarchs' best player, is portrayed as an indolent student by 
teachers and teammates. Needing at least a 700 score on the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test to play college basketball as a freshman, he has failed the exam twice. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Boseman can possibly pass the test on his third and final try, 
Boseman's tutor says, "I can teach someone who is brain dead to pass the SAT." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the season and after years of not seeing his son, Boseman's 
father shockingly comes to a game. After the game they have an awkward meeting 
before parting with an uncomfortable, yet touching hug. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie hides nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, a guard, is shown leaving the school after being suspended for 
drinking. Later he complains to a Morningside counselor how the school treats 
him as "the school alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
 In a disturbing scene, forward Curry watches his teammates hug their parents 
after a game. He acknowledges how difficult it is not to have any parents to 
support him. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, the point guard, was a candidate for class valedictorian. But the week 
of the state championship game in Oakland he was among three juveniles arrested 
by police on suspicion of carrying a loaded firearm and a concealed firearm in 
a car. Harris was disqualified as valedictorian, suspended from the team and 
forced to miss the final game. (Morningside lost to Palo Alto in the final by 
20 points.) 
</P>
<P>
 Saffold was the team's center and leader, and his interviews are frequently 
used in the film. Surprisingly, Saffold and Boseman fight in the locker room 
after a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Saffold said he enjoyed the film and realized it had to be a truthful account 
of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have been more basketball-oriented, but you have to show the good 
and the bad," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, however, felt the movie depicted the school disproportionately in a 
bad light. During a classroom scene, gunshots were heard outside the building. 
The camera later filmed police at the school and bullet holes in a building. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really capitalized on some of the negativism," Daniels said. "We had a 
shooting that day and no one was seriously hurt. I didn't want a 
sensationalist-type event at the expense of our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin, who wore a microphone during games, said the film crew, usually 
three or four people, never became a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't as annoying as people might think," he said. "I really wasn't 
(uncomfortable). But it's a challenge to make sure you don't say the wrong 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who produced the movie, said he never met any interference from the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they ever told us to turn off the camera or leave, we would have," Robbins 
said. "This was not a tabloid investigative report. We captured life." 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which ends on graduation day, was not aired on Fox. Robert Licata, 
Fox's senior vice president of publicity, would not discuss why the documentary 
was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins called the decision "strange," but he was encouraged by the three 
awards "Hardwood Dreams" has won: the Crystal Heart from the Heartland Film 
Festival, the National Black Programming Consortium Prize and the Cine Golden 
Eagle Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the film had two screenings at the Nuart Theater in West Los 
Angeles. Soon, "Hardcourt Dreams" will be one of three American films shown at 
the St. Petersburg International Film Festival in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the premiere in Los Angeles last year, the film raised $28,246 for the 
Inglewood School District, most of which went to the Morningside athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who said he grew attached to the players, said it was an eye-opening 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear about kids in these neighborhoods and you find out they're the same 
all over," Robbins said. "They have the same hopes and dreams. Everybody wants 
the same thing. Maybe it's just a little tougher to get there." Where They Are 
Now 
</P>
<P>
 Stais Boseman: USC guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Harris: San Diego State, not playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Stafford: Was a redshirt as a freshman at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Curry: Didn't play last season at El Camino College. Enrolled at L.A. 
Trade Tech. Expected to play for Trade Tech this season. 
</P>

NOTEBOOK / ROB FERNAS; FOOTBALL PLAYER FOUND GUILTY OF BATTERY IN POSTGAME 
BRAWL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harbor College football player Dion Mills has been convicted of battery and 
sentenced to two years probation for knocking out a Pierce assistant coach 
during a postgame brawl Sept. 29 at Harbor. A Compton Superior Court jury 
reached the verdict last week after rejecting a higher count of assault with a 
deadly weapon against Mills, who hit Pierce assistant Pat Swift in the head

PEOPLE: FORMER HOSPITAL PATIENT RETURNS TO HELP LIFT THE SPIRITS OF OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steven Dimmick burned his little toe on a campfire a few years ago, he 
never thought it would lead to gangrene, a partial amputation of his foot, 
impaired eyesight and five months in the hospital. But as much as he lost in 
the experience, Dimmick found something too: humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 1992 stay at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, he 
spent a good deal of time helping other patients cope with depression. Dimmick, 
29, is still on the road to recovery, but he continues to spend three and four 
days a week on the hospital's third floor, helping lift the spirits of those 
who need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimmick says he helps himself feel better by helping others. He gets the guy 
in traction a banana that the nurses don't have time to fetch. He plays cards. 
He talks. He offers suggestions -- based on his own experiences -- on how to 
cope with the long hospital days and nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is wonderful," said Julia Johnson, director of activities for the 
hospital recreational therapy program on the third floor. "He's so loving, 
warmhearted and caring. He gives a lot of himself to patients and to the staff. 
He's always there to assist us." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the other patients feel comfortable with him. "They feel his 
kindness. He gives them a little extra tender loving care, a little extra time. 
That makes them feel good about themselves. Just being there to share with the 
other patients and letting them know, 'Hey, you're not alone. I've been going 
through it for years.' That's a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Dimmick, who lives in Gardena, calls the hospital his "home away from home." 
His eyes fill with tears when he remembers the day he was discharged. "That 
staff did so much for me," he said. "I wanted to return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals were the furthest thing from his mind in December, 1991, when he 
burned his toe. He and his friends were sitting around the campfire, drinking 
and talking, when he casually moved a metal lawn chair with his bare foot. He 
didn't realize the chair had been close to the fire and the metal was hot 
enough to burn his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 A diabetic since age 11, Dimmick knew how important it was to make sure the 
wound healed. Because of blood sugar imbalances, diabetics are much more 
susceptible to chronic infection and eventual gangrene than are non-diabetics, 
he explained. "But I wasn't too worried," he said, because he had previously 
had numerous scrapes, burns and blisters without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, the blister was nearly gone. Then Dimmick got the flu. For 
five days, he lay in bed, not even feeling well enough to take off his socks. 
When he did, he was horror-stricken: Nearly half of his left foot was black.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping my brother had played a practical joke on me," he said. "I 
yelled at him, 'Please tell me you painted my foot black, please tell me!' But 
he said he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this could happen to me, especially from a little blister." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than a dozen surgeries, Dimmick lost only a small part of his 
foot. And although his eyesight was damaged because of a complication of the 
diabetes, he has regained most of his sight. He is learning to walk again and 
hopes to go back someday to his job as a union carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably become a doctor," he said. "In 
my work, I can finish building something and say, 'I built that,' and it's a 
neat feeling. But it's not the same as seeing people feel better or look 
better. I get more satisfaction from seeing people laugh."

SKATEBOARDS: LAW BANNING SIDEWALK USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know it was not James Benning's intent to be amusing in his article (June 2) 
on banning sidewalk skateboarding in Manhattan Beach, but I had to laugh at his 
statement that Hermosa Beach already has a similar law, because it's a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs are posted on Pier Avenue prohibiting skateboards, bicycles and 
roller skates on the sidewalks, but in the eight years I have been walking on 
Pier Avenue, not once have I seen any attempt made to enforce that law. 
Skateboarders, bicyclists and roller skaters use the sidewalks with impunity. 
If Manhattan Beach doesn't enforce the law any better than Hermosa Beach, the 
skateboarders don't have a thing to worry about.

OUT AND ABOUT / KCRW AUCTION: GARDEN PARTY ON A FINE 'SUMMERDAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trip to the Bushmills Distilleries in Ireland, a Napa Valley wine-tasting 
weekend and a cooking class at the California Culinary Institute are among the 
items to be auctioned Sunday during the KCRW Foundation's fourth annual 
"Summerday and International Wine, Dine and Travel Auction." 
</P>
<P>
 Things get started at noon when auctioneer Joe Smith takes the stage at the 
Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. Smith, an avid wine collector, will 
direct the bidding on 130 unique travel packages, wine collections and events. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bidding, tasting begins in the "Garden of Earthly Delights." Guests 
will feast on an array of cuisine prepared by chefs from nearly three dozen 
Southern California restaurants, including Angeli Caffe's famous pasta and 
Zabie's Caesar salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrated winemakers, distillers and brewers from around the world will then 
offer unlimited tastings of their creations. Nonalcoholic beverages will also 
be served. KCRW music personalities will spin the tunes of yesteryear and 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is a chance to gain insight into the working habits, methods and 
inspirations of some of the world's top winemakers and chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Ruth Seymour, station manager at Santa Monica-based KCRW, came 
up with the theme for Summerday. Thinking of Impressionist artist Claude-Oscar 
Monet, she wanted to create an event that replicated the feeling portrayed in 
his garden paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is (the event should be as) refreshing as one of Monet's gardens. 
. . . He had a real lust for life, cooking and wine," said Lauren Deutsch, 
KCRW's community events producer. "It's really the one time KCRW gets to 
celebrate itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The event is an important fund-raiser for the nonprofit station, an affiliate 
of National Public Radio. Proceeds from this year's event benefit the station's 
new performing arts studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The $75 admission includes the bidder's brunch reception, which begins at 11 
a.m., followed by the noon auction. For tasting only, tickets are $55. 
</P>
<P>
 KCRW Foundation's "Summerday" will be from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m at the Pacific 
Design Center, 8687 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood. Reservations are required. 
Tickets are $75 and $55 and includes parking. No tickets will be sold the day 
of the event. For reservations, call (310) 450-5183. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

DREAMS GRIND TO A HALT AS UCLA DISMANTLES PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve McCain was only 10 in 1984, but he remembers the United States' shining 
moment in men's gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 McCain, who grew up in Missouri City, Tex., watched as the U.S. team won the 
gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. It was a UCLA affair of sorts, with 
Bruins Mitch Gaylord, Peter Vidmar and Tim Daggett leading the victory at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys were my role models," McCain said. "When I was in junior high, I 
aspired to be a top gymnast and I wanted to go to UCLA because of what Daggett, 
Vidmar and Gaylord had done." 
</P>
<P>
 McCain's dream came true. He earned a scholarship to UCLA and won an NCAA 
championship in the vault in 1993 and high bar in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, as McCain prepared for his junior season, he heard the news: UCLA 
was dropping the program, along with women's gymnastics and men's swimming, 
after the 1993-94 academic year in an attempt to eliminate a departmental 
deficit of $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my goal and dream to compete at UCLA and become its next star," McCain 
said. "Now everything was being taken away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 When the women's gymnastics team threatened the school with a gender equity 
lawsuit, UCLA backed down and the program was reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes from the two men's programs also tried legal action, claiming 
discrimination because of their sex. But on May 17, a Superior Court judge in 
Santa Monica denied a request for a preliminary injunction against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Charles Young and Athletic Director Pete Dalis made the decision to 
drop the three programs based on a study made by the university's Athletics 
Administrative Review Task Force. Cutting the programs would allow the school 
to recover $670,000 in costs annually, most of which involves funding athletic 
scholarships. The savings were reduced to about $520,000 annually when women's 
gymnastics received its reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's success in men's gymnastics made the decision even more difficult. 
Coach Art Shurlock guided the Bruins to NCAA championships in 1984 and 1987 and 
eight top three finishes. Eight of his gymnasts have won Olympic gold medals. 
The 30-year coach accepted an early retirement package in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Shurlock, 56, points to Title IX legislation as a deciding factor to drop the 
men's sports. Adopted in 1972, Title IX requires that male and female athletes 
be treated equally in all areas of education, including athletics and 
scholarship awards. 
</P>
<P>
 College football offers the most scholarships, 85, effective in August, down 
from 87 in 1993. Minus football scholarships, most schools offer more 
scholarships to women's programs than to men's. For example, the NCAA allows 
only 4.5 scholarships to men's volleyball and 12 to women's volleyball. In 
gymnastics, it's 6.3 for men and 10 for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Shurlock believes UCLA could have eliminated scholarships from women's sports 
and saved men's gymnastics and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do we give women's track more scholarships than men's track? It's not 
fair," Shurlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a men's team can be successful with fewer scholarships, why can't a 
women's team be just as successful? We are giving away scholarships just to 
give them away. I think we should exclude football from the count and make 
everything else equal. Either that or form a women's football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools depend on revenue from football and men's basketball to fund 
athletics programs. At UCLA, the athletics department receives no state money. 
Athletics are funded through revenue generated by football and men's 
basketball, student registration fees and donations from Bruin supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA women's Athletic Director Judith Holland said the athletic program is 
reviewed overall under Title IX regulations, not sport by sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is factored into men's sports and all those scholarships figure into 
the equation," Holland said. "We then compute the total opportunity for men 
against women and it has to be roughly comparable to the enrollment rate of the 
school, which is roughly 50-50 at UCLA. Nothing is done looking at one sport 
against another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law was created by the federal government and the state and I don't have 
any choice in that." 
</P>
<P>
 So the losers at UCLA became the men's gymnasts and swimmers. The school will 
honor the existing scholarships of its athletes affected by the cutbacks, which 
was welcome news for McCain and his four teammates, who have chosen to stay at 
UCLA and try to compete as a club team. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one way, it could benefit me overall because now I have more time to train 
for the Olympics and concentrate on school," McCain said. "The downside is that 
we won't be able to compete in the NCAA championships." 
</P>
<P>
 McCain does not harbor a grudge against the women's gymnastics team, which 
will remain intact for at least another season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved that they decided to keep the women's team," McCain said. "It 
meant the school was getting the gym back and we could all work out."

QUAKE SCAVENGERS; AFTERMATH: HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN OVER APARTMENTS 
ABANDONED AFTER THE TEMBLOR, STRIPPING AND SELLING WHATEVER WAS LEFT BEHIND. 
</P>

 John Alvarez lives in what might charitably be called a mixed neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroin addicts keep to the quake-damaged apartments near the flood control 
channel. The hookers and crack dealers work the cul-du-sac across the street. 
Gang members drop by occasionally to drink some beer, bust a few windows and 
leave some more scrawl. 
</P>
<P>
 And the homeless find a quiet corner. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a definite hierarchy among those living in the string of abandoned 
apartment buildings in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez considers himself near the top of the heap. After all, he is working 
for his food and cigarette money -- by scavenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get $5 for these," he said, pointing to a set of window blinds, as he 
and two companions took a break Wednesday from carting off furniture, 
appliances and anything else of value.  
</P>
<P>
 For the last two months he and dozens of others have been squatting in 11 or 
so neighborhood apartment buildings that were abandoned by residents after the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is what Los Angeles officials call a new breed of "ghost town," a 
cluster of empty quake-ravaged buildings. On Wednesday, they identified 10 such 
spots throughout the city in Sylmar, Northridge, Canoga Park, Sherman Oaks and 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 With neighbors and police complaining of rising crime rates nearby, city 
officials said Wednesday that they will use $20 million in discretionary funds 
provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for fences and 
other security measures, perhaps guards, to seal off the abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said even that might not be enough and that they will press for 
additional federal money, although the Federal Emergency Management Agency has 
so far turned down requests for more funds, saying it is a local problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners in the Sylmar neighborhood where Alvarez scavenges say they 
don't have the money to fix up their property or, in some cases, even put up 
fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's signs ordering people away have long been torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the warnings are really necessary. Huge cracks run across entire 
walls, overhangs pitch forward as if they are about to fall and there is broken 
glass everywhere. Most front doors are open or torn from their hinges. And 
inside, carpets have been ripped from the floors. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains in many apartments are broken furniture, flies, paper trash, 
beer bottles, animal droppings and rotting food. In their haste to remove their 
possessions in the days after the earthquake, many residents left only scraps 
of their lives: a kindergarten report card, a brown teddy bear, empty 
prescription bottles, personal letters, a pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no running water now, in most cases, no electricity. Yet even the 
dreary, dangerous conditions fail to discourage those seeking free shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those living here say as many as 50 people have passed through the buildings 
in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, dressed in shirt, pants and shoes found in one of the apartments, 
said he lost his own apartment during the quake and has been unable to find any 
construction work since then. So he has been moving from damaged apartment to 
apartment, bunking in "whichever one is the cleanest." 
</P>
<P>
 His companion, Jess Torres -- another unemployed laborer -- holds up a clock 
radio he found and hopes to sell for $5. "This is lunch, a hamburger and a soft 
drink," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were piling the stuff into the back of Terry Bratton's pickup. 
Bratton has a home but said he is trying to keep a family afloat on disability 
payments. So he needs the extra income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just scavenging what I can," the Sylmar resident said. "We had someone 
who wanted a dresser, but we haven't been able to find one." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the first floor air-conditioning units are gone from the apartments 
located on the 14600 block of Hubbard Street. They were sold for $10 each, the 
same rate paid for refrigerators and washing machines, the men said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the city attorney's office said the men have no right to take 
the property, even if it is abandoned. As a practical matter, however, they 
will not be prosecuted for the petty thefts, a misdemeanor, unless the owner of 
the property reports it stolen, spokesman Ted Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if that happens, Alvarez and Torres wonder what they could do to two 
homeless men: Put them in jail, give them a few free meals and a chance to 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
 The police occasionally conduct sweeps at the apartments, but they generally 
arrest only those with outstanding warrants or those who possess drugs, the men 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Marquez, one of the building owners, said he has the same troubles as 
the scavengers, "financing." That is why there is no fence and no guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez said he asked the Small Business Administration for a loan of $400,000 
to pay for $157,000 in needed repairs and to pay off loans on the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless he gets the money, he said, he cannot afford the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is helping us yet, and we are broke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Nuguid, who manages six vacant buildings on Hubbard Street that are 
owned by his father, said he has tried unsuccessfully to board them up. "They 
are tearing down the boards," he said. "It's getting ridiculous."

FIRM TO PAY $800,000 FINE IN GAS ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The operators of a now-defunct paper recycling plant in Vernon where a worker 
was killed by toxic hydrogen sulfide gas three years ago were ordered Wednesday 
to pay $800,000 in fines for illegally disposing of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine, to be paid by Domtar Gypsum Inc., an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based firm, is 
the second-largest payout of its kind in the nine-year history of the district 
attorney's Environmental Crimes Unit, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorneys for the company and then-plant manager Roland Johnson, 47, 
of La Verne said that the firm and the manager had entered no-contest pleas 
because the fine was less costly than litigation would have been. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the monetary punishment, Johnson was sentenced to three years 
probation and ordered to perform 350 hours of community service for the July 
23, 1991, incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vernon plant made headlines in 1991 after a cloud of hydrogen sulfide gas 
enveloped an underground storage tank, killing a worker who had gone inside to 
clean it, and injuring at least 38 others. 
</P>
<P>
 The vat in which the accident occurred was used to store pulp material -- 
churned up paper and water -- that is recycled into paper used to cover the 
company's wallboard, marketed under the trade name Gyproc. 
</P>
<P>
 Malachi Nash, 53, of Compton was overcome by fumes and died inside the tank; 
two other workers who went in to rescue him were left semiconscious and 
required hospitalization. Dozens of employees, paramedics and firefighters 
suffered nausea and skin irritation from the gas during rescue efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, investigators found that reused plant water from a storage tank had 
been used in the tank, and had not been treated with a required antibacterial 
solution, Delaney said. As a result, the water contained organic material that 
fostered the rapid growth of bacteria that generated the lethal gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Domtar and Johnson were aware of the serious health risks 
created by the generation of the gas, but failed to take steps to protect the 
plant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond C. Marshall, a lawyer for Domtar, said the company viewed the incident 
as "an unfortunate accident which neither the company nor Mr. Johnson had any 
reason to believe would occur."

BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE; CAMEROONIANS TRYING TO SET UP ARTS FAIR GET LESSON 
IN RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It should have been a nice pastoral fair in the city, an art exhibition under 
the shade of Leimert Park, a cultural exchange between the people of Cameroon 
and the residents of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans would learn about art from the central African country on the eve of 
its soccer team's participation in the World Cup. And more than 100 
Cameroonians -- artists, performers, business people, and organizers -- would 
learn about the fashions and lifestyles of Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 They got a lesson all right -- in politics, bureaucracy and business, American 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cameroonian artists and performers finally found a spot at the Ruby 
Counts Caring Center, they first had to jump through bureaucratic hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had they literally pitched their tents in Leimert Park when they 
were told Friday -- the day the exhibition should have started -- to take them 
down. Never mind that they had already had a charmingly informal news 
conference that very afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw this place, I fell in love with it," said Manga Doualla-Bell, one 
of the organizers as well as an architect and grandson of one of the last kings 
of Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 But passion wasn't enough. They needed permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of Friday afternoon, they hadn't pulled the appropriate permits for street 
closures," said Carolyn Webb de Macias, chief of staff for City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas. "When you do something in Leimert Park, generally one or more of 
the streets get closed off." 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't all, she said. "They hadn't gone to Recreation and Parks to 
use the park. And they hadn't gone to the Fire Department for permits to pitch 
the tents." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb de Macias said that Ridley-Thomas, councilman for that area, tried to 
help at the last minute. "On Friday we were hastily trying to help them by 
putting in a motion which would have allowed the various departments to get 
busy and do something at least for the weekend," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, insisted an Angeleno who has been hectically trying to help the 
Cameroonians for the last couple of months. According to the organizer, the 
Cameroonians had investigated permits and were waiting to get a waiver of all 
the fees -- which this source said would have amounted to a staggering $1,200 a 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had applied two months ago to Mark Ridley-Thomas' office to waive all 
those permits. We had been told and told and told that this was pending, 
pending, pending," said the organizer, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb de Macias responded: "We were never asked to waive the fees." But, she 
added, she suggested putting a fee waiver in Friday's motion, a common practice 
with nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cameroonians had already dealt with the merchants, whom Webb de Macias 
said often have misgivings about events that close off streets coursing with 
shoppers and browsers through Leimert Park Village. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmy Dodson, the new president of the Leimert Park Merchants Assn., 
strongly insists that the merchants were agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way did we oppose the concept," said Dodson, owner of a yogurt shop and 
deli called Banjoes. In fact, Dodson contends, merchants were intrigued by the 
Cameroonians' initial ambitious proposal to set up an African pavilion, a tall 
structure complete with a palm-frond thatched roof, in the middle of an 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed that that pavilion is not sitting at the moment in 
the middle of 43rd Place and Degnan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson admitted the merchants had some initial reluctance to approve the plan 
in such a brief periode -- it was brought to them in early May -- but said they 
approved a scaled-down version of the pavilion. When it turned out the 
Cameroonians couldn't get the materials they needed to construct an elaborate 
village but wanted to set up a tented exhibition instead, the merchants nixed 
the idea for the middle of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they wanted to go to event tents, we were no longer willing to let them 
block our streets," Dodson said. "A mere tent was a letdown after what we saw 
billed as a world-class structure. It wouldn't bring the same kind of business 
as a pavilion." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cameroonians settled on Leimert Park, the merchants did not object. 
"There are a couple of things we pointed out to them -- they couldn't sell in 
the park," Dodson said. "We are very sorry that it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Surmised businesswoman Phyllis Moats, who tried to intervene between the 
Cameroonians and the city, "I think there was a cultural thing -- they did not 
understand the politics . . . Even though it's a public park, it's still run by 
the city and you have to ask permission to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, all the Cameroonians could do was wait. They had been staying at 
USC dormitories and eating breakfast and dinner at a Crenshaw restaurant, the 
Hereafter, which has also served as their unofficial headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 They had already dealt with minor setbacks. In an attempt to re-create the 
cuisine of Cameroon for visitors, they had brought with them foot-long cassava 
sticks wrapped in dried banana leaves. But all their fresh food products did 
not make it through customs. They simply determined to do without. After all, 
the promotional group that organized this journey is called Jemea, a word from 
the Douala language that means, appropriately enough, determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Emmett Cash, a Los Angeles-based international consultant, managed to 
secure a new venue -- the tree-lined parking lot of the Ruby Counts Caring 
Center at 3831 Stocker St. On Wednesday, Cameroonians were setting up the 
exhibition. The fair is scheduled from noon to 10 p.m. today through Sunday 
night. Shows are to be held at 7 and 9 each night. Admission is $2 and children 
under 13 get in free. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash said he got involved to show off the spirit of Los Angeles. "We don't 
have guests come to this city without trying to facilitate them."

OFFICIALS WEIGH ABOLISHMENT OF L.A. RENT CONTROL; HOUSING: A MANAGER IN THE 
CITY'S PROGRAM SAYS IT IS UNNECESSARY IN A DEPRESSED ECONOMY AND PREVENTS 
LANDLORDS FROM MAINTAINING BUILDINGS. ADVOCATES FOR THE POOR DISAGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles housing officials are debating the merits of the city's 
16-year-old rent stabilization program and may soon recommend to the City 
Council that rent controls be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Zeidman, a Housing Department assistant general manager, said the 
controls may be unnecessary in today's depressed real estate market, which has 
seen rents in uncontrolled apartments decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said the controls are not appreciably helping many renters. High 
vacancy rates in most parts of the city have given tenants greater choice of 
where to move and, thus, more bargaining power in obtaining reduced rents. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the controls "may be creating damage" to the city's aging housing 
stock by making it harder for some struggling landlords to maintain their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said that no firm decision has been made to recommend an end to the 
controls. But in remarks during a recent interview, she left little doubt that 
she is leaning toward such a controversial recommendation as a result of a City 
Council-ordered study of their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, if you're not getting economic benefits, should you be doing 
economic regulation?" Zeidman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said she will give her department's recommendation to the council in 
late July or early August when the study is complete. She is scheduled to brief 
the city's Rent Adjustment Commission today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles rent control law limits rent increases to from 3% to 8% a year 
-- depending on the rate of inflation. This year the allowable rate is 3%. It 
applies only to tenants in buildings built before 1978, when the ordinance was 
passed. These buildings contain at least 60% of the city's apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 When a tenant moves, a landlord can hike the rent to whatever the market will 
bear. More restrictive rent laws in Santa Monica and West Hollywood do not have 
this vacancy decontrol provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in today's market of declining rents, some long-term tenants are paying 
below-market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect them from being kicked out just because landlords want to set 
higher rents, the law requires landlords to demonstrate that they have just 
cause to evict. But landlords complain that this is an onerous burden because 
it is sometimes difficult and expensive to gather evidence that, for example, a 
tenant is selling drugs and is driving away law-abiding residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords say they are also being hurt economically because the law limits 
their ability to pass along the costs of large capital improvements -- such as 
new roofs or earthquake damage repairs -- to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Esparza, director of the city's rent stabilization program, said data 
indicates that the city's housing stock is deteriorating because landlords are 
not making needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 To reassure senior citizens and other long-term renters who pay below-market 
rents, Zeidman said any changes she would recommend would be gradual and not 
affect tenants unless they moved. She also said she would favor strengthening 
eviction protections and expanding penalties for landlords who do not provide 
basic services such as hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent control movement became a powerful political force in the late 1970s 
in the wake of unkept promises by landlords to pass property tax savings from 
Proposition 13 on to tenants in the form of lower rents. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council adopted its first set of controls in 1978, at a time when 
real estate speculators were trading apartment buildings as if they were 
baseball cards and raising rents sky-high to pay for ever-higher mortgages 
during a period of double-digit inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, said William Shaw, president of the Apartment Assn. of Greater 
Los Angeles, vacancy rates hovered at 1% or 2% and tenants who wanted to move 
had few options. By contrast, he said, vacancy rates now are greater than 9%. 
The Housing Department pegs the vacancy rate at somewhat less. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no disagreement that the rental market in Los Angeles is 
fundamentally different now than when the controls were passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rents since 1989 in the Greater Los Angeles area have fallen; vacancy rates 
have risen," Shaw said. "I've been in the rental housing business since 1974. 
This is the most difficult period I've ever been through." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing Department officials declined to release data from their unfinished 
study on rent rates in the city, referring a reporter to Shaw's association. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he had no formal data, but, by his own experience, a low-end, 
two-bedroom apartment in Pacoima that rented for $575 four years ago might rent 
for $475 now. He said a luxury two-bedroom apartment in Encino that rented for 
$1,500 four years ago might rent for $1,200 now. Another association official, 
landlord Andre Vaughn, said rents for a typical two-bedroom apartment in the 
Crenshaw District have dropped from about $725 to $625 in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Any attempt to roll back rent control would probably be subject to intense 
political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe this is the time to roll back rent control," said Rod Field, 
housing coordinator for the Legal Aid Foundation. "If there is a large vacancy 
rate, it's because of the economy. Basically, people can't afford housing. 
Period." 
</P>
<P>
 In some poor areas of the city, high vacancy rates coexist with unprecedented 
overcrowding. Many families, particularly those of recent immigrants, have been 
forced to double or triple up to pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials point to overcrowding as evidence that rent control is not solving 
the affordability problem for the poor. But advocates for the poor worry that 
removing controls will only make things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take off rent control, rents are going to go up dramatically," Field 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADBURY; EX-OFFICIAL 
WHO MISUSED FUNDS PAYS CITY $110,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Bradbury City Manager Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire paid a settlement of 
$110,000 to the city Tuesday, concluding a civil suit that alleged she 
embezzled $84,000 by using the municipal credit card and other city accounts to 
buy personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have recovered our losses with interest," Bradbury Mayor Bea 
LaPisto-Kirtley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire was fired last spring from the post she had held for two decades 
after allegations of misspending. A Times investigation showed that Vollaire 
had used city money to buy such items as personal crystal and china, designer 
sunglasses and shoes. The city sued Vollaire in November, 1993, seeking to 
recover the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire pleaded no contest in April to felony counts of misusing public funds 
and presenting fraudulent claims to the city. She agreed to pay $54,000 
restitution to Bradbury, which is included in the civil settlement. She faces a 
sentencing hearing July 8 on the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil settlement, reached Monday, saves the city the cost and time of a 
trial, which could have taken a year to conclude, Bradbury's attorney Wesley 
Beverlin said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
DEPUTY ACCUSED OF SEX ABUSE TO STAND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of sexually abusing his 
estranged wife's children was ordered to stand trial after waiving his right to 
a preliminary hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge David Horowitz bound Darryl Erwin Byrd, who remains in custody 
in lieu of $375,000 bail, over for trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on two 
felony counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd also was ordered to stand trial on one unrelated felony count of unlawful 
storage of a firearm for an incident that ended in the death of a teen-age boy 
last Christmas Eve.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Mark Zavidow said his client waived his right to a 
preliminary hearing "for reasons that make sense to us."  
</P>
<P>
 The public defender said the hearing would have been of little use to the 
defense because the prosecution was planning to present a "hearsay" hearing in

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
OFFICIALS MAKE NEW OFFER TO POLICE UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after the city of Los Angeles declared an impasse in its contract talks 
with the police union, Mayor Richard Riordan and a small group of city 
officials met privately with top union leaders and made an offer in an attempt 
to reach a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of Wednesday's proposal were not disclosed, sources said the 
contract package was significantly higher than the one officers overwhelmingly 
rejected last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposal advanced by the city did not emerge from the council's 
negotiating team. Instead, it was put forward by Riordan, Council President 
John Ferraro, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie and two of the council's 
prime police supporters -- Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Protective League leaders left the meeting at the Biltmore Hotel 
without comment. But sources said the union took the proposal seriously and was 
waiting for the city to gather enough support for the package on the City 
Council.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-GANG YOUTH, 12, 
RETURNS TO HOMETOWN THAT REJECTED HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Luis (Mousie) Fernandez, 12, a former gang member sent to Los Angeles because 
school and court officials made him unwanted in his rural Washington hometown, 
returned there Wednesday at the direction of a Los Angeles Dependency Court 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Bradley Stout ordered that Luis return to live with his father 
and four siblings in Wenatchee. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney appointed for Luis at the hearing told Stout that he would line up 
an advocate to represent Luis' interests in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Stout could not be reached for comment on the case. Dependency Court 
officials, citing state confidentiality statutes, would not confirm that a 
hearing had been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources who asked not to be named described the terms of Stout's order. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis has returned to the north-central Washington town of Wenatchee, the 
center of a rich fruit-growing region along the Upper Columbia River, for the 
second time in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was born in Wenatchee, Luis spent more than a year beginning in 
late 1991 in a gang-ridden part of the San Fernando Valley and became involved 
in street life, hanging out with a North Hills gang into the night without 
supervision by his father. He and his family moved back to Wenatchee last fall 
after the death of Luis' oldest brother in a gang-related shooting accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon Luis' return, he became a symbol of the town's struggles to retain its 
peaceful isolation and keep out gangs. The handling of the matter by officials 
there raised a number of legal and moral questions about how difficult children 
should be educated. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Wenatchee school officials, who earlier banned Luis from attending 
classes, went to court to get an order making it a crime for him to go on 
school campuses or associate with students. The district argued that he had 
harassed and threatened students and administrators and was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to get his son back into the fifth grade, Jose Fernandez agreed 
last month, at the urging of state officials, to have Luis move from Wenatchee 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after his return, the San Fernando Valley church group he was to 
live with, Victory Outreach, had not enrolled him in classes. He was the only 
adolescent living at a church-operated rehabilitation facility for adult drug 
addicts, alcoholics and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services heard about his 
situation last week, Luis was taken to stay at MacLaren Hall, the county's 
group facility for abused and neglected children. That move prompted this 
week's court hearing. RICHARD LEE COLVIN

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; HE'S FULFILLING HIS DREAM 
TO HELP OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1985, Joaquin Shelton finally decided it was time to charge ahead with his 
dream.  
</P>
<P>
 Maxing out his credit cards, he took $5,000, joined with two friends and 
founded Human Services Network (HSN), a North Hollywood-based, nonprofit group 
that provides 24-hour residential care for abused, neglected and abandoned 
adolescent boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money was so tight at the beginning," he said. "I had to keep my other job at 
a large social service agency for three years to pay the bills while I worked 
here as volunteer director." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Shelton has only one job but remains on call 24 hours a day. His time, 
he said, is spent writing new training programs, talking to kids, reviewing 
weekly client status reports, keeping his census full and raising development 
money to start a private school.  
</P>
<P>
 After spending 14 years in the field working as everything from resident 
manager, home parent, child-care worker, social worker and program director, 
Shelton felt qualified to take the plunge and form his own nonprofit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also got tired of the infighting that goes on at larger agencies," he said. 
"I wanted more latitude, so I could be more responsive on the line level to the 
input we get from kids."  
</P>
<P>
 HSN has grown from one community home to three sites in Shadow Hills, North 
Hills and Granada Hills. Each of the facilities houses six boys at a time, with 
75% of the teen-agers coming from Los Angeles County's Department of Children 
Services. The remaining 25% come from county Probation Department referrals.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization has 12 full-time and five part-time staff members.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Shelton did was start an "emancipation program" for 
teen-agers 16 through 18 who have no family to return to and who must live 
independently at age 18 when the Department of Children Services stops 
supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "DCS regulations meant we were taking kids who were badly damaged emotionally, 
have histories of physical and/or sexual abuse and, in some cases, 
institutionalization, have no living skills and expect them to make their way 
on their own," Shelton said. "It wasn't working. Many of them were ending up in 
jail or back on the streets abusing drugs and alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 All of Shelton's clients have backgrounds that include some kind of abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 "It ranges from simple neglect to grotesque stuff," Shelton said. "I have boys 
who suffered sexual abuse starting at 6 months of age and were so badly damaged 
they can't hold a bowel movement. I also have kids who have scar tissue on 
their backs from cuts and burns, and kids who were locked in closets for weeks 
at a time."  
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Korn, senior social worker for HSN, oversees the emancipation program. 
Some of the organization's clients have learning disabilities. Most had so 
little parenting, she said, that much of the staff's time is spent modeling 
appropriate parent-child relationships.  
</P>
<P>
 "This lack of parenting manifests itself in depression, unrealistic 
expectations and trust issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers in the emancipation program usually come from single parent homes 
where the mother may have substance abuse or emotional problems and the father 
is absent or in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys in the program are required to finish school or get a General Education 
Diploma. HSN helps the boys get jobs, teaching them how to complete job 
applications, make resumes and go on interview. They must also open bank 
accounts and are taught how to balance their checkbooks.  
</P>
<P>
 "We make them deposit at least 80% of the money they earn, so they'll have 
some kind of nest egg to get started," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pre-teens also get group and individual therapy, do household chores and 
participate in structured recreational activities.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PORTION OF 
STATE'S LARGEST FREEWAY INTERCHANGE OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half of California's largest freeway interchange opened Wednesday, linking the 
new Interstate 105 with heavily traveled Interstate 405. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers removed orange cones on the roadway before 6 a.m., providing morning 
commuters with a way to travel from the southbound 405, or San Diego Freeway, 
to the westbound 105, or Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The interchange is one of the final projects associated with construction of 
the 105 Freeway, which opened in October, said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie 
Tiritilli. 
</P>
<P>
 The interchange, which covers more than 100 acres and is taller than a 
seven-story building, is east of Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the largest and most complex freeway interchange ever built in 
California," said Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 The connector roads from the eastbound 105 to the 405 are expected to open 
next month, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
SUPERVISORS VOTE TO END BONUS FOR RETIRING OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to end the practice of 
giving six-month pay bonuses to retiring executives, the latest in a series of 
efforts to scale back the county's unusually generous benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote, the supervisors agreed to stop paying the bonuses to 
newly hired department heads and will seek outside legal advice on ways to take 
the benefit away from department heads who have the bonuses written into their 
contracts. In recent months some retiring county employees have received lump 
sum bonuses of more than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The move follows efforts by the board to pare back pension benefits and car 
allowances for senior officials after a pension scandal two years ago.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CASTAIC; 15 INMATES 
HURT IN BRAWL AT PITCHESS HONOR RANCHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen inmates were injured in a fight Tuesday night when as many as 800 
prisoners at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho battled each other using crude 
weapons for about 15 minutes before guards were able to restore order, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting began about 7:45 p.m. in a minimum security compound at the jail 
when prisoners began arguing about the theft of money from an inmate, said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the battle divided along racial lines, with 750 to 800 Latino 
and African American inmates squaring off with mop and broom handles, socks 
filled with rocks and prison-made knives, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty deputies, some using pepper spray, quelled the brawl, Ramirez said. Two 
injured inmates were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, one with a 
broken clavicle and a cut above his eye, the other with several stab wounds, 
Ramirez said. The hospital declined to give their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three inmates were taken to County-USC Medical Center to receive stitches, and 
10 prisoners were treated at the jail's medical clinic, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 No deputies were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates involved in the brawl have been transferred to different sections of 
the jail, Ramirez said, as is common practice after such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail has been the site of hundreds of brawls between Latino and African 
American inmates in recent years. Prison officials attribute the violence to a 
power struggle.

WALKING A MILE IN THEIR SHOES; MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTHS AT POLICE WORKSHOP DISCOVER 
THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A LAW OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The police officers went out on a routine call -- a homeowner complaining that 
her neighbors' party was too loud. Augustine Lorenzo and Susanna Ventura had 
seen all the movies. They'd had their training. They were ready. Or so they 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But these weren't your average officers. Augustine and Susanna are both in 
seventh grade. And when they were forced to act as police officers in a 
workshop with actual officers, they got more than they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine, a student at Washington Irving Middle School in Mt. Washington, 
stared down Guadalupe Maciel, a student playing the owner of the site of the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn the music down or I'll take you to court," Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe shrugged. "So?" 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine was baffled and silent as his classmates giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Susanna and Augustine were two of nearly 600 seventh-graders from six Los 
Angeles middle schools who met with 60 police officers Wednesday in the Los 
Angeles Convention Center to get a taste of life as law enforcement officials. 
The day was the capstone of a yearlong experimental civics curriculum called 
CityYouth designed by the nonpartisan Constitutional Rights Foundation, an 
organization with the goal of teaching good citizenship to youths. The pilot 
program includes workshops and classes ranging from law to how to clean up 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Students such as Augustine found that being a police officer was tougher than 
they thought. Guadalupe refused to budge, despite Augustine's repeated 
requests.  
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Pat Connelly stepped in to give Augustine some advice. Tell her you can 
impound the radio if she doesn't turn it down, he said. Tell her that she could 
spend six months in jail if charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn," Guadalupe said. "I'll turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Clark, the executive director of the Constitutional Rights Foundation, 
said the day was designed to give students "an appreciation of how difficult it 
is to be a police officer in a city like this, and to give them (officers) an 
understanding of how difficult it is to grow up in a city like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Senovita De La Torre of South Gate Middle School was one seventh-grader whose 
opinions changed after spending the day with police officers. Before, she said, 
she thought, "They're pigs." Now, she said, she knows that "they're doing their 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Em Jai Jones, a student at Charles Maclay Middle School in Pacoima, said he 
knows people who don't like police, but, he said, "police care about people." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students seemed to share Senovita's original views of police officers. A 
survey of the CityYouth students found that 38% had never had a friendly 
experience with the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat you like you're not a human being," Edgar Soto of South Gate 
Middle School said.  
</P>
<P>
 Other students complained that police took too long to respond to calls, 
questioned youths just for wearing baggy clothes and were racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Howard Yamamoto explained that police officers have to question people 
who look suspicious to do their jobs. "You know who I am because I wear a 
uniform," he told a group of South Gate students. "I don't know who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 If Yamamoto sees youths dressed like gang members, he said, he has to be 
careful and question them. "That's how we have to act so we can get home at 
night and not die," he said.

JET CRASH NEAR LONG BEACH AIRPORT KILLS 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A vintage French military training jet crashed into a vacant lot and exploded 
in flames shortly after takeoff from Long Beach Municipal Airport on Wednesday 
afternoon, killing both people on board, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were not immediately identified. The Federal Aviation 
Administration said the twin-engine jet belonged to Paradise Aerial, an 
aviation company based at the airport. Company officials could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the plane's engines sounded as if they failed shortly after the 
jet lifted off from Runway 30 at 2:57 p.m., fire officials said. The witnesses 
said that when the engines quit, the pilot apparently started to lower the 
landing gear, which had been retracted seconds after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot radioed he was having trouble with his landing gear, "but there was 
no sense of urgency" in his message, said FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the plane stopped climbing and began to bank, slamming onto 
Cover Street and skidding across the road and some railroad tracks before 
crashing into a dirt embankment on the lot.

 Two women driving along Cover Street saw a ball of fire rising from the 
wreckage. They said fuel from the aircraft spilled across the road and burst 
into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 If a co-worker "hadn't stopped us for a moment as we left, we would have been 
a couple of seconds earlier, and oh my God, that could have been us," Teresa 
Gooselin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only two people on board, and both of them were killed," said 
Battalion Chief Richard Cooper of the Long Beach Fire Department. "Basically, 
the only damage is to the aircraft itself, and it is totally destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the plane was an Aerospatiale Fouga Magistere, a military 
trainer craft manufactured in France between 1953 and 1969. When in civilian 
use, such planes are characterized by the FAA as experimental aircraft.

TRUST LISTS MCDONALD'S IN DOWNEY AS A LANDMARK; BUILDINGS: INCLUSION ON LIST OF 
ENDANGERED STRUCTURES PROVIDES NO PROTECTION, BUT BOOSTS THOSE HOPING TO SAVE 
THE RESTAURANT CHAIN'S OLDEST SURVIVING DRIVE-IN. 
</P>

<P>
 The oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant, a red-and-white-tiled food stand 
in Downey that was boarded up and abandoned by the company in January, has been 
declared an endangered historical landmark by one of the nation's leading 
preservation organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, built in 1953 and originally operated by the McDonald brothers 
who founded the chain, was designated as one of America's 11 Most Endangered 
Historic Places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The listing provides no government protection for the Downey landmark, on the 
corner of Lakewood Boulevard and Florence Avenue, but up to $5,000 in trust 
grant money may be available to help launch a preservation drive, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust officials and local preservationists also hope the listing will again 
draw national media attention to the building, which is famed for Art Deco 
architectural features including a pair of golden arches that pierce the food 
stand's roof and a neon "Speedee" mascot that sits atop a nearby 60-foot perch. 
</P>
<P>
 Local preservationists announced the listing at a Wednesday morning news 
conference held at the restaurant site. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust describes the Downey restaurant as a cultural landmark that 
"symbolizes America's love affair with the automobile and the eye-catching 
vigor of roadside architecture." Unless plans change, the organization 
concludes, "an authentic icon of contemporary American life will be just a 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Councilwoman Joyce L. Lawrence, who frequented the food stand as a 
teen-ager in the 1950s, said the listing offered a needed boost to the efforts 
of city leaders and local preservationists. Saving the restaurant remains "a 
long shot," she said. "But my hopes are rising." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's officials shuttered the restaurant after it suffered damage in the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Before the quake, company officials had 
announced plans to close it, saying sales had slumped partly because it lacked 
modern amenities, including indoor seating and a drive-up window. 
</P>
<P>
 When McDonald's allowed its lease to expire in April, control of the 
restaurant site reverted to the property owner, auto parts retailer Pep Boys. 
Fred Stampone, a vice president of Pep Boys, said Wednesday that a Southern 
California McDonald's franchise operator had recently expressed interest in 
reopening the Downey building but apparently was unable to obtain a license 
from McDonald's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the situation is becoming dim," Stampone said. He said Pep Boys 
executives still hope the restaurant can be preserved or reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Brink, vice president of the trust, said Tuesday that the trust's 
written plea to McDonald's executives was answered with a form letter from the 
company's customer complaint department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Wednesday, McDonald's officials expressed no interest 
in reopening the Downey food stand, but suggested that the company may retrieve 
its "Speedee" sign and other historic elements for use in a new restaurant to 
be built in the city.

AROUND THE VALLEY: MAKING SIXTH SENSE OUT OF A BRUTAL DEATH IN THE URBAN WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like so many good mysteries, it began with a scream in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 A strange, keening moan awakened my wife after midnight recently at our house 
in the Santa Monica Mountains in Encino. I slept through it. 
</P>
<P>
 The crying went on, intensifying now and then into a sort of otherworldly, 
muffled scream. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife called a next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you hear that weird screaming? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, she did. It sounded like something in pain, but not a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 We have lots of animals up there near the Lake Encino reservoir. Our property 
borders a vast island of wild land that runs around the reservoir, up to 
Mulholland Drive, west to Woodland Hills and far south into Pacific Palisades.  
</P>
<P>
 Herds of deer appear in our yard almost nightly, lovable-looking, dopey-eyed 
pests that gobble expensive landscaping. Coyotes are as common as sparrows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canada geese that migrate into the Valley every year come honking home to 
the reservoir each winter night, in raucous bomber-formation Vs. (They were 
more interesting when I thought they came from the sub-Arctic, losing their 
glamour when researchers tracked them to Utah in the summer. Utah lacks the 
cachet of, say, Yellowknife or Tuktoyaktuk.) 
</P>
<P>
 A white wolf roamed the neighborhood a few years ago until the duly 
constituted authorities trapped it, discovered that it was being kept as a pet 
by a guy who let it wander, and deported it to a wolf gulag in Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Possums, tarantulas, rattlers. I expect to run into Marlin Perkins with a 
camera crew in my driveway some morning. 
</P>
<P>
 What I ran into that morning was my wife, telling me to "go outside and look 
around. Something horrible must have happened out there last night." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was that damned peacock." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone about a block away recently acquired a peacock or peahen. Not a wild 
creature, but an obnoxious pet. It looses blood-curdling shrieks every few 
minutes all day long, as if someone were wringing its neck, a notion I cherish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't. It was something else. And closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Into the urban wilderness at dawn, armed with a cup of instant coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't have to look far. 
</P>
<P>
 Upended in a water trap at the bottom of a cement drainage channel that runs 
down the steep hill behind my house was a doe. Or what was left of her. All of 
one haunch and part of the other had been ripped off. Blood and small chunks of 
flesh and fur were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck from the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation that came for 
the body was already loaded with the remains of creatures who had run into the 
animal world's equivalent of a drive-by shooting. Possums, squirrels, a small 
coyote. The doe would be the biggest creature on her last ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't look quite like a coyote kill, does it?" the wildlife hearse driver 
observed to Animal Regulation Officer Dennis Kroeplin. "They usually go in 
through the stomach, the softest parts." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be the cougar maybe," Kroeplin mused. "We'll have to get it out of 
there so I can see the neck before I can tell for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The cougar? 
</P>
<P>
 "A mountain lion?" I asked. "We don't have any mountain lions in Encino." 
</P>
<P>
 The dead-animal truck driver grinned. "Ohhhh yes you do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, I watch those wildlife shows on educational TV. I know that cougars -- 
pumas, mountain lions, catamounts, panthers, all the same animal -- are elusive 
creatures that need lots of wild land for a hunting range. Surely none live in 
a neighborhood where people are pestered by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kroeplin nodded. "There's been a cougar in this area, around Lake Encino 
and up over Mulholland since at least 1988 or 1989. Back in '89 I found a deer 
carcass that was obviously a cougar kill. I keep seeing its tracks ever since 
then, and I've tracked it a few times. I've never seen it, but I've talked to 
people in this neighborhood who have. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think this is a cougar kill. Look. There's a coyote track right 
there by the body." 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern in the hard, dry, tan dirt was barely visible, much less 
identifiable to me. But Kroeplin could read it like a billboard. 
</P>
<P>
 He climbed to the top of the hill and paced back and forth, like a detective 
at a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all right here," he said. "She was sleeping or resting right here, sort 
of trampled a little bed there. There was a coyote over here, stalking her." He 
pointed to the other side. "There were two more coyotes over here, probably 
downwind to keep from spooking her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the wide spacing on these prints. That coyote was running. He came 
charging in from one side, she took off that way and ran into the other two. 
One of them got a good bite out of her right over there, where you can see the 
first blood stain. Probably a hind leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "They chased her down the hill, attacking her. See the bloodstains all along 
here? She slipped on that concrete drainage channel and that was it, they were 
all over her." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a hell of a performance. Kroeplin had reconstructed the entire 
nighttime drama of killers and victim through his ability to see signs on the 
earth, a once-common ability that is a rare skill today. In the America of 
urban decay, Natty Bumppo lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't worry about that lion," Kroeplin said. "It's been back there for 
years and you didn't know it. You'll probably never see it. I never have. 
They're shy." 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't worried about the lion at all. My children are adults and live on the 
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 I was wondering if a cougar would find peacocks a taste treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

PERSPECTIVE ON HAITI; YES, WE CAN REBUILD THE COUNTRY; AFTER RESTORING 
ARISTIDE, BREAK THE DRUG LORDS' GRIP ON THE ECONOMY AND FOSTER THE RETURN OF 
LEGITIMATE COMMERCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nation-building is in the finest American tradition. Isn't that how we created 
the successful post World War II economy? Isn't that what MacArthur and the 
Marshall Plan did for Japan and Europe? Weren't the World Bank and the United 
Nations Development Program created not just to rebuild nations but to salvage 
a war-torn planet? Didn't Congress forswear partisan passion in the interest of 
a heroic effort to provide a stable global economy in the face of communism? If 
that was possible in the 1950s, why not now? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not resurrect our nation-building skills and our leadership in Haiti? 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Jean-Bertrand Aristide's election, a U.N. official remarked, 
"He is the only one the people trust. Everyone else has a price and will give 
in to the drug lords, and the drug money is probably double the total amount of 
aid coming into the government." The government received roughly $250 million 
in aid, while the drug cartel ran $700 million through the Haitian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get serious. Drugs through Haiti are a greater threat to American cities 
than Cuban communism has been since the missile crisis. It's time we recognize 
the total impact of Haiti's problems on crime in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The media characterizations of President Aristide haven't been fair. He 
shouldn't be branded emotionally unstable just because he refuses to abandon 
the mandate of 67% of the Haitian electorate. Aristide is not a politician -- 
or even particularly a democrat. He is a priest, educated in the Vatican and 
more fluent in Italian, Greek and Hebrew than English. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, remember, there were 14 other candidates with better organizations and 
funding and corporate and international support. The Bush Administration did 
nothing to help build an economy that would give the new government a chance to 
win over the middle class and the military. We have consistently lumped all 
anti-Aristide Haitians in the same basket and then set his government nakedly 
against that grouping. Nobody liked or trusted Aristide -- except the Haitian 
people. Shouldn't we honor that? Isn't that what democracy is all about? 
</P>
<P>
 If we want to export democracy, we must include economic development. We 
should initiate a pledging conference to challenge friends of freedom around 
the world to assist in building a viable Haitian economy -- one at least as 
strong as the drug trade. Democracy must include the prospect of economic 
growth in a free and fair market. It must be inclusive and afford opportunities 
for every sector of the society. It must also include an effort at 
reconciliation. The society must have reason to come together, with progress as 
its goal, rather than with retribution on its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 This cannot happen while drug money dominates the country and maybe the entire 
island, making boycotts and embargoes ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 We must plan a forceful return of the Aristide government, the government 
elected by the majority of Haitians. The orchestration and conditions of this 
"forceful return" should be carefully negotiated and agreed upon by the 
international community. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, we must create an alternative to the drug money before it can 
be eliminated. That alternative should come from private sources, with 
international guarantees, in forms that support the middle class. Such a 
serious commitment would free the middle class and the army from economic 
bondage to the drug lords.  
</P>
<P>
 It could also create the possibility for many well-trained Haitians to return 
from abroad with skills and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the military has been aligned with the drug lords and the 
Duvalierists in the police, the interest of the two groups can be separated. 
Drugs have poisoned the country by offering the easiest means of economic 
growth and forcing out legitimate commerce and business. A situation has been 
created that forces people to do whatever they have to do in order to survive. 
The commitment to the development of a legitimate economy, linked to world 
markets, would give the new government a chance to win over the middle class 
citizens needed to govern and administer Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these steps must be taken and a "conditional amnesty" for some must be 
arranged by the international community and the Aristide government as quickly 
as possible. Only then can a reconciliation between the people and the military 
be brought about. 
</P>
<P>
 This reconciliation will not be a capitulation to the forces of violence. It 
will be an appeal to the potential of good will, made generously by the world 
community and the Aristide government. It will be an offer of inclusion into a 
legitimate democracy and economy, made to those who are willing to live within 
a nation governed by law, rather than by violence and vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 It will probably be the first offer of peace and prosperity -- with justice -- 
ever made to the people of Haiti.

THEY'LL PLAY IT FAST AND TIGHT AT OPEN; GOLF: OAKMONT'S SLIPPERY GREENS AND 
NARROW FAIRWAYS MAKE IT "A VERY UNFRIENDLY COURSE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They're hard, they're fast and they're the color of Kermit the Frog's family 
portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the greens at Oakmont Country Club, where the 94th U.S. Open begins 
today in hot, humid weather guaranteed to curl your hair, stick your shirt to 
your back and make you feel as uncomfortable as possible while standing over a 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
 These aren't greens, they're pressure points. The last time anyone saw 
something this fast, they were waving a checkered flag at it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a little unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare himself for the Oakmont greens, Jim Gallagher Jr. had this idea: 
"I'm going home and practice putting by trying to roll the ball down the drain 
in my bath tub." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gary Hallberg: "Putting here is like playing pool in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 To the 159 golfers who begin their four-day march in search of the U.S. Open 
trophy, there is no question that the tournament will be won on the greens. 
That's true, but only if the tournament isn't lost getting there from the 
fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont's fairways are so narrow that most of the golfers put their drivers in 
their bags and use three-woods, two-irons or one-irons, thereby gaining in 
accuracy what they give up in distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Watson said Oakmont is going to take a heavy toll on the best golfers in 
the world this week, unless rain softens up the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unfriendly course," he said. "A lot of golfers are going to be 
embarrassed -- 95% of the field doesn't have a chance. There are going to be 
more scores in the 90s than the 60s." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a pretty picture, but then maybe Watson holds a grudge. He lost two 
major titles at Oakmont -- the 1978 PGA Championship and the 1983 U.S. Open -- 
on the back nine on the last day. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont's slippery, sloping greens and suffocatingly tight fairways with dense 
rough lurking nearby have got some players thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very, very difficult if we don't get rain," Fred Couples 
said. "These greens are virtually impossible from some spots. If they get hard, 
you are going to get to these spots all day long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to be above the pin. How are you going to stop the ball below 
the pin when it doesn't stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some bright spots. If Oakmont is deadly, at least it's going to 
be a pretty deadly. The U.S. Bureau of Forestry came up with $33,000 to plant 
annual flowers that are blooming at just the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 No foreign player has won the U.S. Open since David Graham of Australia in 
1981, but Greg Norman of Australia, Nick Faldo of England, Nick Price of 
Zimbabwe and Ernie Els of South Africa are considered contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo might have won an Open already, but he lost to Curtis Strange in an 
18-hole playoff in 1988 at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass. A victory at 
Oakmont won't be any easier, according to Faldo, mainly because of the greens. 
He stood on one green, he said, and felt oddly relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I thought at last, 'This is the flat one,' " he said. "I said, 'Where 
is the pin?' and someone told me, 'It is behind that hump in front, between the 
two ridges.' I said, 'Oh, fine, this is the flat one.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So, you know, they are brutal. There are a couple of them out there where you 
would be 31 feet from the hole and get 30 feet of break. And they are quick. I 
mean they are quite something." 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo said he considers Oakmont to be the most difficult U.S. Open venue of 
the seven he has played. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he will have done well if he gets the ball to stop within 15 feet 
of the hole. From there, putting will be an adventure. "If you don't get the 
speed right, you are going to be putting from eight to 10 feet on your return 
putts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nelson won the last Open at Oakmont in 1983, when there was a lot of 
grumbling about the length of the rough. It's five inches in most places, about 
an inch shorter than in '83, but still making it difficult to do anything other 
than knock it back out in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 The rough, Nelson said, is a great equalizer. "I don't care who you are if you 
are in the rough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman doesn't care what anybody says, his shot at winning the Open isn't that 
great. "Right now, my golf game is about a 4 1/2 on a scale of 10," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes at Oakmont, where optimism is in the bunker. It's the 
pessimist's Open, four days of groaning, 30-foot putts for par, ball-eating 
rough and balls that still haven't stopped rolling. U.S. Open at a Glance

WORLD CUP '94: 1 DAY AND COUNTING; KEEPING THE FAITH; FANS AREN'T SURE WHAT TO 
MAKE OF ITALY'S ROBERTO BAGGIO, A SOFT-SPOKEN BUDDHIST WHO IS THE BEST PLAYER 
IN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Is Roberto Baggio's value as a soccer player enough to justify a two-day riot? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of philosophical question that Baggio the man would enjoy 
turning over. But at the moment, Baggio, Europe's best soccer player, is 
repulsed by the memories of what he, indirectly, wrought. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio is one of the world's most charismatic and intriguing players, and also 
one of the most misunderstood. Baggio is preparing for his second World Cup, 
and Italy's considerable hopes in the monthlong tournament starting Friday are 
resting on this reserved 27-year-old athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 While Baggio is recognized as one of the world's best players, his reticence 
about embracing his celebrity and his ambivalence on the concept of fame have 
soccer fans puzzled. Baggio is so different from other stars that this 
difference creates more fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The agony for the Italian public is to know that its love is spent on an icon 
that neither seeks adulation nor much acknowledges it. Baggio is an infuriating 
superstar. The three sponsors his IMG agent does allow into the endorsement 
fold want more out of the private man. The fans wish only that he dedicate 
every lovely goal to them by racing to the edge of the field and saluting them 
rather than jogging back to his place in midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio allows no one that power. He learned the full scope of the fickle 
nature of fans after he was sold by Fiorentina of Florence to its bitter rival, 
Juventus of Turin. It was in May of 1990, just as the Italian World Cup team 
was assembling in a suburb of Florence and Baggio had been sold for a 
then-record transfer of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiorentina needed the money, but the sale of its most popular player was more 
than most fans were able to bear. When news of the transfer reached Fiorentina 
fans, the club's offices were besieged by an angry, brick-throwing mob. Riot 
police succeeded in dispersing the crowd only after it had been thoroughly 
tear-gassed. The fans returned the next day and resumed their violent vigil. 
The toll over two days: 50 injured. 
</P>
<P>
 That was only in Florence. The Italian World Cup team opened its training camp 
in nearby Coverciano. The first day, about 2,000 Fiorentina fans confronted 
Baggio and four other national team players from Juventus. The crowd taunted 
the four players and demanded that Baggio tear up his new contract. The 
incident was interrupted when Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini sent the players to 
the showers early. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day it was worse. The mob had grown to 5,000, and the invasion of the 
team's practice caused the president of the Italian Soccer Federation to take 
the unpopular step of closing all future practices to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 For Baggio, being in the middle of the storm was awful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it was the end of months of tension where things were never 
really clarified and people hoped I would stay in Florence," Baggio said while 
relaxing recently in an office at the Juventus training center just south of 
Turin. "Suddenly, when I was sold, people felt betrayed by me and the team and 
reacted badly. When it was happening, I couldn't believe it was happening to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio may have spared himself the further attentions of Fiorentina fans with 
his subdued performance in the World Cup the next month. After scoring what 
many believed to be the most beautiful goal of the tournament, against 
Czechoslovakia, Baggio was used only sparingly. By the time Italy worked 
through to the semifinals, Baggio was benched for the game against Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy was knocked out in that game. The high hopes of Italian fans were shot 
down, and they took their frustration out on the team, saying it took too much 
for granted. Others said Italy should have been able to take better advantage 
of playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big, big disappointment," Baggio said. "Everybody said we were 
convinced we would reach the final. The World Cup is full of surprises. 
Sometimes having the crowd with you and playing at home doesn't mean anything. 
Because the man who thinks everything is against him will concentrate better." 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio's performance in the World Cup was not so much a disappointment as an 
enigma. His potential was easy to see, but seldom did he deliver on it fully. 
Neither pure striker nor strictly a midfielder, Baggio is a playmaker who does 
best when allowed to roam from the back in a supporting role and forward on the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 This freedom is not easily bestowed by coaches and not readily understood by 
fans. Because of his unconventional combination of skills, Baggio often 
disappoints. Coupled with his unusual life choices, Baggio presents an odd face 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And that public is often cruel. Baggio's transfer to Juventus took nearly a 
year to set. Six months after he was sold, Juventus played Fiorentina at 
Florence. Fiorentina went ahead by a goal, but Baggio was fouled for a penalty 
kick. As he was also the team's designated penalty-taker, Baggio was expected 
to take the kick, but refused. Teammate Gigi De Agostini's shot was saved, and 
minutes later, Baggio was taken out of the game. As he left the field, Baggio 
stooped to pick up a Fiorentina scarf a fan had thrown, incensing the Juventus 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his gesture, Baggio was mercilessly booed by Fiorentina fans -- 
traditional behavior toward former crowd favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the players who left Fiorentina had always had the same treatment," 
Baggio said. "I didn't expect that I wouldn't get the same treatment. 
Unfortunately, that's how it is. You are a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio coped with the controversy by finding solace in his Buddhist religion, 
further infuriating an overwhelmingly Catholic populace. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stories have been written attributing Baggio's conversion to Buddhism to 
a period in his life when he underwent three surgeries on his right knee. 
Baggio missed two years, and many wrote off his chances of returning to 
professional soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories share a similar overwrought theme: man facing his own mortality 
turns to God. Baggio dismisses the approach as a need for others to rationalize 
his unusual choice. For some Italians, Baggio's leaving Catholicism was yet 
another display of his disappointing nonconformist behavior, which includes his 
insistence on wearing a ponytail. Why couldn't he be as they wanted him to be? 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has created problems for me (about Buddhism)," Baggio said of his 
conversion in the late 1980s. "I felt it really deeply. I read and studied. I 
realized that the key thing is to be at peace with myself. It really helps a 
lot not to be burned by the profession.  
</P>
<P>
 "In Buddhism, you have to believe in yourself. You don't believe that 
something external guides your life -- basically, it's you. You understand your 
defects. You learn to be happy. Everyone wants to find internal happiness, no 
matter the religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio tries not to draw attention to his beliefs, but he does carry a 
reminder on the field. In place of the usual armband that each team's captain 
must wear, Baggio wears an armband given to him by his Japanese Buddhist 
master, Daisaku Ikeda. Written in Japanese characters, it reads: "We must win." 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that Baggio's soccer playing is aided by Buddhism, the Italian 
public appears to be tolerant of his choice. Baggio remains an inaccessible 
star with unfathomable ideas and unconventional approaches. Finally, he is at 
peace with both his life and his fans' expectations. Soccer is important, but 
it is not everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddhism helps me to be happy inside," he said. "Anytime I am happy inside . 
. . anything you do is better. Buddhism isn't about the game, only. One day 
football is going to be over. Life is more important." Profile

JIM MURRAY: MAD MAX PART OF MAD, MAD SPORTS WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A peculiar thing happened the other night as I was watching television and I 
saw a Houston basketball player, go ballistic in the runway between the court 
and the locker room to which he had been banished after a second technical 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell seemed to be bashing everyone who got in his way down the corridor, 
and I was kind of glad there weren't any women and children in his path. 
</P>
<P>
 But something clicked, and I seemed to recall Maxwell had other troubles in 
the recent past. So, I went back in my stacks to retrieve any recent publicity 
about the Rocket guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, there it was: 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston Rockets guard Vernon Maxwell showed anything but remorse in a Houston 
court a day after his third arrest in 20 months. Maxwell was charged with 
illegally carrying a weapon in his car after being arrested and jailed for 
several hours Tuesday after a traffic incident near the arena. In court, 
Maxwell stared at the arresting officer and said: 'Are you happy now that you 
got on TV?' Though prosecutors asked Judge Sherman Ross to admonish Maxwell, 
the judge took no action, saying he didn't hear the remark." 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting. Mad Max of the hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 But what also intrigued me was that in the research on the Maxwell case, I 
kept running across repeated instances of other sports heroes acting as role 
models for our society. Mad Max is not alone. For instance, here are a few of 
his co-role models in the recent past: 
</P>
<P>
 "WEST POINT, N.Y. -- Army fullback Akili King was recovering from stab wounds 
after he and four other men, three of them West Point cadets and athletes, took 
part in a street fight outside a bar in Newburgh, N.Y. King, a sophomore, was 
stabbed early Sunday in the chest just below his heart. James Ray, former Army 
player, was stabbed in the thighs and buttocks." 
</P>
<P>
 "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Florida State kicker Scott Bentley was fined $500 and 
sentenced to 40 hours on a road crew after pleading no contest to charges of 
illegally taping a sexual encounter with a female student." 
</P>
<P>
 "LINCOLN, Neb. -- Abdul Muhammad, a Nebraska running back from Compton, 
Calif., was pushed through a first-floor window during a fight in a motel in 
Lincoln. Another Nebraska football player, redshirt freshman Ramone Worthy, was 
stabbed during a party at the same hotel. Police are investigating an unnamed 
Nebraska defensive back for a shooting incident that also occurred and left two 
bullet holes in the rear panel of a car." 
</P>
<P>
 "EUGENE, Ore. -- Three former University of Washington athletes were convicted 
of third-degree sex abuse here. Defensive end Charles Douglas Barnes, 20, of 
Carson, Calif., and starting wide receiver Jason Paul Shelley, 19, of Vallejo, 
Calif., and point guard Prentiss Lavell Perkins were charged with groping a 
University of Oregon student in a dormitory room and stealing a piece of 
jewelry. Shelley and Perkins were suspended for other incidents after other 
arrests last fall." 
</P>
<P>
 "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Guard Paul O'Liney was suspended from the University of 
Missouri's first basketball game against Navy after pleading guilty to 
misdemeanor assault. O'Liney, who is averaging 9.4 points in a reserve role, 
was arrested in a downtown nightclub for punching a woman in the face. Coach 
Norm Stewart said the guard would be suspended for 'at least one game' and he 
was. One." 
</P>
<P>
 "BUENOS AIRES -- Soccer star Diego Maradona appeared in court to face 
accusations of shooting at journalists with a compressed-air rifle. At least 
five reporters were injured when they were hit by pellets from the gun. 
Maradona, 33, has acknowledged firing at reporters and photographers outside 
his home but did not comment. The hearing was closed." 
</P>
<P>
 "CINCINNATI -- Former Louisville basketball player Troy Smith was charged with 
voluntary manslaughter in the death of his girlfriend in a domestic dispute 
here. Police said that Kelly Dwyer, 20, died of a head injury suffered when she 
was 'body-slammed' to the floor by the 6-foot-8, 240-pound Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 "BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Six Hartford Whalers hockey players must complete 20 hours 
of community service for getting into a fight at a nightclub owned by Buffalo 
Bills quarterback Jim Kelly. Arrested were Pat Verbeek, Geoffrey Sanderson, 
Marc Potvin, Chris Pronger, Mark Janssen and Todd Harkins, along with assistant 
coach Kevin McCarthy." 
</P>
<P>
 "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Kamari Charlton, a sophomore football player for Florida 
State, was jailed and charged with sexual battery after voluntarily coming to 
police for questioning. The alleged assault occurred May 12 after Charlton had 
helped a female acquaintance move into a new apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Tony Evans, a high school wide receiver from Orlando, 
recruited to play at Auburn, was charged with first-degree murder in an 
apparently drug-related shooting. Evans is accused of shooting an acquaintance 
twice in the back of the head." 
</P>
<P>
 "EDMOND, Okla. -- Senior cornerback Thomas King III of Central Oklahoma 
Univesity was charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in 
connection with a shooting outside an Edmond apartment May 19." 
</P>
<P>
 "CINCINNATI -- Former NFL and Ohio State Rose Bowl quarterback Art Schlichter 
was indicted on charges he stole more than $50,000 from a suburban Cincinnati 
bank and two individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 "NEW YORK -- Nebraska defensive back Tyrone Williams, 20, was charged with two 
felonies for violating the state drive-by shooting law by firing at least two 
shots Sunday from a 22-caliber handgun at a car that carried New York Jets 
safety Kevin Porter and a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "RIVERSIDE -- The Riverside County District Attorney's office will not 
prosecute members of the UC Riverside women's basketball team in connection 
with a fight March 8. Former Riverside players Jennifer Newsome and Monica 
Vargas were engaged in a scuffle with several team members at a restaurant near 
the school. Vargas sustained a concussion and filed charges against team member 
Tawanna Terry." 
</P>
<P>
 The foregoing is only a partial list. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what is going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a Florida football coach, David Villano, in a letter to the editor, 
thinks he can guess. "The blame lies with the role models of today's youth," he 
writes. "Pro basketball players who degrade opponents with expletive-filled 
trash talk; college football players who taunt fallen opponents; coaches who 
run up and down the sidelines berating officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Merriwell would be appalled. We root for the bullies today. We glorify 
the scofflaws, admire arrogance, exalt egotism. No wonder the athletes think 
they can get away with any kind of antisocial behavior. They're the new 
royalty. No wonder they act like Louis XIV.

RANGERS NOW KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE; HOCKEY: IT'S A TOUCHING SCENE DURING 
VICTORY CELEBRATION AS PLAYERS GET THEIR HANDS ON STANLEY CUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They passed the Stanley Cup lovingly from hand to hand, its weight 
feather-light to the New York Rangers in their joy at finally winning hockey's 
elusive prize. 
</P>
<P>
 From team captain Mark Messier it went to Kevin Lowe, the Rangers' 
second-oldest player. From Lowe to Brian Leetch, winner of the Conn Smythe 
Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. From Leetch to Adam Graves, 
who set a club record this season with 52 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then from Graves it went to Jay Wells, whose gap-toothed grin stretched from 
one end of Madison Square Garden to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea what to do with it," said Wells, a former King. "All I was 
trying to do was not drop it, not trip on the (television) wires. And the 
emotion just gets all wrapped up and you don't know what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 15 years that I've seen the Cup in pictures, but I've never touched 
it, never even come close to it. . . . I've seen (Stanley Cup) rings, but I've 
never put one on my finger. Until we won it ourselves, I wasn't going to touch 
the Cup. When I touched it, it was a sweet feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, who played on five Cup-winning teams with the Edmonton Oilers, said: 
"Now, the Ranger organization has a Stanley Cup. Now, Brian Leetch has a 
Stanley Cup and he's experienced. Now, Mike Richter is experienced. Now Alex 
(Kovalev) is experienced. Now, these guys can carry the torch. These guys can 
get the machine going and hopefully turn out more." 
</P>
<P>
 They ought to be good at carrying torches, since they seem to be good at 
playing with fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension between Coach Mike Keenan and General Manager Neil Smith was 
obvious, despite the champagne-soaked haze of Tuesday night's Cup celebration. 
Keenan hugged Messier at center ice for several long moments, and the players 
hugged each other, but not once did Keenan embrace Smith. When Smith approached 
the podium at the end of Keenan's postgame news conference, Keenan walked off, 
avoiding even a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the controversy that surrounded Keenan after it was reported he had 
verbally agreed to take a job with the Red Wings, Smith said nothing for 
quotation about wanting his coach to stay. Their relationship, never warm, 
might have been ruined by Keenan's hesitancy to stop the rumors -- and by 
Smith's public reflection of his private unease at working with Keenan, whom 
Smith believed was trying to encroach on his territory. 
</P>
<P>
 One or the other might be gone, perhaps before the last cheer echoes through 
Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes in the parade scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, though, the Rangers appear more stable. Leetch, 26, has developed 
into an outstanding two-way defenseman. Richter, 27, blossomed under the 
responsibility of being the team's starting goaltender and ranks among the 
NHL's best. Graves, 26, is signed to a long-term contract. Defenseman Sergei 
Zubov, 23, shows exceptional puck-handling ability and boundless promise. 
</P>
<P>
 A few pieces will be replaced. Right wing Glenn Anderson will probably retire 
or play in Europe, and it's questionable whether Lowe, who has many ice miles 
on him at 35, can keep his place as one of the top four defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The runner-up Vancouver Canucks face a similar tinkering process, rather than 
rebuilding. Their core players -- goaltender Kirk McLean, center Trevor Linden, 
two-time 60-goal scorer Pavel Bure -- are also young and haven't hit their 
prime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rangers weren't thinking about the future yet. They were too busy 
enjoying the triumph that ended 54 years of misery. As one fan's sign 
proclaimed: "Now I can die happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Messier said: "I was a little frustrated throughout the playoffs because I 
read some stories that we had to win this year or we'd never win. I look at 
every position and I see superstars." Dry Spells 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers won their first Stanley Cup since 1940 by defeating the 
Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 on Tuesday night. A look at other teams with

GIANTS RELEASE SIMMS; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM CITES SALARY CAP, PLAYER'S AGE AND 
INJURY. QUARTERBACK SAYS HE'S ANGRY, WON'T RETIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new NFL salary cap has felled its first giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Giants released Pro Bowl quarterback Phil Simms on Wednesday, 
citing problems fitting his $2.5-million salary under the $34.6-million salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision sent shock waves through the league, beginning with Simms, who 
was summoned to Coach Dan Reeves' office earlier this week. He stormed out 
after hearing the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he wanted me to autograph some balls for charity or something," 
Simms said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Club co-owner Wellington Mara also disagreed with the decision. "This is a day 
of overwhelming sadness for me," Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision leaves the Giants with untested third-year quarterbacks Dave 
Brown and Kent Graham. They have thrown one touchdown pass combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms, 38, threw for 184 touchdown passes in his 15-year Giant career, the 
most in franchise history and one of 15 club passing records he holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen of those touchdown passes were thrown last season when he led the 
Giants to an 11-5 record and a playoff appearance while being named to the Pro 
Bowl for the second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 He is best remembered for completing a record 88% of his passes in the Super 
Bowl after the 1986 season, earning most-valuable-player honors while leading 
the Giants to a 39-20 victory over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials cited his age and a shoulder tear that required surgery in 
March as factors contributing to the release. Doctors have told the Giants that 
Simms will not be ready for training camp next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of a lot of things," said Giant Coach Dan Reeves, 
carefully adhering to the commissioner's rule against criticizing the cap. 
"Contract, age and injury were all taken into consideration, and we weren't 
ready to take that gamble right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say this is another example of the salary cap eroding the fabric that 
has made football the nation's top spectator sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, agent for several quarterbacks, including Brown, said: "This 
caps a stunning year of veteran quarterback movement. A salary cap, so far, has 
meant quarterback instability." 
</P>
<P>
 Simms, who was given the option of retiring, said he asked for his release 
instead. He did not rule out signing with another team. An obvious possibility 
exists in New England, where he could play for his former coach, Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've decided not to retire," Simms told reporters. "I'll make that decision 
(about another team) in a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Simms and recently retired Lawrence Taylor, the Giants figure to 
be an NFL power. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they thought that not having Phil Simms would keep them from a successful 
season, they wouldn't have done this," said John Wooten, the Philadelphia 
Eagles' director of player personnel.

AFTER WEIGHING HIS PERFORMANCE, CLIPPERS BID WILLIAMS GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers have given up on forward John Williams, announcing Wednesday that 
they will not exercise the option on his contract for next season. Williams, 
who was due to earn $1.5 million in 1994-95, becomes an unrestricted free 
agent, and the Clippers can sign another player with Williams' 1993-94 salary 
slot of $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' weight problem has jeopardized his NBA career. He ballooned to 330 
pounds last summer, was suspended and sent to a weight-loss clinic at Duke in 
October. Williams, who lost nearly 60 pounds, also lost $563,414.62 because of 
the 42-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was inconsistent after being activated Feb. 4, averaging 3.7 
rebounds, 2.9 assists and a career-low 5.6 points in 34 games. He reportedly 
weighed 294 pounds at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired from the Washington Bullets for the draft rights to former UCLA 
forward Don MacLean and backup center William Bedford on Oct. 8, 1992, Williams 
averaged 6.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 109 games as a Clipper.

 MacLean was voted the NBA's most-improved player last season, boosting his 
scoring average from 6.6 points to a team-high 18.2. He also plays the 
Clippers' weakest position, small forward. CHRIS BAKER

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STARTING PITCHING IS NOT THE PROBLEM

 Dodger starting pitchers have the fourth-best earned-run average in baseball. 
Their 3.90 earned-run average ranked behind Atlanta (2.91), Montreal (3.56) and 
San Francisco (3.68), before Wednesday's games.They lead the majors in complete 
games with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back to the spring, the Dodgers' major question appeared to be the 
starting pitchers. Kevin Gross was slowed because of tendinitis, Pedro Astacio 
by heart tests and Ramon Martinez appeared to be struggling. But Fred Claire, 
executive vice president, continued to state his confidence in the starting 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff is doing a great job," Claire said. "The complete games have not 
only been complete, but they have been pitched super. Ramon Martinez is 
throwing as well as he was a few years ago and Pedro Astacio has better command 
and Orel (Hershiser) is throwing great. So is Tom Candiotti and Gross." 
</P>

 The Dodgers lead the majors with 16 of the 25 players on the roster having 
started their careers with the organization. Minnesota is second with 14 
players and Toronto has 13. In the National League, St. Louis and Houston are 
next with 12 each. . . . Roberto Duran, a left-handed pitcher at Class-A 
Bakersfield, struck out 16 batters in eight innings last week and had an ERA of 
1.04. . . . Left-fielder Billy Ashley is batting .336 with 14 home runs, 45 
runs batted in and 23 walks at triple-A Albuquerque. MARYANN HUDSON

 Baseball players and their agents say the owners' proposal, which contains a 
demand for a salary cap, won't deter a strike."I hope it doesn't happen, but my 
gut feeling is that it will," Tony Gwynn of the Padres said. The union's

THE FOOT THAT FITS THE GOLDEN BOOT; THERE ARE NO SHOO-INS, AS ANY STRIKER FROM 
ASPRILLA TO ZAGUINHO COULD WALK AWAY WITH TROPHY AS CUP'S LEADING GOAL-SCORER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1990, it was the wild eyes, the outstretched arms, the joyous celebrations 
of Italy's Salvatore (Toto) Schillaci that fired the fans' imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, it was the smooth skills, the fluid motion, the calm demeanor and the 
deadly finishing of England's Gary Lineker that won their applause. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, it was Italy's Paolo Rossi who captured their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, it was Argentina's Mario Kempes who grabbed their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Every World Cup has had its leading goal-scorer, the player who finds the back 
of the net more often than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he is already famous, like West Germany's Gerd Muller in 1970 or 
Portugal's Eusebio in 1966. Other times he is a relatively unknown player who 
suddenly is thrust into the international spotlight, like Poland's Grzegorz 
Lato in 1974 or Yugoslavia's Drazen Jerkovic in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, he is the man with the golden boot, the player goalkeepers come to 
fear more than any other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 64-year history of the World Cup, 16 players have had the honor of 
being the tournament's top marksman. There have been only 14 tournaments, but 
three players tied for the award in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those 16, one name stands out: Just Fontaine, who was born in Morocco 
but played for France, scored an astonishing 13 goals in the 1958 World Cup in 
Sweden. It is a record that seems unlikely to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dark, sturdily built, a fast and determined runner with excellent 
acceleration and a fine shot" -- that's how English journalist Brian Glanville 
described Fontaine in his book, "The History of the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Look at that description again. It takes more than the ability to strike the 
ball hard and accurately to be a world-class goal-scorer. One has to be tough, 
durable and able to withstand the furious onslaught of the world's best 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 One also has to be fast, not only fleet of foot but quick-thinking. Some 
strikers are described as "instinctive," but more often there is considerable 
guile and cunning in their makeup. Lineker, for example, used to "hide" behind 
defenders, according to Denmark's Kent Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like chess than soccer against him," Nielsen said. "He's always 
hiding behind a defender. He never does much until you suddenly realize that 
he's done exactly enough, and by then it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Lineker, now playing in Japan, was the Golden Boot winner as top scorer of the 
1986 World Cup in Mexico with six goals. Six, in fact, seems to be the magic 
number needed. Each of the four most recent winners -- Schillaci, Lineker, 
Rossi and Kempes -- had that many. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days of Muller, "Der Bomber," who scored a record 14 World Cup 
goals, including 10 in the 1970 tournament in Mexico. Or of Fontaine, and 
Hungary's Sandor Kocsis, with 11 in 1954. Nowadays, scoring a half-dozen goals 
is likely to be enough to be proclaimed the world's top striker. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who are the candidates to become the goal-scoring hero of 1994? Which of 
the many first-class forwards who have come to the United States will emerge as 
the tournament's top marksman during the next month? 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in alphabetical order, are 10 of the players with a very good chance: 
</P>
<P>
 LUIS ROBERTO ALVES (MEXICO) 
</P>
<P>
 Better known as Zaguinho, this tall, left-footed striker made Mexican soccer 
history when he scored a national team-record seven goals in a 9-0 rout of 
Martinique during the 1993 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament, which Mexico won. His 
dribbling skills and shooting ability make him a threat from almost anywhere, 
although he prefers the left side. Zaguinho, 27, was nicknamed in honor of his 
Brazilian father, Zague, who played for many years in the Mexican League. If 
Mexico does well, Zaguinho could be the star of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 FAUSTINO ASPRILLA (COLOMBIA) 
</P>
<P>
 How popular is Asprilla, 24, in his native land? Well, one Colombian radio 
station keeps reporters permanently in Italy and carries live commentary on 
every match played by his club, Parma. The Italian team paid $4 million to 
acquire Asprilla from Atletico Nacional in 1992. He has exceptional speed, a 
deadly shot and an unpredictable temperament. His scoring was instrumental in 
helping Parma win the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1993 and reach the final 
again this year. One of nine children, he was born in poverty-stricken Tulua, 
near Cali. According to no less an authority than Portugal's Eusebio, Asprilla 
has "all the qualities necessary to become a world-class star." 
</P>
<P>
 GABRIEL BATISTUTA (ARGENTINA) 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken striker from Reconquista, a rural town in the province of 
Santa Fe, says he wants to emulate Mario Kempes, whose six goals propelled 
Argentina to its first World Cup triumph in 1978. The 25-year-old, now playing 
for Fiorentina in Italy, has all of the credentials. He was the top scorer in 
the 1991 Copa America in Chile and scored both goals in the final against 
Mexico in the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador. Batistuta has 18 goals in 28 
internationals. "Scoring a goal is just the best feeling for a striker," he 
said. "But it's difficult to describe." 
</P>
<P>
 BEBETO (BRAZIL) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he turned 30 this year, Bebeto remains one of the world's top 
forwards. Two seasons ago, he was the leading scorer in Spain with 29 goals for 
Deportivo la Coruna, the club he joined after leaving Vasco da Gama. He had the 
distinction of scoring against every Spanish First Division club except one. 
This season, he again ranked among the league's scoring leaders. He is small 
and seemingly frail, but opponents have learned just how strong and elusive he 
is. His ball-control skills are second to none, some of them having been taught 
to him by the great Zico. Bebeto scored five of Brazil's 20 goals in World Cup 
qualifying play. 
</P>
<P>
 DENNIS BERGKAMP (NETHERLANDS) 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit and all the rest, it is Bergkamp at 
whose feet Holland's future lies. Widely proclaimed to be the next great Dutch 
star, Bergkamp this season made the move from Ajax Amsterdam to the rarefied 
atmosphere of Italy's first division. He and Internazionale of Milan took some 
time to hit it off, but the Dutch striker won his place in the fans' hearts by 
helping the team win the UEFA Cup, salvaging an otherwise forgettable season. 
Bergkamp was discovered as a teen-ager by none other than Johan Cruyff and 
learned the ropes with Cruyff's old club, Ajax, where he played alongside Van 
Basten. Bergkamp averaged 25 goals a season for three years in Holland before 
moving south. At 25, he is ready to show his ability to score more than a goal 
every other game for the national team is no fluke. He has superb skills, and 
his finishing touch is second to none. Confidence to perform on the largest 
stage might be his only weakness at the moment, but the World Cup should cure 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 ILIE DUMITRESCU (ROMANIA) 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow of Gheorghe Hagi has lain across the Romanian team for quite a 
while, but in the past year or so Dumitrescu has emerged as a player who can 
steal some of the attention from his more illustrious teammate. Like Bergkamp, 
Dumitrescu is 25 and has tremendous technique. His goals are often spectacular, 
and he has been scoring them with greater frequency of late. The Steaua 
Bucharest star has collected nine goals in Romania's last seven matches and 
looks certain to be signed by a wealthier club, perhaps in Italy, if his World 
Cup goes according to plan. His partner in the Romanian attack, Florin 
Raducioiu, already plays for AC Milan. Between them, Dumitrescu and Raducioiu 
scored 12 of Romania's 29 goals in its qualifying campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 JUERGEN KLINSMANN (GERMANY) 
</P>
<P>
 Not many players have enjoyed as much success as Klinsmann, whose quickness, 
control and finishing ability make him perhaps the most lethal weapon in the 
German arsenal. His honors speak for themselves: World Cup winner in 1990; UEFA 
Cup winner in 1991; top scorer in the Bundesliga in 1988; Olympic Games bronze 
medalist in '88; German player of the year in '88. He has achieved fame and 
fortune in three countries -- Germany, Italy and most recently France, where he 
plays for AS Monaco. He is said to be heading back to Italy on a two-year, 
$1.5-million contract with Sampdoria after the World Cup. At 29, he is still at 
the peak of his game. Not bad for a baker's son from Stuttgart. 
</P>
<P>
 ROMARIO (BRAZIL) 
</P>
<P>
 Having had to deal with the kidnaping and subsequent release of his father in 
Rio de Janeiro earlier this year, Romario has dedicated himself anew to the 
sport. "The only way I can repay the Brazilian people for all the support they 
gave me is by scoring goals and helping to win the World Cup," he said. He is 
certainly in form to do so, having just inherited Bebeto's Spanish League 
scoring title by accumulating 30 goals for league champion Barcelona. Romario, 
a silver medalist in the 1988 Olympics in which he was the top scorer with 
seven goals, helped PSV Eindhoven win three Dutch championships before he moved 
to Spain for $4 million. Recalled to the Brazilian team for the final World Cup 
qualifying game against Uruguay, he scored both goals in a 2-0 victory that 
purchased Brazil's ticket to the World Cup. His left foot is his main weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 HRISTO STOICHKOV (BULGARIA) 
</P>
<P>
 For three consecutive years, Stoichkov was Bulgaria's player of the year. But 
it was not until the volatile striker was lured to Spain by Barcelona that he 
achieved worldwide fame. Since Stoichkov joined the club, Barcelona has won 
four Spanish championships in a row, with their Bulgarian star a key 
contributor to each one. In frequent trouble with referees because of his 
explosive temper, the 28-year-old nonetheless has sublime skills. He can set up 
goals, as he does for Bulgaria, or score them, as he does for Barcelona. In the 
1990-91 season, he scored 38 goals. No one in Europe did better. Two seasons 
ago, he banged in 20. This season, while teaming up front with Brazil's 
Romario, who led the Spanish League with 30 goals, Stoichkov still was able to 
score 16. Strangely, he has not done as well for the national team, but 
Bulgaria is confident Stoichkov will remedy that in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 RACHIDI YEKINI (NIGERIA) 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Yekini could have been a huge star, as big as if not bigger 
than Cameroon's Roger Milla. But because Nigeria lost its final qualifying game 
to Cameroon when a tie would have been enough to send it to Italy, it was 
Milla, not Yekini, who achieved stardom in Italia '90. Now, Yekini, 30, has one 
last chance to grab the global spotlight. He is ready, judging by his 
performance at the African Nations' Cup in Tunisia in March. He finished as the 
championship's top goal-scorer with five goals as Nigeria won the title. 
Earlier, he had recorded eight of Nigeria's 17 goals in its World Cup 
qualifying campaign. And before that, he had been the leading scorer at the 
1992 African Nations Cup in Ivory Coast. Tall and powerfully built, he is 
unafraid of opposing defenders, which helped him become the top striker in the 
Portuguese League this season with 21 goals for Vitoria Setubal. He deservedly 
was voted Africa's player of the year for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a dozen or more other strikers of outstanding ability taking part in 
World Cup '94. Defending champion Germany, for example, also has Karlheinz 
Riedle and Rudi Voeller. Italy has Giuseppe Signori, the leading scorer in the 
Italian League in each of the last two seasons. In addition to Batistuta, 
Argentina can count on the services of Abel Balbo and Claudio Caniggia, if the 
latter can recover his form after a yearlong ban for cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland's Stephane Chapuisat and Adrian Knup make up one of the deadliest 
duos in the tournament. Another team with a fierce 1-2 punch is Sweden, which 
boasts Martin Dahlin and Tomas Brolin. Then there are Belgium's Josip Weber, 
Colombia's Adolfo Valencia, Spain's Julio Salinas, Russia's Sergei Yuran and a 
host of others. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this could be a high-scoring World Cup. Italia '90 produced an 
average of 2.21 goals a game, the lowest in the event's history. But with the 
talent available in 1994, that figure easily could be improved on. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, even the tournament's mascot is named Striker.

 Alan Rothenberg, chief organizer of the World Cup's U.S. edition, borrowed 
from Abraham Lincoln to assure officials of FIFA, soccer's world governing 
body, that the game has found a home in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening of the 49th Congress of FIFA on Wednesday in Chicago, 
Rothenberg said, "We want the people of the United States to embrace this 
beautiful game," adding that "we are at the threshold of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, quoting from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, he said that "people will 
little note nor long remember what we say here, but they will not forget what 
they did here." 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates from 190 nations began a two-day meeting at which most of the issues 
already are decided. The highlight will be today's re-election -- unopposed and 
probably unanimous -- of Joao Havelange to a sixth term as FIFA president.

<P>
 In Chicago, Fair Play Awards, designed by FIFA to promote sportsmanship and 
abolish rough tactics, went to Nandor Hidegkuti, the Hungarian coach, player 
and administrator; and the Zambian soccer federation, which almost qualified 
for the World Cup with a team put together in weeks after the national team was 
killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Order of Merit, FIFA's highest individual award, went to 10 people, 
including Gene Edwards of the United States and Norway's Gunn Nyborg for 
promoting women's soccer.

 Chicago, which had greeted the event with a yawn earlier in the week, showed a 
little World Cup fever with a parade that featured festive native garb, 
mariachi musicians and soccer players dribbling balls up a street lined with 
thousands of viewers in an eclectic mix of languages and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest Chicagoans forget about the American football that will remain when World 
Cup leaves, the grand marshal was former Bear star Walter Payton.

 Visions of the World Cup generating $4 billion in the United States are 
vanishing.

 "I absolutely believed it was going to be the equivalent of nine Super Bowls 
-- much bigger than the Olympics," said Bob Solomon, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Dakin Inc., a national purveyor of plush toys, key rings, 
figurines and mugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But while orders from big airports, duty-free shops and some hotels were 
encouraging, World Cup merchandise is in fewer than 5,000 stores nationwide, 
about 25% of the number of stores that carry "Flintstones" or "Jurassic Park" 
merchandise. The bottom line is sales of $5 million, one-fifth as much as 
during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

 Colombia is the clear favorite to win Group A, which includes the United 
States. With the wizardry of midfielder Carlos Valderrama, the scoring prowess 
of forward Faustino Asprilla and the goalkeeping of Oscar Cordoba, the team is 
considered capable of winning the title. Colombia lines up in what appears to 
be a 4-2-2-2 to take advantage of the talents of Valderrama and Asprilla.

WORLD CUP WEATHER BECOMES HOT TOPIC; SOCCER: TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY EXPECTED 
TO AFFECT PLAY AT MANY OF THE NINE VENUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Remember the way Johnny Carson used to set up his audience by saying something 
like, "Today, it was so hot . . . ," and the audience would shout back, "How 
hot was it?" and Carson would be off and rolling with a string of hot-weather 
humor? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's no joke to the World Cup folks. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chicago and several other locations around the nation where the teams and 
fans have gathered, one topic was on everyone's mind Wednesday as temperatures 
soared into the 90s, often with humidity to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the heat/humidity going to ruin the soccer? 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the 52 World Cup matches, starting with Friday's opener 
here between Germany and Bolivia, are being played in the early afternoon to 
accommodate European television. That's fine for armchair potatoes in Brussels 
and Bonn, but what about the players? 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a handicap for soccer in general," Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi 
said when his team arrived in steamy New Jersey earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the continent, Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira 
was thinking tactics, not temperatures. "The most important thing in this 
weather is to keep possession of the ball," he said. "That is imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a belief among the European teams that countries such as Mexico and 
Brazil will benefit from the heat and humidity, but that theory is not shared 
by all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heat will not give an advantage to anyone," Mexico Coach Miguel Mejia 
Baron said. "They are all great athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brazil defender Leonardo thinks otherwise. "This weather could give us an 
advantage over our opponents," he said, "but we would prefer it to be cooler." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas is perhaps the hottest of all the hot spots, and the Bulgarians arrived 
early to get used to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes between 10 and 14 days for players to acclimatize and adapt to these 
conditions," said Dimitar Gevrenov, the team's doctor. "That's why we came to 
America two weeks before our first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without doubt, for teams coming from Europe, the heat and humidity is going 
to be the biggest concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria forward Boncho Guentchev is one player who is feeling the heat. "I 
can't explain to you in words how tough these conditions are," he said. "You 
have to feel it with your skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's captain, Franco Baresi, said: "We are preparing to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has brought to the surface the players' need for water during the 
games. That caused a mini-flap with the Irish, who had believed that the 
players would not be allowed to drink during games. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to FIFA, soccer's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA encourages players to drink," spokesman Guido Tognoni said, "but they 
can't do it in the middle of the field. We won't allow drink bottles to be 
thrown onto the field. But it would be stupid not to let them drink in these 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can drink anything they like -- water, beer, champagne -- just as long 
as they are on the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA had been warned last year what the weather conditions were likely to be 
in the United States in June and July but chose to keep the schedule that had 
been agreed upon. The theory was that when Mexico staged the World Cup 
tournaments of 1970 and 1986, the games were played in the afternoon when the 
heat was just as intense, yet the players and the quality of play did not 
suffer.

 Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat was philosophical, even though his team has to play 
at Orlando and Washington, where the heat and humidity are especially 
miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how long it would take to get used to the conditions, Advocaat said: "A 
year. We're used to practicing in the rain, so this sunny weather we enjoy -- 
but not every day and not for five weeks."

LOS ANGELES IS A MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER CITY; FRANCHISES: SIX OTHER AREAS ARE 
NAMED, BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY KEY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED.

 Greater Los Angeles, which has already seen the Wolves, Toros, Surf, Sunshine, 
Aztecs, Lazers, Skyhawks and Heat come and go, is getting yet another 
professional soccer franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was one of seven named Wednesday as charter members in Major League 
Soccer, the United States' planned new professional soccer league due to begin 
operations next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. team, which like the rest has yet to be named, will play its home 
games at the Coliseum. In addition to Los Angeles, the other cities or regions 
awarded charter membership in the league are Boston, Columbus (Ohio), New York, 
New Jersey, San Jose and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven additional cities remain in the running for the final five league 
positions. They are Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, 
Kansas City, Sacramento, Seattle, Tampa and Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS is envisioned as a 12-team league acting, in effect, as an American first 
division. It is scheduled to begin play next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's news conference in the sauna-like atmosphere of the World Cup 
press tent outside Soldier Field produced far more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the league have any sponsors? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just started to talk to the various prospective sponsors," said Alan 
Rothenberg, who wears three hats as head of World Cup USA '94, U.S. Soccer and 
MLS. "We will have a major conference with them in Los Angeles during the final 
week (of the World Cup). We'll be announcing sponsors later in the summer and 
into the fall. The responses so far are very encouraging."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the league have the $100 million in capital it needs to get off the 
ground? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the process of raising the necessary capital, and I expect we will 
be able to make specific announcements later in the summer," Rothenberg said. 
"The business plan is flexible. We can go with as little as $50 million or as 
much as $100 million." 
</P>
<P>
 -- When will the rest of the cities be named? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a specific timetable," Rothenberg said. "We are targeting Aug. 1 
as the deadline date for making the decisions, but it's conceivable we might 
announce them one at a time earlier than that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- What about potential conflicts with American Professional Soccer League 
(APSL) and United States Inter-Regional Soccer League teams in cities MLS has 
targeted?  
</P>
<P>
 "The APSL has been certified by the U.S. Soccer Federation as one of its 
second-division leagues and I hope that it will continue to survive and 
thrive," Rothenberg said. "If our presence causes it to work harder and do 
better, then that's great. The USISL has known from the beginning that we would 
be looking at all markets in this country, including the 74 USISL communities." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will MLS teams be able to afford the salaries necessary to prevent U.S. 
national team players from going to clubs overseas? 
</P>
<P>
 "The money that will come in will be adequate to compensate our best U.S. 
players," Rothenberg said. "There is no reason why any of them need to sign 
anywhere else in the world from a financial standpoint. The money will be there 
to compete for our players worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Giants Stadium be used if it does not convert permanently to a grass 
field as has been done for the World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll deal with that if and when that happens," Rothenberg said. "I think 
when everybody goes out there now and touches and sees and feels the grass at 
the Meadowlands, I can't see them not going forward with plans (to return 
completely to a grass surface)." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Coliseum and Giants Stadium in New Jersey, other facilities 
to be used in the inaugural season are Foxboro Stadium near Boston, Ohio 
Stadium in Columbus, Hofstra Stadium on Long Island, Spartan Stadium in San 
Jose and RFK Stadium in Washington.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; KNICKS STAY THE CURSE AND GET EVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Next curse. 
</P>
<P>
 Having lived to see the New York Rangers end their 54-year drought, New 
Yorkers turned their attention to that little matter of 21 years that have 
slipped by since the last Knick championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Local observers, devotees of the curse theory of history, are focusing on 
several figures, any of whom might have vowed never to let the Knickerbockers 
win in his lifetime as this Red Dutton person did to the Rangers: 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Jackson -- No one can curse you like one of your own. Mr. Elbows was a 
Knick fans' favorite in the '70s before he discovered Michael Jordan and the 
joys of ballet. He thinks Pat Riley is the second coming of Richard Nixon and 
Knick ball as aesthetic as a car wreck. If he has his way, they won't win a 
title in this century, or next. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubie Brown -- They axed him. Maybe he decided to get them. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Scott -- He wasn't too happy about Riley's rebound drill in Pontiac, 
Mich., before the '89 finals in which his hamstring popped. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake O'Donnell -- You think that offensive foul he called on Patrick Ewing at 
the end of Game 3 was a coincidence? 
</P>
<P>
 A dry spell here is so unbecoming. While New Yorkers concede that Dr. James 
Naismith invented college basketball in some YMCA in New England, they're sure 
the pro game was born in the clouds of cigar smoke in the old Madison Square 
Garden, where the gamblers sat on the baseline and cursed the referees, and the 
legendary public-address announcer John Condon learned to carry on, no matter 
what the distraction, like the night when he announced Gladys Gooding would 
sing the national anthem and a fan yelled an impolite comment about Ms. 
Gooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless," interjected Condon, and finished his presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor have the Knicks made the finals for 21 years, and anyone who has seen them 
lately might wonder how soon they'll be back, making this a special 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not much doubt they'd be ready Wednesday, or as Riley and his scout 
troop like to say, sometimes in unison, "Come with more force." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Riley might not have fed them for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the curse has gotten to Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
 How else can you explain it? He went nine for 29 Sunday with no free throws or 
assists. Wednesday he went eight for 28 with two free throws, both of which he 
missed. His matchup with Hakeem Olajuwon, supposedly the centerpiece of this 
series, is becoming one-sided; Olajuwon outscored him, 32-16, Wednesday night 
and 106-73 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Knicks had to battle down the stretch, scavenging for points any way 
they could: 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rockets leading, 70-69, Charles Oakley scored on a rebound of Ewing's 
missed finger-roll. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Knicks leading, 71-70, Oakley rebounded Derek Harper's missed 
three-pointer, was fouled and made one free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Knicks leading, 75-72, Oakley rebounded Ewing's missed 17-footer, was 
fouled and made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Knicks leading, 77-74, Oakley won a rebound scrum for a missed Knick 
free throw, saving the ball as he was going out of bounds, keeping the 
possession alive for John Starks' three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Voila! Tie series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Rangers showed exactly what this thing is about," Riley said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're down 2-3 going over to New Jersey, come back and win in double 
overtime, come back and win. They're ahead, 3-1, to Vancouver, lose two and 
then win in the seventh game by one goal. I'm sure even the people who watched 
the last game who probably thought with 1.6 seconds to go that the puck was 
going to get in that net. You just never know. 
</P>
<P>
 "And right now, we're one win at home away from playing for the title. And I 
think that's what you get to. You keep pushing it, you keep pushing it. You 
never lose that faith and that conviction and we've had a half a dozen 
situations in the playoffs where it didn't look very good for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing them (Rangers) win it galvanized the city. Now if we can win it, this 
city would be catatonic in the summertime. Just take the summer off." 
</P>
<P>
 After a winter of blizzards, a spring of suffocating heat and a midnight 
strike deadline by workers on the Long Island Railroad, they could use the 
summer off around here. 
</P>
<P>
 Knick fans had better start collecting lucky charms, because their curse, 
while younger than that of the Rangers, promises to be tougher to end, with 
Ewing struggling and the Rockets with home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But get Riley close and he'll think of something. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you gonna call?  
</P>
<P>
 Curse busters.

TIMBERWOLVES SENT BACK TO MINNEAPOLIS; PRO BASKETBALL: STERN SAYS 
$152.5-MILLION OFFER FROM NEW ORLEANS GROUP "WASN'T COMPLETE ENOUGH," BUT HE 
EXPECTS LEAGUE TO BE SUED. 
</P>

 Goodby Bourbon Street, hello judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA relocation committee on Wednesday turned down a New Orleans group's 
$152.5-million offer to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves, a move that is expected 
to tip off a round of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting it, the league filed an action in federal district court in 
Minneapolis, where it is assured of popular support, asserting its right to set 
criteria for prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Stern said Top Rank of Louisiana failed to furnish enough 
data pertaining to its offer, so the Timberwolves will stay in Minnesota for 
the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said he expects Top Rank to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have pleadings available for birthdays, franchise transfers and collective 
bargaining (the NBA Players Assn. is threatening to sue to block the coming 
draft)," Stern said. "We're being sued for just about every occasion in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called 'Raiders vs. the NFL.' . . . Every time a franchise is 
transferred or not, there's a lawsuit, whether it was the Raiders, the San 
Francisco Giants, the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said the New Orleans offer "wasn't complete enough" but "may mature into 
something that is solid." 
</P>
<P>
 A Minneapolis group, headed by a local businessman named Bill Sexton, said it 
has raised its offer to $149 million, aided by state and city pledges of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-man delegation from Minnesota made a presentation at NBA offices 
Wednesday. For the time being, the financially strapped owners, Marv Wolfenson 
and Harvey Ratner, who have to meet a $72-million balloon payment on a loan 
from a Japanese bank, will continue to operate the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfenson and Ratner announced three weeks ago that they had sold the 
Timberwolves to the Louisiana group headed by boxing promoter Bob Arum. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards said there was no justification for the NBA's 
move and pledged to help Top Rank if it decides to go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, the sellers -- present owners of the Timberwolves -- were 
satisfied with the financial arrangements," Edwards said. "That should be 
adequate for all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand in a previous situation, the Los Angeles Clippers took the NBA 
to court and won the case with the court ordering approval of the move."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: BY DESIGN; COSTUME DESIGNER'S AWARD IS A BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The only Tony awarded to Disney's Broadway production of "Beauty and the 
Beast" on Sunday night was for Best Costume Design. Creating costumes for the 
actors, who -- as everyone knows -- are turned into inanimate objects by a 
witch's spell, was "a fascinating challenge," Ann Hould-Ward said Tuesday from 
her New York home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My assistants and I would bang our heads against the wall and ask why we ever 
said we could turn anyone into a candlestick," she added. It was a question she 
never had to ask while designing costumes for such productions as Stephen 
Sondheim's "Into the Woods" or "Sunday in the Park with George." 
</P>
<P>
 Hould-Ward described the sketches for "Beauty and the Beast" as "halfway 
between a drawing and drafting. More like a topological study." Indeed, much of 
the detail work was "vacu-formed," then cut away and hand-beaded. 
</P>
<P>
 She drew inspiration from the fashion world's recent fascination with all 
things three-dimensional: bustiers, bustles, lace overlays and re-embroidered 
cording. Which brings us to her latest challenge: designing costumes for a 
"really big rock star who is about to embark on a world tour." She wouldn't 
reveal the name but said it would be OK if we guessed. We guess, uhhhhh, Elton 
John. (But be he Beauty or be he Beast?)

 House of Style: Fashion statements at Juliette Lewis' surprise 21st birthday 
party, held in the VIP room at the House of Blues last Saturday night . . . 
Lewis wore an ankle-length, body-hugging white knit dress with black lace-up 
boots and a '70s-style brown purse made what looked suspiciously like 
carpeting. ("I am surprised! I'm so surprised!" she said, over and over again.) 
. . . Actress Karen Black -- a genuine relic of the '70s -- wore really big 
hair . . . A 47-year-old William Morris agent doffed her shoes to show off her 
new yoga positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ultimate in club fashion accessories were the blue wristbands found on 
the way-cool crowd, permitting them to enter the hippie-styled VIP room. 
Meanwhile, low-status, white wristband-wearing patrons were confined to the 
club's performance area, where we spotted a very obese man remove his shirt and 
shake his belly to the music.

 As the Fashion World Turns: How's this for a fashion panoply? The actresses 
featured in Aaron Spelling's highly anticipated "Melrose Place" spinoff, 
"Models Inc.," get to wear Richard Tyler designs, to model clothes in a 
fictional Nolan Miller fashion show (during the June 29 debut episode on Fox) 
and to mingle with the pros during an Escada show June 24 at Santa Monica's hot 
Renaissance club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only play a model," we can just hear the actresses saying. No kidding. We 
promise you that the young ladies plucked to play opposite such cinematic leads 
as itty-bitty Jason Priestley and his ilk (don't get us wrong -- we love the 
little guy) cannot possibly top out at the 6-foot height demanded on the 
runway.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: A NICHOLSON IN WOLF'S CLOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: After Manhattan book editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is bitten 
by a wolf, his body and spirit are transformed in alarming, canine ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Designers: Special makeup effects by Rick Baker ("An American Werewolf in 
London," "Harry and the Hendersons," "Coming to America," "Gorillas in the 
Mist," "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan"), costume design by Ann Roth 
("Silkwood," "Klute," "The Day of the Locust," "Hair," "Places in the Heart," 
"Midnight Cowboy"). 
</P>
<P>
 The Metamorphosis: Will as wolf man may be less visually astounding than other 
techno creatures of the day, but he is no less spooky. This "thinking man's 
werewolf," as his creator calls him, evolves almost hair by hair on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the changes are an increasingly full hairline achieved with six toupees; 
facial and hand hairs (a combination of yak, Angora and human) applied one by 
one; a series of rubber prostheses affixed to the nose and ears; multiple pairs 
of contact lenses to convert the eyes from a green-yellow to a venomous 
blackish-yellow, and six sets of increasingly ferocious dental caps. 
</P>
<P>
 At its most extreme, the makeup application took four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "It would be a real mistake to cover Jack Nicholson with a bunch of 
rubber. For one, he's got a great face with a lot of character. . . . He 
shouldn't have to change into this thing with a rubber dog nose," Baker says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf's Clothing: Will is rumpled and bookish, as ordinary as they come in 
baggy corduroys and nondescript ties and sport jackets. Yet there's something 
slightly weird about his unrelenting choice of pale-to-vivid-blue dress shirts. 
Roth says: "I wanted to see him running through Manhattan at night, but with 
little points of light and a blue shirt that screamed at the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Contact lenses were made by Dr. Richard Silver in Los Angeles. 
Toupees were fashioned by Peter Owen in Bath, England. Will's clothes were 
custom-made in New York. BETTY GOODWIN

 The Scene: Sunday's benefit premiere of Disney's animated feature "The Lion 
King" at the El Capitan theater. A party followed in the Hollywood Bowl parking 
lot. It was Disney at its best: a film and party that parents and children 
enjoy together. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience Review: The crowd was dazzled. One 7-year-old said he'd "give it two 
thumbs up." The only real question was who was awed more: kids by the movie or 
rival studio execs by the umpteen gadzillions Disney stands to make from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: It was a 1,400-strong crowd that was 60% 10-years-old and 
under. Among the adults were character voices Matthew Broderick (with Sara 
Jessica Parker), Whoopi Goldberg (whose 4-year-old granddaughter Amarah's 
favorite scene was "when Granny gets the bad one"), Cheech Marin, James Earl 
Jones, Robert Guillaume, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella; lyricist Tim Rice; 
studio execs Jeffrey Katzenberg and Roy Disney; plus guests including Kevin 
Costner, Luanne Wells, Bob Daly and Carole Bayer Sager, Sid and Lorraine 
Sheinberg, John Davis and Norman Lear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bambi Moment: The film's one emotional death scene sent much of the 
audience into tears and some crying kids into the lobby. Afterward, one small 
boy was seen peeking through the theater doors, "to check if it's a happy 
part." What terrified adults most was the thought of stack parking at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: Party Planners West provided carnival games, a high-tech trampoline 
jump and an elephant ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Impressive Guest From a Rival Studio: Josef, a magnificent -- although 
remarkably lethargic -- 8-year-old lion. It turns out he's a Hollywood veteran. 
One of his other gigs is playing the MGM logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Jones, the voice of Mufasa, on the joys of working in animation: 
"You're totally liberated from the self-consciousness of working with a camera 
or on stage. You can just wig out." 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets started at $150 for children and $500 for adults with 
packages as high as $10,000. Disney matched what ticket sales brought in, 
making it a net of $800,000 for the California Institute of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Lessons: Kids learn it's better to be a fat cat donor because you 
get reserved seats downstairs. If not, you scramble for what's left in the 
balcony. Adults learn the Walk of Shame Shuffle as they pass peers on the way 
to cheaper reserved seats in the front rows.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; A 'FASTEN-ATING,' HISTORICAL LOOK AT THE UBIQUITOUS 
ZIPPER; ZIPPER AN EXPLORATION IN NOVELTY; BY ROBERT FRIEDEL / W.W. NORTON $23, 
288 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTYANN KEVLES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I first moved to Pasadena, a friend told me about a shop on Colorado 
Boulevard where the owner did nothing but fix and sell zippers. Gathering up a 
pile of jeans, skirts, sleeping bags and a piece of hand luggage, I hurried to 
meet the magician who could make them all whole again. 
</P>
<P>
 Zippers have always puzzled me. Like escalators, they symbolize the 
quintessentially machine-made. For the life of me, I could not understand how 
either worked, except that each contains a series of identical metal cogs that 
move, mysteriously changing form but always ending up the way they began. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading Robert Friedel's "Zipper," the remarkable saga of the staccato 
evolution of a peculiar example of mechanical wizardry, I drove back to the 
zipper shop last week to speak to the magician. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, he was gone. He had disappeared along with the Talon company that once 
dominated the zipper industry. Talon, having grown from a shaky beginning as 
the Hookless Fastener Co. in 1921 to become the single largest employer in 
pre-World War II Meadville, Pa. (it even had its own radio station: WZPR), shut 
down in the wake of 1980s foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Once marketed as a novelty, zippers have become a staple -- along with safety 
pins (an elaboration on the fibula the Romans used on their togas), buttons, 
hooks, snaps and other ways of holding together two pieces of material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zipper" is a fascinating history of a peculiarly American enterprise, with 
something in it for everyone who has wondered about the enormous changes in 
clothing in the 20th Century: from home-made to store-bought, formal to sport, 
complicated shirts with separate collars to children's clothes with zippers 
that fulfilled, its marketers claimed, the "self-dress" ideal of 1930s 
child-rearing.  
</P>
<P>
 A professor of American History at the University of Maryland, Friedel 
conjures up a world in which it was possible to ask people to remove the new 
fastener (lest it rust) before they did the laundry, and then to sew it in 
again.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Zipper" is not a frivolous book and should appeal to those of us who have 
toyed with patenting an invention. Friedel uses the rise of the invention to 
speculate on what it takes to market a novelty that no one actually needs. 
Zippers are fine. Most of us would miss them mightily should they disappear, 
but substitutes can do most jobs as well, if not as swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 What it took was the determination, faith and confidence of a series of men 
who happened to be the right people at the right time. Each brought the 
"hookless fastener," as it was called for at least 20 years before it found 
what seems the most natural name in the world, another step toward becoming a 
household item and a household word.  
</P>
<P>
 These men included Whitcomb Judson, who patented the first generation of 
hookless fasteners, updating and improving them for years. And like other 
supporters of laissez-faire economics, he made his first big sale to the U.S. 
government, which put his fasteners on mail sacks. Judson was followed by Lewis 
Walker, a salesman-entrepreneur who kept the company going, and Gideon 
Sundback, an engineer who took the crude fastener that Judson had toiled over 
and made it into a dependable gadget. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the lessons that "Zipper" offers is the fact that this wonderful device 
was not an instant success. Even historical landmarks such as World War I that 
helped other technologies did nothing more than keep the zipper alive in the 
public mind. The Post Office sale turned into a onetime thing, as did the use 
of the zipper on the money belts given to the 24,000 doughboys who went abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1921, the Goodyear rubber company installed hookless fasteners on 
their new galoshes and called them Zip boots. Eventually the fashion ended, but 
the name zipper stuck. Yet even this style, which lasted for years, was not 
enough to make zippers the ubiquitous commodity they were to become. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Talon, who owned the patents, perfected the gizmo and defended it 
against copycats, society was changing. New zippers were easier to slide and 
more dependable, and by the mid-'30s, fashion designers had introduced them 
into the fly of gentleman's trousers and the seams of slinky ladies' dresses. 
In the heyday of the first stages of sexual liberation, the zipper symbolized 
the intellectual stripteaser who sings while unzipping in Rodgers and Hart's 
1940 production of "Pal Joey."  
</P>
<P>
 These sexual overtones remained into the '70s, when novelist Erica Jong 
idealized sex without a zipper. In fact, Friedel tells us, the zipper is the 
cardinal 20th-Century symbol. There are zipper myths retold in every culture, 
as zippers bring together what Friedel sees as the themes of "sexuality, 
mechanism, cleverness, opening and closing, attaching and releasing, revealing 
and hiding." 
</P>
<P>
 The zipper is, of course, a part of modern life. The curious thing is how 
nonessential it is. Not only did its inventors have to make it really work, 
they had to convince the world that it was an improvement over whatever they 
were already using.

'SPLENDOR' OPENS WITH HIGH HOPES; ART: A LANDMARK EXHIBITION OF 18TH-CENTURY 
KOREAN WORKS HAS LACMA OFFICIALS EAGER TO STRENGTHEN ITS TIES TO THE COMMUNITY, 
WOO NEW PATRONS AND BUILD ITS AUDIENCE.

 "Korean Arts of the Eighteenth Century: Splendor & Simplicity" -- a landmark 
traveling exhibition of 125 artworks, including 17 objects designated as 
National Treasures by the Korean government -- is spending the summer at the 
L.A. County Museum of Art. And like most distinguished guests who settle in for 
an extended period, this one, which opens today, has arrived with an agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized as the centerpiece of a yearlong Festival of Korea by 
New York's Asia Society in collaboration with the National Museum of Korea in 
Seoul -- long before North Korea's nuclear weapons program became a hot topic 
of international debate. Drawing largely on South Korean collections, the 
exhibition debuted last fall at the society's Park Avenue galleries, then moved 
to the Smithsonian Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected of such a high-level national emissary, the exhibition of 
screens, paintings, ceramics, textiles, calligraphy and furniture has been sent 
on the road to increase American knowledge and appreciation of Korean culture, 
which has long been overshadowed by the artistic traditions of Korea's powerful 
neighbors, China and Japan. But in Los Angeles the show also is viewed as an 
opportunity to strengthen the L.A. County Museum's commitment to Korean art and 
to develop community relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kuwayama, LACMA's senior curator of Far Eastern art and Los Angeles 
coordinator of "Korean Arts," puts it this way: "Our museum is the third 
largest (art museum) in the nation, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the major venue for 
presenting exhibitions on the West Coast. . . . By geographical destiny -- 
located as we are in the largest city on the East Coast of the Pacific Rim -- 
we should have one of the great collections of Asian art." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has fulfilled part of its destiny by gaining important collections 
of Indian, Southeast Asian and Japanese art during its 29 years on Wilshire 
Boulevard, but its Korean holdings remain extremely modest. "Korean art is 
something we would like to do something about," Kuwayama says emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As LACMA's largest and most comprehensive presentation of Korean art to date, 
the exhibition offers an opportunity to build the museum's Korean audience and 
to woo patrons of Korean art. To that end, the entire 8,000-square-foot first 
floor of the Hammer wing is allotted to the show -- about double the space 
available at the Asia Society and 25% more than at the Sackler. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, LACMA's education department has planned an extensive program of 
lectures, tours, films and community workshops, with the help of a grant from 
the Korea Foundation in Seoul. Events range from scholarly art talks at the 
museum to family activities at churches and schools in Korean American and 
African American neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Korean Arts" is limited to the 18th Century (near the end of the 
Chosun kingdom's 500-year reign), it surveys a particularly vital period known 
as a golden age, Kuwayama says. It was a time when Korea's recovery from 
foreign invasions coincided with a search for cultural identity, increased 
creative freedom and a growth of patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition tells the story of Korea's cultural flowering in three 
chapters, focusing on how art was used in the courts, by the landed gentry and 
in religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This segment emphasizes the legitimacy of the royal house and its mandate to 
rule," Kuwayama says, strolling through galleries where court art was being 
installed. Artworks portraying "Ten Longevity Symbols" wish long life to the 
king, he notes, pointing out symbolic landscapes on large folding screens. Such 
paintings provided backdrops for 18th-Century rulers whose Confucian beliefs 
cast them as intermediaries between the cosmos and their subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosperity encouraged appreciation for all things Korean and allowed arts 
patronage to spread from the courts to the private sector during the 18th 
Century. The second portion of the show reveals that this phenomenon introduced 
artful dividends, such as precisely rendered portraits, detailed genre scenes 
and expressive landscapes that differ sharply from the idealism that had been 
imported from China. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean ceramic artists also began to follow their own muse during the 18th 
Century. "In contrast to Japanese and Chinese ceramics, there is a naivete, 
directness, simplicity and spontaneous insouciance in Korean ceramics," 
Kuwayama says. Imperfections of glazing and firing were accepted as happy 
accidents, and symmetry gave way to fascination with irregular form, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The final gallery offers artistic manifestations of Confucianism, Buddhism and 
native shamanism -- along with proof that prosperity furthered patronage of 
religious art. One corner of the room is occupied by a simulated Confucian 
ancestral hall containing ritual bowls that could be struck like bells to 
solicit the help of deceased family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Confucians who couldn't afford to build a memorial to their departed relatives 
might substitute a painting of an ancestral hall, such as an anonymous artist's 
"Painted Spirit House" scroll. Buddhists, on the other hand, could contemplate 
the salvation they might find during afterlife in paintings of the Western 
Paradise. Meanwhile, lives of the dead are neatly chronicled in calligraphy on 
blue and white porcelain epitaph tablets.

DANCE REVIEW; A TOOTHLESS BITE FROM THE BIG APPLE; ALTHOUGH HEAVY ON NOSTALGIA 
AND OPULENCE, 'RADIO CITY' ENDS UP LIGHTWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When you hear a bunch of chorus guys singing, "There are no girls like 
showgirls," you know you're not on the cutting edge of societal evolution. But 
cutting edge is not what "The Great Radio City Music Hall Spectacular," with 
Susan Anton and the Rockettes -- which opened Tuesday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center (through Sunday) -- is concerned with. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's not touting the Radio City Music Hall in New York dubiously as "a 
national treasure," the show is about nostalgia, pretty women (lots of pretty 
women), opulent, bizarre, revealing costumes, precision dancing and would-be 
scenic spectaculars. 
</P>
<P>
 It moves to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles for a six-day run, 
starting Tuesday. At least the Orange County center had the honesty to put the 
event on its Broadway series. James A. Doolittle, who is presenting it in Los 
Angeles, pairs it in ads with the Joffrey Ballet and calls both "dance events 
of distinction." That's a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising thing about the show was how clunky and bite-sized the 
choreography -- credited to Joe Layton -- actually was and how indifferently it 
was danced, particularly by the secondary acts. Layton's movement ideas came 
mostly in simple two-bar phrases, yet the dancers seemed to need clear 
preparation time to do them, and they rarely carried through any real kinetic 
impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a start-and-stop quality to the dancing, and that, plus the 
recurring drive to get the 21 dancers lined up to do synchronized eye-level 
kicks -- a feat that always drew applause -- gave some idea of what American 
dance pioneers such as Martha Graham must have been up against as they labored 
to make dance a serious art. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty acts included Michael Kessler and Melinda Jackson as stunt- and 
trick-driven soloists in the kitschy "Kingdom Under the Sea" and the athletic 
"Rhapsody in Blue" scenes. Modest homages to Astaire-Rogers or Gene Kelly, 
Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor looked embarrassingly inept. The "Parade of 
the Wooden Soldiers" probably showed the troupe in its most appealing precision 
dancing, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton, a singing actress of some TV and Broadway reputation, served as emcee, 
flashing a million-dollar smile, offering throaty vocalism and genial patter 
and appearing over the course of the evening in five different costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Magician Jeff McBride provided welcome changes in pace with effective coin 
tricks, some startling quick changes involving masks behind masks behind masks 
. . . and an overwrought lighting trick dependent more on hand-held mirrors and 
a sympathetic designer than on persuasive magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Klein conducted a small orchestra made up of New York City and Southern 
California musicians. The orchestra was miked, as were the singers, helping to 
give a feeling of disconnect to the whole proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Great Radio City Music Hall Spectacular," with Susan Anton and the 
Rockettes, will continue today and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., 
and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $19-$45. (714) 556-2787. The show will repeat

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEWS; 'MUSIC MAN' STORMS RIVER CITY, CAPTURES HILL; A 
YOUNG CAST IN BUENA PARK HAS LITTLE TROUBLE SLIPPING INTO THE 
TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY MIDWEST, WITH MEREDITH WILLSON'S TRAVELING CON MAN PLAYED 
AS MR. SMOOTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Led by a clutch of capable teen-age actors, the Buena Park Youth Theatre's 
staging of "The Music Man" is as warm and satisfying as a stack of flapjacks on 
a cold I-o-way morning. 
</P>
<P>
 First produced in 1957, Meredith Willson's "The Music Man" contains scraps 
Willson remembered from his own Iowa boyhood, and this staging, directed by 
Ruth Walp, does a crackerjack job of capturing the nostalgia believably and 
with the right touch of irony. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a challenging task considering that, to most of these 6- to 19-year-old 
actors, the mores of turn-of-the-century Midwestern society must seem the most 
foreign of foreign policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some awkwardness from the younger members, the cast slips into 
Willson's portrait of the fictional River City with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Alfred Lopez Jr. makes the transition most gracefully as Prof. Harold 
Hill, the traveling con man who slides into the citizens' hearts and 
pocketbooks but gets his foot caught in the door, and his own heart unlatched, 
trying to make his way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's there's-a-sucker-born-every-minute outlook makes him a character that 
would be easy for an unseasoned actor to overplay, but Lopez avoids that 
temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being a broad, brassy, in-your-face con man, Lopez's Hill is Mr. 
Smooth. Seeking a market for his youth band (for which he happens to sell 
instruments, uniforms and lessons), Hill stirs the residents' ire over the pool 
table that has just been installed in the local billiard parlor, a sure-fire 
implement of moral decay among River City's youth.  
</P>
<P>
 But even during the fire- and-brimstone musical sermon in "Trouble," Lopez 
maintains a light touch, letting the townspeople whip themselves into a 
righteous frenzy all their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when he recognizes that Marian is on to his scam and he attempts to win 
her over, he plays his line like a skilled fisherman until she's hooked. Which, 
this being musical theater, she eventually is. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Hill's, most of the featured roles are double cast in 
this show. On Sunday, Summer Wybaczynsky played Marian, River City's 
strait-laced librarian and tireless champion of intellectual improvement. 
Wybaczynsky, like Lopez, keeps things reasonably low key. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Marian is stiff-backed at first but eventually demonstrates some nice 
inner conflict when she's torn between her better judgment and her lonely 
heart. She warms to Lopez's Hill in a way that never seems forced or 
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also an extremely capable singer. Even in a meandering ballad like "My 
White Knight," she's a pleasure to the ear. Actors in supporting roles were 
less consistent, and several times during the two-hour show, the attentions of 
some of the younger kids tended to fade. Also, Walp's double casting of 
ensemble characters caused some confusion (at one point, kids play adults in 
one scene and children in the next). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, last Sunday's cast delivered the goods capably. David Barr and 
Melissa Pike, as blowhard Mayor Shinn and his pompous but secretly 
free-spirited wife Eulalie (watch for her Grecian urn bit in the Ladies' Dance 
Committee number), got plenty of laughs from the adults in the house. So did 
the bickering between members of the school board-turned-barbershop quartet 
(Raul Estrada, Rigo De Oliva, Aaron Jackson and Marty Raymondo.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Myrant gives some nice character work as Marian's matchmaking Irish 
mama, and Craig Watson is delightful as her lisping brother Winthrop, whose 
transformation symbolizes Hill's unintentional impact on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 With 43 children of different age, size and abilities, one expects some rough 
dance numbers, but choreographer Robin Perry helped the cast deliver several 
that were way above the norm for children's theater.  
</P>
<P>
 Especially effective are the rollicking "Shipoopi," with its snippets of 
American dance from square dance to the Charleston to Appalachian clogging, and 
the ever-so-slightly steamy pairings in "Marian the Librarian." 
</P>
<P>
 Costumes, most of them apparently rented, are appealing as well, especially 
the library kids' coordinating striped outfits and Marian's flattering 
shirtwaist dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Live music by four adult musicians added a professional touch, although the 
Jerry Lee Lewis tunes they played at pre-show and intermission were baffling. 
Who knows -- maybe, like the good Prof. Hill, the musicians just wanted to 
shake up the crowd a little.

CLUB REVIEW; THE TREND-DEFYING SKI ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since anyone can remember, the sign above the entrance to Hollywood's Ski 
Room on Sunset Boulevard has read, "Sk Room." The blue lettering, which still 
includes a star dotting what would the missing "i," gives you an indication of 
what's in store once inside the 50-year-old bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor is minimalist drab, at best. The one-room club is renowned for 
having arguably the worst pool table in Hollywood. The regulars -- as well as a 
few of the bartenders -- pretty much define the term "motley." 
</P>
<P>
 So why is this venue, which was actually a "featured" watering hole in the 
Charles Bukowski-penned film "Barfly," consistently attracting a youthful 
music-and film-industry crowd?  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly one reason must be that the Ski Room defies every trend that passes 
through Tinsel Town. Even if you haven't ventured in for five years, you'll 
find nothing's changed much, except perhaps a few songs on the jukebox -- the 
Ski Room's crown jewel. 
</P>
<P>
 Four quarters gets you 11 selections, and if you're big fans of Neil Diamond 
or Engelbert Humperdinck, there's plenty to choose from. The jukebox also 
includes the Doors and Frank Sinatra, but as each year passes, the proprietors 
add a hit song or two and lose a Ski Room classic. Occasionally the losses are 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby" and Billy Idol's cover of the 
Doors' "L.A. Woman" turned up, presumably bumping the original Doors' version 
of the latter and its B-side, "People Are Strange" -- once a Ski Room anthem. 
Although the venue's desire to march to the beat of its own drummer is 
laudable, this incident was a blight on an otherwise inflexible track record.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LUKA BLOOM: NO GARDEN-VARIETY FOLKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Luka Bloom came to the Coach House on Tuesday night and put on your average, 
everyday solo-folkie show -- you know, the kind that comes with rap, reggae, 
laughter, romance, whoops, whispers, and a low E-string vibrating in 
Sensurround. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish singer-songwriter's resourcefulness and versatility enabled him to 
make a concert of almost two hours seem too short. If he could do that well on 
June 14, which was Flag Day, think of the possibilities when he plays tonight 
at the Troubadour in West Hollywood. After all, June 16, as any James Joyce 
enthusiast will remind you, is Bloomsday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luka Bloom was Barry Moore before he came to the United States eight years ago 
to right a foundering career. He spliced together a new name for himself from 
the title of a Suzanne Vega hit and from Leopold Bloom, the character whose 
fictitious wanderings around Dublin on June 16, 1904, were chronicled by Joyce 
in his great novel, "Ulysses." 
</P>
<P>
 No Joyce worshiper, the singing Bloom chose his stage name out of sheer 
whimsy. The Irish icons who figured most prominently in his stage chat at the 
Coach House were not literary but pop cultural: the national soccer team (to 
whose success in the World Cup he dedicated a rousing encore, "Delirious") and 
Shane MacGowan, the former Pogues singer whose alarming table manners were the 
subject of one of the show's wry anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an adoring audience of about 300, Bloom affably tossed out 
one-liners and generally proved himself up to par in the wit and charm 
departments so vital to any solo folkie's success, and so very much expected if 
that folkie happens to be Irish. (Far from pouring on the blarney, though, the 
Dublin-based Bloom went in for no stock Irish humor.) 
</P>
<P>
 His sound owed more to devices associated with up-to-date, atmospheric 
alternative rock bands than it did to the solo-acoustic tradition. He boosted 
his amplified guitars with electronic effects that made the treble strings 
glisten and ripple in a bath of warm, liquid reverberation. Meanwhile, the bass 
strings rumbled as if their vibrations belonged on the soundtrack of a disaster 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 If occasionally obtrusive, these sonic treatments gave Bloom a broad palette 
from which to work. He used it to varied purposes, alternating between 
galloping anthems that found him flailing at the guitar strings as fast and 
hard as he could, and ballad reveries supported by delicate strumming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't hesitate to plunge into his strong new album, "Turf," pulling 10 
songs from it, even though Tuesday was the first day it was available in 
stores. He went back to his 1992 release, "The Acoustic Motorbike," for five 
more songs, dipped into his 1990 debut, "Riverside," for just one, and debuted 
an unfinished new romantic agony song that he played more for laughs than for 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 It took him a few songs to warm up. "Freedom Song," a prosaic, somewhat 
soapboxy ode to femalecivil rights leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, was a 
questionable opening choice. But he found his footing with another topical 
song, "Background Noise." This biting account of how easy it is to ignore 
horrors only slightly removed from one's own immediate turf fully exploited 
Bloom's ability to move from an urgent, low near-whisper to the even more 
urgent upper reaches of his range. That ability to negotiate the high notes 
surely and clearly yielded the singer many an emotional payoff and rewarded 
listeners with many a chorus lifted by a lovely, evocative melody. 
</P>
<P>
 With songs of politics and fervent romance, aggressive strums and moments of 
rippling calm, Bloom put enough musical and thematic strands in play to avoid 
sameness, the bane of the solo performer. His lyrics were more likely to 
portray character types -- the pining or ardent lover, the mourner, the 
outraged social observer -- than detailed individuals. At the same time, songs 
gained depth from the writer's attention to settings and images of natural 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In putting his song list together, Bloom paid attention to the way songs might 
complement each other in meaning or style. In a particularly good pairing, he 
sang "Sanctuary," a deeply melancholy, meditative farewell set at his mother's 
graveside, then followed it with "Diamond Mountain" in which a swelling chorus 
conveyed more sad longing yet allowed the singer to find comfort in the 
permanency of one of Ireland's natural landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another pairing, this one along stylistic lines, he played a lightly 
skipping reggae-beat version of Prince's "When Doves Cry" and followed it with 
the dark, surging struggle-reggae of his own, "The Fertile Rock," an 
environmental anthem whose gravity and chant-like quality would make it sound 
at home on a Midnight Oil album. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end, Bloom got into his own brand of romantic Celtic rap, both in 
his own "Holding Back the River" (in which the semi-spoken rhymes of the verses 
give way to a richly melodic chorus) and his crowd-pleasing cover of LL Cool 
J's hip-hop ballad "I Need Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The mix also included some delicate water music: "Exploring the Blue," in 
which a fervent Bloom takes a figurative plunge in search of pearls of romance, 
and "Sunny Sailor Boy," a sweetly wafting song, written by Mike Scott of the 
Waterboys, about a mermaid who doubles as a muse. It should come as no surprise 
that a singer as attuned as Bloom to mixing flavors in solo performance would 
serve up a song of the surf on a very good album called "Turf."

THEATER REVIEW; 'HOUSE'S' DISTURBING SATIRE STILL PACKS POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Lock's view of contemporary America was absolutely merciless six years 
ago, when his "House of Correction" hit Los Angeles Theatre Center like a house 
on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Director J. David Krassner has revived this disturbing satire at a theater 
some think of as relatively sedate, Theatre 40 in Beverly Hills, and it still 
packs a powerful punch. Some may find it even more apropos now, in the age of 
the Clintons and political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion and Carl, married ninnies who live in a New Jersey suburb, think of 
themselves as good liberals. But they don't know what to think of Steve, a man 
who worms his way into their house -- and their bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve's wife was brutally murdered, he says. And for some reason, he appears 
to hold Carl -- a mild-mannered ad copywriter -- responsible. It's pay-back 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else it does, Lock's play keeps a tight lock on an audience's 
attention. The dialogue rapidly bounces around the stage, hardly pausing to 
allow laughs, though many of them lie just under the surface. But gradually the 
shimmer of the words deepens into a more visceral sense of menace. If Eugene 
Ionesco had written an American suspense thriller, it might be something like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 Krassner's cast, perched on Jerzy Cybulski's comic-strip-style furniture, 
creates impeccable caricatures. Robin Groves makes Marion's nervous little 
laughs worthy of their own laughs. Christopher Michael Moore's Carl is pudgy, 
smug, deliciously disgusting. As the insistent outsider, Michael Gough has 
enough insinuating charm to sneak past this couple's initial defenses without 
much problem, then emerges as a commanding avenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Gough recently played a similar character in "The Homage That Follows" at the 
same theater, but that play moved like molasses compared to this one. The 
witty, uncredited soundtrack between scenes of "House of Correction" helps keep 
it moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences will argue about what Lock's play adds up to -- a difficult subject 
to discuss here without giving away too much of the plot. Yet it's clear that 
severe tunnel vision afflicts the two men in the play, although Steve talks a 
good game to the contrary. The woman, while more open-minded, hasn't a mind 
worth opening. In short, no one is spared, and no one has a clue about how to 
correct injustice without creating more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "House of Correction," Theatre 40, 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills (on the 
campus of Beverly Hills High School). Sundays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends July 5. 
$10. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.

MUSIC REVIEW; L.A. JEWISH SYMPHONY ENDS DEBUT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Topping off a brief -- two concerts, to be exact -- but hopeful first season, 
the L.A. Jewish Symphony offered an accessible program Tuesday at University 
Synagogue in Brentwood, a space with friendly acoustics if cramped stage space. 
A stated goal is to present music of Jewish composers, which in this case meant 
friendly modernism from Aaron Copland, Darius Milhaud and Erich Korngold. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the concert tended to skim pleasant surfaces rather plumb depths. 
What the program may have lacked in substance, the performance gained in 
impassioned delivery, at conductor Noreen Green's behest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quiet City" (1940) typifies classic Coplandia, shimmering with big, open 
chords. Pensiveness errs on the side of light more than dark. Here, soloists 
Boyde Hood on trumpet and John Ralston on English horn produced sharp, anthemic 
statements beneath restless string parts hinting at the composer's more atonal 
period to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Milhaud's "Le boeuf sur le toit" (The Ox on the Roof) disguises modernist tics 
behind a rollicking, carnivalesque facade. Frothy themes are cleverly sabotaged 
via polytonal cross-stitching, squirmy modulations and hairpin dynamic turns. 
The orchestra responded with uncanny precision and suitably canny passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Korngold's Violin Concerto is based on material from the composer's bold film 
scores from the '30s, but what washes in the movie theater sounds washed-out in 
concert. Despite soloist Mark Kashper's considerable technical and emotive 
intensity, the score itself seemed disjointed and under-developed, with 
climaxes and cadenzas that pop up out of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchestrated klezmer pieces by and featuring clarinetist Zinevy Goro served as 
sporty encores to a concert that needed more of a center.JOSEF WOODARD

ART REVIEWS; PHOTOS CAPTURE L.A.'S ARTIFICIAL REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Humble's super-saturated photographs give gorgeous visual form to the 
unnatural beauty of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jan Kesner Gallery, 16 color prints depict the sprawling city as a vast 
spider web of power lines, railways and streets. In this network of 
electricity, steel and concrete, people are trapped like helpless insects. 
</P>
<P>
 But Humble's crystal-clear pictures are not one-dimensional critiques of 
L.A.'s inhuman artificiality. Neither are they giddy celebrations of sunshine, 
stardom and seduction. They reflect, instead, a deep ambivalence about the 
city, fusing sharp contradictions in stunning compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Humble masterfully exploits Southern California sunlight to hold his 
photographs together. He takes most of his pictures on clear days in the late 
afternoon, when the light is brightest and the shadows darkest. 
</P>
<P>
 These harsh contrasts dramatically flatten things out. Buildings appear to be 
no more substantial than billboards. Houses, trailer homes, smokestacks and 
telephone poles seem to be silhouettes. Even the downtown skyline looks like a 
backdrop for a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The best photos make L.A. appear to be an exceptionally realistic set. Some 
images have the presence of collages, of single pictures made of many others 
cut-and-pasted together. This ad hoc, part-by-part construction captures an 
essential aspect of L.A.'s artificial reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost nothing remains of the natural environment that was here prior to the 
construction of the modern metropolis. Concrete and blacktop have totally 
replaced the scrub and sand of the desert. The Los Angeles River is a cement 
ditch. Most of the trees and foliage have been imported. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the sky, in Humble's pictures, is marked by artifice. When it's not thick 
with orange smog, it's crisscrossed by trails of jet exhaust, broken into grids 
by the armatures of billboards and divided into sections by towering chimneys. 
Miles of electrical lines slice it into irregular geometric shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of the urban landscape portrayed by Humble's photographs, the 
sky is at once overcrowded and empty. When people appear in the color-drenched 
environment he vividly depicts, they seem isolated and insignificant, 
crowded-out by their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is as if the man-made landscape leaves very little room for humans, but 
plenty of space for dazzling, anonymous beauty. Humble's art thus captures the 
sense in which L.A. is simultaneously nightmare and paradise, a hallucinatory 
mix of banality and sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan Kesner Gallery, 164 N. La Brea Ave., (213) 938-6834, through July 9. 
Closed Sundays through Tuesdays.  
</P>
<P>
 * Explicit Miniatures: Judie Bamber's three jewel-like paintings at Richard 
Telles Fine Art are the most powerful works she has made. Measuring slightly 
more than 6-by-2-inches, they're also her smallest. Each is a lovingly 
rendered, exquisitely glazed, life-size close-up of a woman's genitals. 
</P>
<P>
 From across the long, narrow gallery, Bamber's oils-on-panel (which are nearly 
as thick as they are wide), appear to be small objects affixed to the wall. A 
viewer has to get fairly close to determine what they depict. And get very 
close to see how masterfully they're made. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't help but relish their painterly virtuosity. Bamber handles her 
medium with aplomb. It's obvious that every square centimeter (and fold) of 
flesh has had hours of attention lavished upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 These sumptuous paintings spring from strange sources. Bamber combines the 
detail of 15th-Century Dutch still-lifes with the scale of 5th-Century B.C. 
Persian miniatures. Her tightly cropped vulvae also draw upon the 8th-Century 
Hindu Kamasutra and contemporary pornography. Courbet's "The Origin of the 
World," a crotch-shot painting from 1866, looks practically Puritan in 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamber's art explicitly recalls Zoe Leonard's black-and-white photographs of 
female genitalia, which she exhibited between pre-Modern paintings, often of 
female nudes. Reproduction, Bamber's stripped-down pictures reveal, has more 
than one meaning. Sometimes it's related to the seemingly biological demand to 
perpetuate the species, or at least to go through the motions of doing so. At 
other times it's more closely connected to the multiplication of images. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-take of pleasure is at the root of both activities. Passion 
grounds both life and art. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Telles Fine Art, 7380 Beverly Blvd., (213) 965-5578, through June 
25. Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 * Topsy-Turvy World: Explosions of lurid color combine with eye-grabbing 
patterns in Carole Caroompas' spunky paintings at Sue Spaid Fine Art. Visually, 
nothing is subtle in these aggressive amalgamations of dumb cartoons, 
simplified diagrams and pilfered movie stills. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroompas leaves subtlety for the ideas and feelings her hefty 
acrylics-on-canvas generate. Her new paintings function most powerfully as 
after-images: Once emblazoned in your mind's eye, they continue to resonate and 
mutate. 
</P>
<P>
 The five works here belong to the ongoing series "Before and After 
Frankenstein: The Woman Who Knew Too Much." In the topsy-turvy world Caroompas 
injects into your head, the battle between the sexes gets increasingly twisted 
and demented. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest (and best) painting centers on two scenes from the B-movie 
"Frankenhooker" and an image of a donkey with an erection. One actress chops 
cabbage while another fondles a man's head as she stares longingly at a brain 
in his lap. About a dozen larger-than-life, trompe l'oeil bones frame these 
blue and green pictures. Four giant wide-open mouths, apparently waiting for 
some painful dentistry, dance across the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Clear-cut oppositions between victimizers and victims are out of the question 
in these loaded explorations of psychological complexity. With vigor and 
unpredictability, Caroompas layers meanings and scrambles cliches in dizzying 
mixes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., (213) 935-6153, through June 26. 
Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.  
</P>
<P>
 * A Glimpse of Faces: Visiting the exhibition "Studio Visits: Photographs of 
California Artists by Jim McHugh" is a lot like thumbing through a stack of 
baseball cards. You get to see nearly 50 of your favorite art stars posing 
seriously or casually, in their studios or in more formal settings. 
</P>
<P>
 This pleasant fund-raiser for the Santa Monica Museum of Art gives fans a 
chance to glimpse the faces behind the art. It invites viewers to speculate 
about how the personalities of the artists might match up with the paintings, 
sculptures and installations they make. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where McHugh's own artistry as a portrait photographer comes in. It 
is his job to convince viewers that his pictures reveal more of the artists' 
selves than their own works normally disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, he's pretty successful: Almost all his photographs present 
characters whose demeanor and attitudes obviously complement characteristics 
present in their work. The movement from private self to public persona goes 
smoothly in "Studio Visits," providing just the type of packaging fund-raisers 
demand.

in the investigation of the killings of his ex-wife and a man she knew, Los 
Angeles police sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's blood type is different from those of the two victims, Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, a source said. Although even rare blood types 
are shared by many people, any discovery of Simpson's blood type at the murder 
scene could lend credence to the suggestion that he was there, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more exact test to determine whether the DNA in the blood sample matches 
Simpson's has not been concluded, sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lead attorney, newly hired lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, was unavailable 
for comment late Wednesday on the blood test results. Shapiro earlier said he 
will seek a second autopsy of the two victims and private forensic tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, who represented Simpson until Wednesday and continues to 
serve as an adviser to his legal team, said he was unaware of any test results 
concluding that Simpson's blood type matched samples recovered from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Simpson slipped out of his Brentwood home for several hours to 
attend a private viewing of his ex-wife at a Laguna Hills mortuary, along with 
her family members who live in the Monarch Bay section of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sources have said Simpson is the main suspect in the investigation, 
the Los Angeles Police Department has declined to confirm those reports, and 
Simpson has not been arrested or charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 New details emerged Wednesday about a matching pair of gloves whose existence 
Weitzman has vehemently denied. According to police sources, investigators 
found two work gloves, one at the scene of the crime and the other outside 
Simpson's Brentwood mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had blood on them, but tests for the blood on the gloves have not been 
completed, sources said. According to one source, the glove at Simpson's home 
was found outside a side entrance near a trail of drippings that have been 
determined to be blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be inconsistent with what I was told," said Weitzman, who has said 
that a police official assured him that there was no second glove found at 
Simpson's home. "Beyond that, I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Goldman's wounds indicated that he fought fiercely when attacked, 
and they said Simpson was scratched and cut when police interviewed him several 
hours after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman and others familiar with the investigation said the former athlete 
spent much of the day at his Brentwood mansion, grieving over the death of his 
ex-wife, surrounded by members of his family and in consultation with his legal 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities sifted through the evidence in the case, Simpson switched 
lawyers, hiring Shapiro to head his legal team. He said that Simpson is under 
treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is deeply upset," said Shapiro, one of Los Angeles' best-known lawyers. 
"He is under a doctor's care for depression. . . . He is going to be in 
seclusion with his family to grieve over the loss of the mother of his 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman -- who has vigorously defended Simpson's innocence over the past 
three tumultuous days -- has given up the lead role to Shapiro, a celebrated 
Century City lawyer whose clients have included Darryl Strawberry and Tina 
Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he has stepped down, Weitzman said in a statement: "I have 
decided because of my personal relationship with O.J. Simpson and my many other 
professional commitments I can no longer give O.J. the attention he both 
deserves and needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he told Simpson to avoid watching television or reading 
newspapers and to instead focus on his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Two black limousines were seen leaving Simpson's Brentwood mansion Wednesday 
afternoon, and a few hours later, he was filmed by a television station as he 
drove away from O'Connor Laguna Hills Mortuary, where his former wife's body 
was being prepared for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a viewing . . . to send my sister off. We all went and paid our 
respects," said Denise Brown, Nicole's older sister. "And . . . yes, O.J. was 
there. But what's the big deal? It's his ex-wife. My God, it's somebody we all 
love. We just want to let her go in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Simpson said he visited his children, who are staying at 
their grandparents' house in Orange County, before returning home. A private 
funeral is scheduled for today in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement released after he took over the case, Shapiro said 
Simpson was at his Brentwood home waiting for a limousine when Nicole Simpson, 
35, and Goldman, 25, were killed Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson traveled to the airport late that night and then caught a "red-eye" 
flight for Chicago. A source said he was the only passenger to travel in the 
first-class section of the American Airlines flight from Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman had previously said he believed that Simpson was in the limousine or 
at the airport when the killings occurred. So far, an exact time of death has 
not been released by authorities, although Weitzman has said he was told that 
it was about 11 p.m. Sunday -- supporting his contention that Simpson could not 
have committed the crime and still gotten to the airport in time to catch his 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that police believe that Simpson would have had enough time 
to make the trip, suggesting that they believe that the time of death may have 
been somewhat earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police discovered the bodies after midnight and called Simpson at 
his Chicago hotel Monday morning to tell him that his ex-wife had been found 
dead in Brentwood. Simpson returned to Los Angeles that morning and was 
questioned by police the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Shapiro's first moves after taking over for Weitzman was to solicit the 
services of a criminologist and a pathologist, whom he would not identify 
except to say that each is a nationally recognized professional. They will 
review the findings of the police and perform a second autopsy on the two 
victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The experts would only have standing in the case if Simpson were to face 
charges, as witnesses are not entitled to bring in their own experts to review 
evidence. Nevertheless, Shapiro said he had no information indicating that 
Simpson's arrest is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro met with police Wednesday, saying afterward that he has pledged 
Simpson's full cooperation during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have introduced myself to the members of the Los Angeles Police 
Department," Shapiro said, "and to offer our complete cooperation with them in 
their investigation to solve this crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said investigators spent Wednesday continuing to work their case, and 
they were said to be just a few days away from turning it over to the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office. According to sources, investigators 
were continuing to interview witnesses -- including a therapist who said she 
counseled Nicole Simpson on two occasions. Simpson's ex-wife said during the 
sessions that he was stalking her, the therapist has said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they conduct their investigation, police were said to be painstakingly 
reviewing their case, eager to avoid a situation in which they arrest a suspect 
for the double slaying and then have the case sent back by prosecutors for more 
work. Once police make an arrest, they have 48 hours to present a case to the 
district attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, however, prosecutors may elect to present the matter to a grand 
jury and ask for an indictment. If that procedure were followed in this case, 
it could delay any arrest by several days, but it also would preclude the need 
for a preliminary hearing in which evidence is presented in a public courtroom.

GRAY WHALE REMOVED FROM ENDANGERED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its population approaching historic high levels, the California gray 
whale, the beast of prey that became a majestic icon of the deep, was removed 
Wednesday from the endangered species list, making it the first marine creature 
to be delisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated at 21,000, gray whales may be as numerous today as they were before 
an American whaling ship discovered their breeding grounds off the Baja 
California peninsula in 1855 and began the commercial slaughter that decimated 
the species. Commercial whaling wiped out two other gray whale populations in 
the Atlantic during Colonial times, and later in the western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the gray whales will remain under the jurisdiction of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, which shields them from hunting in U.S. waters, several 
environmental groups warn that the whales will be more vulnerable to a variety 
of hazards -- such as oil drilling, sea mining, salt extraction and tourism -- 
than they were as an officially endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say such commercial activities will no longer require the 
stringent reviews mandated by the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delisting from the Endangered Species Act removes a protection that has been 
vital to recovery," said Maxine McCloskey of the Sierra Club. "It will leave 
them more vulnerable to pollution and other environmental hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the environmental pressures appear greatest in Mexico, where 
ambitious plans for seaside resort development as well as salt mining could 
disturb the tranquillity of the bays and lagoons that have been safe harbors 
for newborn whales for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Endangered Species Act jurisdiction does not extend to foreign 
waters, critics of delisting argue that it will make it harder for Mexican 
environmentalists to resist pressure for intense development along the Baja 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whale's recovery is attributed to a variety of factors, beginning in 
the 1930s with a series of international whaling bans. However, exemptions 
continued to permit subsistence hunting of nearly 170 whales each year by 
native peoples in Alaska and Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, the National Marine Mammal Protection Act and the 
Endangered Species Act established procedures for safeguarding the whale's long 
migration corridor and feeding grounds. Around the same time, the Mexican 
government gave sanctuary status to the Baja lagoons where the whales migrate 
in winter. In the 1980s, concerns about oil spills along the whales' migratory 
route contributed to the decision to place a moratorium on oil and gas leasing 
off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two decades, at least, the gray whales have been multiplying at a 
rate of about 3% a year, more than doubling their population since the 1930s, 
according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency responsible for 
taking the whale off the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five to 50 feet long, the gray is by no means the largest whale, but it 
is unique in ways that have endeared it to humans. Unlike other whales that 
mate and give birth in the solitude of the deep ocean, the sociable gray whales 
clump together in shallow lagoons to breed and calve. They tend to be bottom 
feeders whose diet of crustaceans brings them close to shore, and their epic, 
1,300-mile migration from Alaska to Baja California has made them the most 
visible of whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, their proximity to their old nemesis, the human being, has helped 
save them, as generations of Pacific Coast residents and visitors have come to 
know the rambunctious gray whales, and commercial whale-watching has become a 
bread-and-butter industry to towns up and down the Pacific Coast, including 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Holland, who for 10 years has run charter cruises out of Newport Beach, 
said most of her business comes from taking groups to watch gray whales 
migrate. More whales were sighted this year than in the past 10 years, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so exciting to see them," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said she circulated petitions on her cruises this year to keep the 
whale on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once an animal has been put on the endangered list than it should stay on the 
list," she said. "I feel that they'll be hunted again, even though they're not 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Jake Grubb, director of the Surfrider Foundation, which works to protect 
coastal waters, said he also is worried about the removal of the whale from the 
list. Without the listing, the whale's habitat will be more vulnerable, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't have ironclad protection of habitat, you open the door for an 
erosion to occur over time," Grubb said. "Often, you cannot measure that 
erosion until it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Grubb said the migrating whales are visible from the Surfrider Foundation's 
office in San Clemente and also can been seen from a surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're extraordinary," Grubb said. "There's really no other way to describe 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whale is the 22nd species to be delisted since the Endangered Species 
Act was enacted in 1973. The last big animal to come off the list was the 
American alligator in the late 1980s. The 892 plants and animals that remain 
listed as either endangered or threatened include 13 marine mammals, seven of 
which are whale species. 
</P>
<P>
 Still under the jurisdiction of the Marine Mammal Recovery Act, the gray 
whales will be monitored under a five-year plan, according to David 
Hollingshead, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
Hollingshead said the monitoring will involve watching for any changes in the 
whales' migratory habits as well as measuring the level of water-borne 
contaminants, including pesticides and hydrocarbons, that have been known to 
harm smaller marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 David Phillips, executive director of Earth Island Institute, a San 
Francisco-based environmental group opposed to delisting the gray whale, 
contends that the action was prompted, in part, by mounting pressure in 
Congress to show that the Endangered Species Act is not "a one-way street" that 
never acknowledges that a species has regained its health. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phillips acknowledges that the whales have made a substantial 
recovery, he said that without the Endangered Species Act it will be harder to 
regulate any number of activities, ranging from the explosions used in seismic 
exploration to the sea bed disruption caused by oil drilling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before oil companies were allowed to drill, they had to do extensive 
environmental impact reviews," Phillips said. "The degree of protection won't 
be required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act."  
</P>
<P>
 Phillips also contends that delisting will send a signal to the International 
Whaling Commission that a limited resumption of whale hunting by interested 
nations such as Norway and Japan will not hurt the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that there would be a greater chance for open season on gray whales 
outside of U.S. waters," he said.

O.C. TOLLWAY WORK HITS NEW LEGAL ROADBLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ and LESLIE EARNEST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry and passionate protesters converged on Laguna Canyon again Wednesday to 
oppose construction of a tollway, and were aided when an appellate court judge 
temporarily ordered bulldozers to stop work in the environmentally sensitive 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid escalating tension between demonstrators and the transportation agency 
that wants to build the thoroughfare, one protester chained himself to a 
bulldozer and another was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The commotion slowed rush-hour traffic an additional 20 minutes Wednesday 
morning on Laguna Canyon Road, which winds through the scenic canyon. That road 
and Coast Highway are currently the only two routes into the upscale seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just running on emotion and adrenaline right now and sort of just 
making it up as they go," said Michael Phillips, director of the Laguna Canyon 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second day of activity that began Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge 
Linda H. McLaughlin rejected the lawsuit that Laguna Greenbelt Inc. and other 
environmentalists filed against the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor 
Agency and the Federal Highway Administration. The suit contended that federal 
environmental laws had been violated when the toll road project was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, bulldozers began moving earth as protesters gathered to 
denounce what they regard as an environmental catastrophe. At issue are 4.6 
miles of tollway that pierces the Laguna Greenbelt between Newport Coast Drive 
and El Toro Road.  
</P>
<P>
 Upon completion, the road will stretch 17 miles between Newport Beach and San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, about 40 environmentalists returned to Laguna Canyon, hoping to 
deter the bulldozers and enlist sympathy and support from motorists in heavy 
traffic that threads each day along Laguna Canyon Road.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal issued a temporary injunction that 
halted the bulldozers, at least for a few days while the judicial panel 
considers the environmentalists' emergency move to get an injunction pending 
appeal of McLaughlin's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 A final ruling on the appeal of the lower court's ruling is not expected for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction "is a small step, but from our perspective, it's an essential 
step," said Joel R. Reynolds, senior staff attorney for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, which is handling the lawsuit for the environmentalists. "If 
the court does not issue this order, the bulldozers could destroy this area in 
a matter of days." 
</P>
<P>
 When word of the temporary injunction reached the canyon, about two dozen 
demonstrators cheered wildly and ran up to the hillside where the bulldozers 
were perched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop them or we will! We got a restraining order!" the environmentalists 
shouted to police officers who were posted at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day's action, one activist chained himself to a bulldozer and 
another, Jesse Elliott, 22, was arrested for allegedly trespassing after 
blocking the path of a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Elliott is a member of Alliance for Survival and was booked into 
Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who chained himself to the bulldozer, Dylan Rogan, a 24-year-old 
Irvine resident and member of the activist Earth First group, voluntarily gave 
up after about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone needs to do it," Rogan said. "This is destruction of fragile 
habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 While the court order halted the construction work, at least for now, 
environmentalists were disheartened by destruction of trees and other habitat 
that had already occurred after 12 hours' work by the bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dreaded this day for years," said Laguna Beach resident Mark Sanderson. 
"It's too late now. This was a pipe dream to think you could stop the gears of 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds bristled at the speed with which the corridor agency sent the 
bulldozers to work after the district court's decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a total and complete outrage for a public agency to be acting in this 
fashion; for them to so quickly destroy valuable habitat in the midst of Laguna 
Canyon knowing that we were going to be asking for an injunction," Reynolds 
said. "You expect that from private developers, not from a public agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, spokesman for the tollway agency, said work began immediately 
because the agency is nine months behind schedule because of delays caused by 
the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been delayed for nine months, and the public is ultimately going to 
pay the cost of the millions of dollars in delays caused by Mr. Reynolds and 
the plaintiffs in this case," Stockstill said. "There was no legal constraint 
to beginning work." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said it was difficult to estimate how much land had been cleared by 
the bulldozers before the injunction was issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest also seemed to frustrate the half-dozen officers assigned to keep 
the peace at the construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say we do have other things to do," said police Sgt. Lance Ishmael. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said he worried that the 
protest, combined with heavy traffic along Laguna Canyon Road, would cause 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody is going to get hurt or killed before this is over," Purcell said. 
"I don't think one person getting killed is worth this, but emotions are 
running extremely high." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Purcell was overtaken by emotion as he surveyed the bulldozed area. 
Trees that had survived the massive firestorm that roared through the area last 
October, blackening the hillsides from Laguna Canyon Road to Newport Coast 
Drive, were no longer in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was going pretty smoothly until they bulldozed those 
100-year-old-plus oak trees," Purcell said. "They survived our big fire only to 
be plowed down by a big Cat. It got to me. It's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters have kept constant vigil at the site since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While some motorists were obviously irked at having to sit in traffic -- and 
at times drizzling rain -- more seemed to support the protesters, honking and 
flashing thumbs-up signs as they passed by waving placards. Occasionally, angry 
motorists and demonstrators shouted and glared at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your canyon!" one woman shouted at passing motorist. "You should be 
out here!" 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, about 50 environmentalists, including some who had been at 
the canyon throughout the day, kept a vigil and plotted their strategy to 
further delay the project. 
</P>
<P>
 During the vigil, Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida Lenney applauded the 
activists who had kept the unorganized protest going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hear it for Earth First," Lenney rallied. "They not only started (the 
protest), but they kept it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach resident Michael Beanan, 45, also urged the crowd to get "civil 
disobedience" training in anticipation of construction resuming. "We are going 
to be in a situation again here, folks, where we are going to have to risk 
arrest."

CLAS TESTS: HERE'S WHAT'S REALLY IN THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Open the top-secret 1994 California Learning Assessment System test and here's 
some of what you'll find: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think that people today are as strong as their parents and 
grandparents were?" CLAS asks fourth-graders. "Why do you think some teen-agers 
and their parents have problems communicating?" the test queries 
eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 And for 10th-graders: "Why do you think people can seem to be shy in one 
setting and outgoing in another? . . . Why is it that some people appear unable 
to talk at all?" 
</P>
<P>
 These are just three of hundreds of questions, tasks and instructions 
contained in the language arts portion of the state's new student performance 
test, widely praised by educators but also under attack as too personal, too 
political and too vague to gauge student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the tests have not yet been released to the public, copies obtained by 
The Times show much of what critics suspected: provocative readings about race, 
poverty and family relationships coupled with repeated requests for children's 
opinions and reflections on personal experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exams also show that rumors about CLAS have often exaggerated and 
distorted its content, focusing on the most sensitive passages and ignoring the 
context in which issues are discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to hear things that parents say their kids say are on the test 
where that just isn't the case," state Department of Education spokeswoman Jan 
Agee said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Radically different in style from older standardized tests, the new assessment 
system seeks to gauge what students know through a variety of methods: from 
doodling exercises and group discussions to essays that require students to 
connect literary themes to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 On various versions of the tests, students are prompted to display their 
writing skills by discussing a time when they did or said something they now 
regret, dreaming up a list of TV programs, or describing someone who does not 
go along with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of computer-scanned answer sheets, CLAS is graded by specially trained 
schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million children in 7,500 schools took CLAS this spring, at a cost 
of $26 million, amid a chorus of criticism from conservative Christian groups, 
some educators and hundreds of parents. Opponents contend that CLAS is too 
subjective to serve as a valid testing tool and that the language-arts segments 
violate state law by questioning children about morality without parental 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials and supporters in industry and academia insist that 
the tests are necessary to revive public education in California and will 
improve schools. The pointed questions gauge analytical thinking and prompt 
students to write passionately, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have denied that CLAS violates state law and have ordered school 
districts to administer the exams, but the Department of Education responded to 
public pressure last month by allowing parents to withdraw their children from 
the exams. At least one district, Fullerton Elementary, has refused to give the 
exams this year despite threats of legal action by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education has refused parent requests to view the tests, 
arguing that statewide tests are always confidential to protect the integrity 
of the exam.

<P>
 Now that CLAS testing is complete, state officials plan to release portions of 
CLAS next month to public libraries. But so far actual test questions have not 
been revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Each student taking the test receives a sealed envelope containing a Student 
Information Form, a set of color-coded exam booklets sporting pictures of 
happy-faced students and stickers with bar-code labels to ensure secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 The information forms pose questions on ethnic background, parent occupation, 
English-language proficiency and achievement levels, as well as inquiries about 
how many hours children spend each day doing homework and watching television. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders take tests in language arts and math, while 
fifth-graders take exams in science and history/social science. 
</P>
<P>
 The language arts component, by far the most controversial, contains separate 
booklets for reading, group work and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS features stories about California youth by prominent authors -- including 
Maxine Hong Kingston and Dick Gregory -- plus classics like an Aesop's fable, a 
poem by John Updike and a piece from Richard Wright's "Black Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 The readings deal with difficult themes: discrimination, fear, dreams, 
homelessness, hunger, dysfunctional families, religion, crime and death. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading his or her assigned selection, each student is asked for an 
initial response to the story, and given space for "ideas, questions or 
opinions." Later, there is space for them to "write anything else . . . what it 
means to you, what it reminds you of, how it relates to your own life." 
</P>
<P>
 In between are a variety of exercises: "double-entry journals," in which 
students copy passages and respond to them and "open minds" or "thought 
balloons," in which students sketch drawings and images or jot down a few words 
that show characters' feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 On some versions of the test, there is space for students to draw posters 
depicting a scene from the story. On others they are asked to identify 
similarities and differences between two parts of a reading and diagram them in 
overlapping circles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend the second day of testing in groups, performing another 
half-dozen exercises in which they reflect on the previous day's readings and 
take notes to prepare for writing. The writing segment consists of one essay 
connected to the reading but exploring a broader topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a closer look at the exams given to each grade. 10TH GRADE 
</P>
<P>
 Each student reads one of these selections: Kingston's memoir of her childhood 
as a Chinese immigrant; a story about a son's changing image of his father; one 
boy's recollection of his friendship with his Spanish-speaking 
great-grandmother, and a pair of poems about heroic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an excerpt from "The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts," 
Kingston tells of her silence in American school and her lively chatter during 
evening Chinese school. In one of the most often criticized passages of the 
entire CLAS exam, the author recalls her mother slicing underneath her tongue 
-- "so that you would not be tongue-tied" -- but the test later asks students 
whether they believe Kingston's tongue was ever actually cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In groups, students are instructed to "think about a time in your own life 
when you were unable to speak, and a time when you were talkative or noisy" and 
discuss those memories. The writing assignment asks why children "feel unable 
to speak or to have nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish author Par Lagerkvist's "Father and I" chronicles a walk along the 
railroad tracks. The boy in the story becomes frightened as night falls, and 
his father soothes him by reminding him of God. But the boy quivers, convinced 
that God "too was horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 In individual and group exercises, readers are told to think "about how most 
high-school students relate to their parents or other adults," and "how a 
changing relationship can be important in a person's life." Some students are 
asked to write essays interpreting the relationship between father and son, 
while others are told to describe an incident "from which you learned something 
important about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 A third reading for 10th-graders is "The Horned Toad," by Gerald Haslam, which 
opens with a bilingual conversation among members of a California family. In 
the reading, a Spanish-speaking woman chastises her great-grandson for removing 
a toad from its home. When the old lady dies, the boy remembers this lesson, 
and insists that she be buried where she had lived. 
</P>
<P>
 This test includes a supposed essay contest titled "The Relationship Between 
Where We Live and Who We Are."  
</P>
<P>
 Updike's "Ex-Basketball Player" is paired with "Memoirs of an Athlete Dying 
Young," by A.E. Housman, to form the final 10th-grade reading. Here, exercises 
concern achievement, with the caveat that "achievements can be public (an honor 
or award) or private (something only you know about)." EIGHTH GRADE 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-school students receive two more language arts booklets than fourth- 
and 10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading for Information" has three nonfiction passages (about Louis Pasteur, 
polar bears and Dorothea Dix), followed by multiple-choice questions requiring 
close reading. For "Independent Writing," students must write a letter to help 
an aunt and uncle dress as "typical teen-agers" for a costume party. 
</P>
<P>
 But the largest source of debate is still the reading, group work and writing 
portions, in which eighth-graders use one of six coming-of-age stories, most of 
which deal with ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory's "Not Poor, Just Broke" tells of a fatherless black second-grader 
trying to impress a girl with a big donation to the charity pot -- only to be 
shamed when his teacher points out that he receives money from the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Looking for Work," Gary Soto revisits a poor, 9-year-old Latino desperate 
to live like Beaver Cleaver's family. Morley Callaghan writes of a mother's 
disappointment in her son, who steals from the drugstore where he works, in 
"All the Years of Her Life." And "What I Want to Be When I Grow Up," by Martha 
Brooks, chronicles bus rides to the orthodontist by a sarcastic, judgmental 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two selections that have raised the most ire from critics are "Black 
Boy" and Marta Salinas' "The Scholarship Jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 The excerpt from Richard Wright's award-winning novel opens with a stark 
passage about a child's severe hunger. Wright's mother sends him to the store 
for food, but a gang beats him up and steals his money. She sends him back into 
the street with a stick, instructing him not to return until he has the 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought to lay them low, to knock them cold, to kill them so that they could 
not strike back at me," Wright remembers in the story. "The boys scattered, 
yelling, nursing their heads in utter disbelief. . . . The parents of the boys 
rushed into the streets and threatened me, and for the first time in my life I 
shouted at grown-ups." 
</P>
<P>
 Students read "Black Boy" along with the Stephen Spender poem "My Parents," 
then "write an essay . . . speculating about the reasons some parents try too 
hard to protect their children from the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' autobiographical story shows her as a poor Latina eighth-grader who 
is first in her class, eager to win the valedictorian's jacket. The girl -- 
called Martha at school and Marta at home -- overhears two teachers talking 
about giving the jacket to the second-place student, a white girl whose father 
is on the school board and owns the only store in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the principal tells Martha that the scholarship jacket will cost $15; 
Martha's grandfather refuses to pay, saying a scholarship jacket should not be 
bought. Ultimately, Martha does win the jacket free. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the story, students fill in a chart of "problems at school," 
then write an essay "about a person you listen to and respect." FOURTH GRADE 
</P>
<P>
 For elementary-school students, the print on the exam booklets is larger, but 
the literature addresses similar themes. There are seven different reading 
tests, including poetry, a biographical sketch of Rosa Parks, folk tales and 
short stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Two stories by Cynthia Rylant show the tragedy of homelessness, followed by 
group and writing exercises about loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angel Child, Dragon Child," by Michele Maria Surat, depicts a Vietnamese girl 
who is shunned at school for not speaking English, but eventually makes a 
friend who helps her raise money to bring her mother to America. Students are 
then asked to write a booklet giving advice to new students at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Tomie dePaola's "Now One Foot, Then the Other" tells a touching tale of 
a grandfather who teaches a little boy to walk, then has a stroke. The boy -- 
named for the old man -- then teaches the grandfather to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretend your school is giving a 'Helping Hand Award,' " the test instructs. 
"Write about a time when you helped someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Fireflies!" a girl runs outside to catch the lightning bugs she sees out 
her window, then notices them struggling inside her jar and sets them free. 
After reading Julie Brinckloe's story, students draw pictures of what they see 
out a window at home, and "what you might see if you looked out (a) wishing 
window into the world as you wish it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The three other fourth-grade tests have pairs of readings. 
</P>
<P>
 On one exam, there are two folk tales about loneliness: "How the Leopard Got 
His Spots," from Africa, and "Bird That Sings Sad Songs," a Navajo Indian myth. 
Students must create a conversation between animal characters in the two tales, 
then "write about what it is like to be by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar selections are on a second test, with Leo Lionni's "Frederick" and 
Aesop's fable "The Grasshopper and the Ant." Frederick, a field mouse, gathers 
"sun" and "color" and "words" while his comrades gather food for winter, then 
exchanges beautiful images for something to eat. But the grasshopper dances all 
summer, then begs in vain for the ant to share its food. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is an account concerning Parks and the Montgomery, Ala., bus 
boycott, paired with a Margaret Walker poem about black female ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about a rule at your school -- on the playground, in the cafeteria, or 
in the classroom -- that you think needs to be changed," the test instructs, 
picking up the protest theme. "Write a letter to the principal about a school 
rule you want changed." CLAS Readings 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's new standardized tests, students read literature selections -- 
many of them coming-of-age stories by prominent California authors -- then

COLUMN ONE; GANGS FIND FRESH TURF IN SALVADOR; WHETHER BY CHOICE OR BY FORCE, 
MANY L.A. YOUTHS HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR HOMELAND BRINGING WITH THEM A VIOLENT 
SUBCULTURE. IT'S TAKEN ROOT AMONG DISAFFECTED TEEN-AGERS PRIMED BY YEARS OF 
WAR.

<P>
 The teen-agers crowding at the edge of the central plaza flash hand signs, 
share a marijuana joint and swap stories of the previous night's exploits. 
Dressed in baggy pants, their arms and chests covered with tattoos, their hair 
slicked back, they speak a street Spanish mixed with street English and call 
each other by gang nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whassup, home?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Hollywood Locos gang -- El Salvador branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest product of the longstanding social and economic ties between El 
Salvador and the United States, especially Southern California, is something 
neither side is particularly eager to claim: a rapidly expanding and 
increasingly violent gang subculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs formed by Salvadorans in Los Angeles have long been considered among the 
most ruthless and deadly. But with El Salvador's civil war finally winding 
down, members of those gangs have been returning here -- some by choice, many 
by force, as immigration authorities step up deportation of convicted felons 
and other lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 They bring with them their murderous ways and brutal rituals. They recruit 
among El Salvador's abundant disaffected youth, form new gangs or co-opt the 
existing school-based gangs. Law enforcement authorities say the gangs are 
partly responsible for a huge surge in crime that is terrorizing Salvadorans 
just as they struggle to recover from war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finding, every day, more and more influence from the Los Angeles gangs 
-- the way they dress, the way they celebrate, their ceremonies. . . ," said 
national deputy police chief Rodrigo Avila. "The internationalization of these 
gangs is a scary thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti common in Los Angeles neighborhoods have sprouted up all over San 
Salvador, in this suburb of the capital and even in the smallest rural towns. 
Some of the graffiti welcome "homeboys" -- in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Versions of several Los Angeles gangs now exist in El Salvador, including the 
notorious Mara Salvatrucha and its principal enemy, 18th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon is not limited to this country. Police in Belize, for example, 
report the arrival of alleged members of the Crips and Bloods gangs. But 
nowhere has the importation of gangs flourished as it has here. 
</P>
<P>
 Postwar Salvadoran society is enormously fertile ground for gangs: This is a 
cruelly violent country where guns, grenades and other weapons abound. 
Unemployment is high and opportunity low, especially for youths. The war and 
the migration of more than 1 million Salvadorans in the last decade have left 
families broken, parents separated from children and children deprived of 
authority figures or role models. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a curious case of reverse culture shock, many of the Salvadoran 
gangsters who are returning to El Salvador spent most of their lives in the 
United States. They know Western or Normandie better than San Salvador's Plaza 
Libertad. They come here barely able to speak Spanish and with few ties to the 
local community, making the gang network all the more crucial to what they see 
as their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Ominously, they also bring with them the same deadly rivalries that they had 
in the States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Amaya, a shaven-headed member of Mara Salvatrucha, says he was deported 
from Los Angeles in March after finishing a two-year prison sentence for drug 
dealing. He had lived in California for 19 of his 20 years and was arrested 
three times before being deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it here," he said. "All my life is in L.A. My family is there. 
My money is better there. I got enemies here. Like I been deported, they been 
deported. He's my enemy in L.A., he's my enemy here too. So I kick with my 
homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya was holding court around midnight recently outside the main pavilion of 
San Salvador's International Fairgrounds. Weekend concerts and dances at this 
site have become the gangs' favorite legal entertainment; it's a place to 
gather, get drunk and plot ways to kill adversaries. Hundreds attend, to the 
chagrin of residents and police. Some gangs even charter buses for followers 
from rural hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Saturday night, agents from the paramilitary National Police formed a 
cordon outside the pavilion and rounded up about 25 boys who looked like gang 
wanna-bes. They wore baggy pants and long T-shirts, but most were younger than 
16 and not armed. Older boys hid the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Police -- la chota in gang slang -- loaded the detainees into a pickup truck. 
As it pulled away, the boys flashed their hands in the shape of an "M" for mara 
, the Spanish slang for gang , and shouted, "M.S., rifa!" "Mara Salvatrucha 
rules!" 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are minors, the boys eventually will be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs have existed in El Salvador since the late 1950s, but until recently 
they were more likely to be associated with schools and would fight each other 
over things like basketball games, perhaps over territory, but not over 
business interests or crime franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 The student gangs were not inclined to attack outsiders, and their weapons 
usually were nothing more deadly than knives. The war between leftist 
guerrillas and U.S.-backed armies in the 1980s made these gangs more violent as 
it made society more violent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Into this milieu came the repatriated Los Angeles gang members, and suddenly 
there was an explosion in the number of gangs and the level of violence. 
Authorities say more than 230 gangs exist in El Salvador, with thousands of 
members. While no one keeps statistics on gang crimes, police routinely arrest 
scores of purported gang members every week, for offenses ranging from 
loitering to the recent case of a young man who threw a hand grenade onto a 
passenger bus, killing two people. 
</P>
<P>
 They traffic in drugs, steal cars and mug pedestrians. According to police and 
to the gang members' own testimony, they have joined rings -- sometimes with 
army officers -- that smuggle stolen vehicles from Southern California to 
Central America, and weapons north to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gang members came to El Salvador because of the heat they were feeling in 
the United States. Amid growing public outcry, U.S. officials recently stepped 
up their efforts to crack down on gangsters and illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service formed the Violent Gang Task 
Force two years ago to investigate and deport foreign-born gang members who are 
in the United States illegally. Those who have legal permanent residency but 
have committed felonies are also subject to deportation by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A.-based Mara Salvatrucha, made up of Salvadorans, is one of the gangs 
the task force has targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are focusing on that gang in particular because it is one of the most 
substantial and violent in Southern California," Chief Special Agent Michael 
Flynn said in a telephone interview from INS Western Region headquarters in 
Laguna Niguel. "I think we've had an impact. Have we dissolved the gang? No. It 
continues in L.A. . . . We've been successful in being a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, about 70 Salvadoran gang members were formally deported by the task 
force, Flynn said. Hundreds more left through other deportation programs or on 
their own. The INS has deportation holds on another 600 Salvadoran convicted 
felons who are in the California state prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 The official numbers tell only part of the story, because the influence of 
gang members who arrive in El Salvador has a ripple effect. One member of the 
Mara Salvatrucha can indoctrinate dozens of youths. And then others emulate 
what they see or have heard about, so that eventually gangs styled after those 
in Los Angeles spring up all over the country. Finally, additional gangs form 
as defenses against the new gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new gangsters have never even been to the States, but they use the 
vocabulary and know which of their rivals they are supposed to hate. A member 
of the Mara Salvatrucha, identifiable by his tattoos, crosses paths with 
someone from the 18th Street, and that is sufficient to start a fight to the 
death -- even though neither knows what the rivalry is about. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of U.N.-brokered peace accords that ended the civil war in 1992, the 
Salvadoran army was cut in half and the guerrilla army disbanded, leaving about 
40,000 former combatants from both sides for whom killing was their most valued 
skill. They are natural recruits for the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 So authorities and citizens alike are faced with a dilemma: As it tries to 
rebuild after the war, El Salvador has little use for the added violence of 
L.A. gangs. Yet these are Salvadoran nationals, after all, who do have a right 
to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangs are a scourge on our citizens," said an angry caller to a local radio 
program, a comment that is heard frequently. "They learned this in Los Angeles. 
Unfortunately, our people go there and are marginalized, and these are the 
things they learn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadorans here are only starting to confront the gang problem. Avila, the 
deputy police chief, sought ideas by visiting Los Angeles police and county 
sheriff's departments last year, as well as the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, with the exception of an occasional vocational training course, 
there are no government programs aimed at preventing youths from joining gangs. 
El Salvador's notoriously corrupt and ineffective justice system is clearly 
overwhelmed and loses ground daily in its feeble efforts to fight the 
increasing number of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 What is perhaps most surprising to observers of traditional Salvadoran society 
is the emergence of female gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla Georgina Ramirez was 8 when she went to live with her mother in Los 
Angeles in 1986, an especially fratricidal period in the civil war. By the time 
she was a student at a Hollywood junior high school, however, Carla had fallen 
in with gangs. After one nasty fight last year with rival gang members in 
"Los," as the gangsters call Los Angeles, Carla's mother decided to send the 
15-year-old back to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom says that there was too many problems," Carla said. "They (the rivals) 
said they was going to kill me -- that's what they told my mom. So that's why 
my mom doesn't wanna take me back. I wanna go back but she doesn't want to take 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carla, who wears thick eyeliner and has teased bangs, says the adjustment has 
been difficult. She hates the fact that Salvadoran students have to wear 
uniforms to school and that the Wendy's hamburgers and Pizza Hut pizza that she 
loved in L.A. are a lot more expensive here. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla's mother does not know she is hanging out with her "homeboys" 2,300 
miles from her former home. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwin D. Hernandez, convicted of a felony weapons charge, returned to El 
Salvador last year after living in San Fernando for 13 years. He had left when 
he was 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel funny 'cause when I get off the plane, it's like, I looked, right, and 
I say, this ain't my place," said Hernandez, who left a 6-year-old son in Los 
Angeles. "I was depressed when I got to El Salvador. I'm poor here. I wasn't 
poor in L.A. I had a car. Family. You put $5 in gas you can drive all day. Over 
there, anybody can go to the supermarket. Here only people with money can go. . 
. . There is no future here, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the gang members said with sadness that the lack of easy access to 
cars here makes it more difficult to do drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million Salvadorans -- one-fifth the population -- left this 
country during the 12-year civil war, fleeing the killing or simply looking for 
economic opportunity. The vast majority ended up in Southern California and 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Salvadoran youths seeking gangs -- for protection, as a surrogate 
family or for other reasons -- hooked up with Mexican-American gangs. But by 
the early 1980s, driven in part by cultural differences and hatreds, they had 
begun to branch off to form their own organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in El Salvador, a common immigration pattern was for parents to go to the 
United States and leave their children with grandparents, aunts and uncles or 
other, often inattentive, relatives for whom child care was a burden. 
Discipline, education, values -- all declined for some of the children, who had 
little supervision and became eager gang recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of people who work with gangs in El Salvador further blame the 
increase in local activity on rampant drug abuse, a permissive society without 
rules in which life is cheap, and the hostile marginalization of the poor and 
hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had violence in our streets, but the (Mara Salvatrucha) ended up 
reinforcing this type of conduct," said social worker Sonia de Jesus Solorzano. 
"These are kids who do not work, do not study. They have no goals in life. They 
are the sons of people who have emigrated, people who went to the States so 
they could make a better life for their kids. So they send back dollars, but 
their homes have disintegrated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong study of gangs conducted by the Jesuit-run University of Central 
America in San Salvador found that the average gang member comes from an 
unstable home where he lives with up to 13 relatives. Most come from families 
with a monthly income of 100 to 700 colones, or about $12 to $82, and more than 
60% are unemployed or underemployed, meaning they earn poverty wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Solorzano and her partner, Ana Maritza Alvarenga, work in neighborhoods where 
gangs hold sway and charge "entrance fees," a kind of protection fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarenga tells of boarding a bus and running into eight shirtless young 
Salvadorans who spoke "Spanglish" and were covered with gang tattoos. They 
clearly had only recently arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not from here," she said. "They were going along as though they 
were here visiting, like tourists." 
</P>
<P>
 The repatriated gang members teach their new followers the range of rituals, 
from how to challenge and defy police to the hazing techniques of beating up on 
the newly initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, a Mara Salvatrucha ringleader here, lived with his mother in Hollywood 
for 13 years from the time he was 6. He was arrested 38 times before he was 18, 
he says, but it was a cocaine sales conviction, at age 19, that got him 
deported. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year he was back, he said, he felt lost. But as more of his gang 
buddies began to arrive from Los Angeles, they organized, and Carlos again had 
his support network.

 Unlike many of his cohorts, he took a steady job driving a truck, but he 
spends his nights getting high with his "homeboys," who make money by stealing 
spare tires.

 Not long after his return, Carlos got into a fight over a parking spot. The 
other fellow was an army lieutenant who settled the dispute by shooting Carlos 
in the shoulder. Carlos ended up in the notorious Mariona national prison, 
until he bribed a judge to release him. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos plans to stick it out in El Salvador for a few years, and then, he 
said, he will return to Los Angeles, legally if he can, or illegally if he 
must. "When I get back home," he said through a marijuana haze, "I won't get 
into what I was in before."

WARNINGS ON WORKERS' COMP FLAWS IGNORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials had repeated warnings for at least five years that 
the city workers' compensation system was badly flawed, and even ripe for 
fraud, but they did little to correct the problems, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time serious attempts to reform the system began this year, police say, 
taxpayers may have been cheated out of as much as $1 million by an alleged 
fraud ring. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force reported that the city's expenses for injured workers had 
spiraled out of control, with municipal employees filing injury claims at 
nearly twice the rate of other government employees and payments per worker 
averaging $2,169, more than 2 1/2 times the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 The warnings from the task force -- appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan and 
City Atty. James K. Hahn -- were far from the first to confront the Workers' 
Compensation Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors from within city government and from the private sector have warned 
since at least 1989 that the city paid too much for worker injury cases and 
that screening to prevent excessive payments to employees, physicians and 
others was in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the workers' compensation system's imperviousness to change is 
one of reforms being lost or diluted as they passed through layers of 
bureaucracy, of elected officials refusing to make short-term payments for 
potential long-term gains and of the system's resistance to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had implemented some of the recommendations, we think it would have 
prevented much of the fraud that is alleged to have taken place," said City 
Controller Rick Tuttle, whose office audited the workers' compensation system 
twice in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though others familiar with the workers' compensation system agreed that 
reforms could have saved money, they questioned whether any safeguards can 
prevent abuse by high-ranking and trusted employees. One such employee is under 
investigation for allegedly conspiring to defraud the system of about $1 
million. Thelma Bowman, a principal workers' compensation analyst who 
supervised 20 employees, was recently placed on paid administrative leave 
pending completion of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly exceedingly difficult to prevent (fraud) when you have 
collusion from a high level on the inside," said Carol Williams, assistant 
chief of the Workers' Compensation Division since late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not in dispute is the need for reform of the city's program for paying 
injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the city's workers' compensation claims jumped more than 2 
1/2 times over a decade to $86.5 million in 1992-93. With an all-time high of 
42,000 cases now open, there is the equivalent of nearly one claim for each 
city employee. About one-third of those are suspected to be files for employees 
who have returned to work or left city employment, files that should have been 
closed so that they did not become susceptible to fraudulent billings. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as a 1989 audit, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie cited the 
potential for fraud and recommended hiring a private firm to reduce some of the 
caseload for workers' compensation analysts, who have reportedly carried up to 
seven times the recommended caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 Comrie's office also said a computer system should be revamped to ensure the 
accuracy of payouts and a form created for employees to verify that they had 
received the treatment that a doctor said they had. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the verification form typifies that of other reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Comrie's report suggested that without such verification of the patients, 
doctors "may bill against a legitimate claim number for inflated or fraudulent 
service costs." In fact, three doctors are being investigated for just such 
billings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the administrators of the Workers' Compensation Division resisted the 
change. They reported that they had policies to "provide appropriate control 
over the bill-paying process." They also wrote to Comrie that it could be 
cumbersome and difficult for an overworked staff to process more paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers' compensation managers further cited an opinion from the city 
attorney's office that said employee verification could be requested but that 
if it was not received doctors would still have to be paid. Assistant City 
Atty. Thomas Theis wrote at the time that because an employee's signature was 
not specifically required in the state Labor Code, the lack of a signature 
could not be used to deny payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Comrie's auditors to this day defend the proposal for the verification 
safeguard, saying it would have drawn attention to doctors who submitted many 
bills without signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the time -- faced with the opposition from Workers' Compensation 
managers and the city attorney's opinion -- Comrie's office backed off on the 
recommendation. The City Council tabled the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recommendation of the Comrie audit, hiring a private firm to reduce 
the backlog of workers' compensation cases, also fell by the wayside. Although 
$200,000 was set aside and the City Council was told the work would begin by 
early 1991, the Workers' Compensation Division let the program languish. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurutha Brown, former head of the division, and her supervisor, Ray Allen, 
both said they were waiting for an outside auditor to complete a top-to-bottom 
review of the workers' compensation system before beginning attempts to reduce 
the case backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said he was not convinced that such a contract would be the most 
cost-beneficial and that he also lacked enough staff to draft a proposal to 
private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle's office was the next to make an effort with the Workers' Compensation 
Division in a 1990 audit and a review two years later of the division's 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 report, the firm of Balbin & Co. of Los Angeles detailed 14 
weaknesses in the workers' compensation system and recommended improvements 
including: improved documentation by analysts when billings and payments 
differed; creation of flow charts so employees could better understand 
processing of claims, and promulgation of rules that allowed only supervisors 
to increase the maximum amount that could be paid on an employee's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a harshly worded response, the Personnel Department said that about 
half the recommendations were superfluous and that existing procedures were 
sufficient. Other changes were being put in place, the memo promised, but it 
also accused the auditing firm of a "lack of a full understanding of the system 
itself and of the complexities of workers' compensation in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Armstrong, auditing director for the controller's office, said in an 
interview this week that Brown obstructed that audit by failing to cooperate 
with the firm. "It would be kind if I used the word uncooperative to describe 
her," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said it was the firm's chief auditor who caused conflict by refusing "to 
understand how our system worked and how the city worked." She said that, 
inexplicably, recommendations were made for improvements that were already in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Workers' Compensation Division made its final response to the 
audit, Stanley Gronos had replaced Brown. (Brown had been moved to another 
post, as part of a routine rotation within the Personnel Department.) The 
workers' compensation management agreed to at least study many of the auditor's 
proposals, to decide whether they could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller's office auditors said that they had hoped for more than the 
lukewarm response, but that they have limited staffing to enforce audits and 
were forced to move to other matters. "We are somewhat reliant on management's 
representations they are going to take action and make changes," Armstrong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most anticipated review of the department, though, was the study by the 
Newport Beach-based firm of Warren, McVeigh. The report was conceived in 1989 
as the comprehensive review that would draw a new course for administering 
injured workers' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 When a first draft of the report was ready in March, 1992, it provided a sharp 
rebuke of the entire Workers' Compensation Division, calling its performance 
"well below the industry standard." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm also found that city analysts were hopeless about making 
improvements. Employees shifted blame to others, and few took responsibility to 
complete a task, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the observations and nearly 50 recommended reforms were not disseminated 
for 21 months to the commission that oversees the Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the report said that division managers Brown and Gronos 
failed to respond to the audit, leaving it in a draft form that could not be 
released to the commission and the public. "These things don't have to be 
released until they are finalized," said the source. "Would you want that 
report released?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Gronos denied that they tried to hold up the report. Their 
supervisor, Allen, said the report languished in part because of the shift in 
command of the worker's compensation section from Brown to Gronos. He conceded 
that the completion of the report "took way too long" and "shouldn't have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was released in December, it became part of a blueprint for the first 
substantive changes in the Workers' Compensation Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Faye Washington became head of the Personnel Department in the following 
months and began to institute many of the recommended changes. 
</P>
<P>
 A risk manager is expected to be hired within the next few weeks to revamp the 
entire system for paying injured employees and their doctors. A proposal is 
expected to go to the City Council by the end of the month to hire a firm to 
reduce the massive case backlog. And the council will also soon be asked to 
hire a private firm to manage some new cases and to test Mayor Richard 
Riordan's theory that an outside contractor can do the job more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important, there is an acknowledgment that the system is broke and we do 
need to fix it," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warren, McVeigh report also supported the Workers' Compensation Division 
management in calling for a massive increase in staffing, to a total of 40 
analysts from 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar requests have been sent to the mayor and City Council repeatedly since 
1989, but most have been rebuffed because of the city's tight finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and Finance 
Committee, said the managers of the workers' compensation system never properly 
emphasized the dire need for more analysts. "Department general managers know 
that when you urgently need a hiring freeze exemption, that you should call the 
mayor, the head of the Budget and Finance Committee or the head of the 
Personnel Committee," Yaroslavsky said. "No such call was made."

CLINTON MAY SEEK LESS ON HEALTH CARE; LEGISLATION: OFFICIALS SAY PRESIDENT 
MIGHT ACCEPT BILL THAT SOFTENS HIS PLEDGE OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. A 'PHASE-IN 
PERIOD' IS UNDER CONSIDERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although President Clinton publicly continues to insist that he will veto 
health care reform legislation that falls short of universal coverage, White 
House officials privately acknowledged Wednesday that he might be prepared to 
accept a measure that settles for something less. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton first drew his line in the sand, it was a clear and simple one: 
He would not sign any health care bill that did not guarantee every American 
private health insurance that could never be taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with the congressional debate over health care legislation at a 
critical and delicate stage, the sands are shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, the compromises now on the table would delay universal coverage 
-- possibly into the Administration of another President, who could stop it 
altogether. Other proposals -- thus far rejected by Clinton -- stop well short 
of ever guaranteeing coverage for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 With a softening of the line on universal coverage, new questions arise, both 
in the Administration and on Capitol Hill: Should the President hold out for 
legislation that covers 99% of the public? Would 95% be enough? How about 91%? 
And is covering an additional 2% or 3% or even 9% of the population so 
important that it is worth sacrificing the benefits that a less ambitious bill 
might provide to hundreds of millions? 
</P>
<P>
 If the President is willing to lower his sights, he might have a deal. But he 
would also have reneged on his pledge. Such a possibility has a haunting ring 
for Democrats, who exploited President George Bush's failure to keep his 
"read-my-lips" promise to veto new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, noted in an interview 
Wednesday that "the President is insisting on universal coverage. There was no 
backing off on that." But, Ickes went on to stress, "universal" can be an 
extremely flexible concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, where officials once talked of the onset of universal coverage as a 
single event -- a date certain by which all Americans would have an insurance 
plan -- they now more often describe it as a "process." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a phase-in period," Ickes said. "The questions are whether the 
phase-in period is a reasonable amount of time and whether at the end of the 
process everyone is covered." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure to redefine the bedrock concept of universal coverage comes as 
the White House and leaders in Congress have begun to negotiate in earnest over 
the most controversial element of the President's health care reform plan, his 
proposal to require employers to pay 80% of their workers' health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only through such a requirement could universal coverage ever become a reality 
in a privately run health care system. However, business groups argue that the 
additional expense also could force many smaller and weaker firms to lay off 
workers or shut down altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the two sides have battled each other to a deadlock. But there has 
been evidence of more flexibility in recent days. Both Democrats and 
Republicans have advanced proposals under which the so-called employer mandate 
could be "triggered" if other reforms did not succeed in extending coverage to 
all or virtually all of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 The main sticking point for the White House appears to be assuring that 
Clinton is able to plausibly say to the American people that the bill he signs 
does "guarantee private insurance for all Americans" at some point. "You have 
to have some kind of guarantee," said one senior Clinton aide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, some of those most anxious to cut a deal say even that is too 
much to realistically ask. Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) noted that when 
government statisticians talk about "full employment," they generally mean that 
at least 94.5% of the labor force is working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why doesn't the same logic apply when you are talking about health care 
costs?" Breaux asked. He pointed to a study showing that 91% of the population, 
whose health care bills represent 97% of the nation's medical costs, could be 
covered without an employer mandate if reforms were made in the health 
insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 The true calculations, however, are far more complicated than that. Even under 
Breaux's approach, Clinton's advisers argued, about 25 million people would 
remain without coverage. Four-fifths of them would be people with jobs, 
generally low-paid workers at small firms. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Breaux's proposal and others assume that if employers are not 
forced to subsidize the health coverage of those who cannot afford it, the 
government would -- to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars over five 
years, according to most estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, health care experts warned that it will be more difficult to 
rein in overall health care costs if large numbers of people remain without 
coverage. That is because the costs of treating the uninsured will continue to 
be shifted onto those who have coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of weakened resolve on universal coverage have alarmed many of 
Clinton's most loyal allies. "We're on a slippery slope here. God knows where 
it will end," said one lobbyist for a group that has ardently supported the 
President's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, if the President goes too far to appease the right, he could lose 
liberal votes. "They have some belief down there (at the White House) that they 
can get us any time they snap their fingers," said Rep. Jim McDermott 
(D-Wash.), who leads a faction of 90-plus House members who support universal 
coverage in the form of a government-financed health care plan modeled after 
Canada's system. "The only thing they understand is when you don't vote for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is far from certain that a compromise would hurt Clinton 
politically. Polls indicate that universal coverage is not the issue that is 
fueling middle-class sentiment for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what the public thinks is major reform, things they really want, is 
really rather minor insurance reforms -- ending the pre-existing condition 
requirement, for example," said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, referring to 
the situation in which people who have known illnesses have difficulty 
affording insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Administration gets some piece of that, they're going to be fine" with 
voters, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP pollster Richard B. Wirthlin agreed that it would be more dangerous 
politically for Clinton to hold on to his principles at the risk of seeing his 
entire effort fail. "They need a win," Wirthlin said. "It's very hard to recoup 
anything positive from a legislative defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the fact that trade-offs on universal coverage are even being 
discussed appears to indicate that the health care debate has moved from 
rhetoric to realism. "In some ways, I find it really heartening. For the first 
time since we started this high-profile debate, we're really grappling with the 
fact that this is tough stuff," said Ed Howard, executive vice president of the 
Alliance for Health Care Reform, a research and advocacy group that supports 
universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill the gritty business of trying to produce health 
care legislation continued, with little progress evident among the four 
committees that have yet to pass a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Ways and Means Committee dissolved in disarray Wednesday after 
opposition developed to some provisions of an amendment, offered by Rep. 
William J. Jefferson (D-La.), that was supposed to be the glue to hold together 
a shaky Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson's proposal combined larger tax credits for small businesses with 
fewer than 50 employees, a reduced level of tobacco tax increase to help pay 
for the plan, halving the proposed tax on insurance premiums and a three-year 
postponement -- to the year 2000 -- of proposed long-term care for severely 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment was designed to attract the votes of several Democrats, 
including Rep. Lewis F. Payne Jr., who represents a tobacco-growing district in 
Virginia, as well as solidify the support of Jefferson and Rep. Peter Hoagland, 
a moderate from Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal to reduce the tobacco tax increase from 60 cents, as 
recommended by committee Chairman Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), to 45 cents, drew fire 
from other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Finance Committee, which is considered the most fertile ground for 
a grand compromise, began its effort to draft a bill with a discussion of 
insurance issues that most of its members already agree upon. It will continue 
its work behind closed doors next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, the politically powerful American Medical Assn. on Wednesday urged 
Congress to pass some type of health care reform, and its members promised that 
it would not automatically oppose any of the approaches that are likely to come 
out of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been saying since 1990 that we need health system reform. We'd be very 
disappointed if there was no legislation by this fall," AMA Executive Vice 
President James Todd told reporters during a break in the organization's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are flexible. We are willing to look at almost anything that achieves 
health system reform," Todd said.

GRAY WHALE REMOVED FROM ENDANGERED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its population approaching historic high levels, the California gray 
whale, the beast of prey that became a majestic icon of the deep, was removed 
Wednesday from the endangered species list, making it the first marine creature 
to be delisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated at 21,000, gray whales may be as numerous today as they were before 
an American whaling ship discovered their breeding grounds off the Baja 
California peninsula in 1855 and began the commercial slaughter that decimated 
the species. Commercial whaling wiped out two other gray whale populations in 
the Atlantic during Colonial times, and later in the western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the gray whales will remain under the jurisdiction of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, which shields them from hunting in U.S. waters, several 
environmental groups warn that the whales will be more vulnerable to a variety 
of hazards -- such as oil drilling, sea mining, salt extraction and tourism -- 
than they were as an officially endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say such commercial activities will no longer require the 
stringent reviews mandated by the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delisting from the Endangered Species Act removes a protection that has been 
vital to recovery," said Maxine McCloskey of the Sierra Club. "It will leave 
them more vulnerable to pollution and other environmental hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the environmental pressures appear greatest in Mexico, where 
ambitious plans for seaside resort development as well as salt mining could 
disturb the tranquillity of the bays and lagoons that have been safe harbors 
for newborn whales for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Endangered Species Act jurisdiction does not extend to foreign 
waters, critics of delisting argue that it will make it harder for Mexican 
environmentalists to resist pressure for intense development along the Baja 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whale's recovery is attributed to a variety of factors, beginning in 
the 1930s with a series of international whaling bans. However, exemptions 
continued to permit subsistence hunting of nearly 170 whales each year by 
native peoples in Alaska and Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, the National Marine Mammal Protection Act and the 
Endangered Species Act established procedures for safeguarding the whale's long 
migration corridor and feeding grounds. Around the same time, the Mexican 
government gave sanctuary status to the Baja lagoons where the whales migrate 
in winter. In the 1980s, concerns about oil spills along the whales' migratory 
route contributed to the decision to place a moratorium on oil and gas leasing 
off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two decades, at least, the gray whales have been multiplying at a 
rate of about 3% a year, more than doubling their population since the 1930s, 
according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency responsible for 
taking the whale off the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five to 50 feet long, the gray is by no means the largest whale, but it 
is unique in ways that have endeared it to humans. Unlike other whales that 
mate and give birth in the solitude of the deep ocean, the sociable gray whales 
clump together in shallow lagoons to breed and calve. They tend to be bottom 
feeders whose diet of crustaceans brings them close to shore, and their epic, 
1,300-mile migration from Alaska to Baja California has made them the most 
visible of whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, their proximity to their old nemesis, the human being, has helped 
save them, as generations of Pacific Coast residents and visitors have come to 
know the rambunctious gray whales, and commercial whale-watching has become a 
bread-and-butter industry to towns up and down the Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whale is the 22nd species to be delisted since the Endangered Species 
Act was enacted in 1973. The last big animal to come off the list was the 
American alligator in the late 1980s. The 892 plants and animals that remain 
listed as either endangered or threatened include 13 marine mammals, seven of 
which are whale species. 
</P>
<P>
 Still under the jurisdiction of the Marine Mammal Recovery Act, the gray 
whales will be monitored under a five-year plan, according to David 
Hollingshead, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
Hollingshead said the monitoring will involve watching for any changes in the 
whales' migratory habits as well as measuring the level of water-borne 
contaminants, including pesticides and hydrocarbons, that have been known to 
harm smaller marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 David Phillips, executive director of Earth Island Institute, a San 
Francisco-based environmental group opposed to delisting the gray whale, 
contends that the action was prompted, in part, by mounting pressure in 
Congress to show that the Endangered Species Act is not "a one-way street" that 
never acknowledges that a species has regained its health. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phillips acknowledges that the whales have made a substantial 
recovery, he said that without the Endangered Species Act it will be harder to 
regulate any number of activities, ranging from the explosions used in seismic 
exploration to the sea bed disruption caused by oil drilling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before oil companies were allowed to drill, they had to do extensive 
environmental impact reviews," Phillips said. "The degree of protection won't 
be required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act."  
</P>
<P>
 Phillips also contends that delisting will send a signal to the International 
Whaling Commission that a limited resumption of whale hunting by interested 
nations such as Norway and Japan will not hurt the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that there would be a greater chance for open season on gray whales 
outside of U.S. waters," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 And the critics also worry that delisting could send the wrong message to 
foreign governments regarding coastal economic development that could harm 
whale habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that concern is now focused on the west coast of Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two of the three critical lagoons are under enormous pressure for 
development," said Bruce Mate, a professor of fishing and wildlife at Oregon 
State University and a member of the federal Marine Mammal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "At San Ignacio Lagoon there are plans for a saltworks 2 1/2 times larger than 
the world's largest facility," Mate said. It would mean the creation of a town 
of 5,000 to 10,000 people and the combined pressures of sewage and recreational 
fishing as well as barge traffic. Meanwhile, on Magdalena Bay, he said, 
Japanese developers have planned eight "Club Med-sized resorts with all the 
marinas, para-sailing, motor boats and jet skis that go with those sorts of 
places." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexicans have been world leaders in whale conservation," said Mate, "but 
they are under tremendous pressure to approve a totally inappropriate level of 
economic development."

CLINTON IDEAS ON CRIME BILL MAY CUT BOTH WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton will seek changes in final crime legislation that threaten 
programs prized by both liberals and conservatives, according to a detailed 
internal review of the Administration's position provided to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that is likely to disappoint liberals, the Administration wants to 
remove a provision to retroactively reduce minimum sentences for first-time 
nonviolent drug offenders, according to the 61-page document. At the same time, 
the review document shows that the Administration opposes some top conservative 
priorities -- most prominently a Senate-passed measure to establish a network 
of new regional federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the document generally favors the House version of the legislation, 
which puts more emphasis on prevention and softens some of the harshest new 
penalties included in the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, the Administration urges Congress to set aside $28 billion over 
the next six years for the bill -- significantly more than the $22.3 billion 
that was included in the five-year Senate bill passed last fall. Sources said 
that Senate-House conferees already have "largely agreed" to spend at least 
that much -- though some House members want to bump up the figure to $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The conferees are likely to divide the funds roughly evenly among funding the 
President's promise to hire 100,000 new police officers, building prisons and 
launching an array of crime prevention programs, officials involved in 
preliminary negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a measure of potentially significant interest to California, the 
Administration document supports federal reimbursement to states for the cost 
of incarcerating illegal immigrants -- though it does not specify the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo also expresses support for provisions in the bills expediting the 
deportation of illegal immigrants serving time in U.S. prisons and calls for 
expanding the use of federal anti-racketeering laws against smugglers who bring 
in illegal immigrants. It also endorses "an expansion of seizure-and-forfeiture 
authority in order to seize the vehicles or vessels used to smuggle aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration distributed the analysis to key legislators as House-Senate 
conferees prepare to sit down today for their first attempt to reconcile the 
differences between the two chambers' versions of the bill. One House aide said 
that the document -- which mostly reaffirms positions Clinton has already taken 
-- is arriving relatively late in the process but still is likely to exert 
significant influence on the conference discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The train is pretty far gone, but a lot of their views are going to be taken 
into account," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders are hoping to wrap up the talks by the end of next week and 
possibly pass the legislation by the time Congress leaves Washington for its 
July 4 recess. But participants said that, while preliminary staff talks have 
resolved many issues, differences remain substantial on several of the most 
controversial questions.  
</P>
<P>
 High on that list is House-passed legislation to restrict use of the death 
penalty in jurisdictions where it has been applied more frequently to 
minorities than to whites. The Administration has avoided taking a firm public 
position on that polarizing issue throughout the long struggle over the crime 
legislation, and its position remains fuzzy in the document. 
</P>
<P>
 In an accompanying letter to Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the chairman 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Administration said only that it will 
work with the conference "on provisions that would prevent discrimination while 
allowing effective use of capital punishment in appropriate cases." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter offers no further details, but, previously, senior officials have 
spoken privately about restricting so-called "racial justice" provisions -- 
which would allow those convicted of capital crimes to challenge the death 
penalty on the basis of racial bias -- to the handful of federal capital 
punishment cases. That would reduce the measure essentially to symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration may face another struggle over its position on a 
House-passed provision to exempt from mandatory minimum sentences those 
first-time nonviolent drug offenders who have no previous record of serious 
wrongdoing. With bipartisan support, the House proposed to make the change 
retroactive and apply it to current prisoners with records of good behavior. 
The Administration said that it will oppose retroactive application. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, though, the document favors the House version of the legislation 
where the two chambers conflict. The Administration backs the narrower House 
version of the "three strikes" provision, which imposes life imprisonment on 
repeat violent felons, over Senate language that would apply the penalty to a 
larger group of offenses. It supports the full array of new prevention programs 
that House liberals added to the bill. And it prefers a House provision that 
permits judges to try teen-agers accused of violent crimes as adults to a 
Senate proposal that would require such trials.  
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, the Administration reiterates its opposition to the Senate-passed 
proposal to create a new network of federal regional prisons. It instead backs 
the House plan to provide states with grants to build and operate their own 
prisons. The memo supports the House provision to allocate some of that money 
to states that pass tougher sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the crime bill conference has been delayed is that Rep. Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.), the House Judiciary Committee chairman and an opponent of a ban on 
assault weapons, has sought to separate the ban on some assault weapons 
included in the Senate measure from the overall legislation. That would make it 
easier for opponents to kill the assault ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But the document reaffirms Clinton's support for the ban and one White House 
official said flatly Wednesday: "The assault ban will be in the final bill."

U.S. URGES U.N. TO IMPOSE MILD N. KOREAN CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States proposed to other U.N. Security Council members Wednesday 
that the world body impose mild sanctions against North Korea as the first step 
in a punitive campaign that the Communist government insists could lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking with reporters outside the council chamber, Madeleine Albright, U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations, said the North Koreans would "pay a heavy 
price in diplomatic isolation" if they kept defying the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and refusing full inspection of their nuclear installations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's draft resolution was far less punishing than measures first 
advocated by the Clinton Administration. Because of opposition from China and 
Japan, the resolution would not impose a trade embargo on North Korea. It would 
postpone a ban on the transfers of money from Koreans living in Japan to 
relatives and friends in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a trade embargo, it would halt North Korea's export and import of 
arms, end U.N. technical assistance, ban technical and scientific assistance, 
reduce the number of diplomats at North Korean embassies around the world and 
curtail cultural, scientific and educational exchange programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution will probably not come to a vote for several weeks and may be 
altered substantially before then. It would take effect only 30 days after 
adoption by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the sanctions appeared likely to exact a heavy price from the North 
Korean economy. The country's arms trade, for example, is estimated at only $50 
million a year. U.N. technical assistance is low -- $3 million a year from the 
U.N. Development Fund for projects such as agricultural productivity and 
industrial pollution control, and $1 million a year from the U.N. Children's 
Fund for projects including the iodination of salt and promotion of 
breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 In drafting the resolution, the Administration sought to relieve pressure from 
opposite directions. It must persuade China, a longtime ally of North Korea, 
not to use its veto on the council to shoot down the sanctions. The 
Administration also is seeking to convince South Korea, Japan and other allies 
in the region that the resolution would not provoke war. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said the draft reflects his Administration's intention "to 
be very deliberate, very firm." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that we are pursuing the proper course at this time," he told 
reporters as he met with congressional leaders in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration decision to seek sanctions in phases came in for criticism 
from some Republicans, who argued that more must be done to prepare for the 
possibility of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "To call for sanctions at this late stage is almost a joke . . . ," said Sen. 
John McCain (R-Ariz.), a consistent critic of Clinton's handling of the North 
Korea crisis. "Sanctions alone, without the threat of military force behind 
them, will not be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 But House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, one of the congressional 
leaders who met with Clinton, said: "I think he recognizes this is the most 
dangerous foreign policy problem he's faced so far in his term, and I think on 
our side there's a 'Be cautious, be firm but don't rush into anything right 
this minute' kind of mood." 
</P>
<P>
 The current crisis began when North Korea refused to let IAEA inspectors 
examine fuel rods removed from a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon to determine 
whether the North Koreans in 1989 had removed enough plutonium to make a 
nuclear bomb. When the IAEA condemned this action, North Korea withdrew from 
the agency. It remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
even though the IAEA monitors compliance with that accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright described the sanctions as "carefully calibrated: . . . The more they 
break the rules, the tougher the sanctions." North Korea presumably could head 
off the first phase of sanctions -- the arms embargo, halt in U.N. aid and cut 
in diplomatic and cultural relations -- if it cooperated with the IAEA in the 
grace period, which diplomats said would be 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is further backsliding by North Korea," Albright said, "we will 
tighten the economic noose by cutting off all financial transactions with 
Pyongyang." She did not define what might provoke the further sanctions but 
there is a fear that North Korea may decide to withdraw from the 
non-proliferation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 An American official said the draft described the second phase of sanctions, 
aimed at stopping remittances from Koreans living in Japan. These sanctions 
would not be activated without a second Security Council resolution. If the 
15-member body decided later to tighten sanctions even more with a trade 
embargo, a third resolution would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, former President Jimmy Carter arrived Wednesday in North Korea, 
hoping to help defuse the crisis. At a Pyongyang reception hosted by Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong Nam, Carter said the United States "is ready to meet you in 
accomplishing" the goals of friendship and peace, and that progress can be made 
"as soon as the nuclear issue is resolved clearly and the misunderstandings are 
removed," news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Carter's visit, Clinton told reporters he hopes the former 
President "will get a better sense from them about where they are and that they 
will understand that we're very firm in our position but that there is an 
alternative path and a very good one for North Korea, that they don't have to 
become more isolated."

EMERGING GAYS FIND FEAR AND REJOICING IN NEVADA; CULTURE: THEIR GROWING SOCIAL 
AND POLITICAL CLOUT AND A RESULTANT BACKLASH ILLUMINATE THE STATE'S PSYCHIC 
SPLIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 History was made here one Sunday in March, when Gov. Bob Miller, resplendent 
in a stars-and-stripes leather jacket, took to the podium at a dark little bar 
and got a standing ovation from the raucous crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd see the day when I'd see a Nevada governor in a gay bar," 
recounted Eddie Anderson, master of ceremonies for the rally. The event also 
drew Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones -- who is challenging Miller in the governor's 
race -- and a host of other political luminaries in this self-proclaimed 
"frontier state" and bastion of western independence. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a bittersweet moment for the growing number of lesbians and gay men 
in Nevada -- proof of newly minted clout, evidence of continuing vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Just months after the Legislature repealed the state's 82-year-old anti-sodomy 
law, conservative activists launched a petition drive to make it legal to 
discriminate against gay men and lesbians. The rally was called in opposition 
to the initiative -- a carpetbagging measure written by Lon Mabon, the 
architect of similar legislation throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mabon and his followers are the first to admit, this is a watershed year 
for gays in the Silver State. They are learning to flex their political and 
social muscle; in so doing, they are bringing Nevada face to face with its 
contrary personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, Nevada has long embraced behavior that no other state would 
allow; on the other, it blushes fast and easy. "It is a dual personality here," 
says Ward Bushee, executive editor of the Reno Gazette-Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the live-and-let-live side of this statewide schizophrenia that helps to 
explain why the firsts for gays and lesbians are tumbling in almost too fast to 
count: 
</P>
<P>
 * This year has brought Nevada its first openly gay candidate for any public 
office. Jack Levin, 31, is running for Clark County school trustee. In 1990, he 
ran for Assembly and lost in a close Republican primary. "When I ran (before), 
I was gay," Levin said. "But I never came out. My positions have never changed. 
. . . A lot of ultra-right-wing people supported me then. They're not now." 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washoe County, home to Reno, the "Biggest Little City in the World," 
people with HIV were allowed in the classroom to talk about the disease for the 
first time this school year in a controversial program called Frontline. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada opened 
in Las Vegas, the first such facility in the state. It offers a library, a 
speakers bureau, counseling for families of gay teen-agers, clubs for newcomers 
and seniors, and referrals for roommates, jobs and legal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bushee told a group of gay activists this spring that if they would help 
form guidelines for the practice, his paper would publish same-sex unions on 
the wedding pages. Fewer than a dozen mainstream newspapers in the nation 
include such notices. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the first time, gay voters are a presence in a major statewide election. 
Politically active gays and lesbians raised $5,000 for Jones in January in the 
first gay-sponsored benefit for a Nevada candidate. Since then, the gay 
community has held several fund-raisers on behalf of state legislators. "We are 
all fighting over them in the governor's race," says Jones, who faces Miller in 
the Democratic gubernatorial primary in September. 
</P>
<P>
 However -- and this is a big however -- being courted and being accepted are 
two vastly different things. For every first celebrated in Nevada, there is a 
caveat. For every step forward, at least one step back: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nevada has the ninth-highest AIDS rate in the country and has been in the 
top 10 since 1987. It is in the bottom 10 for state spending on the disease. 
"The only state support we get is indirectly through Medicaid," says Dr. Jerry 
Cade, a Las Vegas physician who treats AIDS patients. "The rural counties are 
incredibly reluctant to help those big 'sin cities,' Reno and Las Vegas, with 
their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * Although HIV-infected patients in the Frontline program can tell Washoe 
County students about life with the disease, they are not allowed to talk about 
their sexual orientation. "If (speakers) were asked point-blank if they were 
gay, they may say yes or no but that would be it," said Jan Donnelly, health 
education curriculum specialist for the Washoe County School District. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the Gay and Lesbian Student Union at the University of Nevada, Reno, 
started a youth outreach program a year ago, "we agreed not to talk about sex," 
says Leslie Fiske, one of the program's founders. The self-imposed prohibition 
was partly to avoid conflict with the university and partly in response to the 
anti-sodomy law, which was still in place. Nevada is "still conservative in a 
lot of ways, still redneck," Fiske says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia City, the saga of Russ Collingwood underscores Nevada's split 
personality. At least five businesses in this tiny Wild West tourist 
destination are owned by gays or lesbians. "This is the differentest town in 
the world," says one Chamber of Commerce board member. "Everyone's different." 
</P>
<P>
 The population of fewer than 1,000 is "a combination of a few miners and a lot 
of aging hippies who moved here after the '60s," says Martin Lane, co-publisher 
of the Comstock Chronicle. "You have a lot of people who came here to be left 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 And for the most part, they are. But in January, when Collingwood, 25, 
announced to the Chamber of Commerce board -- of which he was a member -- that 
he was planning a sex-change operation, he ended up on the front page of the 
Chronicle and ultimately felt it necessary to leave the board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Collingwood, who now is known as Paige Sinclaire, life as an openly gay 
man in Virginia City was fine; life as a transsexual means learning to deal 
with whispers and odd looks, misunderstanding and cold shoulders. Virginia City 
is not the best place, he admits, for a man to learn the ways of womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not asked to leave the chamber board, Collingwood said he felt 
a not-so-subtle push out the door. "I don't believe there's been anyone like me 
in this town before," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, Collingwood is right. Nevada is home to only 1.4 million 
residents scattered unevenly throughout 110,000 square miles -- or about half 
the population of Orange County in nearly 150 times the area. Its North and 
South are more drastically divided by attitude and geography than even those of 
California. The state is bisected by Interstate 50, a.k.a. "The Loneliest Road 
in America." Almost nothing exists by way of civilization connecting the Las 
Vegas area to the south and the Reno/Sparks/Carson City area farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitution is legal in most of the so-called "cow counties" or rural areas 
of the state, although it is against the law in urban Clark and Washoe 
counties. You can play the slot machines in the supermarket, video store or 
casino, buy a drink 24 hours a day. It is still only a misdemeanor to sell a 
gun to a child, although that could change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a frontier state," said Miller in early March, as he kicked off his 
reelection bid with a Reno speech that suggested tougher penalties for those 
who sell guns to children under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional boxing and quickie divorce found their first acceptance here in 
the early 1900s. Mary Pickford came to Nevada in 1920 for the divorce that 
enabled her to marry Douglas Fairbanks; a long parade of celebrity splits 
ensued, as the state dropped its waiting period from six months to three months 
to six weeks, and the moneyed set poured into Reno for sympathetic court 
hearings, dude ranch vacations and new leases on life. 
</P>
<P>
 To Robert Laxalt, novelist and Nevada historian, the state's psychic split 
provides little mystery. Though not conversant with the anti-gay petition 
drive, Laxalt contends that the state's early embrace of prizefighting, easy 
divorce laws, gambling and prostitution were born of economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The millionaires who sacked the Comstock Lode around Virginia City packed up 
their moneybags and moved on to greener pastures, and they left a Nevada that 
was dead broke," he says. "That's why the state enacted liberal laws: to entice 
tourists here." 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Nevada residents boast of a western independence, a 
live-and-let-live attitude that embraces the Liberace Museum and the Boy-Lesque 
variety show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both ends of the state are much more liberally inclined than they used to 
be," says Rollan Melton, longtime columnist at the Reno Gazette-Journal. 
"Because of the influx of Southern Californians, there is a more liberal 
feeling. We're joining the latter part of the 20th Century recently. We were 
very redneck, very bullheaded, and very conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nevada is in the bottom 10 of states in population, it is the fastest 
growing in the nation. Three new hotel-casinos opened in Las Vegas last winter, 
bringing the city 15,000 new jobs. In 1993, the state averaged about 6,000 new 
residents per month. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the population on the whole grows, so does the gay community. In a 
recent edition of the bimonthly Las Vegas/Reno Bugle, nearly 10% of the 
"Manfinder Personals" were from new gay residents, men who described themselves 
as "New 2 Vegas" and "just moved here from S.F.," "New Kid in Town" and "moving 
from SF to Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 This spring brought the state's first Stonewall Democratic Club, based in 
Reno, for gay men and lesbians. Nevada already had a Log Cabin Republican Club 
for gays. And the numbers of celebrants at Las Vegas' annual Gay Pride festival 
grew from about 100 in the 1980s to 2,200 in 1993. "For Las Vegas, that's 
amazing," says Rob Schlegel, publisher of the Bugle and a former festival 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of new Nevadans, both straight and gay, is in part responsible for 
the state's changing views and the landmark repeal of the anti-sodomy law last 
June. "What I think has happened over the years is that we have people from Los 
Angeles and Chicago and New York, really liberal people, moving here for the 
first time," said Judy Corbisiero, a longtime activist and co-director of 
Nevadans for Constitutional Equality, which fought for repeal of the 
anti-sodomy law. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the late 1970s, the "crimes against nature" law was so vague that it did 
not define the acts it prohibited for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, said 
state Sen. Lori Lipman Brown (D-Las Vegas), architect of the law's repeal. In 
1977, the state changed the law to enumerate the outlawed acts; at the same 
time, it made them illegal only for partners of the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law was repealed by large margins in both houses of the Nevada 
Legislature, lawmakers said that constituent calls ran largely in favor of 
keeping the controversial statute on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every 10 phone calls or letters that we received in my office from my 
district, one person was for the repeal and nine were against it," said 
Assemblyman John Bonaventura (D-Las Vegas). Bonaventura, who displayed a "No 
Rights for Sodomites" bumper sticker on his desk during heated debate and 
testimony over the law, voted against repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is just such opposition that the Nevada Citizens Alliance has hoped to tap 
with its drive to place the Minority Status and Child Protection Act on the 
ballot. In part, the proposed amendment to the state Constitution says that 
"objection to homosexuality based upon one's convictions is a liberty and right 
of conscience and shall not be considered discrimination relating to civil 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: Gay men and lesbians could not be foster parents, nor could they 
win custody of their children if the other parent in the dispute is 
heterosexual. Works by Oscar Wilde could be allowed in public libraries, but 
"Heather Has Two Mommies" could not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexuality could be acknowledged in public school health or social studies 
classes but not in a way that would "elevate homosexuality to a neutral or 
normal position in a child's eyes," Mabon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabon says he has received hundreds of calls from Nevadans asking for help in 
countering the growth of the state's gay community. He has come here a year 
earlier than planned because, "from our standpoint, it is better to fight the 
battle sooner than later." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar initiatives were voted on in November, 1992, in Oregon and Colorado. 
The Oregon measure was defeated. The Colorado initiative was approved by voters 
but is being challenged in court. Mabon's group is continuing its efforts in 
Oregon, in addition to pushing initiatives in Washington, Idaho and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevada initiative campaign is being run out of makeshift offices in Daisy 
Stanley's Reno apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 She got involved after calling her daughter, Kathy Phelps, in a panic in 
January when the anti-sodomy law was repealed. She faxed Phelps a copy of an 
article from the Reno Gazette-Journal. The headline: "Nevada Gays Building New 
Political Power." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps lives in Eugene, Ore., and works for Mabon. She shared the news with 
him. For Mabon, that was the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they saw that article, they said they gotta do what they gotta do, even 
if there isn't the money and all the rest," Stanley says. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Mabon flew to Carson City, where the group filed to start 
the petition drive. He has visited the state several times since to stump for 
the initiative in the state's conservative circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevada Citizens Alliance needs just over 51,000 valid signatures by 
Tuesday to put the proposed initiative on the November ballot. As the group 
heads into its last weekend of signature gathering, its chances have dimmed 
some. Although alliance officials would not estimate the number of signatures 
that they have gathered, opponents believe that only about 15,000 have been 
garnered to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not out of the question that the signatures will pour in in this last 
week," Mabon said. "If they do not collect the required number, they're going 
to refile. Then they'll have enough time, two years, and will get on the 
ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Janine Hansen, president of the Nevada Family Eagle Forum and initiative 
proponent, views its chances as limited. Hansen too felt the repeal of the 
anti-sodomy law as a body blow to her cause; her organization has mailed out 
thousands of petitions to try to reverse what she sees as the march of the 
"homosexual agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to hold homosexuality up as a standard for our children," said 
Hansen, who refers to such an orientation as a "destructive, anti-family 
deathstyle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my children to know it's wrong and it's unnatural," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the petition drive has lacked members, money and time, vital resources 
necessary for any sort of political work -- especially for lonely work such as 
hers. "But I've never underestimated the power of the people," Hansen said. "I 
believe that it will mushroom, and there is a possibility, an opportunity, for 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno activist Eddie Anderson is not so sure. He personally finds reason for 
optimism in the gay community's recent strides forward and the stumbling 
performance of the Nevada citizens alliance. "While the conditions have not 
changed for gays and lesbians, the attitudes toward them have."

BLOOD MATCHES SIMPSON TYPE, POLICE SOURCES SAY; INQUIRY: MORE EXACT DNA RESULTS 
ARE PENDING. NEW ATTORNEY, ROBERT SHAPIRO, WILL SEEK SEPARATE FORENSIC TESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The blood type of samples recovered at the scene of a brutal double slaying 
matches that of O.J. Simpson's blood, a potentially important piece of evidence 
in the investigation of the killings of his ex-wife and a man she knew, Los 
Angeles police sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's blood type is different from those of the two victims, Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, a source said. Although even rare blood types 
are shared by many people, any discovery of Simpson's blood type at the murder 
scene could lend credence to the suggestion that he was there, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more exact test to determine whether the DNA in the blood sample matches 
Simpson's has not been concluded, sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lead attorney, newly hired lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, was unavailable 
for comment late Wednesday on the blood test results. Shapiro earlier said he 
will seek a second autopsy of the two victims and private forensic tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, who represented Simpson until Wednesday and continues to 
serve as an adviser to his legal team, said he was unaware of any test results 
concluding that Simpson's blood type matched samples recovered from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sources have said Simpson is the main suspect in the investigation, 
the Los Angeles Police Department has declined to confirm those reports, and 
Simpson has not been arrested or charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 New details emerged Wednesday about a matching pair of gloves whose existence 
Weitzman vehemently has denied. According to police sources, investigators 
found two work gloves, one at the scene of the crime and the other outside 
Simpson's Brentwood mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had blood on them, though tests for the blood on the gloves have not been 
completed, sources said. According to one source, the glove at Simpson's home 
was found outside a side entrance near a trail of drippings that have been 
determined to be blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be inconsistent with what I was told," said Weitzman, who has said 
that a police official assured him that there was no second glove found at 
Simpson's home. "Beyond that, I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Goldman's wounds indicated that he fought fiercely when attacked, 
and they said Simpson was scratched and cut when police interviewed him several 
hours after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman and others familiar with the investigation said the former athlete 
spent much of the day at his Brentwood mansion, grieving over the death of his 
ex-wife, surrounded by members of his family and in consultation with his legal 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Two black limousines left Simpson's Brentwood mansion Wednesday afternoon, and 
a few hours later, he was seen driving away from O'Connor Laguna Hills 
Mortuary, where his former wife's body was being prepared for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a viewing . . . to send my sister off. We all went and paid our 
respects," said Denise Brown, Nicole's older sister. "And . . . yes, O.J. was 
there. But what's the big deal? It's his ex-wife. My God, it's somebody we all 
love. We just want to let her go in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities sifted through the evidence in the case, Simpson switched 
lawyers, hiring Shapiro to head his legal team. He said that Simpson is under 
treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is deeply upset," said Shapiro, one of Los Angeles' best-known lawyers. 
"He is under a doctor's care for depression. . . . He is going to be in 
seclusion with his family to grieve over the loss of the mother of his 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman -- who has vigorously defended Simpson's innocence over the past 
three tumultuous days -- has given up the lead role to Shapiro, a celebrated 
Century City lawyer whose clients have included Darryl Strawberry and Tina 
Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he has stepped down, Weitzman said in a statement: "I have 
decided because of my personal relationship with O.J. Simpson and my many other 
professional commitments I can no longer give O.J. the attention he both 
deserves and needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he told Simpson to avoid watching television or reading 
newspapers and to instead focus on his family. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement released after he took over the case, Shapiro said 
Simpson was at his Brentwood home waiting for a limousine when Nicole Simpson, 
35, and Goldman, 25, were killed Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson traveled to the airport late that evening and then caught a "red-eye" 
flight for Chicago. A source said he was the only passenger to travel in the 
first-class section of the American Airlines flight from Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman had previously said he believed that Simpson was in the limousine or 
at the airport when the killings occurred. So far, an exact time of death has 
not been released by authorities, although Weitzman has said he was told that 
it was about 11 p.m. Sunday -- supporting his contention that Simpson could not 
have committed the crime and still gotten to the airport in time to catch his 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that police believe that Simpson would have had enough time 
to make the trip, suggesting that they believe that the time of death may have 
been somewhat earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police discovered the bodies after midnight and called Simpson at 
his Chicago hotel Monday morning to tell him that his ex-wife had been found 
dead in Brentwood. Simpson returned to Los Angeles that morning and was 
questioned by police the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among Shapiro's first moves after taking over for Weitzman was to solicit the 
services of a criminologist and a pathologist, whom he would not identify 
except to say that each is a nationally recognized professional. They will 
review the findings of the police and perform a second autopsy on the two 
victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts would only have standing in the case if Simpson were to face 
charges, as witnesses are not entitled to bring in their own experts to review 
evidence. Nevertheless, Shapiro said he had no information indicating that 
Simpson's arrest is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro met with police Wednesday, saying afterward that he has pledged 
Simpson's full cooperation during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have introduced myself to the members of the Los Angeles Police 
Department," Shapiro said, "and to offer our complete cooperation with them in 
their investigation to solve this crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said investigators spent Wednesday continuing to work their case, and 
they were said to be just a few days away from turning it over to the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office. According to sources, investigators 
were continuing to interview witnesses -- including a therapist who said she 
counseled Nicole Simpson on two occasions. Simpson's ex-wife said during the 
sessions that he was stalking her, the therapist has said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they conduct their investigation, police were said to be painstakingly 
reviewing their case, eager to avoid a situation in which they arrest a suspect 
for the double slaying and then have the case sent back by prosecutors for more 
work. Once police make an arrest, they have 48 hours to present a case to the 
district attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, however, prosecutors may elect to present the matter to a grand 
jury and ask for an indictment. If that procedure were followed in this case, 
it could delay any arrest by several days, but it also would preclude the need 
for a preliminary hearing in which evidence is presented in a public courtroom.

L.A. MOVES TO PUSH OUT SQUATTERS; CRIME: OFFICIALS TO USE $20 MILLION TO GUARD 
'GHOST TOWNS' OF VACANT, QUAKE-DAMAGED HOUSING, WHICH IS CONCENTRATED IN THE 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Frustrated by the growing problem of squatters, drug users and vandals taking 
over vacant quake-damaged buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, 
Los Angeles city officials Wednesday launched an effort to find money for 
fencing, barricades and even guards to secure the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they plan to attack the problem with $20 million in 
discretionary funds provided by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. But that may not be enough, they said, to stem the increase in 
crime that adjacent communities have already experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad-hoc committee of the City Council ordered its staff Wednesday to press 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more funding, even though FEMA 
officials have already indicated that the problem does not qualify for 
emergency funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A study is under way to determine the exact number of vacant buildings being 
occupied and the cost of securing those buildings. A report to the ad-hoc 
earthquake recovery committee is expected Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used for barbed-wire fencing, lighting, security guards and 
other measures to clamp down on the gangs, prostitutes, drug users and others 
taking up residency in vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be done no matter who pays for it," said Councilman Hal Bernson, 
whose Northridge-based district suffered the worst quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, about 1,250 apartment buildings and condominiums with 17,900 units 
have been vacated since the Jan. 17 quake, city officials said. There are 38 
neighborhoods with more than 100 vacant units, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most serious problems are occurring in about 10 clusters of empty 
buildings, which housing officials have dubbed "ghost towns." Such blighted 
areas have been identified in Sylmar, Northridge, Canoga Park and Sherman Oaks. 
Three more are in Hollywood. They pose three problems, officials said: 
</P>
<P>
 * Squatters in quake-damaged buildings are in danger from collapsing walls and 
ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegal occupants have stripped the buildings of bathroom fixtures, 
carpeting and other items left behind when the buildings were vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of the buildings have become headquarters for illegal drug use, 
prostitution and other crimes that can spread to adjacent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are providing a free and enjoyable location for these gangbangers, then 
we are supporting these other endeavors in nearby neighborhoods," said Sam 
Luna, director of the Neighborhood Recovery Program in the city's Housing 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors have already noted an increase in burglaries and other 
crimes in neighboring communities, Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna plans to ask the council next week to hire four workers to join his staff 
of 14 to combat the problem. He plans to hire fencing contractors and security 
guards for the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district in the northeast Valley includes 
several "ghost towns," last month asked that the council name a task force to 
attack the problem. The proposal has not been considered yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are several of these ghost towns," he said. "But you don't get a sense 
of how bad it is unless you drive through one of these." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said he is frustrated by the lack of action by the city and wants 
officials to move faster to make it easier for owners to repair and reopen the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, a vacant building caught fire two weeks ago and officials 
believe squatters may have sparked the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirta Ocana, a housing deputy for Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents 
the Hollywood area, said there has always been a problem with drug users, 
homeless people and runaways taking over abandoned buildings in Hollywood. The 
quake aggravated the problem by supplying more vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocana said building owners have told her they try to seal the buildings off 
with boards and barbed wire. The tactic often fails, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To them, it's better to have some shelter than no shelter at all," Ocana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A community meeting is planned in two weeks to discuss the problem in 
Hollywood and consider suggestions to solve it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some building owners hesitate to spend substantial sums of money to keep 
buildings secure because, among other reasons, many are still waiting for word 
on government loan applications and are not sure if they will ever repair and 
reopen the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of a $2-billion earthquake-repair bond issue earlier this month 
has led to the cancellation of a state program to loan apartment owners money 
to repair damaged buildings. Local housing officials said that without the 
$576-million program they fear that many of the city's 20,000 vacant apartment 
units will not be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Haddigan, a managing director at the Marcus & Millchap brokerage in 
Encino, which specializes in apartment buildings, defended the owners, saying 
many are in financial straits and are working hard to refurbish and reopen 
their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he said, is that the government loan programs are sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases, the (owners) are not sitting on their hands," he said. "I 
think these things are just stalled."

ANCIENT TREES REFLECT CENTURY-LONG DROUGHTS; ENVIRONMENT: ANALYSIS OF STUMPS' 
RINGS SHOWS THAT DRY SPELLS CAN LAST FAR LONGER THAN THE STATE HAS ESTIMATED, 
EXPERT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A study of the stumps of ancient trees that once grew from stream beds and 
lake bottoms in the Sierra Nevada has turned up new evidence that droughts in 
California can last 100 years or more, far longer than the state's official 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 In this week's issue of the British journal Nature, a Cal State Hayward 
professor writes that submerged stumps in Mono Lake, Tenaya Lake in Yosemite 
National Park, the West Walker River in the northern Sierra and Osgood Swamp 
near Lake Tahoe are relics of trees that grew on land that was uncovered when 
droughts reduced water levels by up to 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The cottonwoods and Jeffrey pines drowned when the drought ended and high 
water returned, according to Scott Stine, a professor of physical geology. He 
attributes the droughts to extended periods of naturally caused global warming 
which, if they recurred, could have disastrous effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message for California is that we are subject to droughts far more severe 
and persistent than we have ever realized," Stine said in an interview this 
week. "While we can't predict when such droughts will occur, we would be fools 
to think that they won't. 
</P>
<P>
 If they recur, Stine said, "the current urban and agricultural infrastructure 
could not be maintained. It would bring California to its knees." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by the California Department of Water Resources have concluded that 
the worst droughts have not lasted much longer than the state's recent 
seven-year dry spell. Officials base that assertion on 90 years of recorded 
weather information and tree ring data from 450-year-old trees. 
</P>
<P>
 However, state officials acknowledged this week that at least one other study, 
published in 1922, discusses a drought in California that lasted more than a 
century. Bill Mork, a state hydrologist, said the department never relied on 
the 1922 book because "we don't know where they got the data." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Stine's work reinforces a growing body of scholarly opinion that 
California has experienced dry spells of biblical proportions. Two ongoing 
research projects, one looking at tree rings in the Sierra near Mt. Whitney and 
another focusing on core samples from San Francisco Bay, lend credence to the 
theory of prolonged drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Stine's research on the stumps of ancient trees relied on radiocarbon dating 
to determine when the trees had been drowned -- and, thus, when the droughts 
had ended. By counting rings in the interior of each stump, Stine calculated 
the life span of the trees and thus the length of the droughts. 
</P>
<P>
 He concludes that two long droughts -- one from about AD 900 to about AD 1112 
and a later one from about 1210 to 1350 -- were interrupted by an abnormally 
wet period. 
</P>
<P>
 Stine's research did not dwell on the cause of the droughts, but he wrote that 
his findings support theories that dramatic climate fluctuations for several 
hundred years leading up to the 14th Century had a profound, worldwide effect. 
In northern Europe, the period known as the Medieval Warm Epoch was a time of 
agricultural abundance that helped European civilization expand greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Stine attributes the long warming trend to a natural phenomenon: a change in 
the position of the jet stream or storm track -- the boundary between cool, 
polar air and warm, subtropical air along which storms occur. "The storm track 
simply moved northward during the two periods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stine's work is one of at least three independent research projects that come 
to similar conclusions about centuries-old weather patterns in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tree ring studies on ancient pines and junipers near Mt. Whitney by the 
University of Arizona's tree ring research laboratory have also found 
indications of prolonged drought, occurring about the same time as Stine 
estimates -- between 900 and 1300. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked at the length of the droughts I was finding," said Lisa 
Graumlich, a professor of dendrochronology -- the study of tree rings -- at the 
University of Arizona who began performing research in the Sierra eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means is that when we plan on water resource availability based on 
the 20th-Century record, we are probably making some critical errors since the 
longest-recorded drought during the 1920s and '30s lasted less than 10 years," 
Graumlich said. "The 20th Century is really quite anomalous. It appears to be 
the second-wettest period in the 1,000-year record." 
</P>
<P>
 The third study, looking at 5,000-year-old mollusks from the bottom of San 
Francisco Bay, also bolsters the case for the hundred-year drought, according 
to Lynn Ingram, a doctoral fellow in geology and geophysics at UC Berkeley.

UC HIRING CONSULTANT TO POLISH IMAGE; EDUCATION: PUBLIC RELATIONS EXPERT WILL 
BE ASKED TO HELP COUNTER THE RECENT FLOW OF UNFLATTERING NEWS WITH MORE 
POSITIVE STORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 University of California officials, dismayed by a barrage of unflattering news 
stories, have asked a former Bank of America and Kaiser Aluminum executive 
known for his aggressive public relations style to advise them on how to 
improve UC's sagging image. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Baker, UC vice president for university and external affairs, said 
he recently met with Ronald E. Rhody, now a private Walnut Creek media 
consultant, and asked him to help the nine-campus system put out more "positive 
stories" about faculty and student accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negative stories seem to overwhelm the positive stories, so we're trying 
to make sure that the people know that we're a pretty good institution after 
all, to the extent that people feel otherwise," said Baker, who directs UC's 
public information and lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhody, 62, is negotiating a contract with UC that would last four to six 
months. Rhody will counsel the university on public relations strategy but will 
not deal directly with reporters. UC officials declined to say how much the 
contract would cost, but added that Rhody would charge a discounted rate and UC 
will pay him out of private, not public, funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Rhody's clients is the Oakland Coliseum, owned jointly by the city of 
Oakland and Alameda County and now engaged in a spirited campaign to keep the 
Oakland A's baseball team from moving. 
</P>
<P>
 UC's decision to approach Rhody -- whose firm advises on crisis management and 
damage control -- comes after a series of critical news stories about costly 
administrative retirement packages, escalating student fee hikes, political 
miscues and a controversial contract with fallen junk bond king Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were constantly shooting ourselves in the foot or being shot in the head 
by somebody," said UC Regent Ward Connerly, a Sacramento land-use consultant. 
Connerly said a number of regents began talking two months ago about seeking 
outside media help. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he decided to seek public relations advice even before the regents' 
discussion because his public information staff has been cut in half by budget 
reductions at a time when the university needs to expand its outreach efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an image consultant, it's not a firm, it's a guy to give us advice," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhody is known for his take-charge style of corporate image-shaping. He worked 
for Oakland-based Kaiser Aluminum for 20 years before Sam Armacost, then chief 
executive officer of Bank of America, hired him in 1983 to run the San 
Francisco-based bank's public relations unit during what would be some of the 
institution's darkest hours. 
</P>
<P>
 On Rhody's watch, the bank weathered a $95-million mortgage loan scandal, a 
nasty fight with federal banking regulators, top management turnovers and a 
hostile takeover attempt. The bank stopped paying dividends in late 1985 and 
was the subject of rumors about discussions with federal regulators for a 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keane, the bank's current director of corporate relations, said Rhody 
countered by having the bank call publicly for a federal investigation and 
putting its top executive on the radio to defuse the public relations 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bank pulled out of its financial nose dive, Rhody was just as 
aggressive at trumpeting good news, such as the restoration of stock dividends 
in 1988, Keane said.

 Legislation to dramatically reform California's lax and secretive system of 
disciplining judges passed a key test Wednesday as the Assembly Judiciary 
Committee approved it without a dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaired by Assemblyman Philip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), the committee heard 
testimony Wednesday from people representing a broad range of interests. 
Witnesses included Santa Monica Superior Court Judge David Rothman, who urged 
the panel to delay taking action until a special state Judicial Council 
committee he heads completes a study on the issue this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman said overzealous reforms might interfere with judicial independence. 
Discipline of judges can be overdone, he said. "You have to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee rejected any delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a matter of great importance. . . . It's not going to wait for you," 
said Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues have been there a long time," said Assemblywoman Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles). "The people don't have faith in the will of the 
judiciary" to act on its own, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is going to move along with strong bipartisan support," said 
Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith of Poway, one of three Republicans who joined four 
Democrats in voting the bill out of committee, 7 to 0. Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood), who faces a November runoff election for a Superior 
Court judgeship, abstained. Five committee members were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, introduced by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
would require more openness in hearings held by the Commission on Judicial 
Performance and end the judges' domination of the commission by adding more 
citizens as members. 
</P>
<P>
 California's system of disciplining judges, once considered trailblazing, has 
become archaic, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Speaker's bill would carry out needed reforms to bring California up to 
the standards of 29 other states," said Peter Keane, chief deputy public 
defender of San Francisco, who wrote the legislation for Brown. "California's 
system is characterized by secret proceedings without scrutiny. There is no 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined in support by Gregory Totten, executive director of the 
California District Attorneys Assn., and Deputy Atty. Gen. Raymond L. 
Brosterhous II, representing state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. Both are 
conservatives who rarely agree with Keane on anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill has no ideological content. That's one of the beauties of it," 
Keane said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office has taken a particular interest in the 
legislation because its lawyers act as prosecutors in presenting cases against 
judges accused of misconduct. Last week, Brosterhous, on Lungren's behalf, sent 
a stinging letter of support to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The letter said the attorney general's office was having to spend considerable 
time in "secret litigation concerning whether or not secrecy will apply" at a 
formal commission hearing on allegations of misconduct by a judge. In fact, 
Brosterhous said, there has not been one open hearing on judicial misconduct 
since 1988, even though voters passed a measure that year designed to ensure 
greater public access to these hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria B. Henley, director of the commission, said it does not oppose change 
but expressed reservations about whether Brown's proposal would give the agency 
too much power. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Municipal Judge E. Mac Amos, president of the California Judges 
Assn., tried to walk a fine line, saying the judges favored changes in the 
commission's structure and confidentiality rules but had reservations about the 
specifics of Brown's measure. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only one state judge, Terry B. O'Rourke of the San Diego Superior 
Court, has publicly endorsed the proposed reforms. O'Rourke, a former law 
partner of Gov. Pete Wilson who is considered something of a maverick, sent a 
letter of support to state Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), who is 
sponsoring a measure similar to Brown's in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he endorsed Alquist's plan to divest the California Judges 
Assn. of the power to adopt a code of judicial conduct for the California 
judiciary. The association "is not a governmental body; it is a private 
interest group," O'Rourke wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alquist bill is scheduled for hearing next week. Passage of the bills 
would require a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, and then a majority vote in 
a general election because the measures would amend the California 
Constitution.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: INITIATIVE COULD BE WILD CARD IN FALL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another landmark California ballot initiative -- the kind that polarizes the 
state and sends a loud message nationwide -- is on the verge of qualifying for 
the November election. And if it does, the trend toward lower voter turnouts 
likely will be reversed, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are gleeful. Democrats are scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is SOS, a catchy abbreviation for "save our state" -- as in, save 
it from illegal immigrants. Among other things, it would deny public education 
to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, already has 
denounced the proposal as "mean-spirited and dangerous." Gov. Pete Wilson has 
indicated he'll warmly support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither U.S. Senate candidate -- Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein or GOP 
Rep. Michael Huffington -- has taken a stand. But they'll have to, as 
ultimately will every candidate for statewide or legislative office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wedge issue," notes a sponsor, conservative Assemblyman Richard L. 
Mountjoy (R-Arcadia). "You either have to be for it or against it. You can't be 
in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates who don't take a stand will be branded as cowards. When they do 
step up, their positions will send a signal to voters about the kind of 
politicians they are. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Californians finally cast their ballots, they will send a signal 
across the country about the political importance of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure fails, the Clinton Administration and Congress likely will feel 
little pressure to heed the pleas of California and other big states for more 
money to fund immigrant services. If the initiative passes, it will quickly 
catch the attention of a President who probably cannot be reelected in 1996 
unless he again carries California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because illegal immigration strikes such an emotional chord, this initiative 
has the potential to join a list of historic ballot props that have influenced 
voting for elective office and swayed national policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 One such measure was Proposition 13, the 1978 property tax cutter that ignited 
a nationwide anti-tax revolt. Wilson, then the San Diego mayor, joined most 
Establishment politicians in opposing the initiative, and it cost him votes in 
a failed bid for the gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was Proposition 14, which in 1964 repealed an act banning racial 
discrimination in real estate sales. The Supreme Court later overturned the 
measure, but Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown's strong opposition to it cost him 
politically. Back in 1958, however, Brown capitalized on voter rejection of an 
anti-labor "right to work" initiative in winning the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The SOS initiative would cut off most public services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying public schooling would violate a 1982 Supreme Court decision, but 
sponsors -- and Wilson -- want to force the court to reconsider its 5-4 ruling. 
All health services except emergency care also would be forbidden. Law 
enforcement agencies would have to cooperate with the INS in finding illegal 
immigrants. And school and health officials would be required to snitch on 
children and parents they suspect of being here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative needs the signatures of 384,974 registered voters to land on 
the November ballot. The deadline is June 30. Sponsors turned in nearly 600,000 
signatures and so far 204,342 have been validated. Los Angeles County still has 
roughly 200,000 it hasn't checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers say they don't think any delaying games are being played. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and other Republican politicians foresee SOS performing the same role 
as an anti-handgun measure -- Proposition 15 -- did in 1982. It spurred to the 
polls many white males who otherwise would have stayed home. They not only 
helped bury the gun prop but helped narrowly elect Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 "The keys to this campaign are two words -- taxpayers and citizens ," says 
Barbara Kiley, the mayor of Yorba Linda who, with her husband Bob Kiley, is 
managing SOS. "Those are the people we're going to reach -- citizen taxpayers 
who are tired of being ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown envisions the initiative playing the same role as Wilson's Proposition 
165 did for Bill Clinton and other Democrats in 1992. Democratic operatives 
turned out poor people to help defeat the governor's welfare cutbacks and also 
elect the party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 In this race, Brown plans to target Latino voters who solidly oppose SOS and 
favor her. But she must be careful because whites overwhelmingly support the 
measure. Overall, according to the latest Times poll, voters back it by a 59% 
to 32% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Good or bad, this proposition should add excitement to the ballot.

CLEARING OF TOLLWAY LAND HALTED; COURTS: JUDGE'S RULING TEMPORARILY BLOCKS WORK 
IN LAGUNA CANYON, THE SITE OF STAUNCH PROTESTS BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ and LESLIE EARNEST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge issued a temporary injunction Wednesday that halted bulldozers 
in Laguna Canyon amid a second day of protests by environmentalists seeking to 
stop construction on a 10-lane highway through the bucolic canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The order came after one environmental activist chained himself to a bulldozer 
and another was arrested in a demonstration that snarled morning rush-hour 
traffic on narrow Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary stay by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was the latest round in 
a legal battle by environmentalists trying to prevent the toll road's 
construction through Laguna Canyon between Newport Coast Drive and El Toro 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin rejected the lawsuit that 
Laguna Greenbelt and other environmentalists had filed against the San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor Agency and the Federal Highway Administration. 
The suit charged that federal environmental laws had been violated when the 
toll road project was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's ruling allowed work to begin on the 4.6 miles of roadway that 
cuts through the canyon as part of a 17-mile tollway that will extend from 
Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court's decision set off a mad scramble as bulldozers immediately 
began clearing the land and attorneys for the environmentalists rushed to file 
an appeal. Meanwhile, protesters gathered at the canyon Tuesday and Wednesday 
-- some camping out along Laguna Canyon Road on Tuesday night "to keep an eye 
on things," one protester said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, when news reached the protesters that the higher court had 
ordered the temporary halt to construction, about two dozen demonstrators 
cheered wildly and ran up to the hillside where the bulldozers were perched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop them or we will. We got a restraining order," the environmentalists 
shouted to police officers who were posted at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration stalled traffic going through the narrow, winding canyon for 
about 20 minutes earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary injunction issued Wednesday is expected to be in force for only 
a few days while the judicial panel considers the environmentalists' emergency 
move to get an injunction pending an appeal of McLaughlin's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 A final ruling on the appeal of the lower court's ruling is expected to take 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction "is a small step, but from our perspective, it's an essential 
step," said Joel R. Reynolds, senior staff attorney for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, which is handling the lawsuit for the environmentalists. "If 
the court does not issue this order, the bulldozers could destroy this area in 
a matter of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds bristled at the speed with which the corridor agency sent the 
bulldozers to work after the district court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a total and complete outrage for a public agency to be acting in this 
fashion; for them to so quickly destroy valuable habitat in the midst of Laguna 
Canyon knowing that we were going to be asking for an injunction," Reynolds 
said. "You expect that from private developers, not from a public agency." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dreaded this day for years," protester Mark Sanderson said. "It's too 
late now. This was a pipe dream to think you could stop the gears of progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Martin, a 23-year-old Corona del Mar resident and member of the activist 
Earth First! group, sat alongside Laguna Canyon Road holding a sign made from a 
pizza box that read: "Say Goodby to the Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, spokesman for the tollway agency, said work began immediately 
because the agency is nine months behind schedule because of delays caused by 
the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been delayed for nine months, and the public is ultimately going to 
pay the cost of the millions of dollars in delays caused by Mr. Reynolds and 
the plaintiffs in this case," Stockstill said. "There was no legal constraint 
to beginning work."

ISRAEL EXPANDS HEALTH BENEFITS TO ALL CITIZENS; MIDEAST: UNANIMOUS VOTE IN 
KNESSET ENDS SIX YEARS OF DEBATE. NEW LAW IMPOSES SALARY TAX TO FINANCE 
NATIONAL SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six years of debate and a power struggle that reshaped Israeli politics, 
Parliament on Wednesday enacted a national health law that guarantees medical 
care for all citizens as a basic right. 
</P>
<P>
 The law brings into the country's four medical care funds those Israelis, 
about 6% of the population, who have been without health insurance, often 
because of serious diseases, and it expands the services the funds provide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major change is to finance health care through a 4.8% salary tax and 
to funnel the money through a government agency rather than through Israel's 
trade union federation, whose General Sick Fund is virtually bankrupt after 
years of mismanagement and survives only on government handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have revolutionized the life of Israel's" social services, former Health 
Minister Chaim Ramon said in triumph after the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, 
approved the law, 68-0. "We have changed the entire health system." 
</P>
<P>
 A major element in the law will be the financial incentives offered to health 
funds to enroll children, the elderly and the chronically ill -- in effect, 
fostering competition to provide medical services for those most in need of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a great day for all those who struggled for egalitarian 
medicine in Israel," said Chaim Oron, chairman of the Knesset subcommittee on 
health services. "The law creates a very good basis for the continuing 
political struggle to improve the range (of services)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's passage was a major political victory for Ramon, who quit as health 
minister when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Labor Party leaders 
withdrew their support for his version of the law. Ramon, 44, then campaigned 
for leadership of the Histadrut, the labor federation, defeated the Labor old 
guard there and positioned himself to succeed Rabin, perhaps at the next 
election in two years. He becomes secretary general of the Histadrut later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hailing the new law as finally achieving a goal set by Israel's founders more 
than four decades ago, Ramon said, "Israel will be the same as most progressive 
countries in the world in health care," guaranteeing its citizens advanced 
medical care, allowing them to choose those who provide it and paying for it 
based on their income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dedicated almost every day, since the time I was health minister until 
now, to this," he said. "It was so difficult, with such painful labor pains. . 
. . For me, this is perhaps the greatest, the most important, the sweetest 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The law breaks the mandatory link between membership in the Histadrut and in 
its health care fund, which now covers 67% of Israelis. With support from Labor 
Party leaders, the Histadrut fought bitterly against Ramon to maintain the 
linkage, which has both swelled its membership and ensured a large portion of 
its revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a companion bill levies a 0.8% "organization tax" on salaries that will go 
to Histadrut, effectively requiring virtually all Israeli workers, including 
non-union members, to support the federation, long one of the most powerful 
institutions in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation incorporates in the basic health care services guaranteed all 
Israelis a number of benefits, such as prenatal care, that the General Sick 
Fund began offering this year in an effort to retain its members in the face of 
strong competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also provides for state financial assistance for those in old age 
homes and for elderly citizens receiving nursing care; the state will also 
continue to cover psychiatric care, including hospitalization. Under the 
legislation, the government will monitor the health care funds far more closely 
than it has done in the past to ensure that they provide proper medical 
services and are well managed.

MARKETING; THE SQUEEZE IS ON TO CAN RUSH; LIMBAUGH'S PROMOTION OF FLORIDA 
ORANGE JUICE HAS CREATED A FIRESTORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after a furor erupted over the decision to pay radio talk show 
host Rush Limbaugh $1 million to tout Florida orange juice, stagnant sales and 
a stepped-up national boycott have put the squeeze on the state Citrus 
Commission to can the outspoken conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not seen any outstanding results from Mr. Limbaugh's promotion," said 
William E. Owens, one of 12 commissioners who will meet next month to consider 
renewing Limbaugh's contract. "I don't think the members of the commission 
realized how controversial he turned out to be. I am going to vote no." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy M. Leventhal, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Citrus, insists 
that Limbaugh is not an official spokesman for orange juice, but rather the 
host of a top-rated, nationally syndicated radio program hired to read 
advertising copy. Limbaugh's program was just one part of a diverse $17-million 
media buy for an ad campaign built around the tag line, "Florida orange juice, 
to your health." 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not set out to create controversy," Leventhal says. Nonetheless, 
controversy is what the commission got. In more than 26,500 telephone calls, 
letters and faxes received by the Department of Citrus through last week, 
opposition to Limbaugh is running 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for calling some women's rights activists "femi-nazis" and bashing gays, 
environmentalists and Democrats, Limbaugh has become so closely associated with 
Florida orange juice that he is being compared to past spokespersons who became 
equally controversial: Anita Bryant and Burt Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, a singer, pitched orange juice for 12 years until her opposition to 
gay rights got her fired in 1980. Reynolds' one-year contract to hawk O.J. was 
not renewed after his split with wife, Loni Anderson, turned nasty and went 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott of Florida orange juice -- labeled the "Flush Rush campaign" -- is 
being spearheaded by the National Organization for Women and has received 
support from the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the 
National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter mailed to hundreds of groups last month, NOW President Patricia 
Ireland said that Limbaugh's "hatemongering is being underwritten by state and 
federal tax dollars," and urges support of the boycott "to expose the hateful, 
divisive fanaticism of Rush Limbaugh." Enlisting support for the boycott is 
high on the agenda of NOW's national convention, which begins July 1 in San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Florida orange juice, NOW also has called for a boycott of Coca 
Cola, which owns Minute Maid, a major buyer of Florida oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Limbaugh likes to say he is a harmless little fuzz ball, but believe me, he's 
not harmless," Ireland says. "He knows his audience very well, and makes them 
laugh. But what he says is very harmful to women's rights. When he calls women 
'femi-nazis' and says they are trying to criminalize courtship, that's not 
funny or harmless." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy spilled over into the Florida Legislature in March when a 
Senate committee held up the normally routine appointment of three members to 
the Citrus Commission. Some lawmakers said the reason for the delay was to 
protest the composition of the commission, which is made up of 11 white men and 
one white woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Limbaugh also was a target. "We're looking for people who will present the 
best possible image for Florida citrus -- not people who will engender hate, 
disregard for minorities, or represent any political philosophy," state Sen. 
Peter Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Quarles, president of the California-Arizona Citrus League, says he has 
seen no evidence that the flap in Florida has spurred sales of Western orange 
juice. But a Citrus Commission spokesman said sales of Florida orange juice 
have been flat since Limbaugh began touting the drink, although other 
variables, such as price, may be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Says commissioner Owens, a grower from Indiantown: "In the future, I kind of 
think we should not use a personality to promote our product. I think we could 
do just as well without it."

EDUCATION; FIGHT OVER COMMUNITY SERVICE MANDATE GOES FROM CLASSROOM TO 
COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Maintaining a good academic average just isn't enough to graduate nowadays in 
a growing number of high schools across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Students now have to do time -- time in nursing homes and nature preserves, 
food banks and homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several years, an increasing number of school districts have made 
community service a requirement for receiving a diploma. Proponents of the 
plans say they believe that they are necessary to counter a decline in civic 
values among many members of the MTV generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community service work is crucial for American youth," said David Sawyer, 
director of Students for Appalachia, a community service program at Kentucky's 
Beria College. "It develops people who understand citizenship as 
problem-solving and taking responsibility in your community and your country." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees.  
</P>
<P>
 For Daniel Immediato, 17, an 11th-grader at Rye Neck High School in 
Mamaroneck, N.Y., the issue is one of money. "I didn't really want to work for 
free," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aric Herndon, 14, a ninth-grader at Chapel Hill High School in North Carolina, 
already considers himself a full-fledged volunteer. He often performs community 
work through his Boy Scout activities. But his high school contends earning 
badges is a form of payment -- thus a form of personal benefit. The two 
students, with their different perspectives, are united by two separate 
lawsuits they filed against their school districts to challenge community 
service requirements for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine for public schools to say: 'We don't care if you don't do algebra 
ever again, but we want you to learn the skills now.' But with community 
service it's different," said Scott Bullock, an attorney for the Institute of 
Justice, the Washington-based libertarian organization sponsoring the federal 
court suits. "Students are being forced to go out into the community and 
provide free labor for other individuals or organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 The institute contends that mandatory community service violates the 
Constitution's 13th Amendment prohibition against involuntary servitude as well 
as the due process provisions of the 14th Amendment, which the group maintains 
gives parents the right to direct their children's education.

 Immediato and Herndon are not the first opponents of forced community service 
plans to be represented by the institute. The group previously assisted Lynn 
Steirer, a student from Bethlehem, Pa. Federal courts denied Steirer's 
position, and the Supreme Court refused last year to hear an appeal. But the 
institute is hoping that the more recent cases will force the high court to 
alter its position. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are swimming against a powerful tide. A survey this year by the 
Educational Research Service found more than 30% of U.S. public and private 
high schools, including the Laguna Beach Unified and Saddleback Valley Unified 
school districts, either require community service or plan to implement it 
within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement received a boost in 1992 when the Maryland State Board of 
Education voted to require 75 hours of community service from all public high 
school students in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the nonprofit sector support the programs, seeing it as a way to gain 
volunteers and a chance to sway young minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators believe students gain valuable learning experience from volunteer 
work. They say students benefit from being expected to contribute to their 
communities as well as from exposure to different kinds of people. "They give 
our students the skills they need to be successful in their personal lives 
beyond school," said Rahima Wade, a University of Iowa education professor.  
</P>
<P>
 At Rye Neck High School, students perform their service duties through a class 
called Managing Your Future. "You read a lot today about schools not doing a 
good job of preparing students for the transition from school to work," said 
Phyllis Jaffe, the lawyer representing the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A program which does require an application for a job, working for 10 hours a 
year for four years outside of the classroom, how to deal with people, dress, 
be on time, and make a commitment and stick with it -- this is part of the 
transition school districts have been accused of not doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are dissenters within the education Establishment. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Voluntary dedication is an important factor in motivating people to 
participate in public life, and when you make something mandatory, you lose or 
undermine the feeling," said Reed Ueda, an associate professor of American 
history at Tufts University in Massachusetts. "In the end, while it may seem 
like a cure to the decline of civilization, it may actually lead to a 
weakening." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students say they have mixed feelings about the programs. On a recent 
day, Cord Chase, 18, took a 15-minute break from building a butterfly haven at 
New York's Rye Nature Preserve to explain his position. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, a senior at Rye High School, supports the program. He says that since 
he's been volunteering at the nature preserve, he's more environmentally aware 
and he's stopped littering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to coming here. I know it sounds corny, but it isn't. It gives 
me something to do after school, and it keeps my mom off my back," he said.

VATICAN, ISRAEL CEMENT FULL DIPLOMATIC TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Vatican established full diplomatic ties Wednesday and said 
ambassadors will be exchanged soon, sealing a historic accord on mutual 
recognition and reconciliation after centuries of bitterness between Roman 
Catholics and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said he and Vatican envoy 
Archbishop Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo signed the relations agreement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides had signed a 14-point "fundamental agreement" in December 
officially recognizing each other, but they delayed full ties until final 
details could be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin portrayed the pact as a fruit of Israel's peace accord with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. The Vatican is the 41st state to either 
establish, renew or upgrade ties with Israel since Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin said the agreement recognizes the Vatican's right to have a say on the 
status of Jerusalem, especially the protection of holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that one of the "important fruits" of the agreement will be a 
rare exhibition of the Dead Sea Scrolls on June 29 at the Vatican. He said the 
scrolls, discovered nearly 50 years ago, have never been displayed in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Two commissions of experts will now work out details of the legal and fiscal 
status of the Catholic Church and its possessions in the Holy Land, Beilin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican will open its embassy in Jaffa, a former Arab town that is now 
part of Tel Aviv and has a sizable Christian Arab population.

LATIN AMERICAN, IBERIAN LEADERS WILL PUSH FOR END TO U.S. EMBARGO OF CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of Latin America, Spain and Portugal agreed Wednesday to push for an 
end to the 30-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Communist Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the fourth annual Ibero-American Summit, more than 20 heads of 
state and government approved a declaration that included their most critical 
reference ever to U.S. economic measures against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the leaders also pressured Cuban President Fidel Castro to implement 
democratic reforms in his country, although that was not part of the 
declaration. In a news conference, however, President Carlos Saul Menem of 
Argentina linked the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want Cuba to return to democracy, so we are going to pressure strongly for 
the United States to withdraw those measures," Menem said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Latin American diplomat predicted that the region's leaders will ask 
President Clinton to lift the embargo when they meet at a summit of Western 
Hemisphere nations scheduled for December in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to tell Mr. Clinton: more trade, more interchange, and you are 
going to see things change in Cuba," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the leaders defended Cuba's Communist system. "We all want Cuba to 
change economically and politically," said Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. 
"I think everyone in this meeting has tried to persuade President Castro to 
make changes." 
</P>
<P>
 The summit included efforts to create a Western Hemisphere free-trade zone. 
Menem said that without democratic reforms, Cuba would be excluded from such a 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the decisive step that Cuba must take -- return to democracy -- to be 
integrated completely with the other countries of Latin America," he said.

JAPANESE WITHDRAWS CONTROVERSIAL BOOK ON HITLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Japanese author has withdrawn a book he wrote praising Adolf Hitler's 
political strategies while neglecting to mention the Nazi dictator's crimes 
against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitler's Election Strategy: A Bible for Sure Victory in Modern Elections" 
stirred debate just as the former World War II Allies were commemorating D-day, 
the Western offensive that led to Hitler's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish groups around the world objected that author Yoshio Ogai had portrayed 
Hitler in a favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppered with small cartoons of the Nazi dictator, the book does not mention 
the atrocities against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogai is spokesman for the Tokyo office of the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party, the conservative party that ruled Japan for 38 years before being ousted 
last summer by a reformist coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 He was out of town and could not be reached, office director Nobuyuki Akiba 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Akiba confirmed that Ogai had asked the publisher, Chiyoda Nagata Shobo, 
to withdraw the book from circulation and stop printing it. The initial run of 
3,000 copies sold out at major Tokyo bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not mean to say that he supported Hitler, but it was taken that way," 
Akiba said. "So he decided that if it was going to cause trouble and hurt 
people's feelings he should withdraw it." 
</P>
<P>
 The book did not make a splash when it was first published in early May. Many 
Japanese have stereotyped opinions of Jews, and books purporting to expose 
various Jewish conspiracies have sold well in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to criticism, Ogai said last week that he was "not neo-Nazi, or an 
admirer of Hitler. I want people to know his other sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal 
Center, said it was "almost beyond belief" that such a book could come out so 
close to the D-day celebrations.

CONGRESS TOLD OF BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 11 institutions falsified data, failed to enroll patients properly or 
misplaced key data in a national breast cancer research project, officials told 
Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A re-examination of clinical trial records at 120 of the 500 institutions 
participating in the National Surgical Adjuvent Breast and Bowel Project have 
found what one official called "serious problems" at sites including Memorial 
Cancer Research Foundation in Los Angeles and UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony about the troubled $9-million research project came at a hearing 
before a House subcommittee and included the first public testimony by Dr. 
Bernard Fisher, who until March directed the project. He took responsibility 
for what he called administrative errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was removed after it was disclosed that researchers at St. Luc Hospital 
and St. Mary's Hospital in Montreal had been falsifying data. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher had been in charge of the national cancer research effort headquartered 
at the University of Pittsburgh for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The data falsification, which started in the 1980s at St. Luc, was known by 
project officials and by the National Cancer Institute for months before it 
became public.

WORKER INSTALLING AN ELECTRICAL CABLE HIT BY 14,400 VOLTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting zapped with 14,400 volts was enough to set his clothes on fire, but 
John Mays says about all he remembers "was one big flash." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers put out the flames Tuesday, but the shock to his muscles kept the 
construction worker from letting go of an electrical transformer he had been 
working on. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I came to. I told the guys to get some help. . . . I was stuck 
there for a while," Mays, 47, said from Parkland Hospital in Dallas. He was 
listed in fair condition Wednesday, suffering mostly second-degree burns over 
15% of his body.

U.S. OFFERS ASSURANCES TO SOFTEN HAITIAN MILITARY; CARIBBEAN: SOURCES SAY ARMY 
WON'T BE CUT BACK IF ARISTIDE RETURNS. APPARENT SHIFT IS AIMED AT REDUCING 
RESISTANCE TO RESTORATION OF THE EXILED PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is trying to weaken Haitian military resistance to the 
restoration of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with assurances that the 
army will not be seriously cut back nor will most senior officers be removed, 
diplomats and other sources here and in Washington say. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a seeming shift from the recent American policy of seeking a 
substantial reduction in the 7,000-member army, its separation from the police 
and a total restructuring of both institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still want to professionalize the military, and we will insist on a 
separate police," one U.S. official said, "but we now think that if we can 
convince the military it won't be destroyed and the soldiers won't be thrown 
out of work they might not follow Cedras and the others." 
</P>
<P>
 He was talking about the exceptions to the new approach: Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, the regime's military strongman; Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army chief 
of staff; and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, Haitian police commander. These 
men also led the 1991 coup that drove Aristide, Haiti's first democratically 
elected president, from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Their resignations and departures are among demands made by the United States 
and the United Nations for ending the economic and political embargo strangling 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian military leaders have effectively used fears about possible job losses 
and other punishments to maintain solidarity in their force. But some officials 
here said the seeming shift in tone and policy on this topic is designed to 
weaken the hold of senior officers; one diplomat in Haiti called it the "carrot 
of the carrot and stick" approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day (the Americans) are issuing menacing statements about invasions, and 
the next day the military is told they don't have to worry if they cooperate," 
the diplomat said. Another official agreed, but noted that "of course, this 
(offer) is not open-ended, and all bets are off if the military resists" in the 
event the United States takes military action to restore Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The comments about the military here also would seem, potentially, to 
constrain American policy here, particularly in view of past assessments by 
senior U.S. officials in Washington and Haiti that they had been unable to find 
a senior or even mid-level Haitian officer who could be trusted to lead a 
restructured army. Speaking of what the army might expect after Aristide's 
restoration, one official said that other than forcing a few transfers, "the 
rest can stay. That is all that the U.N. resolution calls for." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to a May 6 resolution of the U.N. Security Council demanding 
that the three top officers resign and leave Haiti in order to restore 
Aristide, whom they overthrew in a coup Sept. 30, 1991. While it is true that 
the resolution discussed just those three officers and previous agreements had 
offered amnesty to the military, U.S. policy was to go beyond that narrow view. 
U.S. officials since have said they would seek a reduction and restructuring of 
the army, including removal of officers involved in criminal acts and human 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, said one diplomat, referring to a failed agreement in July to restore 
Aristide, the Governors Island accord "was abrogated by Cedras. We certainly 
don't have to live by the provisions designed to help out the man who reneged." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the interpretation, most officials and sources interviewed shared the 
view that an attempt had to be made to create problems for Cedras inside the 
military. The Americans "want to create as much dissatisfaction and dissension 
as possible in the ranks," one diplomat said. "That's what the ship is for." 
</P>
<P>
 He was discussing a ship-borne radio station, authorized by President Clinton, 
to broadcast to Haiti. "Well," said an official, "you're right. The point of 
much of the broadcast will be to urge the troops to get rid of Cedras, Biamby 
and Francois and to assure them they will be safe and have jobs afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as these sources were speaking, many Haitians were speculating that a 
split was developing in the army and at the highest levels. The furor began 
Tuesday when Evans Francois, elder brother of the police commander, called a 
radio station here from the Dominican Republic, demanding that Cedras resign 
and stating that Michel Francois "is ready to make concessions to save the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Francois reacted overnight with a statement rejecting his brother's 
position and calling the demand for Cedras' resignation "offensive and 
inopportune." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and Haitian analysts split in their view as to the significance of 
this development. "It is serious," one Haitian political expert said. "We know 
that Michel has been uncomfortable with Cedras and Biamby for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it means anything other than Evans is frightened," another 
source said. "Anyway, you know that Evans and Michel had a falling out over 
Governors Island and (Evans) has been out of the country most of the time 
since." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as this situation was developing, there were renewed efforts to persuade 
Cedras to leave. This is being done with promises that he would lead a 
comfortable life in exile. A senior Administration official in Washington said 
he would find it "fine" if another nation offered exile to Cedras; the United 
States would even help him leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not negotiating anything" because the Administration doesn't want to 
send "mixed signals" to either Cedras or to Aristide supporters, the official 
said. But when asked if any other nation was working on exile arrangements with 
the general, the source answered: "I can't say what anyone else might do. But 
if Cedras said he wanted to leave and wanted safe passage, what do you think 
we'd do? We'd ask: 'Do you need a plane? How can we help?' And we'd say: 'Have 
a nice life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, diplomats from countries likely to accept Cedras refused to 
comment, but some said privately that there have been talks about the general's 
going to France or Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 While the American official's comments reflected previous agreements reached 
between Aristide and Cedras -- including amnesty in exchange for Cedras' 
resignation and departure -- some Haitian analysts and diplomats saw the 
comments as exactly what the official claimed to be trying to avoid -- sending 
mixed signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you convince someone as determined and hardheaded as Cedras that he 
should leave now, if at the same time you're telling him he will be flown out 
in comfort and allowed to keep his money and live in luxury in Paris?" this 
source asked. "Of course he'll stay until they come and take him away. What 
they should tell him is that he has X number of days to resign and get out and 
that if he's still here when the troops come, he goes to jail. He might 
understand that."

GRIEVING FAMILY RECALLS VICTIM AS FRIENDLY, KIND; KIN: GOLDMANS TEARFULLY TELL 
OF THEIR SON'S PLANS. NICOLE SIMPSON'S RELATIVES ARE IN SECLUSION UNTIL 
SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Family and friends of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman grieved in 
public and in private Wednesday, trying to concentrate on the goodness the two 
victims embodied. 
</P>
<P>
 At an emotional news conference in front of the Goldman family's home in the 
Ventura County community of Oak Park, Fred Goldman wept as he tried to put his 
son's short life into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine that your flesh and blood, a 25-year-old, could touch so 
many people," said Goldman, who was flanked by his wife, Patti, and daughter, 
Kim. "Ron was a special human being who didn't deserve what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the home of Nicole Simpson's parents in Monarch Bay, a gated 
community in south Orange County, a woman who identified herself as a friend of 
the family answered the phone and said the children of Nicole and O.J. Simpson 
-- Sidney, 9, and Justin, 6 -- were staying with their grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend said the children had been told that their mother was dead and were 
doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances. She said the family 
was not prepared to talk until next week after funeral services. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman described his son as a carefree young man who quickly made friends 
wherever he went. He said he would not be surprised if Ron had struck up a 
friendship with Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not uncommon for Ron to have friends who were young ladies," he said. 
But his son never spoke of a more serious relationship with her. "We would have 
known," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Goldman said the manager of Mezzaluna, the restaurant where Ron Goldman 
was a waiter, told him that when Nicole Simpson called to say she had left her 
glasses at the restaurant, Ron Goldman volunteered to return them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't surprise me to find out from his work that when Nicole called to 
say she left her prescription glasses that Ron would be the one to offer to 
take them to her," he said. "His answer was, 'I don't mind, she lives close by 
and I'll be glad to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman also addressed police reports that his son struggled with his attacker 
before he died. "If it's true that Ron put up quite a fight, maybe to help 
Nicole, that wouldn't surprise me either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman would not respond to questions about his son's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to get into all the innuendo and rumors and all that 
other monkey business that's been going on," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim Goldman, 22, said she hoped that the publicity surrounding her brother's 
case would help lead to an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "As horrible as (the publicity) is, I'm grateful," she said. "At least this 
way Ron will be remembered in a positive way and maybe it will help them find 
out who did this to him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said the family has not been in frequent contact with police and did not 
know about the status of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Goldman said tearfully that his son was killed just as he was beginning 
to put his life in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, Ron's aspirations have been multifold," he said, recounting 
his son's various professional plans, which ranged from becoming a tennis pro 
to working as a paramedic. Ultimately, he said, his son had decided he wanted 
to be in the restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was telling me he had been looking around hoping to open up a place," he 
said. "He was putting his life together." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman added: "Even when things didn't go 100% with the things he wanted to 
do, he seemed to have a way of bouncing back. The bottom line is that Ron was a 
good person from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet, inside and 
out."  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Goldman's mother, Sharon Rufo, could not be reached for comment at her 
home in Missouri, but a cousin said the family was preparing to come to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Goldman said his former wife has been out of contact with their two 
children since Ron was 5 and Kim was 3. He said Kim called their mother to tell 
her of Ron's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said the funeral will be private.

THERAPIST MAY FACE DISCIPLINE FOR DISCUSSING CASE; COUNSELING: SOCIAL WORKER 
SUSAN FORWARD APPEARS TO HAVE VIOLATED NICOLE SIMPSON'S PRIVACY BY REVEALING 
COMMENTS, AN OFFICIAL FOR STATE EXAMINERS OFFICE SAYS.

<P>
 Encino social worker Susan Forward may face professional disciplinary action 
for violating the privacy of her former client Nicole Brown Simpson when 
Forward revealed comments Simpson made during therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward, a licensed clinical social worker, said during numerous media 
interviews Tuesday that she had counseled Nicole Simpson on two occasions and 
that Simpson told her she had been battered and threatened by O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, divorced from O.J. Simpson in 1992, was slain outside her 
Brentwood condominium late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the state Board of Behavioral Science Examiners, which governs 
licensed clinical social workers, said Wednesday that Forward appears to have 
violated Nicole Simpson's privacy -- even in her death. 
</P>
<P>
 And Forward said Wednesday that she had erred in discussing those therapy 
sessions publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of "Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them," Forward said 
in a television interview she made an honest mistake and violated a 
doctor-patient confidentiality privilege in disclosing the nature of her 
conversations with Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, however, raises the sensitive question of how far the 
patient-therapist privilege extends. 
</P>
<P>
 Private therapy conversations are, in most cases, legally protected from 
public disclosure, experts say, even when the patient is dead. Moreover, most 
professional therapy codes generally forbid disclosure of a deceased patient's 
records or comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dead person has the same confidentiality rights as a living person," said 
Sherry L. Skidmore, a forensic psychologist in Riverside who is an expert on 
professional ethics codes for therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the state Business and Professions Code and the state Civil Code forbid 
the unauthorized release of any medical records -- including mental health 
records -- except under very specific circumstances, such as a subpoena or 
search warrant, said Kathleen Callanan, executive officer of the Board of 
Behavioral Science Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on these codes, the board is considering disciplinary action against 
Forward, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, it does appear there was a breach of confidentiality," Callanan 
said. "At this point, the board is considering opening an investigation into 
this matter and is gathering information." Forward may be subject to the 
suspension or loss of her license. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts, however, said it is not clear whether Forward actually broke 
any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward did not return repeated phone calls Wednesday. She did appear on the 
CNN program "Sonya Live" Wednesday to say that she had made a mistake in 
discussing Nicole Simpson with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward has said in interviews that she had counseled Nicole Simpson during 
her divorce. In two sessions, Forward said, Nicole Simpson confided that the 
former football star had, on occasion, beaten, stalked and threatened to kill 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward operates the Susan Forward Therapy Center on Ventura Boulevard in 
Encino, a large practice where several therapists maintain offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Several mental health professionals said they were disturbed by Forward's 
revelations and fear people will think they cannot trust their therapists to 
keep their conversations private. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read (Forward's comments), and I was stunned," said Dr. Peter B. Gruenberg, 
a Beverly Hills psychiatrist and vice chairman of the ethics committee for the 
American Psychiatric Assn. "The vast majority of (therapists) would never say 
something about a deceased patient." 
</P>
<P>
 The code of ethics for psychiatrists clearly disallows such disclosure, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An ethics code governing licensed clinical social workers does not 
specifically address the rights of the deceased, said Elizabeth DuMez of the 
National Assn. of Social Workers, a professional group with 150,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, the code does state that privileged information should not be 
disclosed except for "compelling professional reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "Apart from that, the general sense is that simply because the client has died 
doesn't automatically release one from a sense of responsibility to that 
client," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward is not a member of that professional group, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 According to legal experts, a patient possesses the confidentiality privilege, 
and only the patient can waive it. If the patient is dead, it can be waived 
only by a legal representative, usually the executor of the estate or an 
administrator appointed by a court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, the privilege stays after the death," said Michael Perlin, a New 
York University law school professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are several legal exceptions to the confidentiality requirements, 
experts say. For example, if a patient threatens to harm himself or someone 
else, the therapist is required to report the threats to authorities and to any 
potential victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists are also required to report child abuse. The privilege is also 
waived when a patient threatens the therapist with harm. 
</P>
<P>
 A patient also generally loses the privilege when he or she files litigation 
against anyone in which mental distress is claimed. The therapist can be 
required to turn over notes and to testify about conversations with the client. 
</P>
<P>
 It is less clear whether a psychotherapist has a duty to report threats a 
patient says she has received, such as those Forward said Nicole Simpson told 
her about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is an easy answer there," said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, 
professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at the University of 
Massachusetts Medical School. "Ordinarily, therapists abide by patients' 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could imagine circumstances in which a therapist believed a patient was in 
fact in serious danger and was not competently making the decision not to 
reveal that information. The therapist might feel compelled as an ethical 
matter to take steps to protect the patient, which involve breaching 
confidentiality. But that would be quite an exception to the usual rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Several social workers have called the Board of Behavioral Science Examiners 
to complain about Forward's comments, Callanan said. And she said she is 
concerned about the public's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is reason for concern," she said. "You certainly would not want 
people thinking that just because they die that the therapist can release 
everything in therapy."

DNA TESTS ON BLOOD WON'T YIELD ANSWERS FOR MONTHS; FORENSICS: INITIAL MATCHING 
CAN BE DONE QUICKLY, EXPERTS SAY. DEFINITIVE RESULTS TAKE MUCH LONGER, BUT THEY 
HAVE 999,999-IN-1-MILLION ACCURACY.

 Laboratory comparisons of bloodstains from O.J. Simpson's car, and driveway 
and the crime scene with blood from Simpson and the two victims already have 
yielded some results. But the techniques used to obtain such a rapid analysis 
are not definitive, experts said Wednesday, and results of a more conclusive 
DNA test will not be available for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tests for blood type, there are other conventional tests -- 
based on comparisons of proteins in the blood -- that can show with up to 99% 
certainty that two blood samples are identical, and a large number of 
convictions have resulted from their use, said Jack Mertens, supervisor of the 
DNA unit at the FBI's forensic laboratory in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood analysis can proceed through as many as five separate stages, Mertens 
said. The first critical test is to determine if, in fact, a stain is blood. 
That can be done in as little as 10 minutes by swabbing a small portion of the 
stain with chemicals that will produce a visible reaction with hemoglobin, 
which is present in all blood. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sample is blood, the next step is to dissolve it in a liquid, a process 
usually accomplished by allowing the sample to soak overnight. Once the blood 
is suspended in a solution, researchers apply antibodies to determine if it is 
human or animal blood. That takes about four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to determine the blood type or group, a process that takes 
only a couple of hours. This was done in the Simpson case, but Mertens said 
many labs now skip this step because it yields little information. For example, 
If the blood is found to be Type AB, a rare group, then only 1 person in 10 in 
the general population would match it. But if it is Type O, nearly half the 
population would match. 
</P>
<P>
 To refine matching, researchers have started looking at enzymes and other 
proteins in the blood. As many as 19 different proteins, which occur in each 
person's blood in different combinations, are used in this process. This 
analysis takes about four hours. If the pattern of proteins in blood from 
Simpson's car, for example, is the same as the pattern in one of the victims' 
blood, the chances are 99 in 100 that the blood in the car is from a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good, but it's not great," Mertens said. "It's most useful in the 
initial screening process when they don't match," meaning that two specimens 
come from different individuals. Such results could show that an individual did 
not commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The process yields results in about two days, according to Mertens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of DNA testing a few years ago, that 1% of doubt in the 
matching process can be greatly reduced. For that reason, the FBI lab and some 
others skip the conventional tests and go directly to DNA studies, Mertens 
said. In these tests, researchers extract DNA from blood cells, break it down 
into small fragments and compare the pattern of fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA tests take longer because of their complexity, but they are usually worth 
waiting for. If DNA testing shows that blood from Simpson's car matches that of 
his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, the chances are at least 999,999 in 1 
million that the blood in the car is hers. The same would hold true if a blood 
sample at the townhouse where Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman 
were slain match Simpson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is irrelevant that samples in a driveway or a car have dried out, Mertens 
said. Drying actually preserves the integrity of the samples because it helps 
preserve proteins and DNA, he noted. In fact, laboratories typically dry out 
blood samples obtained from victims or criminals before testing to ensure that 
all samples have been treated in a comparable manner.

FEDERAL PANEL PROPOSES RUSH-HOUR HIGHWAY TOLLS; TRAFFIC: 'CONGESTION PRICING' 
WOULD IMPROVE TRAVEL AND CUT DOWN ON POLLUTION, REPORT SAYS. MOTORISTS' GROUPS 
SAY PLAN IS A DISGUISED TAX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After studying traffic jams for two years, a National Research Council panel 
has decided that the best way to curb highway backups is to impose fees on 
commuters who drive at peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "In response to these fees, some motorists would vary the times they travel, 
alter their routes, car-pool, use public transit, choose other destinations or 
avoid some trips," the panel said in a report released Tuesday. The National 
Research Council is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. The study was 
financed by the Federal Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, from long-distance phone carriers to airlines to restaurants, 
charge more for their services during high-traffic periods. And a renewed 
emphasis on efficient transportation, coupled with motorists' rising 
frustration with delays, is fueling interest in "congestion pricing" on busy 
highways across the nation, including Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Peak-period fees averaging 10 cents to 15 cents a mile, or $2 to $3 for a 
daily round trip, would reduce congestion by 10% to 15% and cut commuting time 
by about 20%, the panel estimated. Off-peak tolls would vary depending on 
traffic conditions. Reducing highway traffic would also cut down on 
ozone-depleting emissions and fuel consumption, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Current technology would allow the fees to be collected electronically, the 
report said. Computers in toll booths could communicate with electronic tags on 
motorists' dashboards, allowing commuters to prepay the fees or have their 
accounts debited without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become clear that America's metropolitan areas cannot build their way 
out of congestion," said Martin Wachs, chairman of the National Research 
Council committee and a professor of urban planning at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal support for the idea so far has been limited, but the Transportation 
Department is funding a handful of pilot programs for congestion-pricing around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel urged Congress to increase funding for the programs in 1997, when 
the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which includes money for 
the experiments, will be reconsidered. One proposed government experiment would 
hike the $1 toll on the San Francisco Bay Bridge by $1 or $2 during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But congestion-pricing proponents acknowledged that winning wider support for 
the concept, both on Capitol Hill and among motorists, will not be as easy as 
taking a Sunday drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public and political perceptions about fairness and about motorist resistance 
to paying for services which they previously viewed as free will be significant 
obstacles," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Transportation Department set aside $150 million in its budget to 
support congestion-pricing experiments last year, only 16 transit authorities 
submitted plans for the projects. Part of the reason for the tepid response, 
transportation officials said, is that lawmakers are leery of backing a program 
that could be interpreted as a road-use tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to market rush-hour tolls to drivers, a Federal Highway 
Administration expert said, would be to use the new toll revenue for public 
transit or to offset local gas taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists' groups derided the idea, saying that "a tax by any other name is 
still a tax," and they argued that commuters should not have to pay to use a 
road that they already had financed with tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peak-period pricing's effectiveness stops where theory and reality meet," 
said Lester P. Lamm, president of the Highway Users Federation. "While the 
report outlines a variety of theoretical ways to compensate for peak-period 
pricing's massive inequities, it ignores the political reality of current tax 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Automobile Assn. called congestion-pricing unnecessary. AAA data 
shows that the nation's highways took on 22 million new commuters between 1980 
and 1990, while the average commuting time increased by only 42 seconds to 
about 23 minutes.

COURT REFUSES TO DISMISS LAWMAKER'S BRIBERY CHARGES

 A congressman has no special protection from criminal charges, a federal 
appeals panel ruled Wednesday in allowing a racketeering and bribery trial for 
Rep. Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
 McDade had used the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause in asking for 
dismissal of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the House of Representatives supported McDade's argument before 
the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for 
the majority, dismissed the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 The clause McDade cited was inserted into the Constitution to block the 
executive branch from using its powers of investigation and prosecution to 
interfere with the legislative work of Congress. While extending broad 
protection to legislative activities, the clause generally has not been 
interpreted as barring prosecution of a congressman for bribery. 
</P>
<P>
 McDade's attorney, Sal Cognetti, had not reviewed the decision but said he 
remained "extremely confident that the congressman will be vindicated." He said 
McDade can request a rehearing before the full 3rd Circuit, appeal to the U.S. 
Supreme Court or go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 McDade was indicted in May, 1992, on two counts of conspiracy, two counts of 
accepting a gratuity and one count of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that over a five-year period, McDade extracted more than 
$100,000 worth of favors from various defense contractors in return for helping 
them secure more than $50 million worth of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, the favors included a $7,500 scholarship for one 
of his children, plane flights and a sports coat.

TOBACCO REGULATION PLAN STALLED AS ATTEMPT AT QUICK PASSAGE FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a setback for advocates of tobacco restrictions, the House Rules Committee 
on Wednesday rejected a plan for a fast-track vote on authorizing the Food and 
Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products without banning their use. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel refused to allow a waiver that would have permitted the regulatory 
proposal to be offered this week as an amendment to a bill providing 
appropriations for the Department of Agriculture.This means that the proposal 
to regulate tobacco is probably dead for this year and will have to wait until 
the next Congress convenes in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), a senior member of the Rules 
Committee, said that the panel decided against the waiver after Rep. John D. 
Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said it 
would infringe on his panel's jurisdiction over the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), one of the principal advocates of the 
regulatory plan, expressed disappointment at the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "By failing to act, we have let many people down," Durbin said in a statement. 
"The tobacco industry will continue to lure our children into the ranks of 
addicted smokers, and more than 1,000 Americans will continue to die each day 
from tobacco-related diseases. While the tobacco lobby may have won this 
battle, regulation is inevitable."  
</P>
<P>
 Durbin urged FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler to use his existing authority 
to regulate tobacco while Congress continues to consider the issue.

SCIENTISTS FIND ANTI-BLEEDING BLOOD PROTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists have discovered a key blood protein that prevents bleeding in 
people being treated for cancer or blood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bleeding can be fatal, and doctors often reduce or delay chemotherapy, 
which suppresses the body's manufacturing of blood cells critical to clotting, 
because of the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the discovery may be the next major breakthrough in the 
biotechnology industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The protein prods the body into making platelets, microscopic disks in the 
blood that rush to the sites of injury and clump together to stop bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding of the protein is reported in today's issue of the journal Nature 
by two independent research teams. One included scientists at Genentech Inc. of 
South San Francisco and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.; the other team was 
from ZymoGenetics Corp. of Seattle and the University of Washington School of 
Medicine in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The protein stimulates the creation of specialized blood cells that make 
platelets, and makes the cells mature. Scientists found animal versions of it 
and then identified the human gene for it, which revealed the chemical makeup 
of the human version. The Genentech-Mayo team reported using the gene to make 
the human protein. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment with the new protein may let doctors give more effective doses of 
cancer medicines.

HANDS-ON SCIENCE TASKS ARE PART OF TEST FOR 5TH-GRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Forget No. 2 pencils. For the state's newest standardized test, students use 
rocks, trucks, round metal washers and an army of plastic insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced this year, the fifth-grade California Learning Assessment System 
test includes hands-on science tasks and social science exercises gauging 
knowledge of California and U.S. geography and history, according to copies 
obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The most innovative portion of the exam -- which has received little attention 
amid the furor over the language arts components of CLAS -- is Science Booklet 
2, in which students conduct a variety of experiments to plan a "critter 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Working in groups, children test rocks' durability, analyze a loaded truck's 
ability to move on different paths and group bugs according to their anatomy 
and characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 First, students must select a material for the benches and tables in the 
museum's picnic area and explain why they believe it will hold up best under 
wind, rain and abuse. Then, test-takers choose whether to truck material to the 
museum site along smooth or gravel roads, using a rudimentary system made from 
a paper cup, a piece of string and metal washers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, students place tiny plastic bugs in groups and fill out information 
cards for a makeshift museum exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Science Booklet 1 is more straightforward, with eight standard multiple-choice 
questions, and two more multiple-choice questions in which students must 
explain their answers. But the content is thoroughly geared to students' lives 
and reflects California's ethnically diverse student population. 
</P>
<P>
 One question concerns Mrs. Coe's fifth-grade science class field trip. Another 
shows Maria's record of the temperature in her classroom. Several follow up on 
the Rodriguez or Shafik or Lee families' hiking, camping and picnic trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the situations designed around children, CLAS tests students' 
knowledge of plant life, astronomy, electric circuits, outer space, animal 
digestion and weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The second part of the fifth-grade test -- social science and history -- is 
the most traditional form of California's revolutionary performance-based 
assessments. Students label the rivers and mountains on a U.S. map, answer 
eight multiple-choice questions and write one or two essays, depending on which 
of six versions of the test they are given. 
</P>
<P>
 One version shows students a poster advertising a slave auction and asks for 
an essay about "why slaves were used in the South," "how slaves found ways to 
resist," "what being slaves meant for a Negro family" and "how slaves developed 
a culture to survive their day-to-day lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Another essay asks why people settled the colonies, while a third instructs 
children to pretend it is the time of the American Revolution and "write a 
letter to a friend about which side you would support." 
</P>
<P>
 Other essay assignments concern Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, pioneer 
trails (students also must label a map), the New England Colonial economy, the 
Declaration of Independence and the sea routes to the Gold Rush.

ROGUE REPUBLIC STALLS PEACE EFFORTS IN CROATIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Serbian nationalist warlord who led a 1991 rebellion that tore away 
one-third of Croatia has a simple strategy for dealing with Western warnings 
that the outside world will never accept his breakaway state: Milan Martic, 
self-styled president of the rogue Republic of Serbian Krajina, is waiting for 
the rest of the world to give in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my deep belief that we as a nation and a people are just within our 
rights," Martic informed U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith as the two 
men prepared for today's resumption of Croatian peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many governments, including the United States, will change their positions 
and attitudes regarding the Serbian people in the former Yugoslavia, and we 
will get that final right to self-determination," the mustachioed rebel leader 
insisted. "What is most important today is that we have our own state, and that 
is a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith, who doubles as the American mediator in the long-dormant talks to 
end the conflict, traveled two days ahead of the negotiations to this remote, 
rocky rebel stronghold in hopes of persuading Serbian insurgents to begin 
mending fences with the government of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 But nationalist passions and propaganda that sparked the war here three 
summers ago have not run out. On the contrary, the roughly 200,000 Serbs living 
in the shattered war zones draw on their anger and hardship as sources of 
strength for what they know will be a long standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Martic -- like the architect of the Balkan conflicts, Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic -- counts on using obstinacy as a weapon with which to wear 
down outside resistance to his pariah state. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western mediators believe the time is right for a start toward 
reconciliation because Serbian nationalist patrons in the rump Yugoslavia, keen 
to get U.N. sanctions lifted, have threatened to cut the fuel and food lifeline 
to the Krajina rebels unless they agree to a peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
 But others fear the tough talk from Belgrade is just a smoke screen for 
Milosevic's own calculated resistance. They worry that pressure being brought 
on neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept ethnic partitioning is encouraging 
Serbian secessionists here to hold out for a similar carve-up that would allow 
them to unite with other Balkan Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stymied by the impasse over Krajina's political status, mediators from the 
United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union have changed 
tactics in negotiations, setting aside the question of who should rule Krajina 
to focus on smaller steps that might boost economic cooperation and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Their proposals include deals to supply water and fuel to rebel-held regions 
in exchange for restored telephone and transportation links, as well as payment 
of pensions to Krajina retirees by the Croatian government and resumption of 
trade. But the stalemate over Krajina's political status has been tripping up 
even those efforts to restore mutually advantageous contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajina Serbs object to a U.N. Security Council resolution that recognizes 
Croatian sovereignty over the region and its right to administer and tax 
Krajina commercial transactions. The rebel leaders claim the U.N. position 
undermines their authority and places them at a disadvantage in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' position offers little hope of any progress at the peace talks 
scheduled to run for two days at Plitvica Lakes, a scenic resort behind Serbian 
lines that was one of the former Yugoslav republic's most popular tourist 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning succession of lakes, wooded slopes and waterfalls provides a 
telling example of the devastation war has brought to a land that once teemed 
with visitors who bankrolled a prosperous lifestyle. The 1989 income of the 
Plitvica Lakes resort was three times higher than that of all of Krajina today, 
Galbraith noted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More discouraging for the mediators than the stubborn positions staked out 
over economic matters is an obvious endeavor by Knin authorities to strengthen 
their hold on the vanquished territory and the Zagreb government's coinciding 
military buildup in apparent preparation to retake it. 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire arranged by the mediators in March led to deployment of U.N. 
soldiers along the more than 400-mile confrontation line stretching from the 
Adriatic Sea to within 20 miles of Zagreb and east to the border of the rump 
Yugoslavia. The patrols were designed to be temporary -- to give warring 
factions pause to negotiate a permanent settlement by which Krajina Serbs would 
gain some degree of autonomy but submit to political union with the rest of 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, rebels have been haggling with peacekeeping officials over the exact 
delineation of the cease-fire line, regarding it as the permanent border of 
their state. The Croatian Defense Ministry, while also refusing to make 
concessions in negotiations, has beefed up its presence on the other side of 
the front line, according to a U.N. official in Knin. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the many troubling parts of all this is the increasing war talk on 
both sides of the line," Galbraith said after his Krajina visit, which included 
a tour of front-line villages that have been the scene of wanton destruction 
and desecration by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by the prospect of another fruitless stare-down when the two sides 
meet at Plitvica, Galbraith warned that there is a limit to the patience and 
resources of the international community. "We will try to do our best Thursday 
and Friday," he said. "But if there is no progress, we are losing our chances."

5 QUAKE MAKEUP DAYS TO BE ADDED TO '95 SCHOOL YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Los Angeles public schools will be required to add five instructional days 
to their calendars next year to compensate for the week that campuses were 
closed after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said Wednesday they have 
received an $85-million federal grant that includes $56.3 million to pay for 
the expanded school time.While most schools probably will add five days to the 
end of the school year in June, 1995, the district and its unions still are 
determining how to set up next year's calendars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's important that the kids who lost the five days make up the 
time," said Bill Rivera, the district spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 The grant will not pay for the repair of classrooms and offices, which will be 
covered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But $20 million was 
approved to help schools recover costs of emergency supplies and substitute 
teacher salaries.  
</P>
<P>
 Individual schools were allowed to submit requests for the money, and most 
wanted to add the five school days, extend counseling services and provide 
emergency training for campus employees, officials said.

STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON BREAST IMPLANT PERIL; HEALTH: MAYO CLINIC REPORT FINDS 
THAT RECIPIENTS ARE NO MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ILLNESSES SUCH AS ARTHRITIS AND 
LUPUS THAN OTHER WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The largest study ever of breast implants finds no evidence that they cause 
rheumatoid arthritis or other serious diseases, challenging the claims of women 
who reached a $4.3-billion settlement with manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The review, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, found that women who get implants to 
enlarge or reconstruct their breasts are no more likely than anybody else to 
develop a variety of connective-tissue disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 These diseases, including arthritis, lupus, scleroderma and several less 
common illnesses, have been linked to leaking implants. Much of the apparent 
evidence came from examples of individuals getting sick after receiving 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, such illnesses could be unrelated to their implants. Until now, there 
has been little rigorously conducted comparison to see if those who get 
implants have worse health than other people. 
</P>
<P>
 The study "should provide a lot of encouragement and reassurance to women who 
have been literally terrified by the unfortunate hype and hysteria that 
surround this," said Dr. Sumner Slavin, a plastic surgeon at Boston's Beth 
Israel Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayo report is not the first epidemiological study showing no link between 
connective-tissue diseases and the implants. Several large studies presented at 
the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in San Antonio in 
November also showed no association. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although no single study can prove that breast implants are safe, the 
researchers say theirs suggests that if there is any hazard, it is small. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, headed by Dr. Sherine E. Gabriel and published in today's New 
England Journal of Medicine, was financed by the National Institutes of Health 
and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers studied all the women given breast implants in Minnesota's 
Olmsted County, home of the Mayo Clinic, from 1964 through 1991. They compared 
them to twice as many women the same age who did not get implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Connective-tissue diseases were very rare among the women. After an average of 
eight years of follow-up, precisely the same proportion got these illnesses in 
both groups -- five of the 749 implant recipients and 10 of the 1,498 in the 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
 One million to 2 million U.S. women are thought to have gotten breast 
implants. The Food and Drug Administration took implants off the market two 
years ago, contending that manufacturers failed to collect necessary safety 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 13,000 lawsuits have been filed against Dow Corning and other 
manufacturers by women blaming implants for a variety of ailments. 
Manufacturers have agreed to the $4.3-billion settlement but have not admitted 
that the implants are harmful.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marcia Angell, the journal's executive editor, said the work cannot 
conclusively rule out any link between implants and connective-tissue diseases, 
in part because so few women studied had the diseases, "but their data are the 
best we have."

$10,000 SOUGHT TO PLAN VENTURA MARINE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offering no concrete financing plans but lots of enthusiastic ideas, a 
Montecito-based entrepreneur has asked Ventura for $10,000 to help him plan a 
state-of-the art marine center at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 And some excited Ventura council members, impressed by Al Fiori's proposal at 
a Wednesday committee meeting, promised to rush the proposal onto next Monday's 
council agenda so the city could write him a check as soon as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want Ventura to become a center for marine education," said Fiori, one of 
two partners in the year-old Rising Hawk Productions. "We would like to see 
this be a state-of-the art facility that would attract visitors from up and 
down the coast." 
</P>
<P>
 For a city eagerly eyeing the tourist trade and the ready cash it brings, 
Fiori described a combination educational, entertainment and research complex 
that would attract visitors from across California.  
</P>
<P>
 Fiori said the project would be developed in concert with the National Park 
Service, the Ventura Harbor District, and private investors, most of whom have 
yet to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Harbor District and the Park Service joined Fiori at the 
meeting. The Park Service and the Harbor District have long hoped to develop an 
education center at the harbor, but lacked the private sector partner to pay 
for the construction.  
</P>
<P>
 The one potential private investor Fiori did trot out Wednesday is the 
production company of friend Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of celebrity 
oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. The Santa Barbara-based Cousteau has said he 
also may collaborate with Fiori on a Native People's Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a real interest in the marine center, though to what extent at this 
point, we're not sure," said Leo McCarthy, vice president of Cousteau's 
production company. The three council members on the city's economics committee 
said the marine center could be a landmark development for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura's always been on a real launching pad to something greater," said 
Councilman Gregory L. Carson, one of the council's most enthusiastic tourism 
boosters. "This means we're finally being discovered."  
</P>
<P>
 Fiori asked the city to give him $10,000 as soon as possible, so he could draw 
up a blueprint outlining how much the center would cost, what would be its 
scope, and what kind of services it would feature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The figures for these kinds of studies usually come in ahead of $100,000," 
Fiori said, as council members Carson, Gary Tuttle and Rosa Lee Measures nodded 
in agreement. "But the reason we're coming in at this number is that I really 
believe this is going to be a fantastic center." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori refuses to pin a price tag or a time line on the project, only saying it 
will definitely cost more than $5 million and could take at least five years to 
construct. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson at first tried to negotiate with Fiori on the tab for the blueprint 
study. "I don't know if the city needs to foot the whole bill," he said. "If 
we're going to have a partnership, today's the day to start." 
</P>
<P>
 But the enthusiasm of his fellow council members quickly won him over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm a little humbled," Tuttle said. "Here we sit in Ventura, and 
they come to us with a project like this . . . I'm not going to fight over 
$10,000."  
</P>
<P>
 Lauren DeChant, Fiori's partner at Rising Hawk, described a number of 
possibilities for the project, including an underwater photography center and a 
fishbowl laboratory that would allow tourists to observe scientists working on 
marine research. The center might also include interactive videos and computers 
that could be operated by visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up with basically a bag of ideas," she said. "The meeting today was 
our real vote of confidence, so now we can move on to the next step."

PROBATION VIOLATION SENDS MANNES TO PRISON; CRIME: A WEEKEND DRINKING BINGE 
ENDS THE FREEDOM OF SOMIS WOMAN WHO KILLED THREE YOUTHS AND INJURED TWO FIVE 
YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Five years after killing three teen-agers in one of Ventura County's bloodiest 
drunk-driving cases, Diane Helen Mannes was sentenced Wednesday to 44 months in 
prison for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes, 39, received no prison sentence last year when she pleaded guilty to 
vehicular manslaughter for running down the young men in 1989 as they walked 
along the road shoulder to get help for a flat tire on the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence of three years and eight months is the first prison term for the 
Somis woman since she was released in a plea bargain agreement. She had served 
about two years for injuring two other boys in the crash, but she was granted 
probation instead of a prison term for the deaths in exchange for the 
manslaughter plea. The widely publicized case went as high as the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath revoked Mannes' probation Wednesday 
after Mannes admitted to drinking alcohol, falsifying Alcoholic Anonymous 
attendance cards and failing to attend AA meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes, who appeared to have no family members or friends among the courtroom 
spectators, displayed no emotion as the judge announced the sentence. She 
lowered her head and avoided eye contact with photographers as she was led back 
to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent violation occurred last weekend, said sheriff's deputies, who 
found Mannes drunk in a parked car surrounded by empty beer, wine and liquor 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison sentence was instantly applauded by prosecutors and relatives of 
Mannes' victims in the 1989 wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it is a victory, finally," said Linda Oxenreider, whose 19-year-old son, 
Joshua, was one of the youths who died. "I've been waiting five years to send 
her to prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, Mannes could be paroled in just under two years, lawyers 
said. Inmates typically serve about half their prison sentences, after 
receiving credit for good conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she should have been in prison a long time ago for 15 years," 
Oxenreider said. "That would have been five years for each boy killed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Robert A. Dahlstedt said Mannes is not the villain 
portrayed by prosecutors and victims' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last weekend she had faithfully stayed away from alcohol, he said. 
Mannes acknowledged to police that she had been on a two-day binge prior to her 
arrest early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlstedt said she began drinking last week after giving up antidepressant 
pills on the advice of psychologists and becoming jittery. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a nice person, and that's the sad fact about alcohol," Dahlstedt said. 
"It turns somebody who should never hurt anybody into a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin G. DeNoce said Mannes had run out of breaks. DeNoce 
said Mannes apparently did not exercise her right to have a hearing on the 
allegations that she violated her probation because the evidence against her 
was too solid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Diane Mannes was convinced that what she did was worthy of a state 
prison commitment," DeNoce said. "I think Diane Mannes realized this was her 
last fight, and it was time to throw in the towel." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Deputy Timothy Waite reported finding Mannes in the passenger 
seat of a parked car with a man identified as Richard Romney just after 1:15 
a.m. at Pleasant Valley Park in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 A breath test showed that her blood-alcohol level was .245% -- more than three 
times the legal limit for driving. The car was littered with a 1 1/2-pint 
bottle of vodka, a three-quart bottle of wine, an empty malt liquor bottle, an 
empty beer can and an empty bottle of Zima, another alcoholic beverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A paper bag containing two empty cans of Club Margaritas lay on the ground 
outside the passenger door, Waites' report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks earlier, Mannes had been accused of missing the AA meetings and 
forging the attendance cards. A hearing on those alleged probation violations 
was pending when she was arrested at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what sets her off," DeNoce said. "But each violation is getting 
worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlstedt said Mannes' anxiety about the allegations she had missed AA 
meetings, combined with her decision not to take the antidepressant pills, led 
to last weekend's binge. 
</P>
<P>
 He said she drank in an effort "to self-medicate." 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure just got to her," Dahlstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that she is remorseful for her actions, including the three 
deaths and the pain and suffering she caused family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 crash that killed the three boys occurred barely a day after Mannes 
had been arrested in Los Angeles County on drunk-driving charges. She was out 
on bail when she plowed into the boys on the westbound Conejo Grade. Her 
blood-alcohol content then was .20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury charged Mannes with second-degree murder, but 
the jury deadlocked and the trial judge dismissed the charge, saying he doubted 
that any jury would be able to agree on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys argued that the judge's comments constituted an acquittal, 
and the federal courts agreed. After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take 
the case, Bradbury agreed to accept the guilty plea to vehicular manslaughter.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN RUSSO FELONY CHILD-ABUSE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared Wednesday in the felony child-abuse case of a wealthy 
Westlake mother accused of biting her daughter after a lone juror refused to 
vote the woman guilty, causing a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 In four different votes, the other 11 jurors agreed that Charlotte Russo 
committed a felony when she bit her adopted daughter and should face a six-year 
prison term. But the lone holdout refused to go along with the others, said 
jury foreman James Farra. 
</P>
<P>
 That juror, a 75-year-old man, talked with members of the Russo family outside 
the courtroom for about an hour after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 But he refused to discuss with reporters why he voted to acquit Russo, saying 
only, "The evidence did not conclusively indicate she was guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo showed little emotion when the verdict was announced. Afterward, she 
exited through a back door of the courtroom without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's verdict ended one of the most dramatic trials in recent county 
history. Russo and her husband, Richard Russo Sr., were arrested for alleged 
child abuse May 24, 1993, after some neighbors reported seeing Charlotte Russo 
beating the girl in the family's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict also left several other jurors dismayed at not reaching a decision 
after working on the case for 29 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the juror who voted to acquit Russo concluded during deliberations that 
the woman left several bite marks on her daughter when she bit the girl during 
an altercation last year, several jurors said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said the holdout juror felt that the bites did not cause the victim 
to suffer a "traumatic injury," which is required for a felony conviction under 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during deliberations, the holdout told other jurors that he felt 
the law regarding traumatic injuries is unjust, said jury foreman Farra. Other 
jurors told Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona that the holdout juror explained that 
he had experienced difficulties raising his own children and could empathize 
with Russo's plight, Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona, who has spent the past year compiling evidence against Russo, was 
visibly dejected when the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't follow the law. He didn't care what the law said," Corona said of 
the holdout juror. She quizzed other jurors for nearly two hours in the 
courtroom hallway after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't able to get beyond the fact that he had had problems with his own 
children and didn't find this (conduct by Russo) outside the norm," Corona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley praised the holdout juror, saying he had the 
courage of his convictions in standing up for what he believed was the right 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God he was here," Farley said. "I'm glad I picked him." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have until July 1 to decide whether to retry Russo, who was 
shocked that the other 11 jurors voted to convict her, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began generating publicity after investigators alleged that the 
Russos had forced the girl to live in the locked quarters of the family's 
back-yard racquetball court for months on end to prevent her from violating her 
salt-free diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo pleaded guilty in November to misdemeanor child abuse and served 
a 30-day jail term. He is on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, charged with felony and misdemeanor child abuse, chose to 
take her case to trial. The felony charge accused Russo of severely biting the 
girl on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor charge accused her of forcing the girl to sleep in a back-yard 
racquetball court for long periods and clawing and hitting the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to six weeks of testimony -- including emotional statements 
from the victim and Charlotte Russo -- the jury convicted Russo of misdemeanor 
child abuse last week. She faces up to 180 days in jail for that conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 On the felony charge, the jury deliberated for two days before advising the 
court late Tuesday afternoon that it was hopelessly deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury foreman Farra told Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath Wednesday 
morning that he and the other jurors did not believe that the holdout juror 
would change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that we have unanimity on this issue, and that is that the 
jury is deadlocked," McGrath said, declaring the mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, the girl testified that her mother sank her teeth into her 
arms and bit her during the incident in the garage that was witnessed by the 
neighbors in May of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, however, testified that she bit the girl in self-defense a 
day earlier, after the girl attacked her in the kitchen of the family's home. 
Wednesday, several jurors said they thought Charlotte Russo lied on the witness 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't believe everything she said," said juror James Greer, a Naval fire 
inspector from Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors also believed the girl also lied, embellishing some of her claims 
of abuse, they said. But, they said, she was more credible on the stand than 
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many lies on both sides that we felt we had to nit-pick and get 
to the truth," said juror August Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also said they believed the Russos had good intentions when they 
adopted the 1-year-old girl, but the parents were frustrated by their 
daughter's unwillingness to take orders and her frequent medical problems. The 
girl has had five heart surgeries, including four since her adoption, according 
to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that all of this started years ago," Hardy said.

OJAI WRITES TO COUNTY ON LANDFILL QUESTION; BALLOT: THE CITY BELIEVES IT CAN 
SHOW THAT THE PETITION THAT WOULD PUT THE ISSUE TO THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER 
VIOLATES THE ELECTIONS CODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving closer to a legal challenge of the Weldon Canyon landfill initiative, 
Ojai officials will notify Ventura County today that they believe a petition 
submitted to qualify the measure for the November ballot does not comply with 
the elections code. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in closed session Tuesday night, the City Council voted to ask its 
attorney to write to county officials to tell them that the petition submitted 
by Taconic Resources should not be certified by the county clerk because it 
violates election law "on a number of procedural and legal grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which last week apparently qualified for the November ballot with 
nearly twice the number of signatures needed, has long been opposed by Ojai 
city officials, who have promised a legal battle to stop the construction of a 
551-acre dump near the mouth of the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai city officials declined to reveal their legal strategy Wednesday, but in 
a prepared statement said "the measure as presented is clearly invalid and 
should not be placed on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's move follows on the heels of decisions by Ventura city officials 
and the Board of Supervisors to oppose the measure. The Ventura City Council is 
considering joining neighboring Ojai in its legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai city officials said their letter to County Clerk Richard D. Dean 
outlining the basis of their argument will be sent today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be my assumption that if the clerk was convinced that there were 
legal grounds, and I think those will be spelled out in the letter, (he could) 
decline to certify," said City Councilwoman Nina Shelley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean said Wednesday that although he hadn't seen the letter he doubted 
that the city's concerns would interfere with the petition's certification. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anything that would prevent us from certifying the petition," 
he said. "I see that as a decision for the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both Ojai and the county have said they believe the measure would 
probably not stand up in court. In a memo circulated last week, County Counsel 
James L. McBride questioned whether the initiative was legally valid, saying it 
goes further than the law allows in granting planning powers to voters and 
would improperly amend county zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the measure said they are certain it is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lawyers have experience in this arena," said Richard Chase, general 
partner of Taconic Resources, the San Diego County-based firm that proposed the 
measure and has negotiated a lease for the Weldon Canyon land. "We feel it is 
perfectly legal and if approved by the voters will be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we would not be spending a lot of money to enact a measure that is 
legally invalid," Chase said. "We would not go to the trouble of putting it on 
the ballot unless we were very confident that it was valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic has estimated the company is prepared to spend $1 million in its 
pursuit of a ballot initiative. The measure has been widely backed by 
communities in east Ventura County, but opposed by the west county cities of 
Ojai and Ventura, which are closest to the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made it clear from the beginning they don't want a vote," Chase said 
Wednesday. In terms of a legal challenge, he added: "I don't think they have 
any basis for their actions."

KUDOS TO CAMEROON; SOCCER: WORLD CUP TEAM FROM AFRICA IMPRESSES LOCAL COMMUNITY 
WITH ITS ABILITY AND GRACIOUSNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The love affair began at Oxnard College, on a rutted patch of dirt choked by 
weeds and wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where volunteers set out to fashion a world-class soccer venue, 
clearing the rocks and pulling the weeds, and making the earth smooth and even. 
That's where they planted Bermuda sod and tended the lawn until it lay as flat 
and seamless as carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was earlier this year, when hundreds of volunteers gathered to whip the 
field into shape, that Oxnard first fell in love with Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Cameroon says it's in love too. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are so nice," said Jean-Pierre Tokoto, a representative of the 
World Cup soccer team from the west coast of Africa. "We feel like we are at 
home here and we feel wanted." It's no wonder. The Cameroonians received an 
official welcome during a ceremony at Oxnard City Hall and a party in their 
honor at the home of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have been greeted at their twice-a-day practices by dozens of fans, 
some wanting autographs and others only wanting to watch one of the best teams 
in the world prepare for the world's largest soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell my kids, 'You'll never be able to see this in Oxnard again,' " said 
Efrain Cisneros of Oxnard, who brought his children, Daisy, 9, and Abraham, 7, 
to an evening practice session. "It's impossible that the World Cup will ever 
come here again." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was announced that the tournament would be played in the United States 
for the first time, World Cup officials said they worried that the games would 
receive little support. And while that remains a concern nationwide, local 
support is running high. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of soccer enthusiasts have watched the Cameroonians practice at 
Oxnard College since their arrival. Until Tuesday, adults paid $5 to get in. 
There is no longer a charge to view practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning was typical. Escorted by police, the Cameroon team, known as 
the Indomitable Lions, arrived aboard a red-and-white tour bus, its side panel 
emblazoned with the words "Destination America." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, two dozen people were waiting. Children pressed up against the 
chain-link fence guarding the field, trying to get a better look. Some in the 
crowd waved, although it was impossible to tell through the bus' tinted windows 
whether players returned the salute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believe the Cameroon team is the only one in the tournament that 
opens its practices to the public, and security is tight as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors were searched with metal detectors, and their purses and bags were 
searched by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they had to check for hand grenades," said Betty Creson of 
Ventura. "That was kind of interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Creson and her husband, Bob, had come to talk to some of the players about 
Cameroon. Their son Robert lives in the capital city of Yaounde, and told them 
about the team's Ventura County visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were excited when they came so close last time," said Betty Creson, 
referring to the 1990 World Cup where Cameroon became the first African team to 
advance to the quarterfinals. "We'll root for them again this year." 
</P>
<P>
 At a ceremony Tuesday at Oxnard City Hall, Mayor Manuel Lopez said he too will 
root for Cameroon. He also told team representatives how pleased the city is to 
have them around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are thrilled that your team is here and we are honored by your presence," 
he said. "Your country has reason to be proud of you. The Lions are fine 
ambassadors." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days earlier, Lopez threw a party for the team at his house. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it went off without a hitch, except that they had to cancel the 
carnitas after remembering that some of the players were Muslim. They ate 
cheese enchiladas and salad instead.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were very nice and very accommodating," Lopez said. "The only thing I 
worry about is that they have to be very focused. This is serious business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so they practiced hard on Wednesday, kicking hard and leaping high with 
the exuberance that makes the team a crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are pretty good at what they do," said 10-year-old Samantha 
Camacho of Port Hueneme, who has won a permanent job retrieving errant balls at 
team practices. "They are also really funny and nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who weren't playing -- including the injured, the exhausted and team 
trainers -- were asked to autograph soccer balls, T-shirts and newspapers. 
Three-year-old Andrew Hafnor became painfully shy when team trainer Moise Mbeng 
shot him a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "How old are you?" Mbeng wanted to know. Andrew wouldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know or you don't know?" Mbeng pressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew ran back to his father, John, a former amateur soccer player in 
Germany. The Hafnor family is vacationing in the area, and decided to take in 
the World Cup practice before returning to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my touch with the game, my chance to say I saw a part of it," John 
Hafnor said. 
</P>
<P>
 After practice, the players waded into the crowd of journalists and autograph 
seekers. Some posed for photos with a Brazilian actress. Others took turns 
turning away shots on goal by youngsters in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy that Oxnard was selected for us," said Thomas N'Kono the 
team's goalkeeper. "We will try hard to make you proud." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Garcia brought his five children to the practice session. They 
snapped photos with players and collected as many autographs as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very beautiful that they visit us," Garcia said. "This is one of 
the star teams. The world is watching them." 
</P>
<P>
 The world is also watching Oxnard, local officials believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means everything. This is history here," said Jorge Brescia, the soccer 
coach at Oxnard College. "This has put Oxnard and Ventura County on the map of 
the world." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Cameroon soccer team will practice at Oxnard College at 5 p.m. today and 
hold its final practice Saturday at 4:30 p.m. There is no entry fee, but you 
must show photo identification to get in. Cameroon's first game will be Sunday 
against Sweden in the Rose Bowl.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN GETS 6 YEARS IN FATAL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has sentenced an Oxnard man who admitted killing his ex-girlfriend's 
son during a Christmas Day stabbing to six years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence handed down Tuesday by Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Lawrence Storch was part of a plea agreement reached between lawyers for 
defendant Jose Jimenez and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Jimenez with murder for the fatal stabbing of Isaias 
Guerrero Morales, 21. The victim was knifed in the yard of his family's 
Campbell Way home. 
</P>
<P>
 But a jury last month acquitted the defendant of murder after the defense 
argued that Jimenez acted to ward off an attack by Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors then agreed to accept Jimenez's plea to voluntary manslaughter 
after the jury could not reach a verdict on a charge of involuntary 
manslaughter. Part of that agreement called for the defendant to be sentenced 
to the six-year term instead of the 12-year sentence he could have received.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 JOIN BIDDING TO BUILD PIER RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors hoping to run a restaurant at the end of the Ventura Pier should 
have 2 1/2 weeks to submit a proposal to Ventura City Hall, a council committee 
recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month after negotiations fell through with Seattle businessman Hal 
Griffith -- the council's original choice to operate the restaurant -- the city 
already has offers from two local restaurateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Eric Wachter, owner of Eric Ericsson's Fish Co. restaurant, and Sandy 
Smith, owner of Rosarita Beach Cafe, say they want to compete for a chance to 
build a seafood restaurant on the wooden pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are looking at fast-tracking this, it wouldn't take me too long to put 
some (plans) together," Smith told the council committee. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff told council members that if they didn't quickly pick someone 
local, the restaurant might not open until the summer of 1996, instead of next 
summer as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss the issue at its Monday night meeting. Committee 
members said they will recommend setting the bid deadline for the first full 
week in July. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO FATAL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man pleaded guilty Wednesday to murder and use of a deadly weapon in 
connection with the April stabbing death of his sister's 19-year-old boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Culbertson, 24, also entered guilty pleas to two counts of aggravated 
assault that stem from separate attacks on his former girlfriend and another 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Culbertson faces 21 years to life in prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. 
Glynn. Glynn said Culbertson's plea would lead to conviction of second-degree 
murder at sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got an aggressive, violent personality where he beats up women," Glynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Culbertson in connection with the slaying of David Rubio of 
Oxnard on April 10. Rubio was stabbed in an alley behind the 5200 block of 
Columbus Place. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim had borrowed a car from Culbertson's sister and was late returning 
it one night, Glynn said. That led to an argument and Rubio's death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn also said Culbertson badly beat his ex-girlfriend, Mysti Giralde, 20, 
damaging her pancreas. The second assault charge stemmed from an attack against 
the girlfriend of Culbertson's stepfather, he said. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ESTUARY REPLANTING GETS COUNCIL'S OK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city plan to replace non-native plants with native vegetation at the Ventura 
River estuary does not require an extensive environmental review, Ventura 
council members agreed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a staff report Monday that would allow the city to begin 
digging up invasive plants like the giant Kikuyu grass and castor bean as early 
as August and replacing them with shrubs native to the riverbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The project to upgrade the estuary is being run by the city of Ventura, the 
California Department of Parks and Recreation and the California Coastal 
Conservancy.  
</P>
<P>
 The replacement of vegetation is the first part of a three-phase project to 
restore the area. In the second phase, the agencies will remove feral cats and 
other animals in addition to building wooden trails to protect the sand dunes. 
A visitors center and amphitheater are also planned for this phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The last phase will concentrate on restoring the second mouth of the river, 
and trails will be linked between the estuary and the second mouth. CONSTANCE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY ADVISED TO GET TOUGH ON HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura should get tougher on the homeless, encouraging them to get out of the 
Ventura River bottom, their cars and city streets, and into a designated 
campground area, an informal task force told a City Council committee 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeless people "would have a choice," said Ventura Police Capt. Randy 
Adams, head of the task force."If they refused to cooperate, they would subject 
themselves to arrest. That would be a last resort, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the task force, also made up of a city staff member and 
representatives of local charities, believes that the homeless campground 
should be surrounded by an area where homeless people who did not want to obey 
the campground's many rules could live. 
</P>
<P>
 The campground, he said, would help homeless people make a transition into 
being productive members of society. To that end, no drugs and little if any 
alcohol would be allowed in the campgrounds, and residents would have to show 
tangible progress toward self-sufficiency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council members on the committee said they liked the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be giving (homeless people) a tool to say 'Enough is enough,' " 
said Councilman Jack Tingstrom, a member of the council's housing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will take the issue up again in July, when Chairwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures said she hopes to also include county supervisors and council members 
from neighboring cities in discussion of a regional solution to the homeless 
problem. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 11 GET LOANS TO BUY MOBILE HOME LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials have announced $478,000 in loans to 11 low-income households 
in the Rancho Adolfo Mobile Home Estates in Camarillo to help them buy their 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is part of $3.6 million in loans that the state Department of 
Housing and Community Development is distributing to low-income residents at 
mobile home parks throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent is to help mobile home park owners purchase their parks," said 
John Frith, a spokesman. "This way, it's guaranteed that the parks will remain 
housing for the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at the Camarillo mobile home park began moving to buy their lots 
from park owners about two years ago. Many of them purchased their lots with 
assistance from the city of Camarillo, which used some federal grant funds as 
low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Frith said the loans to the 11 households are for a 30-year period and are 
considered a 3% deferred-interest loan. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could be reached for comment at the Rancho Adolfo Mobile Homeowners 
Assn. on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-interest loans were also given to mobile home parks in Santa Cruz, Ione, 
San Marcos and Warner Springs. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; REZONING URGED ON INDUSTRIAL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 77-acre parcel near northern Ventura Avenue should be rezoned to allow a 
combination of residential and commercial uses on the site, Ventura planning 
commissioners said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The property, most of it now zoned for industrial use, is largely owned by the 
Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's, a national copy service headquartered 
nearby.The families plan to turn the vacant lots, industrial businesses, 
storage lots and lemon groves on the property into a neighborhood of 
townhouses, business offices and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also recommended Tuesday that Ventura annex about 28 acres of 
the 77-acre project that are now outside the city's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation goes next to the City Council, which will take a final vote 
on the rezoning later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77 acres are north of Stanley Avenue and south of Seneca Street. The 
property is bounded on the east by Ventura Avenue and on the west by California 
33. 
</P>
<P>
 The development proposal includes construction of 330 residential units, a 
park, bike trails and business offices. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY PROJECTS ARE URGED 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura should encourage the owners of two large parcels at the city's east 
end to develop their properties as a pedestrian-friendly mix of homes and 
businesses, planning commissioners recommended this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The two properties, both of which are now used for farming, lie east of Wells 
Road and together total more than 52 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The northernmost property, bounded by Darling Road on the south and California 
126 on the north, is about 29 acres and is owned by the John Broome Jr. Trust.  
</P>
<P>
 The other parcel, owned by Rosewood Park Partnership, is 23 acres and is 
bounded by Darling Avenue on the north and Aster Street on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the 23-acre site has told city officials he wants to develop his 
land. But under Ventura's comprehensive plan, the two properties are linked and 
he cannot build unless his neighbor to the north wants to participate. The 
owner of the 29-acre property, however, does not want to build on his land now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-1 vote Tuesday, the commissioners recommended that the city sever the 
formal link between the two parcels, allowing them to develop separately.  
</P>
<P>
 When the owners do clear the crops for construction, the commissioners 
recommended that the ensuing developments combine housing and business uses in 
a way that encourages residents to walk rather than drive between their home 
and the corner store. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Inspired by the artwork of gypsy children in the Czech Republic, elementary 
teacher Terry Street saw a new way to teach her Westlake students about other 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with teaching the basic elements of design, Street wanted to give her 
students at Carden Conejo School of Thousand Oaks a sense of world geography.So 
for the past two years, she has selected some of her students' creations and 
entered them in contests around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Street's students have received ample reward for their effort.  
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen students in first through fifth grades have won medals or ribbons in 
contests held in Japan, India and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-graders William Hsu and Caroline Hill received gold medals in the 
Japanese contest, while fourth-grader Kevin Hames won a silver and third-grader 
Andrew Wilk and second-grader Jenny Romano won bronze medals. First-grader 
Geraldine O'Sullivan also won an award. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest held in India, the following students received silver 
certificates: sixth-grader Nicholas McKay, fifth-grader Christopher Maltese, 
third-grader Alexandra Kayat and fourth-graders Molly Horan and Renau Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Renau was also one of four students who placed in the Czech contest. Others 
were third-graders Christopher McKay and Melinda Rodriguez and fifth-grader 
Ryan Hollbrook. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PSYCHOLOGIST SEEKS COLLEGE DISTRICT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks psychologist on Wednesday announced his intention to run for a 
seat on the board of the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald W. Kingdon, 41, kicked off his campaign at a small ceremony Wednesday 
morning at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdon, a private practice psychologist who also serves as chief of the Child 
and Adolescent Services unit of the Ventura County Mental Health Department, is 
seeking the Area 2 seat held by Gregory Cole, who has said he will not seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community colleges offer a tremendous opportunity for partnerships 
between business, schools and the community in Ventura County," Kingdon said. 
"As the largest provider of public, post-secondary education in the county, the 
community colleges must serve the changing needs of our students." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is facing a $3-million budget shortfall that administrators said 
may force severe class cuts and the layoffs of dozens of part-time teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdon said the colleges must "remain focused on a clearly defined mission of 
providing opportunity for educational advancement to a broad range of students" 
because of the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the second Thousand Oaks resident to announce a campaign to seek 
election to the college district's governing board.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Week, Thousand Oaks orthodontist Norman Nagel said he also would run for 
Cole's trustee position. 
</P>
<P>
 The official candidate filing period opens July 18. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAYOR TELLS OF GOALS FOR SIX-MONTH 
TERM 
</P>

<P>
 After 30 years on the Thousand Oaks City Council, Mayor Alex Fiore still 
manages to come up with fresh ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 And during a lively speech Tuesday night, the newly installed mayor outlined 
the initiatives he will pursue during his six-month term, as he tries to draw 
neighbors and council members together in harmony and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from keeping council meetings short, Fiore's main goals include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing protocol policies for the council and its committees, to avoid 
the kind of bickering that has characterized recent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Writing a "buy-local" ordinance to encourage the city and its citizens to 
spend money in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a Neighborhood Watch board of directors to coordinate 
crime-fighting programs throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Publishing a resource directory to help residents find their way through 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inviting senior citizen volunteers to work as receptionists in the new Civic 
Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore also pleaded with candidates in the upcoming city election to "be honest 
and find out what the facts are before they publish their campaign documents." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore will not run for reelection and a dozen potential candidates have 
expressed interest in his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, residents and politicians concentrated on celebrating 
Fiore's achievements and applauding his goals. STEPHANIE SIMON

SIMI VALLEY SEEKS U. S. FUNDS TO UPDATE ITS EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT; RECOVERY: THE 
CITY REPORTS THAT MORE THAN $350,000 IN IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED TO HELP IT 
REACT QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY DURING DISASTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five months after the Northridge earthquake ripped through Simi Valley, 
causing more than $423 million in damage, the city is seeking federal funds to 
beef up its emergency response equipment for the next disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of the city's response to the Jan. 17 quake, conducted by Police Chief 
Willard R. Schlieter, found that the city needs more than $350,000 in emergency 
equipment upgrades to react quickly and efficiently during disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the response to the earthquake was extremely efficient and 
well-managed," Schlieter wrote. "However, the Emergency Operations Center had 
never been activated for multiple days, and the staff had never faced the 
long-term emergent conditions that this event produced." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The recommended improvements include seismic retrofitting of the emergency 
center, installation of computer equipment at the center, and purchase of 
two-way radios for the city's Building and Safety Department, which relied on 
cellular phones donated by a local business after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is applying for funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
cover 75% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal funding is approved, the city would pay the remaining 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're in June and we kind of forget what a very hectic time it was in 
January," Mayor Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that experience under our belts and with the help of some new equipment, 
I know we'll be better prepared for next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Upgrades to the emergency system will also help the city deal with the crises 
that crop up during disasters, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following the earthquake, the two main water pipelines into the 
city burst, two dozen leaks appeared in the gas company's lines and the city's 
telephone system was jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he was eager to make improvements that would help 
the city handle such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we don't have another earthquake," Davis said. "But we need to be 
prepared in case we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter's report also included an updated assessment of the damage caused in 
Simi Valley by the quake: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly 500 houses and 600 mobile homes were seriously shaken during the 
earthquake, causing more than $150 million in damage and displacing as many as 
4,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * The quake caused an additional $268 million in damage to 176 commercial and 
industrial buildings, 12 schools, eight churches, City Hall, the Police 
Department and the East County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 87 miles of residential streets and 15 miles of main roadways were 
ruptured in the quake, causing $5 million to $6 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this kind of damage, it's clear we have to do everything we can to brace 
ourselves for the next one," Davis said. "It only makes sense."

GOLF COURSE PROPOSED AT HAPPY CAMP REGIONAL PARK; MOORPARK: DEVELOPER CALLS FOR 
700-ACRE, 36-HOLE FACILITY. ENVIRONMENTALIST OPPOSES PLAN, NOTING RECENT 
DISCOVERY OF RARE HABITAT AT THE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public golf course would be built on part of Happy Camp Regional Park in 
Moorpark under a plan disclosed Wednesday by a local developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Mahan, 55, who owns an orchard next to Happy Camp, said he would like to 
lease the county-owned park and use the southern 700 acres for a 36-hole 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahan's proposal for the former ranch land comes on the heels of a failed plan 
to turn that portion of the park into an 1800s Western-style theme park that 
would have included a water slide, a 450-room hotel, and a number of 
air-conditioned tepees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Mahan's idea, county officials have decided to seek proposals 
next month from golf course designers nationwide, said Blake Boyle, manager of 
the county's Recreation Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a golf course would probably have less environmental impact than a 
theme park, Roseann Mikos, a member of the Moorpark chapter of the 
Environmental Coalition, said she would oppose a golf course on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when I would have supported building a golf course there, 
but we have new information about what's there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikos said recent biological surveys in the area by the California Native 
Plant Society uncovered rare habitat, and she plans to ask the county to 
consider protecting the whole area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a half-dozen new golf courses have already been proposed for east 
Ventura County, Mahan said he is confident that a Happy Camp course would be 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an associate who owns three golf courses in the east county that are 
doing quite well," Mahan said. "There are studies out that say the east county 
could absorb a number of public golf courses." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for using the site, any golf course developer would have to return 
a percentage of profits to the Department of Recreation Services. The 
department receives no tax support to pay the $5.2 million it currently takes 
to run the county's 10 parks, four beaches and Channel Islands Harbor, Boyle 
said. Instead, the agency uses money generated by rents and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle estimates that a golf course at Happy Camp could generate about $250,000 
per year for the county agency. He said the department receives more than 
$400,000 each year from leasing land for the Soule Recreation Area golf course 
in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The county acquired Happy Camp Regional Park from the state in 1983, and has 
entertained a number of proposals to lease the property for recreational 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park proposal fell through recently when the developers, 
Encino-based Quor Resorts, decided not to renew their option to lease the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a number of factors why we did not renew our option," said Bill 
Norred, Quor's president. "The downturn in the economy being one, but also the 
surprising amount of opposition we got toward the end. That's something we 
didn't receive when we first approached the county in 1987." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local politicians and Moorpark residents publicly criticized Quor's proposal, 
saying the town did not want a "Disneyland" in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahan said he did not expect the same sort of opposition to a golf course, 
which would include a considerable amount of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family's been in the area for generations," he said. "Growing up in the 
community, I've always thought it was one of the most beautiful spots in 
eastern Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 By providing the county with more revenue, he said, the proposal also could 
help preserve the park's northern 3,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would earn a lot of revenue for the county that would help pay to keep up 
the upper park and the local citizens should be very happy that the traffic 
would be minimal compared to almost any other proposal," Mahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, Mahan conceived the idea for a park at Happy Camp, and 
then spent four years working to get the state of California to purchase the 
property, said Bruce Strathearn, whose family owned the ranch at the time.

3-YEAR-OLD BOY WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE AT MOTEL IN VENTURA 
</P>

<P>
 A 3-year-old boy was shot in the back Wednesday at a Ventura motel where he 
was staying with his mother, brother and another man, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A police dispatcher said investigators had determined that the shooting was an 
accident.It was not known who fired the shot.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim, David Cook, was in critical condition after surgery late Wednesday 
in the intensive-care unit at Ventura County Medical Center, a nursing 
supervisor said. The boy's 6-year-old brother, Keith, was also taken to the 
hospital but was released after unspecified treatment, the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 5 p.m. at the Silver Sands Motel and Apartments, 
3215 E. Main St., according to the dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they heard a single shot and then a woman's scream before the 
mother of the injured boy emerged from Room 4 with the bleeding toddler in her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard a shot and just got one of those feelings like, oh my God!" said 
Aura Hennig, who was staying in a room across the parking lot of the motel. "We 
looked out the window and heard her scream. She was holding the baby. She was 
really panicked and upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Hennig and her husband, Hans, ran over to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby was crying all the way through it," Aura Hennig said. "His whole 
back was blown off, more or less." 
</P>
<P>
 Motel manager Max Wang said the mother had occupied the room since April, 
along with her sons and a man whom Wang described as a family friend.

LOVINGIER READY TO THROW HIMSELF INTO GAME; BASEBALL: FORMER LAGUNA HILLS 
LEFT-HANDER, WHO HELPED OKLAHOMA WIN THE COLLEGE WORLD SERIES, WANTS TO GIVE 
THE PROS HIS BEST SHOT.

 Before the 1994 college baseball season began, Vern Ruhle, the University of 
Oklahoma pitching coach, told Kevin Lovingier to make up his mind about his 
commitment to baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some players want the game," Ruhle recalls saying, "but other players need 
the game. There's a difference, and you really need to decide the one you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier remembers well that conversation with Ruhle, who pitched in the 
major leagues for 12 years with Detroit, Houston, Cleveland and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pretty much told me I had to shape up if I wanted to pitch this season," 
Lovingier said. Lovingier, who had been a standout left-hander at Laguna Hills 
High, had not performed up to expectations the previous year as a junior. 
Despite a 6-2 record, he was giving up an average of more than five runs a game 
and was having arm problems. He also had been a part-time starter as a 
sophomore, going 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned as a senior, his college career was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he was going to have to compete for the opportunity to pitch," 
Ruhle said. "He'd been a little lackadaisical about conditioning. We didn't 
start him during the first month of the season, but he shaped up and pitched 
well twice when he came in and got back in the rotation. He ended up having a 
good year for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier was 7-2 for the season, and was the winning pitcher in the first of 
two victories over Texas in the NCAA regional at Austin that enabled the 
Sooners to reach the College World Series. He gave up two hits in 6 1/3 innings 
in a 15-4 Sooner victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma won the national championship over Georgia Tech a week ago, 13-5. 
Lovingier was the starting pitcher but left in the third inning after giving up 
a leadoff home run to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. He also gave up a home run 
in the second to catcher Jason Varitek, college baseball's player of the year. 
Lovingier also had his troubles in his first World Series start against Arizona 
State, giving up five hits and three unearned runs in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have the kind of World Series I hoped I would have," Lovingier said. 
"But I felt good about the season as a whole and about the way I pitched 
against Texas in the regional." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier, 6 feet 2 and 200 pounds, had a 2.99 ERA and 63 strikeouts in 69 1/3 
innings going into the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known for his strikeouts at Laguna Hills High. "He was really a 
dominant pitcher his senior year," said Pete Tereschuk, his high school coach. 
Lovingier led the county in strikeouts with 131 in 1990. He had a 13-1 record 
and 0.97 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 That reputation as a strikeout sensation and those 87- to 90-m.p.h. fastballs 
probably caused Lovingier some problems at times in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could do the same thing in college as I did in high school, and I 
was trying to throw it past everyone, and also throwing for the scouts and 
their radar guns," Lovingier said. 
</P>
<P>
 He originally went to Loyola Marymount on a baseball scholarship. But when 
Coach Chris Smith left after his freshman season, Lovingier decided to switch 
schools. "A friend of mine who was older had gone to USC, then transferred to 
Oklahoma and liked it there, so that's how I got to Oklahoma," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, Lovingier wishes he could have been as solid as a sophomore as 
he was this season. "If I had been pitching that well in 1992, I think we could 
have won the World Series that year. We made it to Omaha but didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier was drafted in the 19th round by St. Louis, and he says he wants to 
give professional baseball his best effort. "I'm going to really work at it," 
he said. "The main thing is that I'll be getting a chance to continue to pitch 
and show what I can do. My goal is going to be to climb a level each year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruhle says Lovingier "has a lot of work to do," but he says he believes he has 
a good shot at being successful in pro baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reminds me of my old roommate with the Tigers, Mickey Lolich," Ruhle said. 
"Their physical builds and their pitching styles are similar. Kevin has a good, 
moving fastball and his changeup has improved. His fastball still isn't as good 
as it could be. He needs to do a better job of hitting his locations with the 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingier said he will drive to his first assignment in the New 
York-Pennsylvania rookie league in a new truck, a gift from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruhle feels pro baseball will again be a test of Lovingier's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's ready for the dream," Ruhle said. "I hope he's mentally tough enough for 
it. It's not an easy road."

SPLASH HITS THE BOOKS IN 12-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Continental Indoor Soccer League's record book is a little light, this 
being the league's second year, but the Splash made a heavy impact on it 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash scored a CISL-record 12 consecutive goals and came within one 
second of scoring the league's first shutout in a 12-1 victory over the Houston 
Hotshots in front of 3,111 at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Beto scored on a rebound of Juan Arboledo's shot with one second left, robbing 
Jorge Valenzuela of a piece of history. He had 13 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela had lots of help in the back from Ralph Black, Paul McDonnell, 
Denis Hamlett, Glen Ervine and Doug Neely. The defense allowed the offense to 
find its way into the record book as eight players scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did an outstanding job defensively," said midfielder Raffaele Ruotolo, 
whose goal 5 minutes 38 seconds into the third quarter gave the Splash an 8-0 
lead and the record. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia (two goals, one assist) scored 1:21 later, and Dale Ervine 
scored 13 seconds after that to make it 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam George and Neely added goals in the fourth quarter. Neely's goal was the 
18th in a row by the Splash in the last two games, matching an indoor record by 
Wichita of the Major Indoor Soccer League in 1980; it also is a CISL record. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Castro and Dale Ervine extended their goal-scoring streaks to three games. 
McDonnell, George and Ruotolo had two goals apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (3-0) lead the Western Division by a half-game over Portland (2-0). 
Houston (0-3) is in last place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash leaves Friday for Detroit, watch the U.S.-Switzerland World Cup 
game Saturday at the Pontiac Silverdome and play the Neon (0-2) on Sunday. The 
Splash's next home game is Wednesday against Detroit. . . . Washington's 
Colette Cunningham became the first female player in professional soccer 
history Wednesday when she played in Dallas. Cunningham was a two-time 
All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection at North Carolina State. Dallas (3-0) 
won, 8-4. Washington is 0-1. . . . In other games Wednesday, Monterrey (2-1) 
beat San Diego (1-2), 9-7, and Las Vegas (2-1) beat Detroit (0-2), 9-6.

SURVIVAL AS BOTTOM LINE; NARROW ESCAPE BASIS OF O.C. REFUGEES' SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rose Hwang learned her survival skills when she became a leader among refugees 
fleeing Communist-held Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just by the escape, I learned tremendous lessons that will stay with me for 
life," said Hwang, now in her mid-30s and chief executive officer of Alpha 
Systems Lab, an Irvine company that designs computer components for multimedia 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took determination, faith, planning and guts. We had unity. While there 
were heroes and cowards, that unity mattered the most." 
</P>
<P>
 By applying that knowledge to business, Hwang and her husband, Mitchell Phan, 
have built Alpha Systems Lab in just four years into a company with nearly $40 
million in annual revenues and a nominee for one of Orange County's annual 
small-business awards, Entrepreneur of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang and Phan, an engineer whose family escaped Vietnam two days before 
Saigon fell in April, 1975, recognize that their success is against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast Asian immigrants -- Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians -- have high 
poverty and welfare rates, based on a UCLA report released in May. And, while 
many Asian Americans have managed to start their own businesses, they have 
generally focused on low-margin, low-profit businesses, the UCLA study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple give credit to their special mix of talents -- Hwang's knack for 
managing business operations, Phan's technical savvy -- a shared dream, 
determination and a bit of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang and her family of seven slipped out of Saigon in 1976 on a river boat. 
But on the high seas, out of gas and water, they were captured by a Communist 
patrol ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communists brought the refugees aboard and tied the boat in tow. They told 
everyone to sit still on the journey back to Saigon, where the refugees 
believed they would be condemned. But the captors left Hwang unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think a 17-year-old girl could do them any harm," she said. "That 
was their mistake. I was not a boy, but I was the oldest daughter and had a 
boy's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 She crept through the ship, whispering a plan to her comrades. The refugees 
then banded together, seized control of the ship and sailed to safety in 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Hwang and her family came to the United States, settling in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang enrolled at Cal State Fullerton and eventually earned a degree in music. 
Her first job was as a pianist. She also worked as a court reporter and in 
marketing for a small high-tech company. She met Phan in 1979, and the two 
married in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple formed their own company in 1990 with $50,000 in savings. It 
generated $1.2 million in sales in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Asian cultures, men usually do all the business, and women stay behind at 
home," said Phan, who is vice president of Alpha Systems Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that women can do a lot more," he said. "To men, I say put your ego 
down a little bit, and you'll find the best kind of partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 A stroke of good fortune came in 1992. Electronic Data Systems, a 
multibillion-dollar computer consulting firm, gave the fledgling company part 
of a $700-million contract to supply computer equipment to the Army, the Navy 
and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS also financed its first orders from the small company with prepayments, 
allowing Alpha Systems Lab to expand without venture capital. Sales at Alpha 
Systems Lab mushroomed to $38 million that year. For 1993, Alpha Systems 
reported sales of $40 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've done good work for us, and we've enjoyed working with them," said 
Randy Dove, spokesman for EDS. "Most of the contract work has been done now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Systems Lab now has 60 employees at its headquarters in Irvine. The 
company subcontracts its work to local assembly houses, which take a set of 
chips and mount them on circuit boards that can be installed in personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody else is shipping work offshore," Phan said. "We are creating jobs 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "This country helped us," he said, recalling his gratitude for a government 
refugee payment of $300 when he first arrived in the United States. "It's 
always been in my heart to do some kind of pay-back." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Systems Lab expects its government contracts to fall to 20% of revenue 
in 1994. But Phan says the company can sustain its sales with its latest 
product, the $1,095 MegaMotion circuit board, which can convert a personal 
computer into a teleconferencing machine that transmits documents and images 
over ordinary phone lines. It can also be used as a security monitor to conduct 
simultaneous surveillance of up to 16 remote sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The MegaMotion board has brought Alpha Systems Lab into competition with an 
array of bigger companies, among them Intel Corp., IBM, Matrox and True Vision. 
But Hwang said she thinks Alpha Systems Lab has an edge because its product was 
five years in the making and is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Burger, a product manager for Northrop Grumman Corp. in Hawthorne, said 
he is impressed with the MegaMotion technology and Phan's expertise. He said 
the aerospace company expects to install numerous boards at its government 
agency customers, such as the Coast Guard, in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan said he expects MegaMotion boards, which have been shipping at the rate 
of 1,000 a month since April, to account for 70% of the company's projected $40 
million in revenue this year. That helps the company offset revenue from the 
expiration of the EDS contract, which ends this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang and Phan, who now have three children, say they might one day do 
business in Vietnam, which no longer faces a U.S. trade embargo. But they 
emphasize that they are American citizens now and have no wish to move back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are watching the politics (in Vietnam) to see if there is a change," Hwang 
said. "But first, our goal is to become a much bigger company here." 
</P>
<P>
 Phan said: "We wanted to be a success on American terms." Alpha Systems Lab

MCI'S JOINT VENTURE PASSES ANTITRUST TEST; COMMUNICATIONS: JUSTICE DEPT. WILL 
ALLOW BRITISH TELECOM TO PURCHASE 20% OF U.S. FIRM, PAVING THE WAY FOR THE TWO 
TO LAUNCH NEW GLOBAL SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the first antitrust reviews of a major telecommunications deal, the 
Justice Department said Wednesday that it will allow British Telecommunications 
to go ahead with a modified plan to acquire 20% of MCI Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance pairs Britain's largest telecommunications company with the 
second-largest U.S. long-distance provider as they pursue the $10-billion 
market for international business customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department proposed a consent decree that would allow British 
Telecom to purchase the $4.3-billion stake in MCI and permit the two companies 
to launch a joint venture, called Concert, to provide business customers with a 
single source for worldwide communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission is still completing a separate review to 
determine the extent and type of services Concert can offer. But the relief 
voiced Wednesday by jubilant company officials indicated they expect the FCC 
review to be a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major hurdle for us, but as of today Concert is fully 
operational," BT spokesman James Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 50% of the world's multinationals are headquartered in the United 
Kingdom or the United States, so this alliance starts with excellent market 
position," said Gerald H. Taylor, president and chief operating officer of MCI 
Telecommunications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for Justice Department approval, the newly created Concert and 
MCI, which had 1993 revenue of $12 billion, agreed to disclose normally 
confidential information on the rates, terms and conditions under which they 
gain access to the British Telecom network. Those requirements are aimed at 
ensuring that U.S. telecommunications companies have the same access to markets 
in Britain that British businesses have here. 
</P>
<P>
 The consent decree, which needs court approval, followed a favorable 
department review of the merger of Paramount Communications Inc. with Viacom 
Inc. and is seen as further evidence that the Clinton Administration's 
antitrust police may not be as hostile to big business as some had feared after 
President Clinton appointed plaintiffs' lawyer Anne Bingaman as assistant 
attorney general for antitrust. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of watching deal making dry up in the telecommunications industry 
amid the uncertain regulatory environment, "people are now saying, 'Thank 
goodness! A telecommunications deal that closed,' " said Blake Bath, an analyst 
at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. "I think you are going to see this 
(trigger) a lot of other partnering" among long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 British Telecom had applied for antitrust approval more than a year ago. But 
the deal had languished at the Justice Department, which is still conducting 
reviews of AT&T's acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications and Microsoft 
Corp.'s domination of the personal computer software market. It is also 
expected to look into a bid by the telephone monopolies of France and Germany 
to buy a 20% stake in Sprint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the other deals raise somewhat different antitrust concerns, the 
Justice Department's decision to support the Baby Bells' entry into the 
long-distance market -- a federal judge has the final decision -- were seen as 
an indication that the AT&T and Sprint deals may also receive approval, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be playing catch-up, however. Some 21 companies, including First Data 
Corp. and Holiday Inn Worldwide, have already signed up for Concert, a 
$1-billion joint venture 75%-owned by British Telecom and 25% by MCI. British 
Telecom officials said that by next spring they expect the service will link 
5,000 business customers in 55 countries.

CALPERS WILL SCRUTINIZE FIRMS' WORKPLACES; INVESTING: THE PENSION FUND SAYS IT 
WILL LOOK AT THE PRACTICES OF COMPANIES IN ITS PORTFOLIO WITH LAGGING 
PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguing that enlightened workplace practices lead to more productive 
companies, the nation's biggest government employees pension fund vowed 
Wednesday to use its vast financial clout to campaign for giving employees a 
stronger voice on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension fund -- the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or 
CalPERS -- already is a major force on Wall Street known for its shareholder 
activism. It has wielded its nearly $80-billion portfolio to pressure corporate 
boards to be more accountable to shareholders and independent of management at 
such business giants as General Motors, IBM, Occidental Petroleum and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Sacramento-based CalPERS is adding a new litmus test for deciding which 
companies in its investment portfolio to coax for changes. The new standard 
takes into account such factors as what these companies do to give workers a 
say in business decisions and how much they spend on worker training. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a study performed by an outside consultant commissioned by CalPERS, 
"we are now convinced there is a direct connection between workplace practices 
and corporate performance," said William D. Crist, president of the pension 
fund's board of administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Crist said CalPERS will evaluate the workplace practices of companies in its 
investment portfolio that are lagging financially to determine whether their 
employment practices are part of the problem. In such cases, CalPERS will press 
for changes in the workplace, much as it previously has prodded poorly 
performing companies to do such things as adding more outside directors to 
check the influence of corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, CalPERS will impose tight limits on how far it will push the 
issue of workplace practices. For instance, Crist said the fund will not be 
making decisions on what companies to invest in on the basis of their workplace 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will the giant pension fund press for changes on the factory floors or in 
the offices of companies that are performing well financially and in the stock 
market. In addition, Crist said issues close to employees' hearts such as wages 
and benefits and the growing use of part-time and temporary workers will not be 
among the major workplace factors considered by CalPERS. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, CalPERS' decision was hailed by U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich as 
a powerful message to corporate America that they need to focus more on how 
good labor relations can improve profits and overall corporate performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing concentrates the mind of a CEO so much as an inquiry from a major 
institutional investor about your practices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich called the CalPERS decision an important shift for the business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workplace performance does matter, it does lead to higher returns over the 
longer term," Reich said. "Today, big institutional investors are so large that 
they can't move in and out of stocks quickly, and so they have to be concerned 
about the longer-term performance of companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Crist said CalPERS had long considered looking into workplace issues, 
the Labor Department also has been pushing it and other pension funds to take 
such action. As such, CalPERS' move could spark a trend among other money 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among labor economists, however, there still is debate about whether a direct 
relationship exists between ostensibly enlightened workplace practices and 
improved corporate performance. "As usual, the evidence is cloudy," UCLA labor 
economist Daniel J. B. Mitchell said.

THE DIGITAL SMOKING GUN; MISMANAGED E-MAIL POSES SERIOUS RISKS, EXPERTS WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Armed with a court order, electronic data detective John Jessen recently 
walked into the headquarters of a multibillion-dollar company and took over its 
computer system. His goal: to find evidence to support an unlawful-dismissal 
suit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Using complex techniques to sift through 700,000 corporate electronic mail 
messages stored on computer tapes, he found the smoking gun his client needed 
to win in court:  
</P>
<P>
 "Dear David, Please destroy the evidence" about the case, said the message. 
Then came the response: "Acknowledging your request. Evidence destroyed. Aloha, 
David." 
</P>
<P>
 As the use of computers has soared, a growing number of lawyers have turned to 
computer experts such as Jessen to search corporate computer systems for 
information that can buttress their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies, whose computer fears once centered on the danger of losing 
information, must now worry about risks posed by a plethora of data. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing you should lose sleep over is sheer volume of data and its 
mismanagement," Jessen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of greatest concern is the rapid growth of e-mail. About 24 million Americans 
now use it, and experts believe that the nation's largest companies generated 
more than 6 billion messages last year, sometimes automatically storing them 
for months or even years. 
</P>
<P>
 "E-mail is a ticking time bomb," says Michael Patrick, a Palo Alto attorney 
who is working with his clients to cut those risks. "You have limericks and 
dirty jokes on these systems -- horrible, vicious stuff that can get you nailed 
for sex harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of pretrial fact finding known as discovery, an attorney can 
demand from a company all electronic files having to do with a client's case. 
Federal rules introduced in December require companies to hand over a list of 
all available electronic data and to refrain from deleting any. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some widely publicized cases -- racist comments by Los Angeles police 
officers over an internal e-mail system became evidence in the Rodney King 
trial -- many people remain sloppy about using and saving electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if people put their brains on hold when they write e-mail," Jessen 
says. "It's a substitute for a phone call, and that's the danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessen worked on behalf of a woman a few years ago who believed she had been 
fired because she spurned her manager's sexual advances. Going through the 
company's e-mail, Jessen found this: "I don't care what it takes. Fire the 
tight-assed bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 When the employer saw the message, says Jessen, he settled right away -- for 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One major problem is that while companies have paper-retention policies and 
most people make an effort to keep their desks cleared, few have thought about 
what electronic data to keep or delete. 
</P>
<P>
 "People manage their paper to avoid looking like slobs," Jessen says. "With 
electronic information, you can keep storing and storing and you don't see it. 
It's out of sight, out of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Most companies simply dump computer files into backup tapes on a monthly or 
weekly basis. Such policies can come back to haunt them. Jessen unlocks a room 
in his Seattle office to reveal steel shelves packed with thousands of computer 
disks and magnetic tapes in several dozen varieties, which he figures contain 
about 40 million files and messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessen is going through the data for a company that was asked to hand over all 
its electronic files in connection with a contract dispute and wanted to know 
what they contained before handing them over. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic evidence has proved critical in more than just personnel issues. 
</P>
<P>
 When German conglomerate Siemens sued Atlantic Richfield Co. for withholding 
critical information before selling its solar subsidiary to Siemens, the key 
piece of evidence in the case was an e-mail message from an Arco executive that 
said, "As it appears that (Arco's solar technology) is a pipe dream, let 
Siemens have the pipe." Another Arco message talked of hiding questions about 
the technology and "finessing" the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessen isn't allowed to give the names of his clients, but he was a pioneer in 
the field when he left his microcomputer company in 1989 to start Electronic 
Evidence Discovery. Today he has 12 employees and is working on 87 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a vast array of software tools, Jessen can penetrate just about any 
system he encounters. To make sure he can read data in any format, Jessen has 
collected a small warehouse full of computers, including a rare machine made by 
Exxon in an early foray by that company into personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jessen says the key to collecting legal evidence is understanding the way 
computer systems organize and store data. Companies often collect and store raw 
data for accounting and database programs that senior executives don't even 
know exists, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessen has found lawyers particularly naive about technology. One lawyer 
boasted about the company's computer security system and challenged Jessen to 
find anything damaging. He watched in horror as Jessen dove into the system and 
pulled up old love notes from the lawyer to a former office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, a client had signed a contract he assumed contained a graph 
that had been discussed in early talks. The lawyer who drew up the contract 
insisted the issue was never raised. Jessen went through the attorneys' 
computer and found 27 drafts of the contract in dispute. The first eight 
versions of the contract included the clause in question. 
</P>
<P>
 As the best defense, experts recommend a regular program of weeding out 
unnecessary files. Joan Feldman, who recently quit working for Jessen to start 
her own company, Computer Forensics, was taken aback when a client's systems 
manager boasted that his new computer system could store 149 years' worth of 
electronic data. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told him he should have (e-mail) erased every two weeks," Feldman says. 
"It's a tape-recorded party line." 
</P>
<P>
 Just erasing e-mail may not solve the problem. Employees often download or 
forward messages to other people in the system. Experts can sometimes even 
recover information from a hard drive that has been erased, re-formatted and 
recorded over. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be a really determined person, a fanatic, to eliminate all the 
copies of your files," Feldman says. 
</P>
<P>
 If a company has a regular program of erasing e-mail, it is less likely to 
face the problem of explaining itself in court when it deletes information that 
later proves to be evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
 One company threw away its old backup tapes and insisted it simply didn't back 
up its computer files, even though it had the expensive equipment necessary to 
do so. Jessen went into the company's accounting program and found receipts 
showing the company had been regularly purchasing backup tapes and was 
obviously lying. E-Mail Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some dos and don'ts of electronic mail: 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish an e-mail policy that urges users to exercise the same restraint 
in writing e-mail messages that they do when writing letters or memos. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees should be told that "anything you put in this computer can and will 
be used against you in a court of law," John Jessen says. 
</P>
<P>
 * The company should implement an aggressive document retention policy that 
limits the number of saved e-mail messages both on the company's central 
computers and in personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warn employees to be careful about forwarding messages to employees or 
outsiders. A Tidal Wave of E-Mail 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of electronic mail, both within companies and across the global 
network known as the Internet, has skyrocketed as more and more users have 
discovered the speed, ease and low cost of this form of communication. 
Estimated messages on the Internet, in millions:

TWO U.S. FIRMS FILE SUIT FOR CONTROL OF MOSCOW HOTEL; RUSSIA: RADISSON AND 
IRVINE-BASED AMERICOM BOTH CLAIM BREACH OF CONTRACT. IF EITHER IS OUSTED, 
RUSSIAN PARTNER COULD WIND UP SOLE OWNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton slept there. So have members of Congress and chief executives of 
American companies. But Moscow's only American-run hotel is suddenly attracting 
more than famous guests.  
</P>
<P>
 The Radisson Slavjanskaya is caught in a very public battle for control 
between its two partners, Irvine-based Americom Business Centers and hotel 
giant Radisson. Three years after its founding, the Americom-Radisson 
partnership has disintegrated into open bickering and dueling lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A legal complaint filed by Radisson in Minneapolis on April 1 alleges 23 
egregious acts by Americom and its president, Paul E. Tatum, including 
violating Russian law, threatening Radisson employees and acting for the 
partnership without authority. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, which could take months to come to trial, Radisson seeks control 
of the American half of the joint venture. (The other half of the venture to 
run the hotel is controlled by a Russian firm, Mosintour.) Americom has 
countersued, seeking Radisson's ouster for withholding funds from Americom, 
foot-dragging on further development of the hotel complex and other alleged 
breaches of their contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the battle for the Slavjanskaya is unusual in its bitterness and 
complexity, it is typical of the chaotic legal and financial environment for 
American enterprises, particularly joint ventures, trying to do business in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tumultuous week in which Tatum was barred from the hotel by armed 
guards, Americom and Radisson sat down at the bargaining table Wednesday in 
Moscow. The Russian side gave the Americans until Friday morning, when the 
three partners will meet again to try to sort out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum said Radisson virtually ignores Americom in the day-to-day management of 
the joint venture. He said Radisson panders to their Russian partner because 
Mosintour -- heir to the Soviet tourism agency, Intourist -- has vast power 
over the hotel business in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Radisson, in fact, signed an agreement with Mosintour in October, 1992, to 
help bring 12 other Moscow hotels up to Western standards, but the agreement 
has stalled. To get it moving, Tatum said, Radisson must make Mosintour happy 
at the Slavjanskaya.  
</P>
<P>
 "They looked at us as squatters," Tatum said. "They (Mosintour) say, 'We want 
more control over the Slavjanskaya hotel property.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Radisson's approach is to give them everything they want," he added during an 
interview in a Moscow restaurant, flanked by two bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Radisson denied that it is ignoring Americom in favor of its Russian partner. 
"Radisson is cozying up to the Russians, I guess, if you say we want to have 
good relations with our partner," said John Norlander, president of 
Minneapolis-based Radisson Hotel Corp. "We'd like to have a good relationship 
with Americom."  
</P>
<P>
 Mosintour has refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parts of the dispute seem to stem from Tatum's stormy relationship with 
both Radisson and his own colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum "has a brilliant mind, but no management skills," said Scott Willens, 
who worked as Americom's sales director for a year before quitting in April, 
1993. Americom employees who challenged Tatum were fired or induced to quit, 
Willens said.  
</P>
<P>
 At least one former Americom employee in Moscow is suing Tatum for breach of 
contract after being forced out of the business, according to Willens. Eleven 
former Americom investors and a former board member are also suing Tatum in 
Florida for fraud and misuse of company funds. That suit, filed in 1992, has 
not yet come to trial, according to Marshall Davis, the Florida attorney 
handling it. 
</P>
<P>
 Americom was just a start-up in 1989 when Tatum and a group of investors that 
included H.R. Haldeman, former President Richard Nixon's chief of staff, 
courted the Soviet government for the contract to run a 630-room hotel on the 
banks of the Moscow River.  
</P>
<P>
 Americom brought in Radisson -- which manages more than 260 hotels worldwide 
-- to clinch the deal. The Slavjanskaya opened in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the Americom-Radisson-Mosintour joint venture is now in doubt 
because it is not legally clear whether one American partner can be ousted 
without the entire joint venture falling apart. And if the venture dissolves, 
control of the hotel would revert to the Russian partner, Mosintour -- an 
outcome that, despite their squabbling, neither American partner wants.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really want to dissolve anything, because that puts everything up 
in the air," Norlander acknowledged in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Russians take over, the Americans would not only lose their share of 
the hotel's profits -- which Tatum estimates at more than $100 million during 
the joint venture's 20-year contract to run the hotel complex -- but they could 
also lose the separate management contracts Radisson has to run the hotel and 
its restaurants and that Americom holds to run the Western-style business 
center and hotel shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, a U.S. District Court in Minnesota upheld Radisson's efforts to 
bar Tatum from the hotel complex, where he not only works but lives. Tatum had 
been banned from the Slavjanskaya since June 6, after he allegedly tried to 
break into an office in the hotel and cut off its phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the joint venture agreed to give Tatum free access to the hotel 
again.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: MONOPOLIES WOULD GAIN EVEN TIGHTER GRIP WITH 
SPRINT DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Excuse me, is there an echo on this line? 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a year ago, British Telecom announced that it would invest $5 billion 
to buy a 20% stake in MCI. Now Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom -- Europe's 
largest state-run telecommunications monopolies -- say they're prepared to ante 
up $4.2 billion for a comparable share of Sprint. (You remember Sprint -- the 
No. 3 long-distance company that has apparently recovered well from having the 
merger hots for Electronic Data Services.) 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? Japan's Nippon Telegraph & Telephone investing $10 billion for a 
fifth of AT&T? Apparently, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery when 
you're trying to build a global telecommunications network. A Sprint stake 
unquestionably gives the two telecommunications giants a tremendous opportunity 
to grow in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, it's an encouraging move for us," a British Telecom spokesman 
says. "It very much vindicates our strategic view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But watch those stiff upper lips tremble with outrage when the conversation 
turns to telecommunications politics. Britain's telecom mandarins are stunned 
by the sheer gall of the French and German monopolies in bidding billions for 
Sprint as they piously proclaim the relative openness of their own networks. 
That's utter nonsense, say the Brits, and the United States would be crazy to 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be absolutely amazed if your Department of Justice and the Federal 
Communications Commission let this deal go through without getting tremendously 
huge changes and concessions from both France and Germany in the accessibility 
of their telecommunications markets," the spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 By any measure, Britain's telecom marketplace is now among the most open and 
competitive in the world. The Baby Bells actually have greater freedom to cut 
deals and forge alliances here than they do in America. In fact, foreign 
telephone companies here actually offer cable television service, and cable TV 
companies have begun to offer telephone service -- just what America's cable TV 
and telephone companies are clamoring to do back home. (That British consumers 
are often less than thrilled with the quality of these hybrid services is seen 
as beside the point.) 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department approved British Telecom's bid to buy into MCI in 
large part because the British telecommunications market invites and encourages 
competition from the world over. By contrast, "both France Telecom and Deutsche 
Telekom are monopolists," says the British Telecom spokesman, "and we would 
think that should be a handicap in their efforts to gain approval for their 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T -- no stranger to monopoly -- has similarly criticized the proposed 
European investment in Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Is all this just corporate posturing by nervous competitors who are greedily 
eyeing each other's markets? Or are there genuine economic and regulatory 
principles at stake? There should be no doubt: British Telecom and AT&T are 
absolutely right in opposing this deal, and if the Clinton Administration's 
trustbusters aren't too busy figuring out ingenious ways to break up Microsoft, 
they should make it clear that state-sanctioned multibillion-dollar monopolies 
do not gain easy access to a competitive American market. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should a Franco-German alliance be allowed to practice as a predatory 
monopolist and use the revenue gained from its home markets -- Germany and 
France are the two largest telecommunications markets in Europe -- to subsidize 
a Sprint in competition with AT&T and MCI in America and the rest of the 
(deregulated) world? That is a totally unfair competitive advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, you could make a case that the French and Germans can easily afford to 
invest more than $4 billion for a piece of Sprint precisely because they pass 
along any costs to their captive subscribers. Monopolies are good at that. Just 
ask the folks who ran the old Bell system. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad truth is that, while Europe is supposed to become a single market, 
telecommunications was granted an exemption by the European Union until 1998 at 
the earliest. In other words, the French and German telecommunications 
monopolies are trying to exploit a loophole in the rules to secure an unfair 
competitive advantage in what will be a $300-billion market by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly annoying, of course, is the stubborn insistence by the French and 
Germans that their telecommunications markets are open. As any multinational 
company in those countries will tell you, France and Germany are hostile to 
innovations introduced from outside; their prices are outrageously high, and 
there isn't even domestic competition to look to for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton Administration really cares about free and fair trade, it will 
take this opportunity to get a schedule of market access in France and Germany 
before allowing a Sprint investment. Or better yet, let Sprint take the money 
-- just don't allow anyone from France Telecom or Deutsche Telekom to serve on 
the Sprint board or exercise any sort of management influence.

 Iran to Allow Private Banks: For the first time since the 1979 Islamic 
Revolution, the nation has decided to let private banks open, the Financial 
Times reported.Speaking on Tehran radio, central bank Gov. Mohammed Hussein 
said the bank will supervise private banks when they begin operating next week, 
guaranteeing their activities. Regulations for private banks were reportedly 
declared within constitutional and religious laws. Separately last week, 
Iranian President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani said the country will repay its 
$17-billion foreign debt by 2000.

 Glaxo Chairman to Retire: The British drug maker said Sir Paul Girolami will 
step down at the end of June, prompting speculation that the company may be 
near a multibillion-dollar acquisition in the United States. Glaxo's American 
Depository Receipts rose 50 cents to $17.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
helped by the view that Girolami's departure will free company management to 
use its growing cash resources. In May, analysts tipped Glaxo -- maker of the 
world's biggest-selling prescription drug, ulcer treatment Zantac -- as the 
most likely candidate to take over U.S. health care group McKesson Corp. 
McKesson gained $1.875 to $79.375 on a revival of the takeover talk.

GOLDSTON STEPS DOWN AS PRESIDENT OF L.A. GEAR; EXECUTIVES: HIS DEPARTURE COMES 
WITH THE NO. 3 MAKER OF ATHLETIC SHOES POISED TO REBOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L.A. Gear, once one of the hottest athletic shoe businesses that ran into 
trouble in the early 1990s, announced Wednesday that Mark Goldston has resigned 
as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldston, 39, was hired in 1991 to engineer a turnaround at the Santa 
Monica-based company. Although L.A. Gear had only one profitable quarter during 
Goldston's tenure, he is credited with preparing the firm for a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 He left to become a managing director of Burbank-based Shamrock Holdings Inc., 
an investment partnership controlled by the Roy E. Disney family and Stanley 
Gold, chairman and chief executive of L.A. Gear. 
</P>
<P>
 William Benford, 51, L.A. Gear's chief financial officer, has succeeded 
Goldston as president. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Gear also announced Wednesday an agreement under which Wal-Mart Stores 
Inc. will buy a minimum of $80 million in the company's footwear in each of the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldston decided to make the move to Shamrock now because he believes the 
Wal-Mart deal will help stabilize the company, said Clifford Miller, another 
managing partner at Shamrock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Gear, the nation's fastest-growing athletic shoe company in the 1980s, 
began to slide in 1990 because of marketing gaffes, excessive distribution and 
a poorly performing apparel division. It currently ranks third behind Nike and 
Reebok, with about 6% of the athletic shoe market. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had a loss of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 1994 and 
expects a second-quarter loss of $13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chairman Gold said Goldston has helped put L.A. Gear on the proper 
track. Under Goldston, L.A. Gear in 1993 introduced its strong-selling L.A. 
Tech line, shoes with heels that flash lights when foot pressure is applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made substantial progress during this period to focus the company and 
positively position the various L.A. Gear footwear brands in a very competitive 
marketplace," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts agreed that Goldston set the stage for the company's 
revival. 
</P>

 "He put in place a plan to bring more value-oriented footwear to L.A. Gear," 
said Mark Friedman, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. "He started to 
implement a turnaround plan, but he has not completed the turnaround. I expect 
to see an improved performance by the company in the second half of the year."

<P>
 Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder Peabody in New York, said he expects L.A. 
Gear to have a profitable second half and predicts that the company will break 
even for the year.

<P>
 "Goldston did an excellent job," Jacobson said. "Without him, the company 
would not have survived. He reinvigorated their product lines and reduced 
expenses."

<P>
 In his new role, Goldston will help Shamrock identify investment 
opportunities.

 Goldston, a former marketing executive at rival Reebok International, was an

FINANCIAL MARKETS; COMMODITY PRICES FUEL INFLATION FEARS

 Bond yields soared and stocks tumbled Wednesday as rising commodity prices 
renewed concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 A falling dollar and comments from a Federal Reserve official added to 
speculation that inflation may accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond yield rocketed to 7.39% from 7.30% late 
Tuesday. It was the highest closing yield since June 1. Its price, which moves 
in the opposite direction, plunged 29/32 point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in interest rates, which gave equity investors an excuse to sell and 
collect profits amassed recently, sent the Dow Jones average, which on Tuesday 
climbed past 3,800 for the first time since late March, down to 3,790.41, 
losing 24.42. The blue chip gauge had gained more than 31 points in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices were narrowly higher during the morning, with investors encouraged 
by government data indicating economic growth may be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors tend to sell on news of strong economic expansion, which 
carries the threat of inflation. That erodes the value of fixed-income 
securities such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve said industrial production posted its 12th straight 
increase in May, rising a modest 0.2% on top of a revised 0.1% gain in April. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.2% in April after 
falling in March for the first time in three months. The modest rebound was 
anticipated by most analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices began tumbling, however, after grain and soybean futures prices 
soared on a long-range forecast for more dry heat in the Midwest. The heat 
threatens to irreversibly damage some crops, hurting supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodities Research Bureau index, a gauge of daily changes in various 
commodities, ended at 238.61, up a healthy 3.31 points. The CRB is watched for 
indications of future inflation trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you saw how commodities were doing, that just ruined everything," said 
Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, bond prices fell after crude oil prices leaped 91 cents to 
close of $19.86 a barrel, the highest crude closing price in a year. Oil prices 
soared due to increasing tensions concerning North Korea and an unexpected 
decrease in weekly U.S. supply figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Precious metals also moved higher with gold rising $2.60 an ounce on the New 
York Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's rout triggered the setback in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every time the CRB index hits a certain level, the bond market 
gets negative and then our market just follows suit," said Alice Sadlo, first 
vice president at McDonald & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff on inflation worries hit blue chips across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows you just how nervous people feel about the inflation issue," said 
Jack Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the selling on Wall Street was directed at big name stocks and smaller 
issues weathered the session slightly better. Losers outnumbered gainers by 
about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where Big Board volume retreated 
to 269.87 million shares, down from Tuesday's 288.55 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Market measures heavily weighed with NYSE issues ended with deficits. The NYSE 
composite index lost 0.96 to close at 254.14 and Standard & Poor's 500 stock 
index dropped 1.76 to 460.61. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq Stock Market composite index of mostly smaller stocks was almost 
flat at 735.84, off 0.14, while the American Stock Exchange market value index 
fell 0.38 to 442.27. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also weakened after interest rates soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Its weakness was particularly noticeable against the Swiss franc as market 
participants, nervous about tensions in Korea, bought the Swiss currency as a 
safe haven vehicle. In New York the dollar closed at 1.371 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.387. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenback also fell to 102.77 Japanese yen and 1.636 German marks, down 
from 102.78 yen and 1.646 yen respectively on Tuesday. Among the highlights on 
Wall Street: 
</P>
<P>
 * The downturn in blue chips spread to economically sensitive cyclical stocks 
such as Alcoa, which lost 1 3/8 at 74 1/2, and Du Pont, down 1/2 to 60 5/8. 
Consumer product maker Procter & Gamble fell 1 1/8 to 54 7/8, and IBM sank 1 
1/4 to 63 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glaxo's American Depositary Receipts rose 1/2 to 17 3/4 on the NYSE 
following news that the Britain-based drug company's chairman, Paul Girolami, 
was retiring earlier than expected. There was speculation that after his 
retirement Glaxo would alter its business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks were among those bucking the general trend. Chrysler rose 1/4 to 
50 1/8 and GM gained 3/8 to 54, although Ford finished off 1/2 to 60 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bear Stearns downgraded Exxon to avoid from hold, and the stock fell 1 7/8 
to 57. 
</P>
<P>
 * Premark International, which makes Tupperware and other consumer products, 
gained 1 7/8 to 76 3/8 in anticipation of strong second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed sessions for stocks overseas exerted minimal influence on Wall Street. 
In Tokyo, stocks gave up earlier gains and ended lower on arbitrage-linked 
selling coupled with slower buying by overseas investors. The Nikkei 225-share 
average ended off 71.01 points at 21,282.96. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average ending up 6.2 points at 3,045.8. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average was unchanged at 2,074.70. 
</P>

 Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 4.07 points to 2,296.87.

FIRST INTERSTATE TO MARKET VARIABLE ANNUITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that extends the development of banks into financial supermarkets, 
First Interstate Bancorp and insurance giant SunAmerica Inc. on Wednesday 
announced an agreement under which SunAmerica's tax-deferred variable annuities 
will be sold through First Interstate branches. 
</P>
<P>
 SunAmerica, a Los Angeles-based life insurer with $23 billion in assets, said 
it struck a similar deal with Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's sixth-largest 
bank, which will offer SunAmerica's variable annuities through its 350 branches 
in four East Coast states and its network of 900 investment broker-dealers 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 For First Interstate, the agreement matches an earlier move by California 
rival Wells Fargo, which teamed up with Skandia America Group to offer variable 
annuities. At least a dozen other large banks also carry the products. First 
Interstate is the nation's 13th-largest bank, with 1,063 branches in 13 western 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Variable annuities are akin to individual retirement accounts in that 
consumers may use them to shelter income while building a nest egg for 
retirement or a future expense, such as a child's college education. As with an 
IRA, investors in variable annuities may allocate their investments among 
stock, bond and money market portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike ordinary bank accounts, variable annuities are not protected by federal 
deposit insurance. To protect consumers, regulators restrict the way banks may 
market the annuities. They may be sold only by licensed investment agents -- in 
most cases, the same people who sell banks' other uninsured offerings, such as 
mutual funds, municipal bonds and Treasury certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 As banks push deeper into territory that has traditionally belonged to 
insurance companies and investment brokerages, regulators and courts are 
struggling to keep up. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month agreed to hear 
a case that may resolve the question of whether national banks have the right 
to sell variable annuities at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves an appeal by NationsBank of North Carolina of a lower court 
ruling that barred the bank from selling variable annuities in all but the 
smallest communities.

 OPEC Leaves Production Quotas Unchanged: Believing it has found the key to 
higher prices, the cartel left untouched its crude production levels for the 
rest of 1994. In adopting a hands-off policy, the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries is gambling that oil prices will continue rallying in the 
fall and winter, with increased demand for crude in the United States and 
elsewhere.Oil prices tumbled late last year to their lowest levels in five 
years. But since the cartel agreed in March to cap its output at 24.5 million 
barrels a day through the end of the year, the price of the U.S. benchmark 
grade of oil has gained more than $5 a barrel. Crude oil prices rose sharply 
Wednesday, reaching their highest level in more than a year and flirting with 
the $20-a-barrel mark.

 Kidder Cash Infusion, Investigation Reported: Kidder Peabody Group Inc. 
received a $400-million infusion from its parent, General Electric Co., and the 
brokerage is the subject of a broad new regulatory probe, the Wall Street 
Journal reported."Kidder Peabody Group Inc. is on life support," the article 
said, adding that the New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange 
Commission are jointly conducting the inquiry into Kidder. The firm is hurting 
because some key traders have recently departed, the paper said. It attributed 
the information to an unidentified regulator and unidentified Kidder 
executives. Michael A. Carpenter, chairman and CEO of Kidder, called the 
article "inaccurate and grossly misleading."

 Sony Unveils Chip for Video Game Machine: Sony Computer Entertainment, a unit 
of Sony Corp., and LSI Logic Corp. unveiled an advanced chip that will power 
Sony's new video game player, the PlayStation.The PlayStation microchip 
contains advanced three-dimensional geometric graphics and high-resolution 
full-motion video. It is a 32-bit RISC (reduced instruction set computing) 
chip, which has architecture that reduces the complexity of the chip by using 
simpler instructions. The PlayStation, announced in May, is a CD-based home 
video game player. It will not be available in the United States until sometime 
next year. It will be shipped in Japan at the end of 1994. Sony said it expects 
the system to be priced at about $500.

 Bank Profits Strong, S&L Earnings Slip: Commercial banks recorded their 
second-best profits ever during the first three months of the year, but 
problems at three big savings and loans dampened the thrift industry's 
earnings, the government said. The nations' 10,840 commercial banks earned 
$11.1 billion, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. said.That was second only to the $11.5 billion earned during 
the July-September quarter last year. Meanwhile, earnings at the 2,240 savings 
banks and savings and loan institutions fell to $1.3 billion from $2.4 billion 
a year earlier. However, the FDIC attributed more than $500 million of the 
decline to "balance sheet restructuring" at three of the top 20 thrifts. In 
California, Glendale Federal Bank and California Federal Bank recognized losses 
on real estate loans. First Federal of Michigan lost $139 million on interest 
rate swaps.

REPORTS SHOW SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH; PRODUCTION: INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT BARELY ROSE 
IN MAY, THE FED SAYS. GAUGE OF INFLATIONARY PRESSURE DROPS FOR SECOND MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evidence of slower economic growth is piling up. Production at U.S. factories, 
mines and utilities barely rose in May, and a barometer of inflationary 
pressure was lower for the second straight month. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also reasonably good news about the productivity of American 
businesses. And, as expected, inventories rose slightly in April while sales 
slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve System reported that industrial production posted its 12th 
straight increase in May, with output of business equipment and construction 
supplies barely offsetting the third consecutive decline in car and truck 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Production rose a modest 0.2% last month after a 0.1% gain in April, which was 
revised downward from an earlier 0.3% estimate. The size of the recent 
increases is down sharply from the last three months of 1993, when the economy 
expanded more rapidly than it had in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're on the verge of economic collapse," said economist Sandra 
Shaber of the WEFA Group, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting service. "Put all of 
it together, we'll have some non-inflationary growth. It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said the industrial operating rate -- a barometer of inflationary 
pressure -- fell in May for the second straight month. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank said production facilities operated at 83.5% of capacity in 
May, down a tenth of a percentage point from April and two-tenths from March. 
</P>
<P>
 The operating rate peaked at 83.9% in June, 1989. If it rises too high, it 
could mean production limits are being reached -- leading to shortages that 
spur price and wage increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts now predict that the Fed, which boosted interest rates four 
times from February to May, will impose no further tightening of credit before 
August at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The news is non-inflationary today," said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest 
Corp. in Minneapolis. "I'm not sure about down the road. Sooner or later, we'll 
bump into capacity restraints." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Sherman, of M.A. Schapiro & Co. in New York, said the decline in both 
production and operating capacity for auto manufacturers is concealing stronger 
growth in other sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good," he said. "But in my view, we're at the threshold of rising 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 In another report Wednesday, the Labor Department said non-farm productivity 
rose 1.3% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year. The figure, 
defined as output per number of hours worked, is nearly three times the 0.5% 
rate earlier reported. But it still lagged behind the fourth quarter of last 
year, when productivity shot up at a 6.1% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Commerce Department said still-lean business inventories rose 0.2% 
in April after falling in March for the first time in three months. It also 
said business sales fell 0.8% in April, the largest drop since they plunged 
1.5% in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said car and truck assemblies peaked in February at an annual rate of 
13.4 million units, and output decreased to an 11.5-million-unit pace in May. 
The drop in auto production from near capacity has pulled down the overall 
index about 0.2% per month since March, the central bank said. Productivity

FUND MANAGERS HIT PAY DIRT IN A BIG WAY; WALL STREET: GEORGE SOROS BECOMES THE 
FIRST PERSON ON RECORD TO EARN A 10-FIGURE SALARY.

 Want a super-paying job? Become a hedge fund or commodity fund manager. 
They're the people who shuffle around billions of investment dollars and get 
fat paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 One fund manager, George Soros, took home at least $1.1 billion last year, 
says Financial World magazine, a business publication. 
</P>
<P>
 In its July 5 issue, the magazine's annual survey of "The 100 Most Highly 
Compensated Wall Streeters" shows that the best-paid people were those who 
worked for investment partnerships called hedge funds or commodity funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial World said 1993 was such a great year that in order to make the 
list, the people who manage money had to get at least $10 million, up from 
1992's minimum of $6 million. The median earner on the list made at least $20 
million, twice the 1992 figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Soros, who runs Soros Fund Management, is the first person on record to be 
paid a 10-figure salary. His billion-dollar paycheck exceeds the gross domestic 
product of at least 42 countries in the United Nations. With it he could buy 
5,790 Rolls-Royces, nicely loaded, at $190,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial World said the managers did well simply because they had a great 
year running money. "A number of them, including Mark Strome and Cesar 
Montemayor, racked up gains exceeding 100% before fees," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strome made at least $90 million running the Strome Susskind fund, and 
Montemayor had a paycheck of $11 million from Montemayor Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Their paychecks are linked to their aggressive fee structures and the huge 
sums they manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Soros, for example, manages more than $11 billion. Julian Robertson, the 
second-highest-paid at $500 million, handles more than $6 billion at Tiger 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial World said the managers get a 1% fee for managing these assets.

 New Powers Proposed for Czech Central Bank: Hoping to quell concerns after 
three bank failures, the government proposed sweeping new regulatory powers for 
the nation's central bank.If approved by Parliament, the regulations would 
allow the central bank to decrease the book value of troubled banks and replace 
corrupt or incompetent bank managers, and would make it easier for the central 
bank to cooperate with foreign regulators. Central bank officials have been 
pushing for the changes after the nation's seventh-largest bank, Banka Bohemia, 
fell into trouble earlier this year by issuing $1.2 billion in worthless notes 
abroad. Two other commercial banks have collapsed because of bad management, 
officials say.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; GERMAN DEVELOPER'S DISAPPEARANCE HAS CRITICS CALLING 
FOR CHANGE; BANKING: HE OBTAINED LOANS WHILE LOSING MILLIONS EVERY YEAR. BILL 
WOULD FORCE COMPANIES TO DETAIL OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German prosecutors have been searching far and wide for developer Juergen 
Schneider since he disappeared with $300 million on April 4, leaving $3.1 
billion in debt and unpaid contractor bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the banks Schneider allegedly defrauded have been trying to 
determine how a developer losing about $300 million a year was continually able 
to obtain loans. And critics are demanding changes in the business practices of 
top executives that run the web of banks and corporations known as Germany Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Schneider scandal, in the near-bankruptcy of engineering giant 
Metallgesellschaft in January and in a billion-dollar fraud revealed this month 
at flooring manufacturer Balsam, well-connected men at ailing companies 
conducted risky or criminal business while their supervisors slumbered and the 
loans kept rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something stinks in the system," said Thomas Schmidt, a senior aide who 
helped draw up business reform legislation pending in Parliament. "You or I 
could never get loans like these. It's an insider's club." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is backed by the opposition and some legislators from the 
conservative government. It would force German companies to detail their 
ownership structures, strip top executives of some of their duties on sundry 
boards and give shareholders more power in running companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But quick passage isn't likely. It's not likely to pass before the Oct. 16 
federal elections, however. And while average Germans may end up paying for the 
Schneider case and other fiascoes, there is no real groundswell for reforming 
the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germans are all too trusting of their bankers," said Ekkehard Wenger, a 
professor of business at Wurzburg University and a critic of large 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 They've had reason to be. The tightly organized structure of the banks and 
corporations enabled the German Wirtschaftswunder, the country's astonishing 
economic rebirth after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 With top bankers and corporate executives sitting on one another's boards and 
owning big chunks of each other's businesses, they were able to smoothly 
coordinate a kind of privately controlled command economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the brave new Europe of open borders, quick-moving financial transfers 
and new competition from Asia and Eastern Europe, the tidy, chummy German 
business boards can't cope, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oversight boards have been conquered by the industries they are meant to 
supervise," Wenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Hilmar Kopper, the Deutsche Bank chairman, sits on the 
supervisory board of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial concern, which 
is 25%-owned by his bank. It's a clear conflict of interest, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a major bank such as Deutsche Bank lines up behind a developer such as 
Schneider, smaller banks quickly fall in line. As for the losses, consumers 
will end up paying the price through more expensive banking fees, said Thomas 
Schlier, spokesman for the German consumers union. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, Schneider, 60, lived in a castle outside Frankfurt 
with his wife, Claudia, a 48-year-old heiress to a retail fortune. The 
developer was able to qualify for huge amounts of credit by setting up dummy 
corporations and getting his buildings valued at far more than they were worth, 
investigators say. He set up 60 dummy companies to keep the credit pouring in, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends who used to stroll by a Munich building owned by Schneider "were sick 
with laughter" when they found out that the "ugly old building" had been 
appraised at $450 million, Wenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Bank, Schneider's biggest creditor, expects to lose $300 million. 
"You have to remember that he always paid on time," spokesman Wolfgang 
Schumacher said. The bank was the victim of Schneider's "criminal energy," he 
said, adding that there is no evidence to support reports that bank officers 
were bribed to help falsify Schneider's appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Bank has promised to finish the construction jobs stilled by 
Schneider's bankruptcy, but when that will happen is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty little mess," said electrician Jens Doerr, one of 66 
contractors in the city of Leipzig who is owed money by Schneider.

 China Cracks Down on Futures Industry: The government announced a sweeping 
crackdown on the nascent industry that will stop trading on most of the 
country's 40-odd exchanges and prevent brokerages from placing orders overseas. 
The move follows a warning by the official People's Daily newspaper Sunday that 
speculation on international futures markets had led to huge foreign exchange 
losses. Most futures exchanges will be turned into wholesale markets that will 
be banned from dealing in futures.

 Packing is a pain, but it's easy to minimize the aggravation. The trick is to 
invest in extras of your essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 In my closet at all times is my "travel kit," a zip-around bag that's always 
ready to go. For $50 to $100 or even less, you can get duplicates of your 
basics (toothbrush, shampoo, soap, hair dryer) as well as emergency items 
(sewing kit, eyeglass repair kit, bandages). 
</P>
<P>
 The convenience is well worth the capital investment. You can initially buy 
half a dozen miniature sizes of each item to keep you in stock for years, or, 
like me, you can regularly refill small containers in the travel bag from 
larger ones in your home as soon as you get back. 
</P>
<P>
 I also keep an extra robe, slippers and pocket umbrella in my luggage, and 
keep a pre-packed exercise bag with an extra pair of running shoes. For each 
trip, all I have to do is pack my wardrobe.  
</P>
<P>
 But you could even save time there, by keeping clothes in your garment bag. 
Even if you don't want to leave certain clothes in the bag all the time, you 
can store some suits in it, leaving the bag hanging in the closet. Whenever you 
have a trip planned, it's ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 You get almost the same treatment as someone with a personal valet by 
investing a small amount of time and money.

 Nervousness about the peso persists, although the currency strengthens some 
days. Overall, it has lost 7.7% of its value against the U.S. dollar this year, 
1.13% in the past month.Interest rates rose to 18% in April, and the government 
has kept them high to protect the value of peso-denominated investments and 
attract foreign investors. Investor concern over the rejection by Zapatista 
rebels of the government peace proposal, and over a car bomb explosion in 
Guadalajara last weekend, could push rates higher.

 An austerity program designed to revitalize a stagnated economy has been

more hardship.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; FIRMS HELP PARENTS LEAVE THE GUILT 
BEHIND

 Business trips may increasingly be a fact of working life for many parents, 
but the travels don't have to turn into guilt trips. There are ways for parents 
to ease their minds while on the road, and some companies are taking steps to 
help lighten the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 The average person who travels on business takes 4 1/2 company trips a month, 
for a total of about five nights away from home, said Susan Ginsberg, publisher 
of the Work and Family Life newsletter, a monthly publication distributed by 
companies to their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing significant events in their children's lives is one of the most 
stressful aspects parents face in work-related travel, Ginsberg said. A recent 
survey Ginsberg helped conduct for Atlanta-based MCI Telecommunications Corp. 
showed that 60% of traveling parents with children at home have missed a 
child's birthday or other special event, such as a school play or baseball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prime guilt provokers are having to leave a sick child or not feeling 
comfortable with the care provider left at home. 
</P>
<P>
 A small but growing number of companies are attempting to help parents who 
travel. Some subsidize or pay for child care while the parent is gone, or they 
may pay for child care if the parent chooses to take the child along, said 
Robin Hardman, director of information services for the Families and Work 
Institute in New York, a nonprofit research company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, for example, will cover the cost of child 
care for parents when they travel, spokesman Michael Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Minneapolis-based IDS Financial Services, a division of American Express, 
the company pays for child care (or elder care) in an employee's absence, or 
pays for child care during a meeting if the parent takes the child along, said 
Sharon Klun, IDS work and family coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Travel Industry Assn., the percentage of business trips that 
include children has increased from 11% of the 224 million business trips taken 
in 1991 to 14% of the 276 million trips in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotels will assist parents in finding child care. And a few even provide 
supervised recreation programs for kids. During the summer, for example, 
Chicago-based Hyatt Corp. runs Camp Hyatt, a children's activities program that 
parents can pay for by the hour or day. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies have adapted to the needs of working parents by conducting 
more business by video or teleconference, Hardman said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when it comes to juggling travel and family obligations, most 
business travelers are on their own. Formal family-oriented travel policies are 
still uncommon at most companies, Klun said, though interest appears to be 
increasing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten 15 phone calls in the last four months from (other companies) 
asking about our policy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are some road-tested suggestions for making business travel 
less anxiety-inducing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Katie Glockner Seymour, president of Performance Marketing near 
Orlando, Fla., and her husband, Thad, general manager of Atlanta-based HBO & 
Co., both travel for work. Each tries to call home at the same time each day so 
their three children know when they can talk about their day's activities and 
concerns. And before either one is leaving for someplace new, they talk about 
the place. "We try to make it a fun geography lesson," Glockner Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Using a map and markers to show where you're going and sending postcards when 
you're on the road are great ways to turn a business trip into a positive 
experience for kids, Ginsberg said. Other suggestions are to hide notes or 
surprises for kids in lunch boxes or backpacks, make sure someone videotapes 
any special family event you'll miss, and take pictures of even routine things, 
such as hotel rooms, airports or meeting rooms to share with very young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can also use fax machines in creative ways to stay in touch with loved 
ones. Some kids fax homework assignments to their parents, or parents fax a 
funny message home, Ginsberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest consequences of feeling guilty about job-related travel is 
that parents sometimes try to overcompensate for being gone.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't try to make up for your absence with elaborate gifts," Ginsberg said. 
Small souvenirs, especially the kinds of things children can use later in 
school reports, are better choices. And when you get home, try to spend extra 
time with your kids, perhaps doing something similar to what you missed while 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best secret for reducing guilt, however, is to think of business 
travel as an opportunity for kids, said Klun, herself a single parent who has 
to occasionally leave her 9-year-old at home for job-related travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly try to look at it as a positive experience for him," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Before she leaves, she talks with her son about getting to set his own alarm 
clock and take care of his own clothes. "It gives him tools to build his 
self-esteem," she said. "It's a chance to try out some of those skills." Tips 
for a Guilt-Free Trip Here are some ideas for minimizing family disruptions 
when traveling on business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disrupt your children's schedules as little as possible by leaving after 
they've left for school or summer activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give very young children a reference point for your return, such as "I'll be 
back after your dinner tomorrow" or "I'll be back in two sleep times." 
</P>
<P>
 * Freeze some favorite meals for when you're gone, and encourage your family 
to eat things they like but you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you know your kids' schedules so you are aware of homework 
projects or games that will take place while you're gone. Talk about those 
events when you call. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fax funny messages or cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use electronic mail to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you call home, make sure you use the same "separation sayings" you do 
there, such as "See you later, alligator." 
</P>
<P>
 * Tape a bedtime story your children can play while you're gone, or bring a 
duplicate book and read it over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid overnight trips by taking an early-bird flight and returning on a 
late-night flight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call home at the same time each day so your kids know when to expect to talk 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Send postcards and letters. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you will miss an important event at home, have someone videotape it, then 
plan a special time to watch the tape with your family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a map to go over your itinerary with your kids. Make a point of learning 
about different cultures if your trip will take you overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leave notes or small surprises in different places, such as on pillows or in 
lunch boxes. Make a game of having your kids find one surprise every day you 
are gone.

 Spying: The Canadian Security Intelligence Service said in a report that more 
than two dozen countries are engaging in economic espionage and that in-flight 
spying is part of the problem. An internal document said Canadian business 
executives were warned in 1992 not to fly Air France after CSIS discovered that 
the French intelligence service was bugging airline seats and using undercover 
agents to pose as flight attendants.The agency said at least one Canadian 
company had lost a major contract because foreign competitors were able to 
obtain details of its tender through their government. 
</P>
<P>
 Visas: Thanks to NAFTA, you no longer need a visa in Mexico -- if you're a 
U.S. or Canadian business traveler staying 30 days or less. New business travel 
cards are available free at border crossings or in advance at Mexican 
consulates, airlines and travel agents. The cards are similar to the tourist 
cards the government issues. They must be presented at points of entry with 
proof of citizenship, such as a valid passport or birth or naturalization 
certificate. For more information, call (202) 736-1000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel rooms: Space will be tight for the next few months in Boston, New York, 
Washington and San Francisco due to the World Cup, soccer's quadrennial global 
extravaganza. Bob Diener, president of Dallas-based Hotel Reservations Network, 
said the Cup games, on top of the usual early summer travel activity, threaten 
to make hotel rooms in those four cities particularly scarce and expensive. The 
other cup cities -- Orlando, Detroit, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles -- will 
not be as strongly affected, Diener said.

<P>
 Delta Air Lines Inc., seeking to cut costs in an increasingly competitive 
airline market, expects to save $100 million a year by removing its 13 Airbus 
A-310 aircraft from its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about $100 million a year savings right there, eliminating one 
airplane type, the inventory that goes with that, the training and so forth," 
Chief Executive Ronald Allen said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta, the nation's third-largest airline, said Tuesday that it would remove 
the planes as part of its program to return to sustained profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said Tuesday that its profit improvement plan, aimed at 
reducing costs by $700 million over three years, is a year ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it said it will eliminate 2,500 jobs over the next 12 months as 
it reshapes its technical operations division. 
</P>
<P>
 As a means of cutting expenses, Delta is examining all its aircraft and may 
further simplify its fleet over the next couple of years, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline has 13 different types of aircraft in its fleet, excluding the 
Airbus A-310 planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably still have too many types of planes -- not too many planes, 
but too many types -- so we must address that," he said, adding that Delta will 
probably begin to replace its Lockheed L10-11 aircraft in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet simplification plan is part of Delta's goal to slash annual 
operating costs by approximately $2 billion by June, 1997, in order to compete 
with lower-cost carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta recently reported a loss for the fiscal third quarter ended April 29 of 
$77.9 million, or $2.10 a share, on revenue of $2.94 billion. This loss was 
narrowed from the year-earlier quarter, when it had a loss of $152.3 million, 
or $3.61 a share, on revenue of $2.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen also said Delta expects to revamp its short-haul operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be some changes in the way we serve the short-haul. . . . 
We may wind up with what appears to be a separate kind of branded product in 
the short-haul market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta said in April that it would not form a separate short-haul unit and 
instead would cut costs throughout the airline.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Delta is closely examining short-haul operations and wants to 
increase plane utilization and may also revamp service on those flights, Allen 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ACME HOLDINGS' CHAIRMAN RESIGNS FROM FIRM, BOARD 
</P>

<P>
 After posting nearly $16 million in losses in 15 months, Acme Holdings Inc., a 
national equipment rental company, said Wednesday that longtime Chairman and 
Chief Executive Ira N. Mendelsohn has resigned from the company and its board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been replaced by Martin Reid, formerly chief executive of Tuboscope 
Vetco International Corp. Reid remains chairman of Tuboscope, a Texas oil 
services company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Wednesday, Mendelsohn said he is leaving to pursue other 
interests.  
</P>
<P>
 William M. Barnum, an Acme director and general partner of Brentwood 
Associates -- the Los Angeles investment firm that is a major Acme shareholder 
-- said the company's financial performance over the past 12 months, during 
which Mendelsohn was at the helm, "has been very disappointing." He said the 
company is "grateful" to Mendelsohn for his work over the past eight years but 
credited Acme President John Jastrem for making "significant progress" in 
improving operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jastrem joined the company as a vice president in August and was appointed 
president in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Acme, based in Irvine, reported a loss of $14.1 million for 1993, compared to 
a $1.1-million loss for 1992. The company's 1993 revenue of $63.5 million was 
down 7% from $68.6 million for the previous 12 months. For the first quarter 
this year, the company posted a $1.8-million loss on $16.7 million in revenue, 
compared to a loss of $992,000 on revenue of $15.3 million for the same period 
in 1993.

MUSICSOURCE U.S.A. SUES OVER ALLEGED STOCK SCAM; COURTS: NEWPORT SHEET MUSIC 
RETAILER SAYS IT LOST MILLIONS WHEN NEW YORK INVESTMENT FIRM DUMPED 1.6 MILLION 
SHARES ON MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange County company that makes computerized retail kiosks for dispensing 
sheet music is suing a New York investment company and several law firms and 
individuals over what it alleges was a massive stock swindle that cost it and 
its investors millions of dollars in seed money. 
</P>
<P>
 MusicSource U.S.A. Inc., based in Newport Beach, alleges in its lawsuits that 
investment firm Marsh Block & Co. participated in a scheme to defraud it of 1.6 
million shares, or slightly more than half its total stock. The shares 
subsequently were dumped onto the market, the suits allege, causing the value 
to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey S. Benice, whose Irvine law firm is handling the case, said what 
happened to MusicSource "is an example of what regularly goes on" in the 
so-called small-cap market, where start-up companies hungry for working capital 
generally go to look for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 One suit seeks $5 million in damages for MusicSource. A second, class-action 
suit seeks up to $8 million on behalf of individual investors whose stock 
plummeted because of the dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion filed earlier this week, MusicSource asked U.S. District Judge 
Alicemarie Stottler to declare that Marsh Block principal Kenneth Marsh 
illegally took the stock from an escrow account and helped dump more than 1 
million of MusicSource's common shares on the market from December through 
early February. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive selloff caused the price of MusicSource's shares to plummet from 
$2 a share to just 30 cents, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dumping that much stock has caused serious problems for MusicSource," said 
Anton Rosandic, one of the company's lawyers. "It has been hard for them to 
find new investors because people see what happened to the stock prices and 
think they are poor managers." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh Block, which has two offices and 15 brokers, has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of MusicSource, which went public at $5 in February, 1993, had dropped 
to as low as 19 cents by this February, Rosandic said. In Wednesday's trading 
on the Nasdaq market, the stock closed at 37.5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Stottler is considering a motion for a so-called summary judgment against 
Marsh Block and Kenneth Marsh and has not said when she expects to issue a 
ruling. Actions against the other defendants will be pursued in the original 
suit, filed in February and awaiting a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 In that suit, MusicSource seeks $5 million in actual damages and unspecified 
punitive damages against 16 defendants -- everyone who participated in the 
complicated private stock issue that Marsh Block allegedly helped arrange. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's suit and the class action filed last month in the federal 
court's Santa Ana office allege that Marsh Block persuaded MusicSource to raise 
working capital in November by issuing 1.6 million shares of its common stock 
to a new company called M&M Investments for $1.44 million cash -- 90 cents a 
share -- and a variety of management and financial consulting services. The 
stock was trading at about $2 a share at the time, according to the suits. M&M 
was formed to help execute a stock scam, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiable share certificates were placed in an escrow account handled by 
Kenneth Marsh, who was not to release the shares to M&M until the cash was 
received by MusicSource, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 But MusicSource alleges that Marsh, who also was a principal of M&M, violated 
the written escrow instructions and transferred the shares to M&M, which 
immediately sold most of them on the open market at steeply discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 M&M subsequently denied selling the shares, and a principal of the investment 
company attempted in December to call a special meeting of MusicSource 
shareholders and M&M to use the 1.6-million-share block of stock to vote 
MusicSource chairman Dale Jacobs out of office, the suit alleges. The company's 
other directors blocked the move, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they'd been able to oust the regular management and taken over the 
company," Benice said, "the entire scam could have been camouflaged."

 CareLine Inc.: The ambulance service company said Wednesday that it has 
completed the acquisition of Thousand Oaks-based Pruner Health Services Inc. 
The acquisition, which was previously announced, establishes Irvine-based 
CareLine in all five counties in the Los Angeles Basin. Separately, CareLine 
also announced that it has signed a $75-million credit agreement with the First 
National Bank of Boston. This line of credit more than doubles CareLine's 
current amount of credit, and it will be used to finance acquisitions and as 
working capital, the company said.

 A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life. -- Oscar Wilde 
</P>
<P>
 Who Buys Ties: About 60% to 65% of ties are purchased by women, according to 
the Neckwear Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Tie Trivia: Silk represents more than 40% of the market. Polyester, wools and 
wool blends are common. Acetate, rayon, nylon, cotton, linen and ramie are 
sometimes used. 
</P>
<P>
 To pamper your tie:  
</P>
<P>
 * Always hang it up after use to remove wrinkles. The exception: knit ties, 
which should be rolled up and stored in a drawer to prevent stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dry clean it once a year, or as needed for staining. Make sure the dry 
cleaner has the special equipment needed for ties. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you get a spill on a silk tie, don't try to rub it out with water or soda 
water. Just blot with a damp paper or cloth.

NOVELTY SAVES THE TIES THAT BIND; CLOTHING: NECKWEAR WITH PIZAZZ BOOSTS THE 
MARKET FOR THE ACCESSORY THAT WON'T GO AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They're basically useless. Occasionally uncomfortable. But even in this 
oh-so-casual age, men aren't giving up their ties -- they're flaunting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an invasion of informality and the easing of dress codes in many 
offices, the $1.4-billion tie business has been shaking off its doldrums and 
perking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being left in the closet, ties are stepping out with new pizazz. 
Neckwear of the 1990s sports motifs from Mickey Mouse to moon rocks, endangered 
wildlife to rock star art. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the splash from novelty ties, tie makers -- even such upscale 
companies as Hermes -- are bringing out neckwear for casual clothes and 
updating classic stripes and dots. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty ties "were a wake-up call to the business," said Tempe Essell, senior 
buyer for the department stores of Dayton Hudson Corp. "It made everyone in the 
industry realize there was a lack of freshness in ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the advent of novelty neckwear, the nation's more than 200 tie makers 
had reason to cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were still a popular gift at Christmas and Father's Day, ties 
were becoming a less common sight. Dressing casually on Fridays has become 
popular in some offices. Store buyers said pricey designer ties snapped up in 
the 1980s fell out of favor in this more frugal decade. Particularly among 
younger men, it's become trendy to wear a shirt buttoned to the neck without a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, tie sales were flat during the late 1980s, according to the 
Neckwear Assn. of America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the World Wildlife Fund, with pandas, tigers and more. The conservation 
group's ties depicting endangered species set off a national boom in novelty 
ties, especially those that contribute to causes. Today, ties that help others 
are among the biggest selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I travel a lot, and I can't remember the last time I was on a plane and 
didn't see a man wearing one of our ties," said Ann McClellan, marketing 
director for the international conservation group. "Even more than the 
revenues, it's a wonderful way to get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sensations have been ties by designer Nicole Miller, featuring sports 
and other motifs, and neckwear by Jerry Garcia. Ties based on the abstract 
watercolors of the guitarist from the Grateful Dead rock band have reaped $30 
million in retail sales since their introduction in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonehenge Ltd., the company that introduced Garcia's ties, has since turned 
out abstract, multicolor ties based on the molecular structures of vitamins and 
moon rocks. The company is also negotiating for a license to make Ben & Jerry's 
ice cream ties and plans designs to benefit Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, cartoon ties with Disney, Peanuts and other characters 
have also been big sellers. So have ties based on Beatles songs. Ties with 
pictures of Big Macs and other McDonald's fare are sold, not at the restaurants 
but in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers have taken advantage of every new fad in recent years. So dinosaur 
ties were big last year, after the release of the film "Jurassic Park." Soccer 
ties are in the stores now for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the novelty in novelty ties has already worn off. Sales have 
slipped from about 35% of tie sales to 10%, said Elena Hart, neckwear reporter 
for the Daily News Record, the largest U.S. men's fashion trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with tie sales boosted by about 10% overall since the appearance of 
novelty ties, the industry hopes to keep its momentum. Buyers are now setting 
their sights on updates of classics and knit, textured or other casual ties 
aimed at the sportswear market. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where the tie's future is going, few predict its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules of dressing have eased, but I don't think that means the death of 
the tie," said Michael Solomon, a senior editor at Esquire magazine and author 
of a book on ties and shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing redeeming about them, but we can't live without them."

HOW FABRIC BECOMES A HANG-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tie-making is an exact science: 
</P>
<P>
 * The main part of the tie, the outer fabric, is cut "on the bias," or at a 
45-degree angle. That is crucial to giving the tie the resilience to recover 
from knotting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outer fabric is sewn into two or three pieces so the seams will be hidden in 
the neckband of the shirt, and the ends are hemmed. 
</P>
<P>
 * A piece of silk, nylon, rayon or polyester called facing or tipping is added 
to the back of both ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * The seams and tips are pressed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tie's lining is also cut on the bias. How a tie hangs on the wearer and 
retains its shape is largely determined by its lining. Lightweight ties need 
heavier lining. 
</P>
<P>
 * The lining is slip-stitched to the outer shell. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tie is turned right-side out, a piece of cardboard is inserted and the 
tie is pressed on the reverse side, so that the edges aren't flat but rolled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Labels are sewn on. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bar tack stitch is made with heavy yarn to fasten seam ends and add a 
finishing touch.

CROATS' NECKWEAR IN WAR IS CLOSELY TIED WITH TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in ancient times, man embellished his neck and chest with beads, bangles 
and stones. The ancestor to the modern tie appeared only about 350 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion that was to sweep Europe came from silk neck scarves of Croat 
soldiers in the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) between Sweden and France and the 
Hapsburg Empire, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Croats visited Paris, the city and later the continent fell in love 
with their cravats, a scarf tied in a bow with loose ends. The term is thought 
to come from the Croatian name for the tie, or perhaps the word Croat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In just a few decades, the cravat took on such importance that James II of 
England spent 36 pounds on neckwear for his coronation, a sum that could have 
purchased a considerable country estate at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this time, peasants and soldiers probably used scarfs to soak up sweat 
or cushion armor. Beginning in the 1500s, higher-class men had also revered 
collars and ruffs, partly because other male frills had fallen out of favor. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cravat firmly in fashion, a second forerunner to the necktie appeared 
in the 18th Century. The stock, which fastened at the back of the neck, also 
derived from military dress, this time from high, stiff collars for soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 As collars diminished in size and grew looser, the modern necktie evolved.

STRAIGHT LACE; FROM BUSINESS SUIT TO PARTY DRESS TO TEE, ACCENT IS ON A LITTLE 
BIT OF ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like no other material, a wisp of lace can stir romantic feelings and memories 
of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 Lace recalls the days of the early 1900s, when women wore lace all over: on 
the fronts and high collars of their blouses, encircling the bodices of their 
dresses and bordering the hems of their petticoats. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 20th Century ends, women have once again taken up lace, but they're 
wearing it in a much different fashion than their grandmothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma would have blushed to the collar of her lace blouse if she could see 
today's sexy lace bodysuits or short all-lace cocktail dresses. Lace camisoles 
(underwear to Grandma) have become acceptable as outerwear and can be seen 
peeking out from women's cocktail or business suits. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer is lace reserved for mostly formal affairs. Now it's all over casual 
wear. Lacy undershirts and T-shirts are being worn with blue jeans and 
overalls. Lace vests go with all kinds of denim or leggings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when women dress up, they return to lace. Some want gowns and party 
dresses covered with the stuff, while others choose evening wear with just a 
bit of lace trim. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to evening wear, lace is to Jessica McClintock what bugle beads 
are to Bob Mackie. The San Francisco-based designer has made lace her favorite 
medium. She's been adding lace to her special occasion dresses since the 1960s. 
Hillary Clinton wore one of McClintock's lacy granny dresses when she married 
Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every designer gets associated with one fabric or another. With me, it's 
lace," McClintock says. "I love using lace . . . . It's a very interesting 
fabric. It has all kinds of shadows and texture and surface interest." 
</P>
<P>
 To McClintock, a little lace goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 The designs in her current collection often feature just a few inches of lacy 
trim. There's a group of floaty chiffon dresses inspired by the 1930s with 
elaborate lace collars (about $150) and short or long column dresses with lace 
accenting their fronts and backs ($150 to $240), available at the Jessica 
McClintock boutique in Crystal Court, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock prefers using a small amount of expensive lace instead of yards of 
the cheap stuff. She'll use a heavily embellished European lace that runs $30 
to $40 a yard as a trim around necklines and hems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lace is not an easy fabric to work with," she says. "I've seen many uses of 
lace that are poorly engineered. It looks sloppy and messy . . . . You have to 
know how to get the right look out of very little lace." 
</P>
<P>
 Other designers have found all kinds of uses for lace. At Rose Ledonne in 
Laguna Niguel, vests, bodysuits, baby-doll dresses, camisoles, T-shirts and 
even shoes have all been treated with lace by inventive designers. 
</P>
<P>
 A new staple in a woman's wardrobe is an all-over lace bodysuit such as the 
short- or long-sleeved styles by Bisou-Bisou that come in assorted colors, 
including taupe, navy, black or white ($66). They go with everything from jeans 
to evening jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're lined in front and sheer in back," says Rose Ledonne, boutique owner. 
"A lot of women are wearing them under suits instead of wearing blouses. 
They're not so bulky, and it's not inappropriate if it shows just a touch of 
lace. Of course, you don't take the jacket off." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer lace vests, one by Kokoon adorned with abalone buttons ($68), can mix 
with casual or formal attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lace is a real novelty. People are looking for something special to spend 
their money on," Ledonne says. "If a plain T-shirt has a little lace trim, they 
want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a desire for romance, for times gone by. Some say the popularity of 
lace in the 1990s is a rebellion against all of the mannish styles for women. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you wear something with lace you feel feminine and sexy," says Marcela 
Cavaglieri, co-owner of Julietta's in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Julietta's carries sheer dresses by Fiore made entirely of lace that come in 
off-white, burgundy, dark green, black or cocoa, with rosebud buttons for a 
romantic touch ($69). They can be worn over a cat suit or Julietta's crinkled 
rayon slip with a lace hem and touch of lace at the neck ($39). There are also 
sheer lace skirts and lace tank tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Lace should be worn in moderation; too much lace can make one look like a 
walking doily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mix lace with contemporary knits. If you do everything in lace it's too 
much," says Liz Menzies, owner of Swept Away in Irvine. "We're not real 
frilly." 
</P>
<P>
 Swept Away has casual separates embellished with lace, including lace socks, 
undershirts, slips and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lace camisoles, some with authentic Victorian appliques, ($5 to $48) can go 
under V-neck sweaters. Lace T-shirts ($45) are being worn with apron dresses, 
denim skirts or palazzos. Slips with lace on the neck and hem ($40 to $70) are 
worn under dresses for a "peekaboo effect," Menzies says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women like having a little something show underneath something else. The 
layers have to be sheer and light. You can't have anything too heavy," Menzies 
says. "That's why lace is popular."

FIRST PERSON: PRECIOUS WORDS OF LIFE: 'WE HAVE A HEART FOR YOU'; HIS 
BROTHER-IN-LAW HAD TO OVERCOME A MORASS OF BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE, BUT HE 
BEAT THE ODDS FOR A SECOND CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is how the dead come back to life. It's 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Day, when 
the phone jars you from sleep. A voice on the other end tries to be calm, but 
the message is stunning: 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy New Year. We have a heart for you. Get down here quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, Richard Evans, 43, will receive the heart of a 26-year-old 
Phoenix man who died earlier that night. Weeks later, he'll be riding a bike 
and taking long walks, feeling 20 years younger. Once a cardiac cripple with 
only months to live, he's suddenly glowing with health. 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, it's a perfect Hollywood ending: Man needs heart. Man gets 
heart. Zoom in on the happy family, pan the desert sunrise and fade to black. 
</P>
<P>
 If only life were that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "This transplant won't guarantee me five years, 10 years or 30 years," says 
Richie, my brother-in-law. "It's just buying me time until doctors find a way 
to prolong my life with certainty. Until then, these are the cards I've been 
dealt." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a common story in the United States, where about 2,000 donor hearts 
become available for transplant each year. With Space-Age technology and 
delicate precision, doctors at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center 
in Tucson have given Richie a miraculous gift -- a second shot at life. 
</P>
<P>
 But lots of other folks aren't as lucky. The story of how Richie got his heart 
raises troubling questions about the 34 million Americans who don't have health 
insurance. It also shines light on a little-understood surgical procedure that 
is rapidly becoming commonplace in some U.S. hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, most folks think of heart transplants as instant wonders. Doctors 
work their magic and bingo, you're back in business. We don't hear about the 
medical complications that haunt patients, such as diabetes, and kidney and 
liver failure. We don't talk about anti-rejection drugs that can trigger 
bizarre mood swings. Or fears that a new heart might suddenly break down. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this changes you," Richie says. "And it happens so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The events are still a blur to me. Last July, I rush to my brother-in-law's 
side when he suffers a massive heart attack. His father died of heart failure 
at 68, and Richie inherited the family's high and deadly cholesterol counts. He 
had triple bypass surgery at 28 and his heart has been deteriorating since. 
</P>
<P>
 On a dry, windy night, I find him clinging to life in Scottsdale Memorial 
Hospital with the aid of a heart pump. Doctors later whisk him in a 
life-support ambulance down to the University Heart Center in Tucson, where the 
verdict is unanimous: Richie's only hope is to get a new heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's like telling a drowning man to find dry land. Like so many other 
Americans with a pre-existing condition, Richie has little or no health 
insurance. There's no way he can possibly come up with the $60,000 cash down 
payment the university demands for the intricate surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he turns, the deck is stacked against him: Richie's auto collision 
assessment business has taken a dive. If he tries to get health insurance, 
carriers who refused to cover him in the past certainly won't do so now. 
Meanwhile, he has little hope of getting covered by Arizona's version of 
Medicaid. You have to be virtually dirt-poor to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 With neither cash nor coverage, Richie won't be put on a national list of 
patients waiting for donated hearts. And without the heart, he's a dead man. 
How long can he hold on? Five weeks? Five months? No one knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money thing hurts more than the fact I need a new heart," he said 
bitterly at the time. "I mean, I've worked all my life. I've paid my taxes. I'm 
a middle-class man, right? And now I'm the one who takes it in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
 He's always been an athletic, resilient guy. The kind of weekend linebacker 
who shrugs off pain and comes back for more. If something bothers him, he clams 
up. His wife, Marcia, grumbles that he's the king of denial. 
</P>
<P>
 But not now. Richie's hit rock bottom -- and his rebirth has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a health care message for Bill and Hillary: It's the bureaucracy, 
stupid. Cut the red tape and you're halfway home. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, his life hanging by a thread, Richie realizes that his only shot is 
to apply for Medicaid. Social workers have told him that his previous income 
may disqualify him, but there's a slim chance he might become eligible for a 
second federal program known as Supplemental Security Income (SSI). 
</P>
<P>
 That's important, because under Arizona law, patients who qualify for SSI 
automatically get Medicaid. With that guarantee, Richie could pay for his new 
heart. As he begins filling out endless forms, it appears he may also be 
eligible for disability aid from a third program called Social Security 
Disability Income (SSDI). It seems too good to be true -- and it is. 
</P>
<P>
 We discover an ominous Catch-22: Under federal law, SSI recipients lose 
coverage if their monthly income is more than the paltry sum of $434. The 
government calculates that Richie qualifies for a mandatory disability check of 
$683 a month, based on years of employment and paying taxes. That's more than 
enough to kick him off SSI and Medicaid. Never mind that he's dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Could he simply decline the federal disability check or give back a portion of 
it? Impossible, say bureaucrats in Phoenix and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York, my wife has been working the phones for her brother, trying 
to find a way out of this mess. In four weeks, she's become an expert in 
disability programs, filling up notebooks with phone numbers and financial 
calculations. It's not looking good, but then Richie gets a huge break. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care officials in Washington eventually reveal that an obscure program 
would let him cut his disability check by paying for job training and re-entry 
skills. Known as PASS -- or Program to Achieve Self-Sufficiency -- the program 
allows participants to subtract these costs from monthly disability checks. 
Thus, by starting an approved rehabilitation plan, they can get under the $434 
SSI limit and stay on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of disabled Americans face the same dilemma as Richie, it turns out, 
yet many don't know about this financial solution. Indeed, some Arizona health 
care bureaucrats tell us they've never even heard of the PASS program. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington officials praise PASS, but they're also concerned about program 
abuses in some states. Meanwhile, we wonder: How many lives have been lost? 
</P>
<P>
 For Richie, the money hurdle has been cleared. Now the hard part begins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine being so dependent on a beeper that your knees shake when it goes off. 
That's how Richie feels after doctors put him on the transplant list. If the 
beeper sounds, they tell him, there's a new heart waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time it goes off, it's September," Richie recalls. "I'm in my car 
and I hear it ringing. I just can't believe it. I start to wobble. So then I 
call the number shown on the beeper -- and it's a wrong number ." 
</P>
<P>
 The gods are against him. Doctors tell Richie to stay healthy so he won't be 
passed over if a heart is found. He promptly comes down with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, however, he creeps up the transplant list. Surgeons rank recipients 
based on their condition and the hearts that become available. There's no 
guarantee that the right one will be found to match a patient's tissue, blood 
type and heart size. Some people wait months -- even years -- in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Richie meets lots of them in October at a support group held by the New Heart 
Society of Phoenix. It's an active organization run by and for heart 
recipients, led by businessmen James Fleming and B.G. (Reb) Proffit. Members 
offer financial support to transplant families and are raising funds to build a 
residence for them near the University Heart Center in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, they try to boost national awareness about organ-donor issues. 
Each year, more than 30,000 Americans need new hearts, but only 2,000 or so 
become available, says Dr. Jack G. Copeland, a world-renowned heart transplant 
surgeon and co-director of the Tucson center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a well-understood subject," he says of organ donation. "Unless 
you have training in this at the time of a tragedy in your family, you're 
liable to react in a way that many people do, and that's to say: 'Nothing more 
is going to happen to this (dead) person. Enough has happened to them already.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 By November, Richie banishes gloomy thoughts and looks forward to the 
approaching holiday season. Holidays mean drinking, driving and mayhem. He 
doesn't wish tragedy on anyone. But if people die in sudden accidents, their 
organs might save another's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Like clockwork, it happens on Thanksgiving and Christmas for two men in his 
support group. Now, Richie is No. 1 on the list. He and his wife dine at 5 p.m. 
on New Year's Eve, then go to bed early. So does his family in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had this feeling ," Marcia says. "I knew we'd be called." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the call finally comes, they don't give you details. All you know is that 
someone has died hours before and that your new heart is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Richie and Marcia climb into their car on a cool, refreshing night and calmly 
drive the 118 miles to Tucson. It turns out the organ is a perfect match, and 
doctors rush my brother-in-law into transplant surgery several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 a.m. in New York, our phone rings and it's Marcia, her flat, steady 
voice fighting off emotion: "We're in Tucson. It's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 There's not much to do except act like zombies. My wife, eight months 
pregnant, decides we should walk, so we shuffle silently through the streets. 
Richie's mother, who is spending the holidays with us, joins the vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 As we hold our breath, doctors give my brother-in-law his second life. The 
operation goes well and although hurdles remain, the situation looks good. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, Richie shows us what people go through after 
transplants: Frustrating pain. More than 60 pills every 24 hours. Fears that 
his new life will be distorted by powerful anti-rejection drugs and medical 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, like magic, he's released after 12 days. Richie begins to feel strength 
he hasn't felt in years. He can cross the street without that awful pounding in 
his chest. Marcia says his eyes are open in a way she has never seen, his face 
pink from newly circulating oxygen. He can chase a golf ball down a ravine, and 
when he falls playing tennis, he gets up unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 How long will he live? At the Arizona center, the one-year survival rate is 
93%; the five-year rate is 80% and 70% reach 8.5-years, Copeland says. Richie 
is a good candidate for that and more because of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Copeland adds, doctors hope to increase survival with 
artificial or animal hearts. Meanwhile, quality of life is a key concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know what pain is until you live without it," Richie tells me when 
I visit him. We meet in the busy Phoenix airport terminal, and I'm startled to 
see that he's walking faster than I am. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I'm back from the dead," he adds. "It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 So are the personal changes. For much of his life, Richie has been a quiet, 
private man. But now, he wants to give back some of what was given to him. He's 
become a vice president of the New Heart Society and helped organize a golf 
tournament and charity auction that raised nearly $74,000 this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, I gave him a good-luck charm. It was a baseball signed by pitching 
legend Tom Seaver, and my brother-in-law held onto that horsehide for dear 
life. Now, as I'm packing up to return home, he saunters over and flips the 
ball back to me. Like a 20-game winner who's found the groove again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be needing this anymore," he explains. "I'm back in control." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he tosses me another ball, this one inscribed to my newborn daughter. The 
message is for her but applies no less to the man who wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's signed "Uncle Richie" and reads simply: "Welcome to the World."

FIRST PERSON: KIDS' OPTIMISM, FAITH TURN THE WORLD INTO MAGICAL PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 When she grows up, Kate will be a veterinarian. She'll move out of state to 
study veterinary medicine in Colorado (there is no vet school here in New 
Mexico), then live in a house by a lake ringed by mountains and raise two 
children and many pets. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a husband, no doubt, but she's vague about the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks shy of her eighth birthday, my daughter has an idyllic life mapped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 With the miraculous lucidity of the young, she's planned for every 
contingency. She knows, for example, that she'll have to work hard at science 
and math so she can get into vet school. She's already steeling herself against 
the trauma of performing surgery or euthanizing a pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad when you have to put a pet to sleep," she explains. "But sometimes 
it's the kind thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kate has somehow acquired the conviction that if she plans carefully and 
thinks everything through, life will work out. 
</P>
<P>
 That comes from her parents, I suppose. My wife and I try to explain how 
things work, helping her to see basic principles and stressing the need to make 
wise choices. It's only natural that she would come to equate planning with 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I get older, the world seems to make less sense than it did when I was 
a kid, and I'm painfully conscious of all the things that, plan as I might, I 
can't control. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can look at the endless, unspeakable suffering of Rwanda (or Bosnia or 
Somalia) and not worry about humanity's seeming tendency to seek the shortest 
route to its doom? 
</P>
<P>
 What about North Korea, global deforestation, unparalleled extinctions of 
plants and animals, AIDS, overpopulation, famine and political violence? 
</P>
<P>
 Here in America we tolerate violence against women and an aimless cruelty in 
our public life. Meanwhile, corporations invade our lives with new technology 
that alienates us from one another and from ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bleak vision of our world and its future -- and it seems so much beyond 
any individual's ability to change. 
</P>
<P>
 It's painful to be a parent when the future looks hopeless. We want to shelter 
our children from every one of life's traumas, but sometimes it seems as if we 
can't really protect them from much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other kids her age, Kate is growing aware of the world's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the child of journalists, she's subjected to an extra dose of doom and 
gloom, because no catastrophe or policy question goes unmentioned in our house. 
</P>
<P>
 She's deeply sensitive to others' pain, with a remarkable ability to 
comprehend some injustice or world problem in personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago, during the D-day anniversary commemoration, she wanted 
to know all about World War II. Later, she told me that if she has sons, she 
hopes they won't have to go off to fight in a war. 
</P>
<P>
 At moments like this, my heart aches for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite it all, she's a happy kid who is boundlessly confident of her ability 
to carve out a fulfilling future. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it has to do with her belief in the magical. She sees signs and 
portents in everyday life, and when enough good omens are in alignment, she can 
scarcely contain herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, after a great day at school, a special meal and her favorite TV 
show, Kate will hug herself and announce, "Today is the best day of my life!" 
And she means it. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect most of us knew such happiness and optimism once. We had that naive, 
beautiful belief that all problems could be solved and everything would work 
out. But somewhere along the way, pessimism started to look more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're lucky, we come to see that such world-weary realism becomes a trap 
when it blinds us to the possibilities inherent in even the worst of 
situations. It's that unexpected turn of events -- call it magic -- that 
transforms a disaster into something new and better. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years as a political prisoner before becoming 
his nation's president, whether he believes in miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate knows this intuitively. Because she sees everything as fresh and full of 
wonder, she teaches me to practice that kind of vision in my own life. 
</P>
<P>
 So like any parent, I wish her happiness, security and the love of good 
people, but most of all I wish for her to keep her special knowledge of life's 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that I need worry. For Kate, the future's practically a foregone 
conclusion. She's already picked out which pieces of our furniture she'll 
appropriate for her lakeside hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
 And in those moments when I furrow my brow and ask how she can be so sure of 
herself, she fixes me with one of those looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust me, Dad," she says. "Kids know these things."

BY DESIGN; ONE COLORFUL CHARACTER; THE UNIFORMS OF MEXICO'S GOALIE ARE BOLD AND 
FLASHY BY DESIGN -- HIS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The man has a style all his own. And it almost kept him from playing in the 
'94 World Cup soccer tournament, which begins Friday in Los Angeles and eight 
other U.S. cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Campos, 27, of Mexico, is perhaps the most instantly recognizable 
goalkeeper in the world, not only for his prowess in the nets but also for his 
manner of dress. 
</P>
<P>
 In soccer, only goalkeepers may use their hands. Because of that rule, they 
wear uniforms of a different color, making it easier for referees to spot them 
in the often crowded and chaotic goal area. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most nearsighted ref couldn't miss Campos in the outfits he 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his line of color-charged goalkeeper apparel is that purple outfit, the 
one with the zigzaggy green, red and yellow horizontal stripes decorating 
shorts and jersey. (The turned-up collar with surfer embroidered on the back is 
a nice touch -- a reference to Campos' wave-riding days back home.) 
</P>
<P>
 And that yellow outfit -- the one with the purple and green and pink diamonds 
scattered about -- has caused more than a few opposing strikers to pause in 
their headlong rush toward the goal and wonder just what it is they're facing. 
</P>
<P>
 Its counterpart is a fluorescent pink creation, also dotted with diamond-like 
patterns and emblazoned with a word or two. Sometimes he incorporates Mexico 
into a design. Other times, Acapulco appears on a sleeve or collar. Most often, 
he uses J. Campos, with a stylized JC logo and his signature on the right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos' fondness for bold colors and dynamic graphics has made him a favorite 
of the Mexico team's younger fans, who also admire his fearlessness -- some 
call it recklessness -- in wandering far out of goal to thwart opponents' 
attacks. (He'll go to work against Norway on Sunday in Washington, D.C.) 
</P>
<P>
 Campos says his inspiration for the designs are the sand, sea and sun of 
Acapulco, where he grew up with seven brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 A "child of the ocean" is what the French soccer magazine Onze called him 
earlier this year, and it is true that Campos owes much of his identity to the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a beach guy," he said recently. "I grew up cradled by the sea, the waves 
and the rhythm of the surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the bright clothes of the international surfing set. "I was 
dazzled by their brilliant outfits," Campos said. "Those colors are my roots. 
They form part of my history, my personality." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Campos played beach soccer almost constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were very tired, we threw the ball in the water and went surfing," he 
said. "It's an extraordinary sensation, almost sensual." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The time spent running on the sand and riding the waves proved useful in 
Campos' goal-keeping career. When he went to play professionally for the Pumas 
of UNAM (Universidad Autonoma de Mexico) in Mexico City, Campos' body 
remembered the lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sand taught me endurance and reflexes," he said. "Surfing taught me 
balance and elasticity." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his success in soccer, Campos wanted to pursue sidelines. He began to 
design his uniforms, which were initially manufactured in Acapulco by a company 
called Sport. His Surfer label was thus born about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Campos signed a contract with Nike, the U.S. company, to produce 
his designs. Then came trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Mexican Soccer Federation signed a $450,000 contract with 
Umbro, an English company, under which Mexico's national team players would 
wear only Umbro uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos balked at the idea and refused to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Federation officials threatened to throw Campos off the team and deny him the 
chance to play in the World Cup, every soccer player's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He still refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the federation backed down and a compromise was reached. Although 
details of the settlement were not revealed, Campos will be playing in uniforms 
of his own design in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So the 1994 World Cup will see the sometime surfer, sometime soccer star, 
sometime fashion designer at his brilliant best, the most colorful character on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a modern original, a player who anticipates the evolution of the game," 
said Bora Milutinovic, coach of the U.S. World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has fantastic intuition," said Miguel Mejia Baron, coach of Mexico's World 
Cup team. "He is always happy. His charisma is extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Just like his designs.

BY DESIGN; ABOVE BOARD; GEAR: SURE, SURFING TRUNKS BY KATIN HAVE CHANGED. BUT 
SOME THINGS HAVE REMAINED THE SAME -- INCLUDING PURISTS' LOVE FOR THE SHORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The original Kanvas by Katin surf trunks were heavy when wet, took hours to 
dry and sometimes caused an irritating rash in a rather delicate area. But they 
had the virtue of being indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a seam blew out after years of wear, Katin covered repairs with a 
lifetime guarantee. Local surfers had only to cross the sand to the inland 
shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway in Surfside, wrap on a towel, peel off their 
trunks and wait for a seamstress to stitch them up. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunks may have changed over the last 30 years, but they remain a favorite 
of the sport's purists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '50s, function, not fashion, drove design. The knee-length Katins 
had to be loose enough for easy movement -- not by today's oversized standards, 
but by those of '50s and '60s, when men's swimsuits resembled hot pants. And 
the fly was secured with the super-industrial snaps used for boat covers, 
except for the lace-up model, which featured 11 eyelets. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunks' creators, "Captain" Walter Katin and his wife, Nancy, were in the 
business of making and selling boat covers in their Surfside shop, on the coast 
between Huntington Beach and Seal Beach. One day, a surfer requested a pair of 
trunks cut from canvas. It was 1958. By the time Hang Ten and Birdwell, among 
others, began doing similar trunks a few years later, Kanvas by Katin had 
established a loyal following. 
</P>
<P>
 Seamstress Sato Hughes, who had been with the Katins since she and her 
4-year-old son, Glenn, immigrated from Japan in the mid-'50s, trained the 
ever-changing crew of Japanese women hired to make trunks. But regulars 
increasingly requested Sato's handiwork, no matter how long it might take her 
to fill their orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Katin board shorts became synonymous with surfing," says Duke Edukas, owner 
of Surfside Sports in Newport Beach, who bought his first of many Katins in 
1970. "Sato was part of that. Everybody knew her." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls the "positive vibe" of the shop: "Even as a teen-ager I could tell. 
. . . Glenn's mom was a part of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that the Katins, who had no children of their own, spent holidays 
with Sato and her son. Glenn went to work when his mom couldn't get a sitter. 
When Nancy Katin died of emphysema complications in 1986 (Walter died in 1967), 
she bequeathed the business and the quarter-acre of prime real estate it sits 
on to her longtime employee and friend.  
</P>
<P>
 A nice ending? 
</P>
<P>
 Almost. "I begged Nancy not to leave it to me," Sato recalls. "I'm not a 
businesswoman." 
</P>
<P>
 The surfwear industry was peaking at the time, with kids even in Oklahoma 
striving for dude appeal. But Kanvas by Katin was wiping out, sinking deeper 
into the red. Nancy Katin had resisted not only mass production, fearing it 
would undermine quality, but also product changes. Nylon had failed as a 
lightweight substitute for canvas when the company first tested it in 1964, 
and, despite improvements, Katin would not reconsider it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sato, left with an unwelcome promotion, brought in her son to help. Initially, 
the partnership proved rocky. "Her favorite saying was: 'We never did that 
before,' Glenn recalls. Eventually, though, she went along with his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn reinvented the 3,000-square-foot shop, creating the Katin Superstore and 
putting the books back in the black within a year. The front room, previously 
housing only a counter and a couch, was stocked with surf accessories, sandals 
and clothes by local designers. Former storage rooms became showrooms for 
boards and wet suits. A production and storage area remained, as did a mini 
kitchen and shower. (The latter, apparently, is a must in all true surf 
stores). 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant change came in 1990, with the decision to mass produce 
and distribute. For years, the Hugheses had refused buyout and investment 
offers from industry big guns. Instead, they chose to go with the owners of a 
then-fledgling snowboard apparel line based in Newport Beach -- Rick Lohr, Bill 
Sharp and Mike Snyder of Burning Snow. Glenn knew Sharp from his former job as 
editor of Surfing magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration had its conditions. Sato retained final say on production. 
"I told them to pay a little more for fabric if they have to, to keep the 
quality," she says. And there was the daunting task of finding contractors that 
would honor the lifetime guarantee on seams. 
</P>
<P>
 More changes followed, including the pattern, which hadn't been altered in 32 
years. Supplex nylon finally replaced the canvas, and the signature snap fly 
was ousted by Velcro -- once Sato found a quality Velcro strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The wholesale division, Katin USA, evolved into a full clothing collection, 
with shorts, pants, camp shirts and jackets. Finally, the logo was tweaked, 
with a single K where Kanvas by Katin used to be. That's it, Sharp quickly 
adds. "It's sacrilegious to mess too much with such an icon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some customers still ask for the old label patch (available on 
request), and orders for custom canvas trunks continue nonstop. Sato, 65, still 
personally fills such requests ("I like to see the customer happy about the 
fit, so I need to be here"), although at her son's insistence she works only 
five days a week, not six. She threatened to fire him for that, she says with a 
mischievous smile.  
</P>
<P>
 Special requests, which can cost one-third more than off-the-rack styles 
priced at $30 to $40, come in all sizes, from a 56 1/2-inch waist to a matching 
set for a newborn and his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Although longtime clients bring their sons and grandsons to the store, Katin 
is not a preserve for old-timers. "It's the younger clientele who want this 
stuff," says Surfside Sports' Edukas. "It's considered core gear."

GROWING UP IN TINSELTOWN CREATES FICTION ON THE FRINGE; AUTHOR: CRAIG NOVA LEFT 
HOLLYWOOD'S DARK DANGER FOR THE LUSH GREENERY OF VERMONT. BUT L.A. KEPT GNAWING 
AWAY AT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This could be among the last places in America where a shopper can find a fine 
selection of dresses made from Indian bedspreads. The general store sells 
sun-dried tomato pesto. At the food co-op, humans pay handsomely for designer 
water. Dogs get it for free, in nice big buckets. 
</P>
<P>
 With pottery studios on every corner, a thriving psychotherapy practice in the 
center of town and -- down the highway a few miles -- a gas station that 
dispenses psychic readings, the area feels like Hollywood's vision of a 1968 
time warp. It feels like something off the back lot at Universal Studios. ("Cue 
the hippie village!") It feels equally like a place that -- if it didn't exist 
-- Craig Nova might have invented. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, this hamlet in the southern tip of America's most rural state is 
where Nova, who grew up with the Universal back lot practically in his back 
yard, has chosen to settle. As a kid, Nova looked out from his house on Bennett 
Drive and watched "Spartacus" being filmed. As a pushing-50 novelist, Nova 
looks out from his writing room and sees trees, trees and even more trees. It 
is a source of continual marvel that everything is green here, even the license 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something about growing up in California," Nova said. He was 
sipping hot, strong tea in a house built by a 19th-Century shipbuilder who 
decided he had had enough of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it as absolutely normal, not bizarre or unusual," reflected Nova, 
whose Hollywood High classmates included most of the Mouseketeers. "However, 
when I got to the East, it did dawn on me that a large portion of humanity did 
not grow up with the same set of expectations and assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, visiting his sister, Nova was reminded anew of that discrepancy. His 
sister raises horses in Santa Ynez, and with absolutely no attempt to hide her 
disgust, she informed her brother that he had turned into an Easterner. It 
might have been his clothes, rumpled khakis and the kind of light blue 
button-down shirt that prep school boys lived in a generation ago. It may have 
been his speech, mannered and sometimes stiff -- hardly the argot, in any 
event, of someone who used to race Steve McQueen on Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was out there, I was trying to put my fingers on the precise nature of 
the psychic or spiritual discomfort," Nova said. "And it seems to me that it is 
the disparity between what that part of the world promises and what it 
delivers." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, ever since he finished up at Berkeley and headed back to Columbia 
for grad school, California has gnawed at Nova. Decades of shoving such 
ruminations to the back of his brain finally resulted in "The Book of Dreams" 
(Ticknor & Fields, 1994), a novel set in contemporary L.A., but filled with the 
dark sense of danger that Nova said he inhaled just growing up there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this book has been working its way through my system," he said of the 
book that waited 25 years to be written. What emerged was the intertwining 
story of three central characters, each living in a separate state of reverie 
and anticipation. Things will get better, each one of these characters just has 
to keep believing. The golden dream will come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this book is really about is people trying to come to terms with 
the promise of what they might be," Nova said. "Everybody has dreams of making 
that big killing, getting away from what they've got." 
</P>
<P>
 And in this book, as in life, Nova believes, "Everybody has a pretty definite 
set of desires. Love, money, land. That seems to be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood was a company town when he was growing up, Nova recalled. His own 
family was not in "the Industry" -- his father worked in aerospace -- but Nova 
hung with the film crowd, because that was what was around him. He said that 
once, as a teen-age gang member, he sneaked onto a studio back lot at night. In 
a bizarre chase scene, the police pursued him through the dusty streets of an 
imitation Wild West town. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was always the rough edges that fascinated him the most. When he turned 
to fiction, the friction at the fringe became a persistent theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always seemed to me as a writer that the best way to portray what somebody 
is all about is to put them in circumstances where they are under a lot of 
pressure," Nova said. The seven novels that preceded "The Book of Dreams" all 
emphasize the quiet tension between risk and respectability, "a kind of 
suction," Nova calls it in this latest work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the pressure that reveals who people really are," Nova said. "Stories 
work much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nova has had some experience with this sense of urgency himself. Years ago, he 
won a fiction-writing grant from New York state. It turned out to be the kind 
of award that had to be repaid with services, and no sooner had Nova used up 
the money but the state turned up, reminding him that it was pay-back time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put me in someplace where no one else wants to go," Nova said, feeling brave, 
cavalier and maybe a little bit crazy at the time. He figured they'd send him 
to Queens. Instead they dispatched him to Sing Sing, where his first group of 
students were all convicted killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison guards are a singular lot, Nova discovered. Most of them are not 
particularly fond of their charges. Writers, Nova found, do not rank much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guards' attitude was, 'well, if you get into any trouble with these guys, 
don't expect us to do anything,' " Nova said. Luckily, he stayed out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Nova married Christina Barnes, who trained at MIT as a city 
planner but went to work at CBS News instead. Barnes' career advanced steadily. 
But as the pair reached their early 30s, they decided it was time to have 
children -- and New York was not the place to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked their way north, stopping when they happened upon this "idyllic" 
pocket of countryside. With their two daughters, Abby and Tate, they share a 
calm and measured existence that makes writer friends in New York slobber with 
envy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We count our blessings about this all the time," Nova said. "That is not to 
say that there are not times when it's exceedingly scary" -- such as when 
unreconciled bank statements show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Nova sculls on the Vermont River. And every day he writes, already 
deep into the next novel -- medically themed, since health these days is a 
fairly risky preoccupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the halcyon isolation of Vermont, his readers are never far from his 
thoughts, Nova said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize that someone goes out and puts down the $21 to buy your 
book," he said. "So it's a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not to say that you write unmitigated junk, but it is a job. It's 
work. If you're not worried about your audience, people are going to be 
alienated. The most important person in writing a book is the reader, not the 
writer."

 Garbanzo beans are manly beans. At least they are in those parts of the 
Mediterranean where they are prepared for men by other men. 
</P>
<P>
 In Syria, there are special restaurants where garbanzos (also known as chick 
peas) are prepared in numerous ways by a specialist, called a hamsani . The 
garbanzos, cooked very slowly in a fired oven, have a meltingly soft texture 
and delicious flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 A dish of cooked garbanzos and crumbled pita, onions and "white" oil (a highly 
acidic and unusual mixture of cold water, baking soda, garlic and cold, old 
olive oil) is a favorite among men when they get together to play cards. It is 
called fatteh bi-zeit , which means "shredded bread with oil." It is literally 
a dish that one can fix while someone shuffles the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 While Syrian men eat this snack in the evening during card games, in 
neighboring southeastern Turkey a similar dish is eaten for breakfast. Again, 
it is a dish prepared for men by other men. In the central market of Gaziantep, 
I came upon a covered shelter along one wall, shaded, cool, dimly lit, nearly 
as large as a railroad station waiting room. Here a couple of hundred men were 
sitting around sipping tea and eating nohutlu durum , a rolled-up round of 
thick pita filled with garbanzos, slivered onions, parsley, red pepper and 
sumac. The garbanzos had simmered all night in a broth flavored with lamb 
bones. Unfortunately, it is more interesting to describe than it was to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the streets of Tunis there are numerous hole-in-the-wall soup kitchens that 
serve nothing but garbanzo soup. Here garbanzos simmer overnight, with calves' 
feet or marrow bones added to give heft and flavor. The soup is served in deep 
earthen bowls ladled over stale bread cubes, then slathered with fiery harissa 
sauce and accented with ground cumin, lemon juice and plenty of olive oil. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The dish is affectionately called leblebi , a name that imitates the bellowing 
of a ram in heat, according to a Tunisian philologist, Ouled-Abdessayed 
Khamais. (In Turkey, the word refers to char-roasted garbanzos.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When you eat leblebi ," a friend once counseled me, "bring a handkerchief, 
because the dish is so hot with spices that the nose runs ferociously." 
</P>
<P>
 Stimulating as the street version is, it can be further embellished with the 
favorite Tunisian garnish of canned tuna, capers, pickled vegetables and 
hard-boiled eggs. (In private homes, a poached egg is substituted.) In this 
form it becomes an entire meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a good tip from Tunisian home cooks. During the period of Ramadan, 
they store garbanzos and fava beans, previously soaked and drained, in airtight 
containers in the freezer. Every day a handful of each is thrown into the soup 
to be served to break the fast that night. The garbanzos and favas keep well 
for up to a month, and it's not necessary to defrost them first. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbanzos benefit from soaking overnight in plenty of water. But first I 
always toss the garbanzos with a little baking soda, remembering to rinse the 
garbanzos in several changes of water in the morning. This enhances the 
desirable luscious texture of the garbanzos. I have never produced delectable 
garbanzos using the quick one-hour soak. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I have started to cook garbanzos in salted water. It adds an hour's 
cooking time, but they do taste better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cook garbanzos in a covered pot, preferably earthenware. (Enameled cast iron 
is a good alternative.) Or cook them in much less water and without salt in a 
pressure cooker for about 35 minutes with equal success. BASIC COOKED GARBANZOS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups (about 1/2 pound) dried garbanzos, picked over 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 1 small onion, or 1 small veal marrow bone with some meat attached, or 1 small 
piece of cracked veal foot 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
 Gently toss garbanzos with baking soda in bowl and cover with 1 quart water. 
Let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse garbanzos thoroughly. Place in enameled cast-iron Dutch oven or 
earthenware bowl. Add onion and coarse salt. Cover with 2 quarts boiling water. 
Cover and set in 300-degree oven to simmer until tender, 2 to 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from oven and discard onion. Skim and discard fat if meaty bones were 
used. Garbanzos will keep, covered and refrigerated, for several days. Makes 3 
3/4 cups, about 7 servings.

 Many tasters in The Times Test Kitchen found the leblebi delicious even 
without the garnish of tuna and pickled vegetables. Try it both ways. Slivered 
pickled turnips with beets can be found at Middle Eastern grocers.

 In Tunisia, fiery hot red peppers play a role in almost every dish, usually in 
the form of the famous harissa sauce, a mixture of sun-dried peppers pounded 
with spices and garlic and packed into jars under a coating of oil. The 
Tunisian/French harissa sauce sold here in tubes bears little resemblance to a 
true homemade harissa paste. In fact, I find commercial harissa pretty 
dreadful. I used to use Indonesian sambal oelek as a sort of workhorse for most 
of my Tunisian cooking, adding ground coriander, caraway and garlic to give it 
the proper pungent, rounded taste. The mildly hot peppers used to make this 
sauce in Tunisia appear similar to New Mexican fresh chile peppers (California 
Anaheims) but are closer in flavor to the poblano or dried ancho. Now that 
dried ancho chiles are available, I make my own. I soak the peppers, then grind 
them with a little garlic, salt, spices and a roasted red pepper for an even 
richer texture.  
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, in Tunisian home cooking, many soups, stews and sauces begin the 
same way: The cook stirs some tomato paste into a spoonful of hot oil; when the 
paste turns glossy and gives off a good aroma, some harissa, diluted with 
water, and stirred until smooth, is added to the pot, along with the 
vegetables, liquid, herbs and spices. This method not only tames the harissa 
but creates a creamier sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Homemade Harissa Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 3 ounces dried chiles, preferably anchos, or mixture of New Mexican chiles, 
pasillas, guajillos or cascabels 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon ground caraway seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium sweet red pepper, roasted, stemmed, seeded, chopped, wrapped in 
cheesecloth and pressed until dry 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Stem, seed and rinse dried chiles. Place in bowl and add boiling water to 
cover. Cover bowl and let chiles stand 30 minutes. Drain, wrap in cheesecloth 
and press out excess moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Grind chiles in food processor with garlic, coriander and caraway seeds, sweet 
red pepper and 3/4 teaspoon salt. If necessary, add small amount of olive oil 
to make smooth paste. Pack mixture into small clean jar, cover with thin layer 
of oil, close with lid and keep refrigerated. Will keep 2 to 3 weeks in 
refrigerator. Makes about 1/2 cup.

 The "white" oil typically used to make fatteh bi-zeit in Syria is actually an 
oil of second quality. In my adaptation below I use a better grade of olive 
oil. The dish makes a delightful simple snack. Near East or Aleppo red pepper 
is available at Middle Eastern grocers.

 This dish, extremely popular in Barcelona, normally requires a fresh sausage 
that is a specialty of Catalonia. In the ingredient list I suggest some 
substitutes, but if you have a sausage-making machine you can make these 
sausages with ease. Grind 1/2 pound pork with 2 to 3 ounces of pork fat; 
moisten the meat with a few tablespoons of white wine, salt, pepper and dashes 
of cinnamon or nutmeg, powdered cloves and crumbled thyme. Then force the 
seasoned meat into a casing and hang the sausage in an airy place for 24 hours. 
The sausage is cooked in boiling water and eaten hot or cold. GARBANZOS WITH

 I've eaten many marvelous dishes in Greece, including this Macedonian version 
of garbanzos, eggplants and tomatoes. When I first tried it, I liked it so much 
I asked my Greek food-writer friend Aglaia Kremezi to find the recipe. The 
secret, it turned out, is preparing the dish in an earthenware pot so that the 
correct amount of moisture is released during cooking. A dish as good as this 
need be accompanied only by dense, chewy bread.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 2 chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 Italian green frying pepper, cored, seeded and cut into small pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 teaspoons chopped long green chile 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, peeled and crushed with dash of salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups canned tomatoes with juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon Greek oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 Soak garbanzos in water overnight with dash baking soda in large bowl or pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain garbanzos. Place in saucepan, add fresh water to cover and 1/4 teaspoon 
coarse salt, bring to boil and simmer, covered, over low heat until half-done, 
about 45 minutes. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 While garbanzos are cooking, peel eggplant and cut into 1-inch cubes. Sprinkle 
lightly with coarse salt and let stand in colander about 45 minutes to draw off 
excess moisture. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 12-inch skillet. Add onions, frying pepper and chile. Stir 3 
minutes. Add eggplant and saute without browning 2 minutes. Add garlic, 
tomatoes and juice, parsley, oregano and 1 teaspoon coarse salt. Simmer 10 
minutes, stirring often.

 In 4-quart bean pot, casserole or earthenware-lined electric cooker, mix 
garbanzos, 1 3/4 cup cooking liquid, bay leaf and contents of skillet. Cover 
pot with clay plate or parchment paper (fasten to pot with string). Bake at 300 
degrees 2 1/2 to 6 hours, or all day in electric cooker. Remove cover, increase 
heat and bake 10 minutes more to evaporate excessive moisture. Garbanzos should 
be very tender and finished sauce should coat them thickly. Makes 6 servings.

 I used to joke about writing a book in which I would follow the garbanzo 
around the Mediterranean, using this humble pulse as a prism through which to 
view culinary influences and history. Here's a dish that shows what I mean. You 
will find old Spanish versions with cured ham as a flavoring, served with 
lentils in Syria, favored with cumin in Egypt, flavored with cinnamon in Turkey 
and garnished with chopped onion in Lebanon. This Tunisian version, made with 
tomato and chile pepper, is my favorite. It can be served as a light meal with 
a brined ripened cheese such as feta along with pickles, bread and salad. 
GARBANZOS AND SWISS CHARD IN THE STYLE OF THE TUNISIAN SAHEL (Morshan) 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 pound Swiss chard leaves, stemmed, rinsed and torn into large pieces

 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup minced onion 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup Basic Cooked Garbanzos, with 3/4 cup cooking liquid 
</P>
<P>
 1 lemon, cut in wedges, optional 
</P>
<P>
 In pot steam, parboil or microwave chard leaves until tender, about 5 minutes. 
Set leaves in colander to drain. Squeeze out excess moisture and shred 
coarsely. 
</P>
<P>
 Crush garlic in mortar with salt, coriander and chile until thick, crumbly 
paste forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in 10-inch skillet and saute onion until pale-golden. Add 
garlic paste and tomato paste and stir into oil until sizzling. Add chard, 
Basic Cooked Garbanzos and cooking liquid and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 
minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until ready to serve. (Contents of 
skillet should be very moist but not soupy. For looser texture, stir in more 
garbanzo cooking liquid.) Serve warm, at room temperature or cold with lemon 
wedges. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Broccoli rabe, dandelion leaves, mustard greens, kale or turnip tops 
may be substituted for Swiss chard. Discard any yellow or damaged leaves and 
cook like chard. Cooking time will vary.

 These garbanzos beans aren't fried, no matter what the name of this dish 
implies. But that's what my mom, Norma De la Cal, called it when we were 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 To be perfectly honest, this wasn't my favorite dish of hers. I was tired of 
eating Cuban food all the time and wanted hamburgers and hot dogs. But as my 
palate has matured, so has my appreciation for the simple, hearty flavors in 
this recipe. NORMA'S "GARBANZO FRITOS"

GARBANZOS; THE BIG LENTIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The garbanzo has personality. You couldn't mistake it for any other bean or 
pea, not this largish, yellowish, lumpily spherical ball of protein and fiber. 
The surface has vaguely face-like marks that made the Greeks and Romans think 
of a ram's head and the Portuguese of a beak (in Portuguese it's called grao de 
bico , "the beaked seed"). 
</P>
<P>
 Its flavor is mellow and nutty, vaguely flesh-like. And it's the most 
easy-going of legumes in the kitchen, because it's just about impossible to 
overcook. 
</P>
<P>
 The garbanzo was domesticated at least 6,000 years ago somewhere in northern 
Iran and spread basically east and west: East as far as India, but no farther 
-- it has never amounted to much in Southeast Asia or China; west to the 
Mediterranean (and later to the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the New 
World), and, from the Mediterranean, as far south as Ethiopia. But in Europe it 
never got very far from the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the garbanzo has yet to be discovered by some Americans. The 
English knew little about it until the Renaissance, and even in the 18th 
Century, Samuel Johnson's notoriously opinionated dictionary defined it as "a 
kind of degenerate pea." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the French were late to the garbanzo party. Although many people in this 
country know this legume as garbanzo, showing that they ultimately learned of 
it from Spanish-speaking people, its other name, chick pea, shows what an 
uphill struggle it had in northern Europe. That name comes from the French pois 
chiches , which the French themselves borrowed either from Italian (where the 
word is ceci ) or some obscure Spanish dialect, because in the Middle Ages 
there were no garbanzos north of Provence.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody doubts that the ancient Egyptians and Iraqis ate garbanzos, though 
there's some question about what they called them. For instance, scholars have 
narrowed the Sumerian name for them down to either gu.gal.gal (literally, "the 
big lentil") or zid.nad.mal . 
</P>
<P>
 In Iran, "to be the garbanzo in every soup" means to be a meddler. The 
13th-Century poet Rumi used it for a mystical allegory in which a garbanzo asks 
the cook: "You bought me and approved of me, so why are you putting me on the 
fire?" The cook replies: "I am not boiling you because I hate you, but to make 
you tasty so that you may mingle with the vital spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks and the Romans, who believed garbanzos had been revealed to them by 
the god Poseidon, were the ones who really got behind the garbanzo. In the 
Iliad, Homer's heroes were eating erebinthos , and in the 6th Century BC, the 
Greek poet Xenophon wrote: "As you live stretched upon a soft couch by the fire 
in the winter season, these should be your words when you have had enough of 
food, and are sipping sweet wine and sneaking garbanzos with it." The Greeks 
took the fateful step of introducing the garbanzo to India, in time for it to 
be mentioned in the Sanskrit epic known as the Ramayana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek physician Hippocrates made great claims for its health benefits: "It 
clears away spots in the skin, beautifies the complexion, is beneficial for hot 
humors and serviceable for ringworm," among other things. He also believed it 
clears the voice, an idea that was still current in the Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Romans, garbanzos were, above all, a snack eaten fried (as garbanzos 
are still eaten in the Near East). The orator Horace characterized the ordinary 
man in the crowd as "a buyer of walnuts and fried garbanzos." They were also 
served boiled, of course. A Roman recipe from the 2nd Century AD says to cook 
garbanzos with salt, cumin, oil and a little wine. (Some ideas never die -- 
substitute lemon juice for the wine and mix in some bread at the end and you'd 
have shurbat hummus , an everyday garbanzo soup still prepared in Egypt.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this country the garbanzo is mostly known in two cold dishes, the Near 
Eastern dip hummus bi-tahineh and the traditional San Francisco three-bean 
salad. Elsewhere in the world, it also goes into soups and stews (it's hard to 
imagine a Spanish cocido without garbanzos), fillings for stuffed vegetables, 
even desserts. The Egyptians make a candy called hummusiyya and the Iranians a 
garbanzo cookie, nan-e nokhodchi.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's not unusual that we should be so familiar with hummus bi-tahineh , 
because the mealy garbanzo lends itself readily to grinding into a paste or 
flour. Whole culinary motifs have been woven out of this property. In Ethiopia, 
during Lent people make "garbanzo fish" ( ye-shimbra assa ) by baking garbanzo 
paste molded into fish shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground garbanzo flour plays such a large part in Indian cooking that it has 
its own name, besan . Indian cooks turn it into dumplings, crepes and spicy 
breads. It makes the batter in which vegetable dumplings ( pakora ) are fried. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in India the garbanzo is considered the most versatile of legumes. 
Late in life the Mughal ruler Shah Jehan, who built the Taj Mahal, was 
imprisoned by his son and gradually deprived of all his pleasures. In the end, 
he had to choose only one variety of legume, but he outwitted his son by 
picking the garbanzo. It could be served as a soup, a bread, a dessert, even as 
a fresh vegetable (though not commercially available in this country, fresh 
green garbanzos are delicious and can be eaten raw). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One use that seems to have died out is the liquid in which garbanzos have been 
boiled; medieval cooks in the Near East often used it as a flavoring for stews. 
One 13th-Century Moorish cookbook went even further: "Garbanzos in their skin 
have no use in the various branches of cuisine," it insisted. "They are a dish 
of nomads and gluttons; those who want to strengthen themselves with it make 
only its broth, add to it meat and make a dish of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bold words. But the rest of the same cookbook gives dozens of recipes for 
garbanzos -- boiled, fried, ground and all the rest of the ways.

HOME COOK: HULL THE BARLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us have used pearl barley in soups and stews, but hulled barley has a 
rich, wholesome taste and is vastly better, in my opinion. It's inexpensive and 
can be bought in natural-food stores. With mushrooms and a generous addition of 
black pepper, hulled barley makes a satisfying dish that lends itself to many 
variations. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, serve lemon sponge custard, another wonderful, but almost forgotten 
old-fashioned recipe. The recipe is easy to measure and mix, and it is very 
good served with fruits or berries. The uniqueness of this recipe is that while 
it bakes, it magically separates so the top becomes a sponge cake and the 
bottom becomes a lovely lemon custard. HULLED BARLEY WITH MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
 3 quarts water 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups hulled barley 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound mushrooms, cut in half

<P>
 4 shallots, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Put water in large pot, add 1 tablespoon salt and bring to boil. Add hulled 
barley and cook until tender but chewy, about 1 hour to 1 hour, 15 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 While barley cooks, melt butter in saute pan and add mushrooms and shallots. 
Cook, stirring, until mushrooms turn slightly dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain barley when done. Add cooked shallots and mushrooms. Add chicken broth, 
pepper and salt to taste, if needed. Stir to mix well. Serve hot. Makes 6 
servings.

SOUP OR STEW?: THE POSOLE PREDICAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA POOL FENZLE and NORMAN KOLPAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The terms soup and stew can be defined fairly simply: Make the ingredients for 
a soup chunky enough and simmer them until thick, and you have a stew; add 
sufficient broth to a stew and there's soup for you. Yet in the Southwest there 
is a culinary gray area between soup and stew that remains delightfully 
blurred. And the citizenry is happy for that, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 Take posole as a prime example. This robust bowlful begins with hominy: large 
kernels of dried corn soaked in lime to remove their hulls and plump them up. 
Several hours of simmering with a few chunks of pork, dried chiles, onions, 
garlic, herbs and spices yields an everyday favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 If more of the pig gets added, the posole becomes a customary New Mexican 
Christmas and New Year's dish. Substitute lamb for the pork and you have a more 
typically Navajo recipe. But whatever the form, is posole a soup or a stew? 
Make your own guess; then pick up any other book or article on Southwestern 
cooking and you have a roughly 50-50 chance of agreeing with the author. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, traditional Southwestern soups and stews exemplify a necessarily 
rough-and-ready approach to providing human sustenance. Cowboys on the range, 
pioneers on the trail, Native American hunters and early European settlers had 
few options for what they cooked or how they cooked it. Into the pot went their 
latest catch or scraps of tough and scrawny livestock, along with the odd 
vegetable, water and whatever seasonings were at hand; out came a one-dish 
meal, whatever it might be called. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to imagine the dismay such cooking might have caused the 
uninitiated. Imagine the "mixture of meat, chilly verde & onions boiled 
together" that 16-year-old newlywed Susan Shelby Magoffin describes in the 
journal she kept on her first journey to New Mexico along the Santa Fe Trail in 
1846. "There were a few mouthfuls taken," she continues, "for I could not eat a 
dish so strong and unaccustomed to my palate." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to say that the emigre's palate could not adjust in time, as Magoffin's 
did, or that such catch-as-catch-can cooking could not on occasion produce 
distinctive results. A case in point is the dish many people consider the 
Southwest's greatest culinary gift to the world: chili. 
</P>
<P>
 When most outsiders sing chili's praises, they pay homage, in fact, to a 
specialty of Texas: chili con carne , literally "chile peppers with meat." That 
phrase describes a native Texan dish often referred to with typical cowboy 
terseness as a "bowl o' red": dried red chiles simmered with small cubes of 
seared beef, some cumin and oregano, salt, garlic, a smattering of other 
peppers to spice it up a little more and maybe a sprinkling of corn tortilla 
flour, or masa harina , for thickening. It is easy to imagine the recipe 
prepared on a trail-side chuck wagon, accompanied by a scoop of boiled beans to 
help soak up and temper the fiery juices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staunch traditionalists will swear that true chili begins and ends with such a 
formula. But a survey of other Southwestern regions tells a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 The chile colorado of New Mexico, for example, stands out as a close cousin of 
old-fashioned Texas chili. Long, dried red pods are stemmed and seeded, toasted 
in the oven or over a flame, pureed with broth and simmered with chunks of beef 
and simple seasonings. The result is generally a thinner, redder, more intense 
concoction, as much chile peppers as it is meat. And because the emphasis of 
the dish has changed, New Mexicans call and spell it "chile," never "chili," as 
the Texans do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more popular in New Mexico is chile verde , green chile. At its simplest, 
this dish consists of nothing more than freshly picked, fire-roasted New 
Mexican green chiles, their stems and skins removed, their juicy flesh torn or 
coarsely chopped and served warm with beans and tortillas. At once 
green-tasting, sweet and subtly fiery, chiles prepared thus present a 
quintessential experience of the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as commonly, you'll find green chiles simmered with pieces of pork to 
produce a stew with the same moist chile-to-meat balance as its colorado 
cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As chili's popularity has grown, so have the variations. Fresh, dried and 
powdered chiles of all colors, shapes, sizes and intensities may season the 
stew, singly or in combination. The beans originally served on the side have 
found their way into the pot even beyond the borders of Texas; and not just 
pinto or kidney beans, but black beans, white beans -- beans of every color and 
creed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes may be added to deepen the color and underscore the flavor of the 
chiles with an edge of sweetness and acidity. Other forms of protein replace 
the beef or the pork -- turkey or chicken, for today's health-conscious cook; 
all manner of game, for hunter-cooks harking back to pioneer days; mixtures of 
two or more kinds of game or domestic meat; meatier varieties of seafood such 
as tuna or shark; and even beans alone, with no meat at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, during almost every weekend hundreds of amateur and professional chili 
chefs show off their own versions of chili in cook-offs throughout the 
Southwest and throughout the rest of the United States. And no two recipes are 
ever quite alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you get right down to the barest of essentials, what they all have in 
common is chiles. And every recipe induces in its creator a heartwarming and 
soul-stirring feeling akin to that expressed by Lady Bird Johnson, wife of U.S. 
President and lifelong Texan Lyndon Baines Johnson, in a letter she wrote to 
legendary Dallas chili expert Frank X. Tolbert for publication in his 
definitive book, "A Bowl of Red": 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling about chili is this -- along in November, when the first norther 
strikes and the skies are gray, along about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I get 
to thinking how good chili would taste for supper. It always lives up to 
expectations. In fact, you don't even mind the cold November winds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiersman and Taos resident Kit Carson certainly would have agreed. His 
reputed dying words were: "Wish I had time for just one more bowl of chili." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This versatile soup is good either hot or cold, so it may be served in any 
season. Available throughout the year in Latino and specialty markets, 
tomatillos will keep for up to a month if refrigerated in a paper bag.  
</P>
<P>
 TOMATILLO SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 3 shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound tomatillos, husked and diced 
</P>
<P>
 3 Anaheim chiles, roasted, peeled, cored, seeded and diced 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 jalapeno chile, seeded and minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Sour cream thinned with little whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic. 
Saute until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add tomatillos, Anaheim chiles and chicken 
stock. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tomatillos are softened, 10 
to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer mixture to food processor or blender and puree along with jalapeno, 
lime juice and cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide soup 
among 6 bowls. Drizzle sour cream mixture on top. Garnish with cilantro leaves. 
Soup may also be refrigerated overnight and served cold. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The subtle flavors of roasted corn and sweet yellow peppers add a distinct 
taste to this soup. Although it may be made any time with frozen corn, it's 
best with just-picked yellow or white corn on the cob. For a more refined soup, 
strain before adding half and half.  
</P>
<P>
 ROASTED CORN SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 4 ears fresh corn, husked, or 4 cups corn kernels 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped red onion 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 2 sweet yellow peppers, roasted, peeled, cored, seeded and diced 
</P>
<P>
 1 serrano chile, seeded and minced 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup half and half 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Over open flame, on very hot grill or under broiler, roast corn until kernels 
are browned and beginning to caramelize. If using whole ears of corn, cut 
kernels off cob after roasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in large saucepan. Add garlic, onion, carrot and celery. Saute 
over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add corn kernels, cumin and 
sweet yellow peppers and cook, stirring, 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Add serrano chile and chicken stock. Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. 
Transfer to food processor or blender and process 1 to 2 minutes. Return puree 
to saucepan. Add half and half. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat 
until warmed through. Divide soup among 6 bowls and serve immediately. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>

 New Mexicans believe that chile must be undiluted with beans or tomatoes, so 
their recipes often call for little besides meat and New Mexico green chiles. 
The Anaheim is similar to the New Mexico green chile, although the latter has a 
sharper flavor. Delicious as a main course served with warm tortillas, chile 
verde also makes an excellent filling for burritos and chimichangas, or a sauce 
for enchiladas and chiles rellenos.  
</P>
<P>
 CHILE VERDE 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons bacon fat or vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup coarsely chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds lean pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 2 garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 10 New Mexico green or Anaheim chiles, roasted, peeled, cored, seeded and 
diced 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups boiling chicken stock or water 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat bacon fat in large, heavy pan over medium-low heat. Add onions and saute 
until tender, about 5 minutes. Add pork cubes and cook, stirring, another 5 
minutes, or until meat loses pink color. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle flour over pork and onions. Increase heat slightly and cook until 
pork is browned and onions are golden. Stir in cumin, garlic and chiles, mixing 
well. Slowly add boiling stock and stir until well incorporated. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until meat is 
tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Serve with warm tortillas. Makes 6 servings.

WAITER, THERE'S BACON IN MY SOUP! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bacon is one of my favorite ingredients. But a little goes a long way to 
flavor a soup or stew, or any dish that could use a strong, meaty taste. 
</P>
<P>
 I use bacon fat instead of olive oil or butter to saute vegetables when I 
start a soup. Bacon is an especially good match when I'm making a recipe with 
beans, potatoes, pasta or beef, but I wouldn't use it for something delicate 
such as a fish stew or chicken broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon also gives soups a long-cooked, smoky flavor -- without the long 
cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 The following Swiss chard, bean and pepper soup is thick and chunky with 
beans. It is a rustic soup that would make a nourishing meal. Bacon, spinach 
and cheese soup is more like a chowder. Although it is satisfying as an entree, 
it can also serve as a first course to grilled chicken or fish. Both soups take 
less than an hour to prepare but taste like they've been simmering for hours. 
SWISS CHARD, BEAN AND PEPPER SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 2 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound Swiss chard, stems and leaves coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup cooked and drained cannellini beans 
</P>
<P>
 Dash crushed dried sage 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 heaping tablespoons shredded Asiago cheese, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Brown bacon in medium pan. Drain on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Add onion, sweet red pepper and garlic to bacon fat and saute over medium-low 
heat until tender, but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add paprika and cook 1 
minute. Add Swiss chard and saute 1 minute over medium heat. Add chicken broth, 
bay leaf, beans and sage. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Add bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover and simmer until chard is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Discard bay leaf. Pour soup into 2 large soup bowls. Sprinkle 
each serving with 1/2 of cheese. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings. BACON, 
SPINACH AND POTATO SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium Yukon gold potatoes, quartered 
</P>
<P>
 3 bacon strips, cut into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 large shallot, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 2 packed cups trimmed spinach, cut into bite-size pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 to 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cook potatoes in pot filled with water to cover until tender, about 20 
minutes. Drain well. Peel and dice potatoes. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 While potatoes are cooking, brown bacon in medium pan. Remove bacon with 
slotted spoon to drain on paper towels and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be 2 generous tablespoons bacon fat in pan (otherwise add some 
olive oil to make up difference). Add shallot to fat and saute until tender, 
about 5 minutes. Stir in flour to form paste. Gradually stir in broth, stirring 
constantly, and cook until thickened and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Add nutmeg. 
Stir in spinach, reserved potatoes and bacon. Simmer 10 minutes. Thin to 
desired consistency with milk. Heat through. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Makes 2 servings.

PASTA PRESTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This recipe takes advantage of seasonal ingredients and it takes less than 
half an hour to cook. It's just a matter of tossing parboiled asparagus with 
cooked bow-tie pasta, sauteed strips of prosciutto, green onions, lemon, 
parsley and Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is fresh-tasting and colorful and looks like a lot more work than 
it is. Although this pasta is delicious as a main course, it could also serve 
as a side dish with broiled lamb chops, grilled salmon or sauteed chicken 
breasts. And if you want, serve it as a salad, just replace the butter with 
olive oil, add extra lemon juice and seasonings, leave out the cheese and serve 
at room temperature. BOW-TIE PASTA WITH ASPARAGUS, LEMON AND PROSCIUTTO 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds thin asparagus 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, cut into 1/4x4-inch julienne strips 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup finely chopped green onions including 2 inches of green stems  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 pounds bow-tie pasta 
</P>
<P>
 4 teaspoons grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Add cooked asparagus, prosciutto mixture, lemon zest and juice, parsley, 
butter and cheese. Season to taste with pepper. Stir and toss well to mix. 
Taste and, if desired, add salt, pepper and lemon juice. To serve, mound pasta 
in heated serving bowl or on platter. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings.

 RAGU OF THE SEA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those of us trying to eat less meat, an easy way to do it is to make 
spaghetti sauces with fish instead. You can use the same flavorings as in meaty 
spaghetti sauces, but you have to modify the cooking method and shorten the 
cooking time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the sauce is prepared in reverse order. In old-fashioned 
spaghetti sauces, the meat is cooked first, but for a sauce based on seafood, 
the fish or shellfish is added last. 
</P>
<P>
 Another result is that seafood spaghetti sauces are speedy. There is no need 
for lengthy simmering. You simply cook together some flavorful ingredients such 
as tomatoes or other vegetables and herbs with a little olive oil. If you like, 
you can enhance the taste with wine, bottled clam juice or fish stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Any fish and almost any shellfish can be used to make these sauces. Tiny 
shrimp can be added whole; scallops can be quartered. For a luxurious seafood 
sauce, you could use crab or lobster meat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even canned fish can become glamorous when made into a tasty sauce for pasta. 
The Italians recognized this when they created "spaghetti con tonno ," made 
with a sauce of canned tuna and tomatoes flavored with anchovies, garlic and 
oregano. 
</P>
<P>
 A small amount of smoked fish -- about one-quarter or one-third as much as you 
would use in fresh form -- also contributes a wonderful taste. For example, in 
linguine with salmon and leek sauce, you can use smoked salmon or lox instead 
of fresh salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 These spaghetti sauces are also delicious with all sorts of other pastas such 
as linguine, vermicelli, angel hair and fusilli. They provide an economical way 
to enjoy the taste of fish and shellfish. You don't need a large amount of 
seafood, because it's tossed with the pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 One last bonus: This type of sauce also happens to be one of the easiest ways 
to cook fish. You don't have to worry that the fish will fall apart -- it's 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This delicate dish is flecked with pink salmon and green leeks and parsley. No 
cheese is necessary; good cooks rarely serve cheese with pasta featuring a 
subtle fish sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 LINGUINE WITH SALMON AND LEEK SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-pound) salmon fillet 
</P>
<P>
 4 medium leeks, split, rinsed thoroughly 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil, vegetable oil or butter 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup bottled clam juice or fish stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound dried linguine 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Remove skin from salmon and pull out bones. Cut salmon into 1/2-inch dice. 
</P>
<P>
 Discard dark-green parts of leeks. Thinly slice white and light-green parts. 
Heat oil in large skillet. Add leeks. Add dash salt and pepper. Cover and cook 
over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender but not brown, 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add wine, cream and clam juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Add fish 
and sprinkle lightly to taste with salt and pepper. Add thyme. Cook, uncovered, 
stirring often, just until color of fish becomes lighter, about 3 minutes. 
Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook pasta in large pan of boiling, salted water over high heat until tender 
but firm to bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer to large bowl. 
Reheat sauce. Pour over pasta and toss. Adjust seasonings to taste. Sprinkle 
with parsley. Makes 3 to 4 servings. 
</P>

<P>
 Considering the simple ingredients it uses, this quick dish is amazingly 
delicious. Anchovy butter is the "secret" element that gives a subtle accent to 
this dish and makes it memorable.  
</P>
<P>
 ROMAN SPAGHETTI WITH TUNA, TOMATOES AND MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons anchovy paste 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 4 tablespoons butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 pound mushrooms, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 large garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) 
can plum tomatoes, drained and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 pound dried spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
 1 (6 1/2-ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Beat anchovy paste with butter in small bowl until blended. Set aside at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and 
dash salt. Saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add about 1/3 of garlic and 
saute 30 seconds. Transfer to plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and heat over medium heat. Stir in 
remaining garlic, tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until thick, 12 to 
15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook pasta in large pan of boiling, salted water over high heat until tender 
but firm to bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, reserving little pasta water. 
Transfer pasta to large bowl. Add anchovy butter and toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Reheat tomato sauce. Stir in tuna and mushroom mixture. If sauce is too thick, 
add 1 to 3 tablespoons pasta water, 1 tablespoon at time. Adjust seasonings to 
taste. Spoon sauce over spaghetti. Serve sprinkled with parsley. Makes 4 to 5 
servings.

OKRA: BEYOND THE SLIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's get one thing straight: Okra doesn't have to be slimy.  
</P>
<P>
 True, this graceful green vegetable has a reputation for being as sticky as 
swamp muck. That's because okra contains mucilaginous starches that can be 
off-putting to neophytes. This very property endears the vegetable to African, 
Caribbean and Louisianian cooks, who use it as a thickener. But there are many 
dishes in which okra remains as snappily crisp as the choicest al dente green 
bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Okra comes from Africa. Like yams and peanuts, it was brought to the Americas 
in the cramped hulls of the African slave ships. The word okra derives from 
Nigeria and the Guinea coast, where it is known as nkru-ma , oguru , etc. Many 
languages of Angola call the vegetable ngombo , which survives in the name of 
the popular Louisiana dish gumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its use as a vegetable, okra belongs to the mallow family and is a 
distant cousin of cotton. Its scientific name is Hibiscus esculentus , "edible 
hibiscus," and it's recognizable by its pretty golden flowers. Today, okra is 
enjoyed throughout Africa, the Near East, the Caribbean, Central and South 
America and the American South. Northerners, however, remain skeptical at best. 
</P>
<P>
 I say it's time to give okra a second chance. The flavor of this unusual 
vegetable hints of green beans and asparagus but is more earthy than either. 
The texture is crisp on the outside and softly sticky inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Okra is a finger-shaped pod, two inches to six inches long, with a hexagonal 
cap at one end and lengthwise ribs that taper to a slender point at the other 
end. Mindful of its attractive shape, the English call it "lady finger." If you 
think the vegetable looks pretty when whole, try slicing it widthwise. The 
resulting rounds look like miniature wagon wheels with tiny round seeds between 
the spokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In traditional Southern cooking, okra would be stewed for several hours, 
reducing it to mush. The starchy gums and pectins in the vegetable served as a 
thickener for soups and stews. Okra is still used this way in Louisiana gumbo 
and West Indian fungi (also called funchi , a cornmeal and okra mush). Cutting 
or slicing the pod increases its stickiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to keep okra crisp is by pickling it or by deep-frying it in 
tempura batter or cornmeal. A new generation of Southern chefs has taken to 
serving okra al dente. They blanch the vegetable in boiling, salted water for a 
minute or two, then quickly chill in ice water. Prepared this way, okra is 
great for dipping in tartar or hollandaise sauce. It also makes a delicious 
addition to salads. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying okra, look for small, crisp, bright-green pods, two inches to 
three inches long. Avoid jumbo okra or pods that are wilted or streaked with 
black. Store okra in the refrigerator and try to use it within two to three 
days of purchase. One pound of okra will serve three to four people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse okra thoroughly under cold water before cooking. Cut off the end of the 
stem, but leave the cap intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Okra is relatively low in calories (454 calories per pound) and high in fiber, 
vitamins A and C and potassium. It also contains traces of calcium, iron and 
folic acid. According to Carol Ann Rinzler, author of "The Complete Food Book" 
(World Almanac), the gums and pectins in okra may help lower serum cholesterol 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These crisp pickles are just the ticket for making believers out of people who 
have had bad experiences with okra. Far from being slimy, they're crispier and 
crunchier than most cucumber pickles.  
</P>
<P>
 OKRA PICKLES 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound small okra 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 fresh or dried red chiles 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dill seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon celery seeds 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse and trim okra. Place in 1 or 2 clean jars along with garlic and chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine vinegar, water, salt, sugar, bay leaves, peppercorns, coriander seeds, 
dill seeds and celery seeds in saucepan and bring to boil. Pour mixture over 
okra. Place coffee cup or tightly sealed water-filled plastic food bag on top 
to keep okra submerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Let pickled okra stand at room temperature at least 2 days or as long as 1 
week. (They are ready to eat after 2 days.) Store pickled okra in refrigerator. 
Makes 1 quart.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: CERRITOS; CITY MAY GET SHERIFF'S SUBSTATION, SCHOOL GYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new sheriff's substation and a gymnasium at Whitney High School are among 
the projects included in an $84.4-million city budget expected to be adopted at 
tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for the fiscal year beginning July 1 contains $32.3 million for 
redevelopment projects, including the substation and gymnasium, and $3.8 
million for capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending plan includes a $48.1-million operating budget, up 5.6% from the 
previous year to accommodate increases in the city's contract for police 
services with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, expansion of the 
city's transit system, and rising costs at the city's Senior Center and the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency has allocated $5.4 million for the construction of a 
sheriff's substation that would house deputies who are assigned to Cerritos but 
who currently are based at a station in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency budget also includes $400,000 for the design of a 
gymnasium at Whitney High School, which currently has no such facility. An 
additional $2 million would be spent over the next two years to build the 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a similar agreement, the city is expected to spend $873,100 this 
year to finish a $2.6-million gymnasium expansion at Cerritos High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meeting is at 7 p.m. GREG MILLER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; COMPANY GETS 1-YEAR PACT TO PLAN AQUARIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $100-million aquarium, considered the linchpin of a massive waterfront 
expansion plan, moved a step closer to reality this week as city officials 
selected a Japan-based construction firm to plan the facility and secure 
funding.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's Redevelopment Agency unanimously approved the deal Monday, giving 
Kajima International Inc. an exclusive one-year contract to secure $100 million 
in revenue bonds to pay for the 100,000-square-foot aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Kajima will also seek proposals from designers and architects and form a 
nonprofit group that would ultimately own and manage the aquarium. The revenue 
bonds would be repaid through income from the aquarium's admission, parking and 
concession fees, said Susan F. Shick, director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Kajima, one of Japan's largest development companies, will not be paid for the 
year's work. Although the company is expected to develop and build the 
aquarium, Shick said, the city will seek bids from other construction firms 
before awarding the contract. Kajima also built the World Trade Center and 
Hilton Hotel in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Shick said Kajima's recent job overseeing the development and financing of an 
$84-million aquarium in Tampa, Fla., was a key factor in the redevelopment 
agency's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Kajima plans to spend about 18 months planning the aquarium, Shick said. 
Construction is expected to take a year to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium would be the centerpiece of a proposed $557-million tourist 
harbor that will include an amphitheater, shops, restaurants and nightclubs. 
Intended to link downtown with the shoreline, the project will be located on an 
old landfill that is now the site of Shoreline Aquatic Park and Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict that the development, when completed, will pump $275 million 
a year into the local economy and create 3,500 jobs. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL NEWS; COUPLE SAY CHANG CAMPAIGN ASKED THEM TO VOTE ILLEGALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A supporter of Councilman Sheng H. Chang persuaded two Los Angeles residents 
to vote illegally in the Arcadia council elections and the councilman's wife 
mailed in other people's absentee ballots, said witnesses at a trial to decide 
whether Chang's April election victory should be invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephen E. O'Neil began hearing a lawsuit on 
Friday that was filed by the leaders of Arcadia Citizens for Fair Voting, 
asking him to set aside Chang's April 12 win because of election fraud. Chang, 
who won by 287 votes, has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those bringing the suit are Geraldine Fasching, wife of defeated 
Councilman George Fasching, and Shao Hua Wen, former president of the Arcadia 
Chinese Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Chang won by illegal votes cast by non-residents and 
non-citizens. It accuses his campaign of registering unqualified voters, paying 
for votes and collecting absentee votes, which is barred by state law, said 
Peter Wallin, the group's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam and Emily Situ, a couple who live in Los Angeles, testified that a friend 
of the councilman's wife, Min-Mey, persuaded them to register to vote in 
Arcadia so they could vote for Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 Min-Mey Chang, who ran her husband's campaign, testified that the campaign had 
conducted a registration drive among residents. She said the campaign had 
collected voter registration forms and absentee vote requests to deliver to the 
city clerk but had not gathered absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 But she revealed under questioning from Wallin that she had helped two 
residents return their sealed absentee ballots to the clerk. She is expected to 
continue her testimony today when the trial resumes after a three-day break. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheng Chang also testified, denying the allegations and saying that his 
campaigners had specifically asked residents if they were citizens to avoid 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs "didn't present anything to change the election result," Sheng 
Chang said Monday. He said he had never heard of Sam and Emily Situ, and that 
their two votes would not have changed the election's outcome anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his wife did mail in the two absentee votes for residents who asked 
for help, but she did not influence them, because the ballots were already 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In April's election, challengers Chang, Mary B. Young and Barbara D. Kuhn 
ousted incumbents Fasching and Joseph C. Ciraulo. Chang, the first member of an 
ethnic minority to be elected to the council, received the most votes, 3,805, 
including 1,438 absentee votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Fasching said that Min-Mey Chang's help with absentee ballots is the 
central thrust of the case. She said, "I think we're doing very well and the 
judge is really interested."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; TRANSITION TEAM TO PLAN MAYOR'S INAUGURATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayoral inaugurations in this city have typically been low-key affairs, 
carried out during a City Council meeting, with only the briefest reception 
following at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't likely to be the case when Beverly O'Neill takes office July 19. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, O'Neill named a nine-member transition team charged with, among 
other things, planning the inauguration.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, members of the team met with Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and 
his chief of staff, Bill McCarley. The discussions ranged from how to make all 
residents feel included in the inauguration -- and how to pay for it -- to how 
to create a smooth transition between top executives, said Charles Greenberg, 
chairman of the transition team. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will also develop plans to restructure the mayor's office and gather 
names of people willing to serve on city boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who defeated Councilman Ray Grabinski last week, is the first mayor 
to be elected from outside the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Greenberg, members of O'Neill's transition team are: Paul De La Cruz 
Blanco, president of the Federation of Filipino-American Assns.; attorney 
Rosemarie Burgos; the Rev. Garon Harden of the Greater Open Door Church of God 
in Christ; real estate broker Ginny Leibrich; Steve Oettinger, community 
relations director for ARCO Transportation Co.; attorney Fred L. Riedman; 
Thomas D. Wood, former president of Marymount College, and Dorothy Wiltse, a 
community volunteer. EMILY ADAMS

 When a high school graduation party ended with two teen-agers shot to death by 
gang members, it mattered little that the suspects were classified as 
"outsiders" by San Marino police. It still seemed inconceivable to parents that 
their children, living in one of the nation's safest and most affluent cities, 
could have collided so fatally with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But some law enforcement officials, local teen-agers and a counselor who 
specializes in the problems of Asian youths were less surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that San Marino is any hotbed of gang activity, they say. But the thrill 
and power associated with gangs has for years been a casual flirtation for some 
San Marino youths, who affect the dress and swagger of gangsters and sometimes 
befriend gangbangers, blurring the lines of distinction. On June 5, that 
attraction turned deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you walk and talk and quack like a duck, look out for duck hunters," said 
Glenn Masuda, a psychologist with the Asian Pacific Family Center who works 
with adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other counselors of adolescents in the valley say many affluent youths 
from good families find it hard to resist the sinister allure of gang culture. 
</P>
<P>
 These young people ape gang styles, dressing in the baggy clothing popular 
among bands shown on MTV. Some wear buzz haircuts and sport gold stud earrings. 
They give themselves gang monikers and hang out together, often at San Gabriel 
Valley pool halls or parties where gang members congregate. While they may not 
commit crimes, they get vicarious thrills from rubbing elbows with those who 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "That can get real dangerous because it blurs the distinction of who's a heavy 
hitter, who's involved and who's just in style," Masuda said. The flirtation 
with the dark side can quickly lead to trouble, said Masuda, who has counseled 
youths who were attacked by real gang members who mistook them for members of a 
rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a number of good kids at the counseling center who come in, dressed 
to the nines, saying, 'Why did they beat us up or shoot at us?' " Masuda said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were subtle hints of gang influence hovering over the San Marino party 
where Dennis Buan and David Hang were gunned down. The flyer advertising the 
party was written partially in gang script, Masuda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entertainment provided by LORDS," the flyer read, with the word LORDS in 
elaborate, graffiti-like lettering. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the presence of metal detectors brought to the party by disc jockeys 
to screen patrons may have been only a novelty, as the San Marino police 
suggested, but it simulated a giddy danger, youth counselors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although San Marino students and parents say that slaying victim Hang, a 
14-year-old San Marino High School freshman, was not a gang member, a source 
close to the murder investigation said that Hang had been a gang wanna-be since 
the age of 10. When he died, he was wearing a belt with the letter S , 
indicating a gang subgroup of the Chinese gang Wah Ching. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who played on Hang's Chinese basketball league team said that when 
the boy entered San Marino High he sought acceptance among those wearing gang 
attire and began dressing the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Buan, an 18-year-old South Pasadena High School senior who was hired to 
help the party's disc jockey, was not a gang member, authorities said. But one 
official said Dennis' older brother, Luigi, who also helped the disc jockey at 
the party, belonged to a long-established Latino gang based in Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Luigi Buan could not be reached for comment, but San Marino police have blamed 
the gang activity at the party on the disc jockey connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody said that socioeconomic barriers determine gang affiliation," said one 
law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. "There's a lot of 
gang influence in the high school. . . . They do it for thrills." 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher in the South Pasadena-San Marino area who did not want his name used 
said he and other educators are perpetually puzzled about the extent of gangs 
at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids take a pride in you not knowing for sure if they're in a gang," the 
teacher said. "They'll give you a look, an attitude. They walk around together 
and you don't know whether or not you can mess with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students at San Marino High, who declined to give their names for fear of 
retaliation, said the gang presence is real and growing. Two factions exist, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 One group wears popular gang attire, such as baggy shirts and pants. Members 
of the other group dress sharply in suits and claim affiliation with Wah Ching. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people who claim (Wah Ching), but maybe four or five people 
actually are" on campus, said one San Marino youth who claimed to be a gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs are growing," he said. "Nothing is being done about it. If (school 
administrators) restricted clothing . . . there would be too many people who 
would protest." 
</P>
<P>
 The students acknowledged that most "open" parties also attract gangs from 
nearby cities. One San Marino student said that gang members from other schools 
showed up at three parties he has attended. But there were no confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, trouble did erupt on the San Marino campus recently after a group of 
students who wear the baggy, gang-style clothing -- but who are not necessarily 
gang members -- were accused of vandalism, students said. Three freshmen from 
that group were arrested by police last month on suspicion of stealing Honda, 
Acura and other car emblems from vehicles parked on campus lots and public 
streets, a 17-year-old junior said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said it has become a fad in school for students to use the emblems 
for key chains or decorations on backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any gangs we have on campus," she said. "I think it all comes 
with the wanna-be hard look, with the 'respect' you want to get from other 
people. . . . If anything, it's a bunch of bragging. 'I know so-and-so (from 
Wah Ching).' " 
</P>
<P>
 At a public meeting earlier this month, San Marino High School Principal Don 
Banderas acknowledged that 40 cars in the school parking lot had been 
vandalized, but he said the three students were required to pay restitution and 
he downplayed any gang connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The law enforcement official, who requested anonymity, said that San Marino is 
home to at least six high-level Asian gang members in their mid-40s. These men 
have ties to sophisticated international Hong Kong-based groups such as the Wah 
Ching and 14K. 
</P>
<P>
 But these upper-echelon men are not active in San Marino, the official said. 
Instead, the gang influence among youths comes from dai-los, a Mandarin term 
meaning big brothers. It refers to lower-ranked members within the highly 
structured Asian gang hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence has turned up that at least one dai-lo in his 30s has recently been 
recruiting students from San Marino and South Pasadena, the official said. The 
recruitment is not done directly but via lieutenants who meet teen-agers 
through other students they know on campus and treat the young people to 
dinners, movies or parties, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's real mobile," the official said. "He's got people from Rowland Heights, 
San Dimas and Diamond Bar. He uses cars, phones and pagers. And what do these 
(San Marino) kids have? Cars, phones and pagers."

THE SAN MARINO TRAGEDY; DENIAL IS PREVALENT IN AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES; SUCH 
ENCLAVES, NOT WANTING TO AIR THEIR 'DIRTY LINEN,' SEEK TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE 
IMAGE. BUT NOT ADMITTING THERE'S A GANG PROBLEM CAN BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

 Robert C. Gayl, who sits on the San Marino Unified School Board, doubts there 
are gang members in his affluent residential community, where the average home 
sells for $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there . . . was a gang problem at the high school, we would be dealing 
with it forthrightly," Gayl asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for the chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a defined gang member at this school; we know this for a fact," 
San Marino Police Chief Frank Wills said at a community meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officials were responding to civic shock and outrage after two youths 
wielding semiautomatic weapons sprayed gunfire through a high school graduation 
party earlier this month, killing two teen-agers, wounding seven and plunging 
this usually quiet and safe city into grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Arcadia -- another affluent and high-achieving community -- used 
to say the same things Gayl and Wills do now. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before 1990. That year, three students from Arcadia High School were 
kidnaped and beaten for refusing to join an Asian gang called Red Door. Police 
broke up the crime ring and arrested five adults and five minors for offenses 
including kidnaping, assault with a deadly weapon and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes marked the end of Arcadia's age of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our watershed," recalls Joann E. Steinmeier, an Arcadia school board 
member who was elected five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the abduction, Steinmeier said, many parents "were definitely in 
denial. They didn't want to deal with the fallout. But sometimes you need an 
event like that to say, 'Hey, we've got a problem, and we'd better deal with it 
head-on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Steinmeier says affluent residential enclaves often find it difficult to 
admit they are vulnerable to the same urban problems that plague the rest of 
the metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "In San Marino and Arcadia, we really want to keep that (positive) image in 
our own minds and in people's minds. We don't want to air our dirty linen," 
Steinmeier says. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the San Marino officials, he adds: "I can understand why they 
don't want to admit this is happening to kids in their community. Arcadia 
generally doesn't like negative press. It doesn't do wonders for the Chamber of 
Commerce or for real-estate sales. But it's a double-edged sword, because if 
you don't recognize it and deal with it, you're never going to get a handle on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the protestations of civic leaders and local police in San Marino, 
students at the community's high school said there are some gang members among 
the students, albeit very few. And a law enforcement source close to the 
investigation of the party slayings said this week that adult Asian gang 
leaders are recruiting students at San Marino High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Those methods are similar to revelations that rocked Arcadia last year, when 
police discovered a student extortion and assault-for-hire ring at Arcadia High 
in which teens worked under the supervision of three adults with ties to Asian 
gangs. Up to 35 youths were believed to be involved, but police only had enough 
evidence to arrest 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia officials said some of the adult ringleaders came from other parts of 
the San Gabriel Valley to recruit students into gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia Police Capt. Dave Hinig says civic leaders throughout the San Gabriel 
Valley should keep one thing in mind: "Any community with a significant Asian 
population is going to have people trying to recruit Asian (youths) into gangs, 
whether it's in the schools or whether they go to where these kids study or 
play video games." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the stereotype of the tattooed, low-achieving delinquent, many 
Asian gang members are good students, Hinig says. They come from affluent 
families. They don't appear motivated by financial gain. And they are extremely 
mobile, willing to travel miles to recruit, attend parties, scrap with rival 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who counsel both victims and perpetrators of gang violence wonder whether 
there has been enough counseling of troubled adolescents after the June 5 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Masuda, a psychologist who works with teen-agers at the Rosemead-based 
Asian Pacific Family Center, said his clinic offered its services to school 
officials at South Pasadena and San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "They indicated they have internal services, and we haven't been contacted 
since," Masuda says. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in both districts said their crisis intervention counselors 
meet with students as necessary to discuss problems. Many students on both 
campuses took advantage of these services after the shootings to talk through 
their concerns and emotions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another counselor, who didn't want to be named, said he had the impression 
that San Marino school officials want to downplay any potential problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to portray a certain kind of image," the counselor said. "I 
don't know if they're worried that it's going to drive down property values or 
what, but I think somebody is very heavily invested in maintaining the idea 
that . . . there's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosa Zee, the newest San Marino school board member and its only Asian 
American, says her community is well aware of the danger of Asian gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to open our eyes -- nowhere is safe -- and if we deny that we'd be 
stupid. Like every parent, I'm concerned. These things move fast, and we have 
to be very careful. We can't say we're immune."

CLOSE LOSER IN COUNCIL RACE SEEKS RECOUNT; LONG BEACH: ONLY 7 VOTES SEPARATE 
FRONT-RUNNER TONIA REYES URANGA AND MIKE DONELON IN 7TH DISTRICT. 
</P>

<P>
 The battle to claim a City Council seat in Long Beach's 7th District continued 
this week as candidate Mike Donelon, who trailed front-runner Tonia Reyes 
Uranga by just seven votes, announced he is seeking a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga held a 29-vote lead on election night June 7, but after the City 
Clerk's office counted some provisional ballots and late absentee votes Friday, 
Uranga led Donelon, 2,926 to 2,919. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon announced plans to seek a recount after the City Council certified the 
results Tuesday. "I want to go the extra mile just to make sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon said Tuesday he probably will ask that ballots be counted by hand 
rather than by machine. A recount would take three to five days, costing $3,000 
per day, Deputy City Clerk Deborah Wright said. Donelon will not be charged if 
the recount puts him ahead of Uranga, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Uranga's lead holds, she and 1st District winner Jenny Oropeza will become 
the first Latinos to join the council. Uranga and Donelon were vying for the 
seat vacated by Ray Grabinski, who lost his bid for mayor last week. Donelon 
had been the top vote-getter in the April primary race for the seat.  
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of a bitterly fought 9th District election, defeated 
Councilman Warren Harwood filed a complaint alleging that his opponent, Jerry 
Shultz, failed to report thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood, who lost to Shultz by nearly 500 votes, filed the complaint with the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz acknowledged that campaign workers had failed to record $3,000 in 
contributions from the Greater Long Beach Board of Realtors and a $3,000 loan 
that he made to himself. He said, however, that the omission was an oversight.

A FIRST-GRADE, FIRST-CLASS FIXTURE; 41 YEARS AFTER TEACHER TOOK A JOB IN ROOM 
1, SHE'S STILL THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a September morning in 1953 when a 22-year-old named Harriet A. Cadman 
walked into the little white schoolhouse on the hill and began her first 
teaching job. And 41 years later, she still hasn't left. 
</P>
<P>
 That young woman fresh out of college, the one who came from a family full of 
teachers and swore she would never join their ranks, is now 63 years old and a 
beloved fixture in Room 1 of Loma Vista School in Whittier. Every year since 
1953, she has taught first grade in that room and every year, she says, she 
loves it more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to keep doing this until I get it right," the short, pink-cheeked 
Cadman says with a joking twinkle in her eye. "If I didn't come here every 
morning, my car would come by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Indiana, Cadman headed for the University of New Mexico at age 16, 
determined to break ranks with her eight teacher-aunts and become a social 
worker. But her fieldwork in Albuquerque landed her in a first-grade classroom. 
Her knees went weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were so adorable, so loving," she recalled. "I knew right then that 
I was history." 
</P>
<P>
 A happenstance introduction in New Mexico to the superintendent of South 
Whittier School District landed her her first job. And so it was that Cadman 
arrived at Loma Vista in the fall of 1953 and moved into an $80-a-month 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 From her desk in Room 1, Cadman has been witness to four decades of change. 
The neighborhood, once grassy space dotted with a few homes, is now blanketed 
with shops and small stucco houses. Its inhabitants, once middle class, are now 
mostly lower income. The sea of little faces that greets her has changed from 
virtually all white to mostly Latino, with a sprinkling of white and black. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, teachers were expected to wear dresses. But today, 
Cadman's attire reflects her down-to-earth style. On a recent day, she wore 
maroon knit pants, a flowered jersey and white sneakers. Her gray hair is 
no-nonsense short. She wears no jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Her manner with the children is more grandmother, with a dash of social 
worker, than schoolmarm. Cadman, who was named teacher of the year by her 
district this year, says she tries to see things from her students' points of 
view. She sums up her approach: "a benefit of the doubt and a hug around the 
neck." 
</P>
<P>
 As they bend over their papers, practicing writing passages from "Goldilocks 
and the Three Bears," she walks around supervising, touching a shoulder here, a 
back there, praising good work and encouraging better. 
</P>
<P>
 And she sees to the little details: One student wiggles loose a baby tooth, 
proudly displaying it to his classmates. Cadman carefully seals it in an 
envelope for him and tucks it into his notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadman has been at Loma Vista long enough that she now teaches the children of 
some former students. Last year, she taught Jamie Cottrell, whose father, 
Shannon, was in Cadman's class in 1966. The elder Cottrell, a 34-year-old 
machinist, recalled how patient Cadman was with him when he was in her class.  
</P>
<P>
 "I cried for 15 or 20 minutes every single day and she never got mad," 
Cottrell recalled. "She just let me put my head down on my arms and she waited 
until I was done. She's a real motherly type." 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Morrow, 29, remembers how Cadman tried hard to speak a little Spanish to 
her when she was a Spanish-speaking child named Lupe Garcia in 1972. Morrow's 
daughter, Bessie, is now a student in Cadman's class. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is real caring and patient, just like she was then," Morrow says. "To see 
her, you wouldn't think she's been teaching so long. She's so energetic." 
</P>
<P>
 While many teachers complain that changing times have produced students who 
are rude, troubled and uninterested in learning, Cadman looks into her 
classroom and sees that the more things change, the more they stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty much the way they always were," she says. "You're going to 
have a couple gabby ones. Always have been, always will be. With kids, there's 
really nothing new under the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The same with teaching techniques: "It all comes around again. First we taught 
phonics, then it was the whole-language method. Now it's back to phonics 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 She does think it's a shame that kids don't seem to read as much at home as 
they used to. And she thinks they watch too much TV. But basically, Cadman 
says, 6-year-olds are still 6-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say there haven't been some changes. So Cadman adapts. When she 
began to hear more and more Spanish around Loma Vista's hallways about 10 years 
ago, she figured she'd better brush up her high school Spanish. So she took a 
few classes. Now she's fairly fluent. 
</P>
<P>
 Her routine stays the same, though. She is installed in her room before 7 
a.m., heading home in her cherry-red 1990 Plymouth at about 3 p.m. In the beige 
stucco home she shares with her widowed sister and a gray cat, Cadman puts her 
feet up, has some tea and grades homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Evenings are for watching television, reading the newspapers or savoring a 
good mystery novel. Weekend afternoons can bring a visit from her 1-year-old 
grandnephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadman doesn't reflect that much on the old days. She likes things fine just 
the way they are. She figures she'll go on teaching in Room 1 "until I don't 
feel good anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year they hand out a form asking if I want to switch grades or 
anything," she says. "I just write down, 'No! Never!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, through the passing of the decades, it's the things that 
never change that keep Harriet Cadman coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time a student writes her name straight without any letters upside 
down or counts to 100 or they actually read and understand what they read, it's 
unbelievable," Cadman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten very emotional about it. In class I've gotten choked up," she 
says with a smile, sniffling to demonstrate. "Sometimes I just have to go 
outside and get a drink of water until I'm OK again."

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; TRUSTEE'S ABSENCES COULD LEAD TO OUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Compton school board member Lynn Dymally has not attended a board meeting in 
nine months and is on the verge of losing her seat, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they will recommend to the county education office 
that the seat be declared vacant if Dymally misses two more meetings without a 
legitimate excuse. She missed the most recent board meeting Tuesday night, and 
the absence was recorded as unexcused under a new policy approved last month by 
Jerome Harris, the state-appointed administrator for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Dymally last attended a board meeting Sept. 21, according to school board 
records. School officials give varying reasons for her absences. Some say she 
has been ill. Others say she is boycotting meetings to protest the state 
takeover of the Compton school system, which has reduced the seven-member board 
to an advisory body under Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who assumed his position in February, said Dymally has expressed 
frustration about the takeover and apparently did not want to attend meetings. 
"If the board doesn't perform its normal duties, she wonders why she should 
even come out" to meetings, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 School Supt. Harold L. Cebrun said last month, however, that Dymally told him 
she has been ill. He said she did not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
 Dymally refused to discuss her absences when reached by phone. "I don't like 
receiving press calls at home," she said. Dymally, 35, was elected in 1991 to a 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a board seat can be declared vacant if a member is absent at 
least three consecutive months except for reasons of illness or excused travel. 
</P>
<P>
 A county education official discussed Dymally's absences last month with 
Cebrun but concluded that the seat could not be declared vacant then because 
she had told the superintendent she had been ill. The official, Marc Forgy, who 
determines whether to order special board elections, said he did not attempt to 
contact Dymally or Harris, the administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new district policy, which took effect this month, board members are 
required to explain any absences. The board declared Dymally's absence Tuesday 
as unexcused after she did not call in. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the new policy was not aimed at Dymally, although they 
expressed concern that she had offered no official explanation for missing the 
meetings. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; NEGLECTED CEMETERY GETS NEW OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sunnyside Cemetery, the historic Long Beach graveyard plagued by financial 
problems and months of neglect, has been sold for $100 to a Wilmington-based 
landscaper who said he will consider giving the site to the state or a 
nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to turn the cemetery around," said the new owner, Je-Rome Poland. 
"If (members of a nonprofit group) feel they can do that or if the state feels 
it can, I'm more than willing to let them try. If not, I'm going to move 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland owns Down to Earth Maintenance, whose primary contract is with 
Wilmington Cemetery. He said that after he bought Sunnyside on June 7 he 
received dozens of angry phone calls from people who said the graveyard should 
be run by a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland bought the cemetery from Dean A. Dempsey, who is under investigation 
for allegedly using more than $500,000 from the cemetery's endowment fund for 
personal expenses. Dempsey owned the graveyard for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special subcommittee meeting of the state Cemetery Board in Long Beach on 
Friday, Poland announced that he will give the site to a new nonprofit group, 
Friends of Sunnyside Cemetery, if it can produce a realistic plan to restore 
the 13-acre graveyard. The group consists of family members and friends of 
people buried there. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Giunta, executive director of the Cemetery Board, said the board will 
make recommendations about Sunnyside's future July 28 at its next meeting, 
which has been moved from Eureka to Long Beach. Giunta said the board could 
either approve the nonprofit plan, recommend that the state take over the 
graveyard or suggest that Poland run it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Marshall, whose parents are buried at Sunnyside, led the effort to form 
a nonprofit corporation that could take control of the cemetery. She said the 
group has about 35 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The group must submit a preliminary management plan to state officials by June 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunnyside, the final resting place of some of Long Beach's most prominent 
historical figures, was brought to state officials' attention last month when 
they received complaints about the graveyard's deteriorating condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon investigation, officials found that Dempsey had apparently used about 
$550,000 from the endowment fund to lease a Mercedes, pay for food and drinks 
at local bars and restaurants, make payments to his former wife and for other 
personal expenses, they said. The endowment fund's balance, which once 
surpassed $1 million, was supposed to have remained intact, with the interest 
used for cemetery expenses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they plan to seek felony charges of theft against Dempsey next 
month. Dempsey, who is battling lung cancer, has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state officials have seized Sunnyside's accounts, Giunta said the 
sale was allowed because state law does not permit the cemetery board to take 
possession of cemetery property. JOHN POPE

WORLD CUP; A BIG PART OF THE FUN AND GAMES IS OFF THE FIELD; THE PLAYOFFS AND 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HAVE SET OFF A ROUND OF CHICHI PARTIES AND SOCIAL EVENTS. BUT 
WILL THE SPORT'S CACHET STICK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It's time for the World Cup "Great Gatsby" party with twin white baby-grand 
pianos at the Ritz-Carlton Huntington; for party planners in Bel-Air to order 
the post-game salmon en croute ; for classic Ferraris to shimmy down Colorado 
Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in the name of soccer. And oh, by the way, the games 
are coming up too. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, soccer is high-class, a curiosity-turned-extravaganza in an area 
where "corner kick" usually refers to the local bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup playoffs and championships -- which run from Friday through July 
17 in nine U.S. cities, including Pasadena -- are spinning off a chichi-event 
circuit featuring unlikely bedfellows such as hip-hop aerobics teachers, 
world-class opera tenors and Motown bands. 
</P>
<P>
 In the blink of a bad goalkeeper's eye, the game's image is changing from 
brawling, face-painted fans and children's leagues to bourgeois spectacle. Jay 
Leno joshes with U.S. soccer player Alexi Lalas on "The Tonight Show," director 
Spike Lee throws a fund-raising party for Cameroon's World Cup team, and 
Beverly Hills preps for the city's daily World Cup celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see people who don't even know about soccer, and they'll be (around) 
just to be there," said soccer fan Giovanni Degidio, owner of Wise Guys 
restaurant in Old Pasadena. "It's a happening, know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena is awash in bright banners for the World Cup, the largest single 
sporting event in the world. Eight of 52 games, including the championship, 
will be played at the Rose Bowl; each game is expected to draw more than 
100,000 people. The championship game alone is expected to draw 2 billion TV 
viewers; by contrast, last year's Super Bowl in Pasadena attracted a TV 
audience of 750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Private World Cup parties will entertain celebrants at exclusive locales 
throughout the Los Angeles area, from museums to mansions. EventWorks, a 
professional Los Angeles-based party planner, is putting on several World Cup 
parties, including a "Hollywood Hills producer" theme party at a Bel-Air 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel, World Cup sponsors will celebrate at a 
"Great Gatsby" party, and at the Huntington Library, two corporate museum 
sponsors are throwing private affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the "Encore -- The Three Tenors" concert on July 16 at Dodger 
Stadium, featuring Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, with a 
top ticket price of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup farewell party is a $1-million Mardi Gras-themed bash on the 
back lot of Universal Studios. Tickets for the July 17 party are $150. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fan Mike Tatikian can't believe how far the game's standing has come. 
</P>
<P>
 "One-million-dollar party?" wondered Tatikian, owner of Pro Soccer Shop in 
Pasadena and a former professional soccer player in Lebanon. "I said 'Gosh! 
Look at that!' " 
</P>
<P>
 But after World Cup leaves town, some wonder whether the sport's cachet will 
fade as suddenly as it came, just another flavor of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will it be hip for Jack Nicholson to be at the Coliseum watching some semipro 
team?" asked South Pasadena resident Jack Donovan, a 15-year coach for the 
American Youth Soccer Organization. "I think the glamour will take years to 
come."

WORLD CUP; PASADENA'S BIG FESTIVAL PLANS FIZZLE; WORLD CUP USA BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 It was supposed to be Pasadena's own family-oriented soccer festival, a 
celebration that would generate more than $600,000 profit for the city and 
allow it to showcase its cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for Soccer Carnaval -- a monthlong combination of soccer, crafts, live 
entertainment and an international food court -- were launched after Pasadena 
lost the official recreational event sponsored by World Cup USA '94, known as 
Soccerfest, to Los Angeles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But with two days to the first game in Pasadena, Soccer Carnaval has no 
corporate sponsors, has dropped plans for an admission price and this week 
moved its location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be lucky if this ludicrous thing makes anything," said 
Councilman Isaac Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say World Cup USA opposed Soccer Carnaval's opening on game 
days and advised major corporate sponsors not to get involved, leaving Pasadena 
short of the predicted revenue and without a showcase for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "World Cup USA doesn't want us to have this event at all," said Councilman 
Chris Holden. "They've done everything possible to block this event for our 
city because they fear it will take away from their Soccerfest."  
</P>
<P>
 The council in closed session Monday decided to ignore World Cup's wishes and 
open the festival on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 It also decided to move the event from the Jackie Robinson baseball stadium to 
nearby Brookside Park to take the event out of the area controlled by World Cup 
on game days, according to council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have plenty of fans from the games on game day," said Michael Jensen, 
head of Pasadena Productions, a private production firm that is staging the 
event with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer Carnaval's celebration of soccer and Pasadena will begin Monday, three 
days after the start of World Cup, when the festival was originally going to 
start. It will run until at least July 20, three days after the cup final, 
Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Carpenter, World Cup USA's Pasadena venue spokeswoman, said the organizers 
of Soccer Carnaval have done an ineffective job on publicity and have only 
themselves to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't blame World Cup. I haven't seen any publicist in Pasadena on this 
event," she said. "I don't know what Soccer Carnaval is, but I do know 500,000 
booklets on Soccerfest have gone out." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Pasadena Productions, a group of renowned event organizers that 
produced the Live Aid concert, acknowledged they didn't even get permits for 
the event until June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena's Soccer Carnaval was supposed to generate $3.2 million through major 
sponsors, a $10 adult admission charge, sales taxes, permit fees and $7,000 
retail booth rentals. More than $650,000 profit was expected to come to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city never got any major corporate sponsors. City officials said 
Coca-Cola was one company that backed off after World Cup warned it away. 
Jensen said the celebration with soccer clinics, more than 50 live acts, 20 
restaurants and 30 retailers and special days to celebrate different cultures 
will now be free except for some special evening concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers now think the city will get less than half the profit predicted, 
$300,000. Jensen's group will bear most of the costs, with the city paying only 
for extra policing and health department activities. Game Schedule 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup competition runs from Friday to July 17 in nine U.S. cities, 
including Pasadena. The first game at the Rose Bowl is Saturday. Here is the 
Rose Bowl schedule and starting times:

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY; BIG DESIGNS ON MOOOVING AHEAD; IT'S CALLED COW. 
AND FIRMS ARE LINING UP TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FOUR YOUNG FOUNDERS WHO GAINED 
ACCLAIM WITH AN INTERACTIVE ART CENTER CATALOGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Funny how things change. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, they were four struggling art students, waiting outside the doors 
of ad agencies to show their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they spent six frenetic months of their own time creating an electronic 
catalogue for their school, Pasadena's prestigious Art Center College of 
Design, where they applied all the design, graphics and computer skills they 
had learned in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work impressed so many people that the Pasadena foursome decided to form 
a company to specialize in interactive design, an enterprise they christened 
with the whimsical name of COW. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with one of their team still in school, all but one under 30 and no 
professional contracts to their name, COW has already won a couple of awards 
and has several firms lined up that are interested in doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the company hasn't landed its first job yet, much less delivered 
on that job. But some of the people who award those contracts are expecting 
great things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're really smart, really talented, and I would love to work with 
them," gushes Jonathan Wiedemann, executive producer of the new media division 
of Propaganda Films, the stylish Hollywood company whose top-notch directors 
and technicians have produced everything from Madonna music videos to David 
Lynch's "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of small start-ups are vying for recognition in the field of 
interactive media, so-called because users navigate their way through a 
computer program that prompts them for information about what they want to see. 
Electronic directories at malls and computer games are familiar examples. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics complain that much of the interactive media on the market today is 
confusing, boring or both, filled with large blocks of text, unappealing 
graphics and maze-like paths that leave users frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, many of these same critics say that COW has brought to the 
technology a sophisticated new level of design, learned at one of the top 
schools in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry mavens praise COW's style, which uses a lot of images and a minimum 
of text. Their program entices the user through a fast-moving blend of visuals, 
sound, type and graphics. The COW technique also uses film prominently, 
favoring herky-jerky off-center editing and hand-held cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the interactive catalogue that the foursome did for the Art Center, 
which funded the cost of their supplies. The user starts learning about the 
school by sitting down at a computer kiosk in the Art Center gallery and 
touching the screen to select from a menu of photo icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the icon chosen, the user is propelled through film, text, 
graphics and photos through the Art Center in Pasadena, the school's 
Switzerland campus, its colorful history or the creative vision of its 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some interactive programs, the team's design makes it easy to switch 
from one path of inquiry to another. Another menu is overlaid in the 
background, where one touch brings it back into focus while the first one 
recedes. Users move through interviews with celebrated Art Center alumni, 
screen of student commercials or view prototypes of sports cars designed in 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 COW's interactive program brings the Art Center to virtual life in a way that 
would require an all-day tour in real time. All that's missing is the smell of 
sage that grows amid the hillside campus' sleek, modernistic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knocked my socks off," declares Jeannine Parker, president of the 
International Interactive Communications Society. "I think they have an 
incredible future. They've already separated themselves from the pack. It's not 
just how you present information, but how you give the user a way to navigate 
through it. They've made it much easier to navigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is because of the blend of artistic background and computer 
literacy among the young entrepreneurs: Dina Temkin, 25 (film and editing); 
John Grotting, 28, (graphics), Bryan Dorsey, 25, (graphics and packaging) and 
Mateo Neri, 31 (graphics). 
</P>
<P>
 The last three are Art Center graduates. Grotting just received his degree 
this month. Temkin graduates this September. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the name COW? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because things are too complicated today, and we wanted something simple that 
everyone would understand, because that's what we're trying to do with this 
media, that's our design philosophy," Dorsey says. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with that, their logo is a toy wooden cow they assembled from 
children's building blocks. Their office is in a California Craftsman house in 
Northwest Pasadena, which they like because it is funky, a far cry from the 
sterility of a commercial office. It is also Grotting's home, and he tends to 
the group's meager cache of computer and video equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 For now they want to stay lean and mean. It's silly, they figure, to spend 
tons of money in a field where equipment and software becomes obsolete every 
six months. Ditto for hiring. COW anticipates assembling specialists in graphic 
design, film and editing as projects come their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the core four, there is a loose and easy familiarity. They finish each 
others' sentences, with one expanding on a creative idea tossed out by another, 
such as the potential for film imagery in interactive design. 
</P>
<P>
 At brainstorming sessions they sit on the carpeted floor; there are no chairs 
or desks. The "grunge" riffs of KROQ radio blast from a portable radio while 
herb tea brews in the kitchen. All but Neri have earrings and long hair. 
</P>
<P>
 After their success with the Art Center catalogue, they decided to form their 
own small creative shop. Grotting had taken a three-year break from school to 
work as an art director at the international ad agency DDB Needham in Finland 
and hated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't creative. It was managing real big projects that were so mundane," 
he recalls. "It's interesting, the bigger the budget, the lower the 
creativity."  
</P>
<P>
 One of their first tasks is to draw up a business plan, meeting with lawyers, 
figuring out copyright laws and deciding which segment of the expanding 
interactive market they want to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 COW partners say they like interactive games and music discs but their 
ambitions lie elsewhere. They want to design new ways of communicating in 
business and education, such as kiosks that introduce new products or programs 
that teach students about World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually have in our biographies that we're not game makers. We're not 
hackers. We're not interested in a game that's going to sell millions," Dorsey 
says. "Games are not solving problems, they're just BS entertainment, and we're 
into solving problems. We want to develop tools that are going to influence 
this medium." 
</P>
<P>
 Grotting is the interface specialist, with a knack for designing ways for 
users to interact with the computer to get where they want. Last year, a 
computer interface designed by a group of Art Center students that included 
Grotting won first place in a competition sponsored by Apple Computer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, COW has had an impact on the Art Center, says school President David 
R. Brown. After seeing the success of the interactive catalogue, the school set 
up a "digital sandbox" for students to experiment with interactive media 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pointed the way," Brown says. "It's going to be very cool around here 
for awhile. We have an opportunity to become leaders in the education of design 
for interactive media." 
</P>
<P>
 COW expects to sign off shortly on its first professional contract, creating 
seven interactive kiosks for Nissan Motors that would introduce customers to 
their line of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has made presentations to Celebrity Cruise Lines, PacifiCare 
health systems, Apple Computers, American Express and Propaganda Films. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been profiled in Daily Variety and in Online Design. And they have 
been courted -- to no avail -- by ad agencies and firms that would like to 
incorporate them into their stables of whiz kids, a hedge against future 
crashes on the "information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to educate them," Grotting says. "They don't know what to do 
with the medium." 
</P>
<P>
 COW has little interest in being swallowed; its brain trust has other plans. A 
retired Art Center professor who ran a CPA firm for the entertainment industry 
is so enthralled that he undertook to raise $1.5 million in capital for them 
through his Hollywood contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the epitome of Marshall McLuhan's 'the medium is the message'; it 
takes something static and makes it dynamic," says Errol Gerson, who for 24 
years taught business management to budding artists. "The implications for 
corporate communications are staggering. I was so impressed with what they had 
done that I broke my rules, which are, one, never get involved with a start-up, 
and two, never get involved with students." 
</P>
<P>
 Another who was wowed is Richard Cassey, an associate at SHR Perceptual 
Management, a marketing firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., that works with auto 
companies and cruise lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassey researched interactive firms across the country and concluded that COW 
was "one of the top two." He envisions hiring the group to design interactive 
kiosks for auto dealerships and travel agencies. Interactive books are another 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "COW was the one that really impressed us. They break down the barriers of 
fear of the technology," Cassey says. "Not many companies are doing that. 
Either they're very creative but the stuff doesn't flow, or they're very 
technologically oriented but not creative." 
</P>
<P>
 One industry figure, while admitting he'd like to lure the COW founders to his 
stable, says the Art Center students have yet to make the leap from small art 
school boutique to big player in the interactive field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they land a major gig and produce something under real world 
constraints and pressures, the jury's really still out," says the man, who 
requested anonymity. But Greg Thomas, an interactive media engineer with Apple 
Computer Inc. who has seen COW's work, believes the group has what it takes. He 
predicts there will be shakeout in the interactive field in the next 1 1/2 
years and that COW will emerge strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed. They have good design skills, and the way the market's 
going, we are always going to have companies that need interactive 
presentations," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 COW's forays into interactive media began in April, 1993, when Dorsey had an 
idea to do an interactive yearbook with Neri. They were told Grotting would be 
essential to their team, so they enlisted his help. Kent Campbell, who has 
since left the group to work as creative director at another interactive 
company, signed on as producer. Along the way they hooked up with Temkin, whose 
film and photography skills brought visual punch to their designs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group opted to pitch the idea of an interactive college catalogue to 
Brown, the Art Center president, instead of a yearbook because they knew it 
would be an easier sell -- most students wouldn't shell out the money or have 
the equipment for a CD-ROM yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gave them an office, a $20,000 budget and free run of high-tech 
facilities for editing, photography and computers. The students even 
commissioned product design students Todd Bell and Bobby Chang to create the 
sleek wood-and-steel kiosk for the catalogue and hired others to do the music. 
Grotting estimates that the interactive kiosk would have cost about $400,000 if 
students hadn't labored for free using equipment and labs provided by the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked six months, using volunteer student film crews, raiding the 
archives, sleeping on couches in the office after 18-hour days. The interactive 
catalogue, which later won a Design Distinction Award in Graphics from the 1994 
Annual Design Review, was unveiled late last year at a design and media 
conference in Kitakyushu, Japan, a city that is gunning to be the interactive 
media capital in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says a headline in the local Japanese paper the next day read: "He 
touched the screen and the audience went 'Wow.' "

 The COW team's interactive design style uses a variety of images but little 
text. The program features a rapid-fire blend of sound, type, graphics and 
visual images, including a heavy reliance on film.Below are shots of two of the 
interactive screens that are part of COW presentations, along with what some 
are saying about the young designers.

 "I think they have an incredible future. They've already separated themselves 
from the pack. It's not just how you present information, but how you give the 
user a way to navigate through it. They've made it much easier to navigate.'

 "COW was the one that really impressed us. They break down the barriers of 
fear of the technology. Not many companies are doing that. Either they're very 
creative but the stuff doesn't flow, or they're very technologically oriented 
but not creative.'

THE JOB LUCK CLUB; UNEMPLOYED PROFESSIONALS TRADE IDEAS, FIND SOLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON and GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around a rectangular table, a dozen business executives critique videotapes of 
job applicants interviewing with a recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing with that pen on the desk," one notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's slouching, not good," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the interviewer asks a 60-year-old applicant the trick question: "What 
are your weaknesses?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pick up on things as quickly as I would like to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the best answer -- pointing out his own flaws. But he need not worry. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a mock interview, one that everyone around the table went through in 
their first week as members of the Job Club, an exclusive group of out-of-work 
white-collar workers from the Southeast and South Bay areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Members have to be professionals, by and large holding college degrees. Many 
of them are middle age or older. They believed they would spend their careers 
at their companies, but they were laid off or offered early retirement in the 
last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in the club is free, but its rules are stringent: All members must 
wear business clothes, including ties for the men, even though they are out of 
work. Each member must spend four hours a week helping to answer phones, type 
information into computer databases or survey prospective employers for 
openings at club headquarters. And who directs the out of work to this 
exclusive group? The state unemployment office.  
</P>
<P>
 The Employment Development Department launched such self-help groups for the 
once highly paid unemployed in the late 1960s, when aerospace cuts put highly 
skilled engineers and white-collar administrators out of work. The Torrance 
group -- officially the Professional Career Assn. -- was started seven years 
ago. Many club members are from Long Beach and other Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The professionals who arrive at the unemployment office have "a lot of 
frustration and anger," said Agnes Dodd, manager of the Torrance office. "It is 
much more difficult for them to accept that they are out of work than, say, the 
(blue-collar) worker who already has gone through a cycle of layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 To displaced professionals -- some of whom haven't interviewed for a job in 
years -- the club is their surrogate corporation. Here, a former nuclear arms 
expert teams with a former Disney Imagineer to craft a good resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a company, it would be the most dynamic firm," said club 
President Herbert Woertler, a former Sears sales executive. "Many of the 
members are advanced in age, tremendously experienced. They're the ones that 
brought the rockets to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 These white-collar workers, many of them former aerospace workers, previously 
had viewed the state employment office as the place where the down and out 
waited in long lines for their unemployment checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think of blue-collar workers going in and making claims," said Marian 
Williams, 38, who lost her job last month as a claims adjuster with an 
insurance company. Williams, a Signal Hill resident, said the first day she 
arrived at the club she got a tip on a job and within hours was invited for an 
interview. The job didn't pan out, but Williams was sold on the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tool for unemployed professional people to actually get a job," she 
said. "The benefits you get you would pay hundreds, if not thousands, of 
dollars for in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 The club's vice president, A.W. Hedge, decked out in a double-breasted suit 
with silk pocket handkerchief, is in charge of "external affairs," spreading 
the word to local elected officials and corporate chiefs about this group of 
available professionals. He comes equipped with Professional Career Assn. 
business cards, which list his title and address. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedge was trained in marketing and public relations and worked as a management 
consultant in Connecticut. But he tired of the weather there and moved to 
Southern California five months ago, even with the dire job market.  
</P>
<P>
 He has not found a job, but he strolls through a bakery in downtown Torrance, 
schmoozing with the president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce. 
When it comes to the club, his sales pitch easily rolls off his tongue: "We act 
like headhunters, but for no cost." 
</P>
<P>
 To promote its members, the club uses their combined brain power. If it's 
sending out a cover letter, they've got a technical writer to help. A job 
database? There's plenty of software engineers for that. Videotaping a new 
public service announcement to promote the club on cable TV? They have the 
former Disney designer. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some computer engineers have created grand plans for job database 
networks, and "you have to remind them that the whole reason for being here is 
to look for a job," Woertler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment department provides the club with a room and pays phone 
charges, but members must raise money for other expenses by selling raffle 
tickets, soliciting companies to donate old computer equipment and even 
gathering groups to go to talk show tapings, where producers offer $200 if 
enough members show up to fill an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cramped club room, members monitor the phones to get the latest tips on 
job openings, which are posted on a chalkboard called "The Hot Board." Cryptic 
messages, such as "UPS LA citywide 30 sales positions," urge members to call 
immediately before positions are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members are encouraged to volunteer elsewhere -- job contacts, after all, 
can be made at the local Rotary and YMCA -- and to proclaim their joblessness 
to anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm walking down the street and happen to stop to talk to somebody, I'll 
tell them I'm unemployed," said club member David Burks, 33, who recites the 
club's tenets like a mantra: "Don't be ashamed, let everyone know that you're 
available and always have a resume." 
</P>
<P>
 Burks worked for eight years as a manufacturing engineer at Douglas Aircraft 
Co. in Long Beach until he was laid off in May, 1993. His unemployment benefits 
expired recently, and now he relies on his savings and lives at a friend's 
house in east Long Beach. He hasn't had much luck in his job search -- no 
interviews yet -- but he is committed to the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Burks keeps a batch of resumes in his car, and sends out five to 10 a week in 
his job search. With the club's help, he has also put together a brief speech 
he uses when he meets a potential employer. In 30 seconds, he said, he can hit 
the highlights of his career and describe the type of position he's looking 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 The range and quality of the job club surprise many new members, including 
Burks, who admitted that when he came to inspect the organization in January he 
expected to find an uninspired government program consisting mainly of a 
counter and some job listings. Burks has also been impressed by the breadth of 
the club's membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people you meet come from all different backgrounds, from banking to 
chemical engineering," Burks said. "You've probably seen them before, but now 
they have faces and names, and you know what they do. You become part of a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 J.W. Wong, formerly a theme park attraction designer for the Walt Disney Co., 
is another member of the family. For years, he had thought about leaving his 
career to become a video producer. When Disney laid him off in August, 1992, he 
quickly put his goal into action. He has produced public service announcements 
for the club, and is at work on longer versions that can be used as 
infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm sitting around waiting for a job," said Wong, 46. "I'm 
trying to do what I want to do on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been a struggle. The value of his Torrance house is dropping, and 
he has dipped into savings, including his children's college funds. 
</P>
<P>
 His annual salary was $67,000 at Disney, but his search for leads among theme 
park design firms, video production firms and other amusement companies turned 
up empty. He recently interviewed for a position as a sales agent at Delta 
Airlines, but was told he was overqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't think I'm going to transfer into a $5-an-hour position," he 
said. "That's one of the problems I am having." 
</P>
<P>
 The club has averaged about 280 members this year, and about 40 have found 
work each month. It is better than at the depths of the recession two years 
ago, when only about 15 members per month were finding work. But many club 
members find themselves competing against hundreds of job applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance unemployment office as a whole places about 150 to 250 people per 
month, Dodd said. The state also offers job training workshops to blue-collar 
workers, although the club's services are more comprehensive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is more difficult" for professionals to find work, Dodd said, 
citing the need to network with prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Woertler, the club president, is entering the third year of his job search. 
With Sears cutting commissions to its sales force, he retired early at age 55, 
after 20 years with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to say at Sears, 'You're a member of the family,' " he said. "In my 
case, mom and dad got a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Woertler began tucking away savings 15 years ago. But others did not have that 
foresight. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many were not prepared for this," Woertler said. "We have members who have 
lost their cars, their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, club members get free counseling. Credit 
counselors also are available. But for some, the club itself is the best 
support system. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos resident Lawrence Shinsato said he was unprepared for the emptiness 
he felt when he lost his accounting job last August. The job club, he said, 
helped fill the void and kept him focused on the task of finding new 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a place to hang my hat, just to belong somewhere," said Shinsato, 
38. "When you're working, I don't think you appreciate that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the club's computerized job-matching service directed Shinsato to an 
opening for an accountant at a dental care company in Cerritos. Shinsato was 
hired on a temporary basis and could become a permanent employee soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have found out about it without the job club," Shinsato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many club members who are refugees of the battered aerospace industry have not 
found the job hunt so encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Smith, also a Cerritos resident, was laid off in April, 1993, after 11 
years managing assembly and testing operations at Hughes Aircraft Co. in El 
Segundo. Though he has been searching for a new job ever since, he says he has 
had just one interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times I begin to think there's something wrong with me," said 
Smith, who receives limited retirement benefits from Hughes. "Your head starts 
playing games with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's troubles are shared by many in a job market flooded with victims of 
aerospace and defense cutbacks. "The common conception is that we have been 
overpaid and under-worked, and there is a lot of reluctance to hire people in 
their 50s," said Smith, 56, who earned over $70,000 a year at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Smith visits the job club each week and continues to search for 
openings outside the aerospace industry that might make use of his talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still hopeful," Smith said. "I don't want to quit working."

OUTFIELDER GIAMBI IS SHOWING TITANS A GLIMPSE OF FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question was posed as soon as Jerry Giambi finished rounding the bases and 
returned to the dugout at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi, an outfielder for Cal State Fullerton, had just slugged his first home 
run of the season during a victory over defending national champion Louisiana 
State in the College World Series. His teammates greeted him with 
congratulations, high fives and an incredulous inquiry: "Why did you wait so 
long?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They were on me because I had joked throughout the season that I was going to 
save my home runs for just the right time," Giambi said. "I guess that was a 
pretty good time to break out." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, which had lost its World Series opener to Georgia Tech, was 
eventually bounced from the double-elimination tournament with another loss to 
the Yellow Jackets, who were defeated by Oklahoma in the championship game last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the Titans boarded their plane for the trip home to Southern 
California, Giambi had served notice that he will be a force to contend with 
the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi, a former All-Southern Section player at South Hills High, homered 
again in Fullerton's final game against Georgia Tech. He hit in all eight 
postseason games he played in and finished with a .458 batting average in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi's fast finish helped him conclude his redshirt freshman season with a 
.294 average and 22 runs batted in in 119 at-bats. Next season, Giambi is 
expected to be in the Fullerton starting lineup every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really starting to mature as a player, and that process took place from 
the beginning of the season to the end," Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido said. 
"He's a cornerstone player for our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi, 6-foot, 180 pounds, plans to build on postseason success this summer 
at the Cape Cod League. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I did in the regionals and World Series boosted my confidence 300%," 
Giambi said. "To do well against that kind of competition shows you that you 
can be among the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi was one of the best players in the San Gabriel Valley in 1992 when he 
batted .407 and compiled a record of 8-2 with a 2.37 earned-run average for 
South Hills. He made a commitment to attend Fullerton shortly before his family 
left for Barcelona to watch his brother Jason compete for Team USA in the 1992 
Summer Olympics. Jason Giambi, a former standout infielder at Long Beach State, 
is currently playing in the Oakland Athletics' minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
 Once practices began at Fullerton, Jeremy recognized that the Titans were 
counting on three returning starting outfielders. He discussed the situation 
with the coaches and his father and decided to redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to waste a year and only get 50 at-bats," said Giambi, who 
practiced with the team every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Giambi played for the Topeka Capitals in the Jayhawk League in 
Kansas, where he batted .280 overall and .560 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened this past college season as Fullerton's starting left fielder but 
batted .150 through the first seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like I was getting beat, but the hits weren't falling," Giambi 
said. "I left the coaches in a position to give other guys a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi eventually worked his way back into the lineup and helped Fullerton win 
a share of the Big West Conference championship. He was in the starting lineup 
when the Titans opened play in the Midwest I Regional at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been shaky throughout the season and had never really gotten into a 
groove," Giambi said. "I'd have two good at-bats and then have two bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming into the regionals, I felt I had something to prove. I hadn't played 
to my full potential. But once the tournament started, every at-bat I took was 
great. And when I got to the World Series, it got even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi hopes to be a member of at least two more World Series teams at 
Fullerton before following his brother into professional baseball. This summer, 
he will concentrate on improving his defense and honing his swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I was on the mound more than I was in the outfield, so I'm 
still learning about playing the position," Giambi said. "I don't want to be 
recognized only as a hitter. I want to be an all- around player."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: OUT OF THE OFFICE FIRE AND INTO THE OMELET PAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN , SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I hated my job." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Tom Thomas, owner of Long Beach's Omelette Inn, explains why he got 
into the restaurant business. Seven years ago, when his employer, AT&T, offered 
workers the opportunity to "take the package," Thomas was out the door of the 
company's bill collection department like Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend breakfasts were one of his favorite activities, so he decided to 
combine business with pleasure. In 1988, he bought the Omelette Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is certainly easy to spot. Just look on the sidewalk for the 
three-foot-tall wooden egg with glasses -- it holds a chalkboard that lists the 
special of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Omelette Inn is an airy, 70-seat place with a row of booths and tables 
draped with dark, flowered tablecloths. The walls are decorated by the works of 
local artists (Thomas is always eagerly looking for new art to exhibit, so if 
you're blessed with a touch of Rembrandt, drop by). 
</P>
<P>
 The omelets are made with three eggs and served with home fries and freshly 
baked muffins. One of the most popular is the Carnaval ($5.50), first offered 
five years ago to honor the Long Beach Carnaval. It's filled with Louisiana 
sausage, chicken and bay shrimp sauteed with bell pepper, onions, Cajun spices 
and topped with Cheddar cheese. The Florentine ($5.25) has fresh spinach, bacon 
and Swiss cheese and is topped with olives, green onions and sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Super spuds ($4.95) are potatoes, eggs, bell pepper, green onions, Cheddar 
cheese and sausage or vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini, for 
instance) -- all mixed together into one tasty mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sandwiches is a chicken salad ($4.95) -- chopped chicken breast 
blended with walnuts, mandarin oranges and mayonnaise served on whole-grain or 
sourdough bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a vegetarian, offers several meatless items, most notably the garden 
burger ($4.95), a patty of mushrooms, onions, rolled oats, brown rice, low-fat 
mozzarella, nonfat cottage cheese, egg whites, Cheddar cheese and bulgur wheat. 
</P>

PEOPLE: ENVIRONMENTALIST KEEPS A SHARP EYE ON BALD EAGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Garcelon dangles precariously over the huge bald-eagle nest on the 
southeastern cliffs of Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 He hangs from a harness connected by a long rope to a helicopter hovering 120 
feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second time Garcelon has visited the nest. Previously, he had removed 
an egg and replaced it with a synthetic one. As he approaches the nest this 
time, Garcelon again disturbs the nesting bird, and it takes off, soaring 
through the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a minute, Garcelon has replaced the fake egg. The eagle and its 
mate return to find a two-week-old eagle chick.  
</P>
<P>
 "The adults immediately came back and started to brood it, and then later we 
saw them feeding it," said Garcelon, 40, president of the Institute for 
Wildlife Studies in Arcata in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle chick was hatched in a San Francisco Zoo incubator from an egg laid 
by captive birds. It was the 42nd bald eagle released on Catalina Island under 
a reintroduction program Garcelon started in 1980.  
</P>
<P>
 The chick has roughly a 50-50 chance of survival, Garcelon said. But that's 
better odds than if the eagles had tried to hatch their own egg on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Human intervention is still the only way to ensure the survival of the 
endangered species, said Garcelon, who has worked for 14 years to re-establish 
bald eagles on Catalina.  
</P>
<P>
 At least six breeding pairs of bald eagles were nesting on the island in the 
1940s. They were among the 25 to 40 pairs on the eight Channel Islands before 
the population was wiped out by hunting and pesticide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT left over from extensive use in Southern California agriculture continues 
to permeate the environment and show up in the fatty tissue of birds and other 
wildlife. The pesticide was outlawed in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT affects the calcium deposits in the eggs of eagles and other shorebirds, 
Garcelon said. The eagles lay eggs with shells so thin they easily break or 
lose water, causing the embryo to dehydrate.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're able to save at least some of them until hopefully the environment 
cleans up well enough that they can do that themselves," he said. "One of these 
days that stuff (DDT) will degrade and be out of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Catalina is home to two breeding pairs and an additional nine mature 
birds, all reintroduced. Garcelon said an unequal sex ratio prevents more 
breeding on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 When eggs are laid, Garcelon quickly replaces them with replicas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragile eggs are transported in a specially designed padded case to San 
Francisco for incubation. Sometimes a chick goes back to the parents that laid 
its egg, but only three of 14 eggs laid on Catalina since 1987 have been 
successfully incubated. The egg removed from its Catalina nest in early April, 
for example, did not hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 After the chick is left in the nest, the adult birds quickly take on the role 
of parents. Only one foster chick has died in a Catalina nest, Garcelon said.  
</P>
<P>
 As the birds mature, they often leave the island for three or four months. 
Wing tags and radio transmitters help Garcelon monitor their travels.  
</P>
<P>
 One bird released in 1991 was spotted on the California/Oregon border earlier 
this year, he said. But eventually it may return.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect them to come back to at least the general area of Catalina Island 
because they have what's known as a 'natal site tenacity' and like to breed in 
the same area they came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon's aim in forming the nonprofit wildlife institute in 1979 was to 
re-establish bald-eagle populations, but he said he was not aware of how 
prevalent DDT was in Southern California waters when he began the Catalina 
project. Garcelon hoped the birds would be producing their own healthy chicks 
by now. Only one pair has laid and hatched an egg unaffected by DDT.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon's organization and the Catalina Conservancy have spent more than 
$700,000 in private funds trying to bring the species back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has contributed an 
additional $255,000 to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes $150,000 a year to maintain the program, Garcelon said.

VOLLEYBALL TAKES ON AN INTERNATIONAL FLAIR FOR 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil Mendel kept his fingers crossed through the lengthy negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The months of waiting will finally come to fruition for the Long Beach State 
middle blocker in Indonesia today when the 49ers take the court for their 
opening match of the Jakarta Sister Cities Men's Volleyball tournament at 
Senayan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong competition, held in conjunction with the 467th anniversary of 
Jakarta and Indonesian Independence Day, also includes teams from Jakarta's 
sister cities of Amsterdam, Berlin, Cairo, Casablanca, Little Rock, Ark., New 
South Wales, Seoul and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew for some time we might have a chance to go, but it seemed like a real 
long shot," Mendel said. "It was like a dream come true when we found out we 
were actually going." 
</P>
<P>
 David Sugita, secretary of the Los Angeles-Jakarta Sister City Assn., first 
extended the invitation to Long Beach State to represent the city of Los 
Angeles in December, but Coach Ray Ratelle was unable to accept the invitation 
until February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very lucky to be contacted," Ratelle said. "It was an ongoing process 
whether we could do it under NCAA rules or the school would permit us to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA regulations require players on the tour to satisfy student-athlete 
eligibility requirements. Redshirts and incoming freshmen were not allowed to 
make the trip, leaving the 49ers only nine players from their 12-man team this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which played its last match in April, was allowed only 10 days of 
practice before its departure. Renovations in the 49ers' gym forced the team to 
hold workouts at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us have been playing on the beach, but it's a completely different 
game as far as timing playing indoors," said Mendel, a sophomore. "We're a 
little rusty, but I think we'll be competitive. I'm sure there will be some bad 
teams and others that are out of our league." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers must also deal with a 16-hour time change and the tropical climate 
in Jakarta, which registered temperatures close to 100 degrees and humidity in 
the high 90s earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The most unpleasant experience for the 49ers, though, might have come before 
their departure. The team, which is taking anti-malaria tablets, received 
vaccinations for tetanus, diphtheria, polio, measles and hepatitis last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also visited the Indonesian Consulate General office in downtown Los 
Angeles for a lesson on Indonesian etiquette. Pointing with fingers in 
Indonesia is considered a sign of contempt and sitting with legs crossed and 
the sole of the foot facing another is impolite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically the do's and don'ts of Indonesia," said Travis Barr, a 
junior outside hitter. "It's just like acting normal and being polite, no 
yelling or pointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle has also issued stern warnings to the team concerning behavior, 
especially during the 9,000-mile flight. His players, however, say conduct 
could be the toughest adjustment for Ratelle, who will be bound by 
international rules that prohibit coaching from the bench during play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy that likes to walk around and shout during matches," 
junior outside hitter Dennis Winners said. "It's hard for him to sit still. We 
don't know what he's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (13-15), which placed fifth in the Pacific Division of the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation, will play Tokyo today and Cairo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day's rest, the 49ers will face Jakarta on Sunday and New South Wales 
on Monday. The tournament will conclude with semifinals and the championship on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Long Beach and Little Rock advance to the final, the 49ers would be forced 
to forfeit because of NCAA restrictions on foreign tours that prohibit Long 
Beach from playing against any other teams from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of play there will be so high, the experience alone will be worth a 
full season here," Barr said. "We were young and inexperienced this year. 
Hopefully this tournament will push us to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 Garuda Indonesia Airlines, along with Unocal, Lippo Bank, Mattel Inc. and 
several local companies, helped foot the $12,000 transportation cost. The city 
of Jakarta is picking up the tab for the 49ers' lodging and meal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will also present a proclamation from Los Angeles to Jakarta Gov. 
Surjadi Soedirdja and make a two-day stop in Bali before returning to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be nearly as strict on the players as we are during the 
season, but we're definitely going to keep an eye on them," Ratelle said. "We 
have our rules, but we're going to let them do some things or whatever as long 
as they're ready to play and not surfing 15 minutes before game time."

FIRE SCORCHES REGIONAL PARK; ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING THE BLAZE 
AT THE COSTA MESA PRESERVE, HOME TO ENDANGERED SPECIES AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF 
TRANSIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A fire burned for nearly seven hours in a dense, county-owned nature preserve, 
which is home to both endangered species and transients, before firefighters 
controlled it Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire burned in 10 of the 154 acres of the nature preserve in Talbert 
Regional Park, just north of 19th Street in Costa Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 The preserve has 142 species of migratory and indigenous birds, including the 
endangered Belding's savannah sparrow and the least tern, said Jonathan 
Schiesel, a Costa Mesa resident who heads the Friends of Talbert Park. Schiesel 
and firefighters said they did not know the extent of damage to the birds or 
their habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve also has an unknown number of camps set up illegally by 
transients, said Larry Paul, a spokesman for the county Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire began at 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, firefighters in a helicopter 
warned the transients to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze. They suspect a 
campfire started by transients or children playing in the brush, said Battalion 
Chief Judy Jewell of the Costa Mesa Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty firefighters from the Costa Mesa and Orange County fire departments 
fought the blaze, but the preserve's tall, dense pampas grass and groves of 
arroyo willow trees made it difficult for them to reach the area, and the grass 
caused flames to spread quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 Cool temperatures and light morning drizzle did help to contain the fire, but 
hot spots remained into the early afternoon Wednesday, Jewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the willow groves were spared, while the pampas grass, which is not 
indigenous to the area, burned quickly. The damage was not extensive, Paul 
said. In fact, occasional fires are natural in the wilderness and may actually 
restore nutrients to the soil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire was contained, firefighters took special care in handling 
valuable willow groves during the cleanup, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire officers responding were aware of the environmental sensitivity of 
the area," Paul said. "They called me during the middle of the night because of 
the working relationship we've had with them and to know what kinds of things 
they should be concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has held meetings with the Costa Mesa Fire Department in the past 
two years to prepare for emergencies such as this one, Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Costa Mesa firefighter, Capt. Brian Roberts, was treated at Hoag Memorial 
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach for smoke inhalation and released. No 
other injuries were reported.

PARENTS PUT ON ALERT OVER STALKER; CRIME: AUTHORITIES EXPRESS FRUSTRATION OVER 
THEIR FAILURE TO CATCH THE MAN WHO BOLDLY APPROACHES CHILDREN IN THE DANA POINT 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA and ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 75 anxious parents who gathered at a school meeting here Wednesday 
night were told to be on constant watch after at least seven incidents 
involving a man who appears to be stalking children.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's very brazen," said Cherie Kocaka, whose daughter was approached by the 
man at the foot of the stairs to their home. "He'll approach kids even when 
their parents are close by." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials said they are frustrated, especially by the 
latest incident on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good description of him that has been broadcast by the media, yet 
he's bold enough to make another attempt," said Lt. Dan Martini. "He's on the 
edge, and we are treating this situation very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The man, described as white, with long, curly brown hair, severe acne and a 
boil on his upper cheek, used the same ruse Tuesday that he has used in several 
incidents, authorities said. He approached two children on their front lawn in 
the 34000 block of Via San Juan at 6 p.m. and asked them to help him find a 
lost cat. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the children had been warned about the man and ran into the house, 
screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's deputy was only a block away at the time. But the suspect had 
disappeared into one of the bush-filled ravines lacing the area by the time 
police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been real frustrating for us not to get this guy," said Sgt. Al Coutts, 
who heads the sheriff's South County investigative team. "Most of us have small 
children, so we take this kind of thing very personally." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Capistrano Beach neighborhood where four of the incidents have taken 
place, the atmosphere of fright "has escalated enormously," said Jayne 
Canfield, principal of Palisades Elementary School, where the parents met 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, many more parents walk their kids to school," she said. "You don't see 
kids walking alone to school any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Nelson, a speaker from the Adam Walsh Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children, gave parents tips on child safety and told the parents at the meeting 
that the man "could live here. Any perpetrator can be your neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents handed out flyers with a drawing of the suspect; others gave out 
leaflets about neighborhood "safe houses," homes marked with bright red signs 
where children can run when they are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman demonstrated an alarm children can wear on their belts that emits a 
piercing screech when they tug on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the suspect is obviously familiar with the Capistrano Beach area, 
which is on a broad shelf of cliffs, pockmarked with narrow, wooded ravines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty neighborhood, but it's an easy place to get lost in," Martini 
said. "That's probably helped this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The same man is suspected of three other incidents of child harassment in 
March at Del Obispo Park, near Del Obispo Street and Pacific Coast Highway, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is about two miles from Palisades Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Canfield said that on May 27 a man exposed himself to a female student on an 
outdoor basketball court after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report given by the girl didn't match details the sheriffs previously had 
gotten," Canfield said.

COURT OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF SEXISM; TRIAL: TOP ADMINISTRATOR DENIES INSULTING 
FORMER EMPLOYEE, WHO SAYS THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FORCED HER TO RETIRE EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Did he? Or didn't he? That's what an Orange County jury is trying to decide in 
a sexual harassment case against Robert Kuhel, the Municipal Court 
administrator who is on trial in the same courthouse where he supervises more 
than 200 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Former employee Bonnie Severson alleges that Kuhel repeatedly called her a 
"bitch" at work -- an insult she says was sometimes preceded by such 
descriptions as "coldhearted" and "pigheaded." She says her boss created such a 
hostile work environment that she was forced to take early retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just reeks of the worst kind of sexism, as well as corruption of power," 
her lawyer, William M. Crosby, told jurors before they began deliberations 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuhel says Severson is all wrong and has denied the allegations. His 
lawyer characterized the case as unsubstantiated claims by a woman troubled by 
personal problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lawsuit is about nothing more than money," attorney Charles Matheis Jr., 
who is representing Kuhel and Orange County, told the jury during the trial's 
closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the jury believes Severson's allegations that Kuhel used those 
insults, the attorney said, there is no evidence that such comments amount to 
gender discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Severson is seeking more than $500,000 in compensation for lost wages and 
benefits as well as emotional distress from the county, and unspecified 
punitive damages from Kuhel. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil trial included testimony from two judges, and is the latest 
controversy to envelope the Municipal Court in Santa Ana, one of the busiest 
courts in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney faces misconduct charges filed in May by the 
state Commission on Judicial Performance, which investigated allegations that 
Whitney "coerced" guilty pleas from misdemeanor defendants and violated other 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County public defender's office, which lodged the complaint, 
alleged that Whitney and then-Presiding Judge James M. Brooks were determined 
to keep cases flowing smoothly at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney and Brooks have denied any wrongdoing. Defendants who entered guilty 
pleas before Whitney were allowed withdraw those pleas, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Gregory H. Lewis in Santa Ana also was the target of an 
investigation by the commission last year for allegedly using sexist and 
verbally abusive language in his dealings with attorneys, but Lewis said 
Wednesday that matter has been closed and no further action is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, now the presiding judge, said Wednesday that Kuhel's civil trial has 
had no effect on the day-to-day operations at the courthouse. The Municipal and 
Superior Court branches are housed in the same Santa Ana courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without him, this place is like a house of cards that would fall apart," 
Lewis said. "But he's been doing his job without missing a beat and we're just 
waiting for this case to be properly disposed of so we can all get back to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he could not discuss the pending lawsuit, but said he has known 
Kuhel for six years, and holds him in high regard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never known him to be overly aggressive with men or women," the judge 
said. "I'm having difficulty understanding why this all came about." 
</P>
<P>
 As the court's top administrator, Kuhel oversees more than 220 employees, 
about 80% of whom are women, according to court testimony. He earns about 
$80,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Severson started working as a court clerk in 1968, but said her problems with 
Kuhel did not start until 1983, when she was was promoted to court services 
division head. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she and Kuhel clashed, and that he insulted her repeatedly for 
several years until she retired from her $36,000-a-year job on her 50th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby said the harassment at work caused his client to lose sleep, become 
reclusive and finally seek medical treatment and counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why would a 50-year-old woman throw herself out on the job market unless she 
had to," said Susan P. Addy, an attorney also representing Severson. 
</P>
<P>
 Severson filed the lawsuit in 1990 and has started working successfully as a 
real estate agent, but only after a substantial struggle to find a new career, 
her lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his closing arguments before the jury, Matheis said Severson's apparent 
health problems were caused by personal problems at home, not a hostile work 
environment, and that she told others she was retiring to "try something else." 
In her retirement letter she expressed "appreciation to all concerned for the 
opportunities and support." 
</P>
<P>
 He also added that Kuhel was responsible for her being selected for the 1983 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhel conceded that he had given Severson a novelty note pad at one point 
inscribed with the phrase "From the desk of the bitch," but that another female 
employee picked out the gift, Matheis told the jury.

 The lawyer said that Severson lacked any witnesses from work who could back up 
her claims, even though she alluded to such people in her testimony. 
Ultimately, Matheis said, the jury's decision will come down to who it believes 
is most credible.

 Deliberations by the six-man, six-woman jury continue today before Superior

ANAHEIM BEAUTIFICATION COULD HAVE AN UGLY SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A $200-million plan to eliminate urban decay around Disneyland and make it 
more inviting could create a host of new problems, as millions more tourists 
clog city streets, pollute the air and overstuff landfills with trash, 
documents released Wednesday show. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the proposed "Anaheim Resort," as the city dubs the area, is 
designed to encourage development, increase tax revenues and keep the city 
competitive in the tourism industry. It would allow up to 16,000 new hotel 
rooms in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the downside, the city's environmental report identifies about a dozen 
"significant" impacts ranging from overcrowded schools to long shadows cast 
over nearby residences. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plan is a companion to the Walt Disney Co.'s proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort, which would be the driving economic force within the 
district. City officials emphasize, however, that the plan will go forward 
whether Disney builds or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's plan, about 550 acres surrounding Disneyland would be 
transformed into a lushly landscaped district with wide walkways and plants to 
give the area an almost-tropical appearance. Ugly overhead utility lines would 
be buried, while businesses would be encouraged to replace gaudy neon signage 
with more understated commercial ones.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district is roughly triangular in shape, bounded by Orangewood Avenue to 
the south, Walnut Street to the west, Haster Street to the east and the Santa 
Ana Freeway running diagonally to the north. It includes Disneyland, the 
Anaheim Convention Center and most of the area's high-rise hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Tom Wood, who helped oversee the plan's drafting, said 
that it is the most economically vital area of the city, but needs the 
improvements to remain healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed that Anaheim residents would not be obliged to bear any costs of the 
project. It would be funded by a 2% increase in the hotel bed tax -- from 13% 
to 15% -- and a landscaping assessment fee to pay for the upkeep of bushes and 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 He also emphasized that all existing businesses will be welcome to stay in the 
tourist-oriented area, but said any new development or additions would be 
required to conform with the plan's development guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business and community leaders on Wednesday praised the proposed urban 
renewal effort as a innovative way to overhaul antiquated streets, sewers and 
other public infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim needs to be rejuvenated, and beautification is a major issue," said 
Bill O'Connell, general manager and co-owner of four motels around the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, however, were more cautious in their support, raising concerns 
over how the $200-million to $300-million plan would be funded. They also 
questioned the wisdom of proceeding with the project at a time when the Disney 
Co. is balking at building its Disneyland expansion, which would add another 
theme park and 5,000 Disney hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no benefit if (Disney) doesn't build, and in fact it's extremely 
costly," said Steve White, a local real estate broker active in a community 
group called Anaheim Home Owners for Maintaining Their Environment (HOME).  
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said last week that they will put off a decision on whether 
to build their resort until at least next year. Previously, it had been 
expected the company might decide as soon as this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Kintz, HOME president, said that all of Anaheim is in need of 
rejuvenation, not just the Disneyland area. "Why stop there? They should do the 
entire city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kintz added, the city is focusing entirely on the Disneyland area 
because "the mouse is myopic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said the plan is needed to remain competitive in the tourism industry, 
especially in light of efforts by Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Diego to gain 
larger shares of the profitable convention market. He added that transforming 
the area should take about 10 years to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Future developers will also be asked to pay their "fair share" of improvements 
made in the so-called Anaheim Resort area. Such improvements include sewer 
lines, streets, fire and police services and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the impacts found in the city's document are: traffic congestion at four 
city intersections; elimination of 56 acres of prime agricultural land -- a 
strawberry field north of the Disneyland Hotel; incompatible land uses next to 
residential areas and air pollution, as well as various impacts associated with 
construction. The plan will also require significantly more water, electric and 
natural gas resources. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the impacts do not outweigh the social and economic 
benefits of going forward with the project. More than 18,000 jobs will be 
created in the Anaheim Resort area, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the environmental review, the city released planning documents 
establishing new zoning, height and density guidelines. The goal, city 
officials said, is to transform the busy architectural mix of cheap motels and 
souvenir shops to beautiful integrated projects, pleasing to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the businesses in the area doubt the good intentions of the plan. They 
only question how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the revitalization of the . . . area is crucial, but we are 
concerned and curious about how the city plans to finance infrastructure and 
landscaping for the purpose," said Frank Elfend, a consultant who represents 
several area property owners. He said any costs must be borne by all property 
owners, not just those who are building or making additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Zaby, whose family owns three hotels in the area, said "Anaheim is 
getting too expensive" and that businesses like his would be asked to pay more 
to support the improvements at a time when customers are paying less. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has 45 days to review and make comments to city about the proposed 
resort plan and the environmental impacts. After the review period, the city 
will respond to the public's concerns and present the documents to the city's 
planning commission and city council for further public scrutiny. The project 
will go forward if and when the City Council approves the environmental and 
planning documents.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TEAMING UP FOR A TREK OVERLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim and Judy Beard didn't know a thing about vintage cars, let alone how to 
fix one. 
</P>
<P>
 But two years ago, after watching the Interstate Batteries Great American Race 
of antique cars on television, Jim Beard fell in love with classic cars racing 
across the country and planned to enter the race the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of buying one classic car, they bought two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach couple now own a 1932 Willys-Overland roadster and a 1931 La 
Salle roadster. They will be among 85 teams, including nine from Orange County, 
in the 12th annual Great American Race that begins at noon Sunday at the 
Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers and their navigators, competing for up to $250,000 in cash and prizes, 
will trek 4,300 miles, stopping at 45 cities in 14 states before rolling past 
the finish line in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Beards entered the race for the first time and drove "Slick 
Willy," a black-and-white convertible. Because the car made it across the 
country without a problem, they will take it again this year, said Judy Beard, 
57, who will navigate. They did not win any awards but they finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed the oil in Indianapolis and that was it," said Jim Beard, 63, a 
land developer and retired Navy pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard said he entered the race for the experience of seeing the United States 
on back roads and meeting folks who live in small towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prize money -- we'll never win it. We're in it for the fun," Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The race will cost them $12,000 to $15,000, which includes the $6,500 entry 
fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Beard agreed that the people they meet along the way make the event 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, the people in all the little towns would come out and greet us. 
The streets were lined with trucks and families and they would wave American 
flags. . . . It's hard to describe. You get such a high." 
</P>
<P>
 Other race participants are in the race to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Newt Withers, 52, of Anaheim, a Goodyear tire dealer, has tried to win every 
race since it started 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not won the rally's top prize, but he did finish third in 1988, 1989 
and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he will drive his red, brass-trimmed 1912 Oldsmobile Autocrat, 
originally priced at $3,875, Withers said. Today, only four cars of its kind 
are left in the world and its value is $375,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Withers' navigator is Wayne Stanfield, 46, a plumbing contractor who lives in 
Santa Ana and was on the team that won the event in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanfield said the secret is preparation, and the pair have fine-tuned their 
navigation skills and planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Vowed Stanfield, "We're going to win -- and the last time I said that was in 
'87." -- DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; AUTO CLUB DRIVES FOR OK ON PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Automobile Club of Southern California says it may leave town and take its 
jobs and sales taxes to a friendlier community if it does not get approval to 
expand its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Further delays are unacceptable and will be considered a denial of the 
project," said Auto Club President Thomas McKernan in a letter sent to city 
officials June 9 after the City Council postponed for two weeks a decision on 
the auto club proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto club, one of the biggest in the nation with 1.3 million members in 
Southern California, plans to add 500,000-square feet of space to its 
administrative offices at 3333 Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional space will be used to combine the club's work force of about 
2,500 in Los Angeles and Orange counties over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion could pump in an additional $2.2 million into the local economy, 
according to an independent study. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Sandra L. Genis said that leaving the city would be "ill-conceived." 
She said that unless the auto club has begun negotiations with another city, 
the group would have to begin from scratch.  
</P>
<P>
 Genis insisted that with a project as big as the auto club's, a delay is not 
unusual and would give the city time to scrutinize the project, possibly 
avoiding lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it takes two weeks to have the last loose ends tied, it's a pretty good 
bargain in the long run," Genis said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Allan L. Roeder said the council will consider an environmental 
impact report on the project Monday. The council also will consider a proposal 
to change the zone designation of the 29 1/2-acre site from industrial to urban 
center commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the environmental report and the zone change, Roeder 
said that an agreement between the city and the auto club would have to be 
reached before construction could start. 
</P>
<P>
 Layna Browdy, an auto club spokeswoman, said that the expansion would be 
phased in over a period of several years "to show the community our long-term 
intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Genis, a professional planner, said that community members are concerned about 
the potential traffic problems the project could produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Genis said she wants to maintain a balance between residential areas and 
commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members -- Joe Erickson and Mary Hornbuckle -- said Wednesday the 
project would be good for the city, and it would be unfortunate if the auto 
club decides to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to expand," Erickson said. "If they can't do it here, they will do 
it elsewhere. I'd like to keep them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornbuckle said that the auto club may appear as if it's threatening the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, they're just being honest," Hornbuckle said. "They have a need 
and they want to make sure we understand their need." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 1 DEAD, 2 HURT AS CAR CRASHES INTO TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old man was killed late Tuesday night when the car he was riding in 
veered out of control and crashed into a tree, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Valencia Wilson Jr. of San Clemente was pronounced dead at the scene 
of the crash, which occurred at 11:40 p.m. on Crown Valley Parkway just east of 
Seven Seas Drive, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, DeWayne Gurrel Allison, 18, of San Clemente, injured 
his back. Another passenger, Joseph Rufas, 19, of San Juan Capistrano, was 
pinned inside the vehicle and it took firefighters about 90 minutes to remove 
him. He suffered minor injuries, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufas and Allison were taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo, where they were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that Allison was caravaning with three other cars as they 
returned from Aliso Beach. Allison lost control of the car, striking the curb 
twice before skidding across the grass on the center divider and smashing into 
a eucalyptus tree, Martini said. The impact of the crash was on the right front 
passenger door, where Wilson was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have not yet determined what caused the accident, but Martini 
said it does not appear to be alcohol-related. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; MALL SIGN APPROVED DESPITE OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over objections from Laguna Hills officials, the City Council has approved 
signage for a planned store in the Freeway Center shopping mall, which is under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cities disagreed whether a six-foot sign to be perched atop the 
proposed Thieves Market retail store is a wall sign or a roof sign, the latter 
being prohibited under a Mission Viejo planning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign will go on a 33-foot-tall triangular structure to be constructed on 
the rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills is upset about the sign, believing it will be big and highly 
visible to the hillside residents near the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand they see that as a wall," Laguna Hills Planning Director 
Michael Thiele said. "But it's right on top of the roof and their code clearly 
prohibits any sign above the visible roof line." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mission Viejo planners and the City Council said the proposed six- 
foot sign was clearly a wall sign and plans for the Thieves Market retail store 
were unanimously approved Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign would represent the Western boot and clothing store and is part of a 
290,000-square-foot outdoor mall in Mission Viejo next to Laguna Hills at 
Pacific Parkway and Cabot Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has been a legal battleground in the past for the two cities, with 
Laguna Hills fighting for some control of the development, which sits next to 
Nellie Gail Ranch, an upscale housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities settled their lawsuit by agreeing to let Laguna Hills have advance 
plans for all stores in the mall and participate in the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiele said Laguna Hills is concerned that Mission Viejo's ruling on Monday 
would set a precedent for the rest of the development. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mission Viejo officials assured Laguna Hills Monday that future 
applications would be looked at "on a case-by-case basis," Councilman Joseph 
Lowe said. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 Community groups and residents are invited to participate in making the 
official Mission Viejo History Book. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being organized by the city's historical society and will 
encompass aspects of Mission Viejo life. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations can submit photos and information about their groups, and the 
submissions must be on official forms available at City Hall and the Mission 
Viejo Library. The forms can be returned to City Hall, 26522 La Alameda. Photos 
will not be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical society is also calling on people who have been community 
leaders during the past 30 years to offer their views on the city's growth.  
</P>
<P>
 Society members say the book will rely on interviews and photos reflecting the 
city's development since the Mission Viejo Co. first built homes in the area in 
the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The book will have categories such as land development, schools, sports and 
recreation, religion, local government and business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit service groups in the general South County area that have 
significant Mission Viejo membership also will be noted in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical society will sell copies of the book once it is completed.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL BALKS AT TAX FOR EQUESTRIAN TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to create a winding equestrian and hiking trail through the center of 
the city has hit a snag because the City Council refused recently to assess 
residents the $40 a year needed to pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many in the city support the concept, officials said it was unfair to 
make Irvine homeowners pay for it when the city prohibits residents from 
boarding horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we want people crisscrossing our city on their horses with our 
residents paying for it," Mayor Michael Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed trail would run along the San Diego Creek and link up with a 
countywide equestrian route system. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials as well as outdoor enthusiasts have hailed the system, saying 
it will one day allow hikers, mountain bikers and equestrians to roam to 
different parks throughout the county without dealing with surface street 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 At a council meeting last month, several horse riders urged officials to 
approve the plan. But council members rejected it, saying they couldn't justify 
taxing residents in newer developments such as Westpark $40 a year for the next 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward and others said the trail assessment could be much less if the county did 
not insist on modifying the San Diego Creek channel while the trail is being 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The county wants the channel paved at several intersections so that 
maintenance trucks can pass through the area to make inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The creek trail would pass under several major roadways, including the San 
Diego Freeway, Michelson Drive and Barranca Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the county wants it, the county should pay for it," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 An existing bike trail along the creek will not be affected by the council's 
action. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; ACQUISITION PUSHES BUDGET TO RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved a $15-million budget for the coming 
fiscal year, the largest spending plan in the city's six-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget is more than $2 million higher than the 1993-94 budget because the 
city has acquired the former Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District, said 
Rita Geldert, the city's director of finance and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Until dissolving last December because of cuts in state funding, the 
independent district had maintained all city parks and run the city's 
recreation programs for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pick up more income by absorbing the park district, but you also pick up 
a heck of a lot more expense," Councilman Mike Eggers said after the spending 
plan was approved Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Geldert cautiously labeled the city's financial situation "healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we are healthy, but the main concern is the announcement made from 
the governor's office of the potential for additional property tax reductions," 
Geldert said. "That is certainly a concern in adopting a budget, knowing we may 
have to come back with some modifications." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the police service contract with the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department makes up the city's largest expenditure at $4.2 million, up about 
$300,000 from last year, Geldert said. The higher cost comes despite the 
council's decision not to pay the estimated $31,200 for helicopter service for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The second costliest budget item is public works, including solid waste, parks 
and park maintenance, engineering and street repair, Geldert said. The cost of 
the various public works programs is estimated at $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As is usual in Dana Point, bed taxes make up the largest share of the city's 
revenue, Geldert said. An estimated $3.6 million is expected to be generated 
from the city's hotels and motels, about the same amount the city received this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always try to be conservative with our estimates, but we are figuring on 
about the same amount as it worked out to this year," Geldert said. Among the 
leading generators of the bed tax is the Ritz-Carlton hotel, which "assists us 
quite a bit," Geldert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next highest revenue sources are property taxes and sales taxes, which are 
projected to be $2.3 million and $2.25 million, respectively, Geldert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has about $15 million in a variety of reserve accounts, 
including about $3.4 million put away for a civic center, Geldert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William L. Ossenmacher called it a "reasonable budget" but said he 
would like to see lower personnel costs. Ossenmacher said the city should 
reduce spending for car allowances to department heads and cut the city's 
contribution to employee retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city has been extremely generous with its employees," Ossenmacher said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY CRITICIZED IN PRESCHOOL LOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents have charged that the city mishandled events surrounding the 
resignations of four staff members at a city-run preschool, claiming that city 
workers padlocked the doors of Kids Corner and prevented the employees from 
retrieving their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the preschool at Darrell Essex Park Friday to handle a 
protest by the instructors and parents that arose after the padlocking, said 
Police Chief Daryl Wicker. Wicker said officers were dispatched to keep order 
and that no arrests resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, on the advice of City Atty. John E. Cavanaugh, declined to 
discuss the situation in public Monday but later were briefed in closed 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 In comments to the council, residents accused the city of trying to humiliate 
the four instructors who resigned over a dispute that involved the scheduling 
of work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Creager, the husband of Susan Creager, one of the four workers who 
resigned from Kids Corner, told the council that the padlocking action was "a 
blatant act of public humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an interview, Creager said, "The children were out in the park 
playing -- they had just had a picnic -- when all of a sudden maintenance 
(employees) showed up with padlocks. Parents came to the support" of 
instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Creager said that she and the three other staffers submitted letters of 
resignation June 9. The resignations stemmed from disagreement over work hours 
policy and how that policy affects potential retirement benefits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Creager told the council that he plans a wrongful-termination lawsuit 
against the city on behalf of his wife. After he made that comment, Cavanaugh 
advised the City Council to say nothing publicly about the Kids Corner staff 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Monday night City Council meeting, Mayor Richard Partin said he did 
not know much about the Kids Corner controversy and asked for a staff briefing. 
"I'd like the details of it," Partin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cavanaugh repeated his warning and the council later held a closed-door 
session to be briefed on the matter. Such sessions are allowed by state law 
when the threat of litigation is involved. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PARENTS PROTEST CUTS IN SCHOOLS' PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal by the Fountain Valley School District to cut an instrumental music 
program to balance next school year's budget has hit a sour note with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to slash hours of school librarians also stirred protest among parents 
and library workers at last week's Board of Trustees meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, teachers and students opposed to eliminating the two programs 
appealed to trustees to save them and submitted petitions supporting their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said about $250,000 in cutbacks are needed to balance the 
projected $24-million 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecker, assistant superintendent of administration and business, said the 
district has no choice but to make budget reductions because revenue isn't as 
high as expected and the district continues to lose money due to declining 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker said that as a first step to balance the budget, $170,000 was shaved 
from district office overhead and operating expenses. Savings if the music 
program for fourth- and fifth-graders were eliminated would be $114,000, Ecker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 375 students participate in the program, said Catherine Follett, 
director of curriculum and instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to cut the library program would trim services at each of the 11 
schools. Librarians' hours were reduced a few years ago and currently employees 
work 3 1/2 hours to 5 1/2 hours a day, Follett said. Under the budget cut 
proposal, librarians would work about three hours a day at each school, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker said the result would be a $66,000 savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed cuts include reducing night custodian work hours to save about 
$45,000 and limiting trustee conference and membership costs, at a saving of 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees plan to meet again today to discuss the budget. A final vote is 
scheduled for June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and music students at Fountain Valley High School told trustees that 
the music program is essential in a child's early development and increases 
students' self-esteem as well as piquing interest in fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Dinger, 16, was among the high school's music students who testified 
about the benefits of keeping the elementary program. Dinger, who will be next 
year's drum major, said music has affected every aspect of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found that music was something I was good at," he told trustees. "It's 
shaped my personality and given me a chance to be a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Follett said the district is looking at alternative ways to provide a music 
program. One suggestion is to offer low-cost music lessons after or before 
school with parents paying the cost, she said. A scholarship fund could also be 
developed for children whose parents couldn't afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheryl Hamlin, a 17-year district employee and library services specialist who 
is retiring this summer, said the proposed library services cuts affect "every 
single student in our district." 
</P>
<P>
 "Libraries to me are just so basic to a child's learning," she said. "The kids 
are going to be the losers."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALLED TRIO VOTES TO EXTEND UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and City Council members Molly McClanahan 
and Don Bankhead have been recalled over a 2% utility tax they voted for last 
year, they voted again this week to keep the tax to help balance the city's 
$81.2-million budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was reminiscent of the 3-2 vote taken last July, when the utility 
tax was initially approved. Council members Julie Sa and Chris Norby cast the 
dissenting votes both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead voted to impose the utility tax for 
a year despite protests from hundreds of residents. The 2% tax was needed to 
help save police and fire department jobs, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the utility tax, Catlin said, "is a responsible but difficult decision 
we had to make in the face of the general public's unacceptance of taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to give final approval to next year's budget at a 
public hearing July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Morton was one of few residents who attended the council's two sessions 
this week when it discussed the budget. He asked the council to consider 
cutting all city administrators' pay by 20% rather than keeping the utility 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the movement that staged a successful recall election against 
Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead later criticized the trio for voting to renew 
the tax in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like their last stand," said Thomas S. Babcock, chairman of the 
Fullerton Recalls Committee, which is interviewing 15 potential council 
candidates for endorsement. "They're taking a strong stand even though they've 
been recalled. They're going to do it their way until they are removed from 
office. That's very selfish of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin countered, "A new council could rescind the tax but . . . right now, we 
are facing a very cloudy economic picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead said they will remain in office until a 
special election is held in November to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby, who proposed putting the utility tax on the November ballot, said he 
voted against the tax because he believes city services could be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Letting the voters decide whether they want the tax, he said, "would give the 
next council direction. There will be lingering divisiveness in the community 
unless the people vote for what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 City administrators said the utility tax would generate about $3 million next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the city had to eliminate 20 jobs. Most of the positions are in the 
maintenance and community services departments and are already vacant, 
officials said. They consist of clerical assistants, tree trimmers, custodians 
and maintenance workers.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; LIBRARY PANEL TO HIRE COLLECTION AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've been ignoring those polite letters from the library reminding you to 
return library materials and pay overdue fines, watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 The next round of letters might not be as polite and won't be from the 
library. Also, they will add $15 to your fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved a plan by the Library Commission to hire a 
collection agency to go after an estimated 300 library patrons who did not 
return more than 2,000 books, tapes and other materials to the library during 
the 1992-93 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Library Director CarolAnn Tassios said the cost of replacing the unreturned 
items was about $33,000. She did not know how much in uncollected fines the 
library had lost during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons with overdue materials and fines will still receive two notices from 
the library, Tassios said. But patrons with materials or fines totaling $50 or 
more who don't respond to the notices will be turned over to Advanced 
Collection Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection agency will send out five notices to delinquent patrons. Those 
who don't respond after the first three notices will be reported to TRW, a 
credit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Tassios said credit reports would be cleared of the library debt eventually 
whether or not patrons respond to the notices. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda was one of the few libraries in the state not contracting with a 
collection agency to retrieve unreturned materials. In a report to the City 
Council, Tassios said other libraries have experienced an average return rate 
of 70% when using a collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since library staff currently spends 12% of the materials budgets on 
replacing lost items, using a collection agency will allow the budget to be 
spent almost entirely on purchase of new titles," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to the library of contracting with the collection agency is $8.25 per 
delinquent patron. Library staff time will add about $10.50 to that figure. To 
cover a portion of the total, the library will add a $15 collection fee to all 
accounts turned over to ACS. 
</P>
<P>
 The new procedure goes into effect July 1. However, Tassios said the library 
will not turn over any accounts to ACS until August. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SUSPECT LEADS CHASE THROUGH SEVEN CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A score of police officers in patrol cars and on motorcycles chased an auto 
theft suspect through seven Orange County cities Wednesday before arresting him 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Scott Sullivan, 27, of Tustin was being held without bail in the 
Anaheim City Jail on suspicion of auto theft, possession of stolen property and 
evading officers, Sgt. Kennet G. Brott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began just after noon in a shopping center at Lincoln Avenue and 
Beach Boulevard in Anaheim, police said. An officer noticed that the passenger 
window of a parked pickup truck was smashed, checked the vehicle's license 
plate through a computer, and it came back as stolen, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sullivan returned to the truck, he refused to pull over, Brott said, "and 
off we went." 
</P>
<P>
 The chase, involving officers from various jurisdictions, proceeded through 
areas of Buena Park, Cypress, Fullerton, Brea, Yorba Linda, back to Anaheim and 
finally to Orange, Brott said. There were no collisions or injuries, and 
Sullivan was taken into custody without incident.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINISTER; PETROLEUM WASTE REMOVAL PACT GIVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fremont firm has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency to begin excavating and disposing of 45,000 cubic yards of 
hazardous petroleum waste buried beneath 25 houses here. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4-million contract was awarded Wednesday to Rust Remedial Services Inc. 
after a bidding process that spanned 10 months and included offers from about a 
dozen firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selection was based on both technical qualifications and cost," project 
manager Dick Vesperman said of the winning bid. "This is a very experienced 
environmental remediation firm. They developed an approach to cleaning up the 
site that appears to be very effective both in terms of excavation and 
disposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the area have been complaining about the stench of the tarlike 
substance oozing from the ground since 1936, when the owner of a trucking firm 
dumped petroleum waste into four open pits. Later, in 1958, a developer moved 
the waste into two trenches buried under back yards of a housing tract he was 
building. In 1992 the area was added to the national priorities list of 
Superfund sites by the EPA, thus qualifying for federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vesperman, the cleanup will be done in two phases: half this 
summer and half next summer. After relocating affected families in late July, 
he said, the excavation is set to begin by Aug. 1 and last three or four 
months. During the work, he said, all back-yard constructions -- including 
patios, swimming pools and added rooms -- will be removed. Workers will then 
use bulldozers to dig about 15 feet into the ground and remove the hazardous 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the families return, Vesperman said, all demolished constructions will 
be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's total cost, including excavation, family relocation and 
reconstruction, is expected to be about $15 million, Vesperman said. DAVID

LEGAL SERVICES FIRM BARRED FROM BILLING UNTIL DOCUMENTS DELIVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local legal services agency was barred Wednesday from engaging in unfair 
business practices after the Orange County district attorney's office accused 
the agency head of taking payment for duties promised but never performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge James H. Poole issued a preliminary 
injunction against Stewart A. Embry and SOS Legal Services, and additionally 
ordered Embry to prepare and provide customers with copies of the court 
documents filed before he can receive payment for future work, according to a 
statement released by Orange County Dist. Atty.Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ordered Embry to notify customers of his whereabouts since he 
has been evicted from his offices, according to the statement. The agency 
assists customers by filing and preparing legal documents, including divorce 
and bankruptcy petitions.  
</P>
<P>
 Embry could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A recording said the phone 
number is no longer in service. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, a victim paid Embry to file documents opposing his eviction 
from his home. The documents were never filed, however, and the victim was 
forced to move, according to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, a woman sought Embry's help in filing bankruptcy documents 
but later learned the documents were never filed with the court. She has been 
unable to get a refund, or have her original documents returned, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are seeking a permanent injunction in the upcoming weeks, 
restitution to victims and payment of civil penalties, according to the 
statement.

SEWER AGENCY REJECTS CLAIMS IN 2 FIRE DEATHS; ACCIDENT: DECISION CLEARS WAY FOR 
POSSIBLE LAWSUITS BY FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS. D.A.'S OFFICE IS CONDUCTING 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Sanitation Districts has rejected claims for damages filed 
by the families of two men killed earlier this year in a fire at a Huntington 
Beach sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision paves the way for a possible civil court fight. Claremont 
attorney Greg K. Hafif was notified Wednesday of the decision and said he 
intends to pursue negligence claims against the sanitation agency related to 
the Feb. 1 fire that killed Joe Patterson and Robin Miller, both employees of 
an Ontario-based engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that somebody should pay for this, because I'm paying every day," said 
Patterson's father, Andy C. Patterson. "The loss has been unbearable for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sanitation agency officials have hired special legal counsel to 
deal with a related personnel dispute involving a sanitation agency laboratory 
manager who has been cooperating with local prosecutors in their investigation 
of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 At an initial cost of $25,000, agency officials have retained attorney Craig 
Scott, in part to address claims filed by Louis Sangermano, who has alleged 
that agency officials are seeking to oust him because of his cooperation in an 
ongoing district attorney's investigation of the fatal fire and other matters, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials also indicated that Scott would look into allegations that 
Sangermano engaged in sexual harassment of other agency employees. Neither 
Sangermano, who is on a medical leave from his $85,000-a-year position, nor his 
attorneys could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local prosecutors are trying to determine whether there were criminal 
violations related to the fire, including whether sanitation agency officials 
may have withheld critical information from state authorities during a separate 
investigation. Last month, the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration cited both the sanitation agency and the Ontario engineering 
firm Pascal and Ludwig for serious safety violations in connection with the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was referred to the district attorney's office by Cal/OSHA 
investigators for further review. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation agency spokeswoman Corinne Clawson said Wednesday that the 
rejection of claims filed by the victims' families was a "routine" legal 
maneuver followed when parties give notice that they are preparing possible 
court action against the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the allegations in the families' complaint against the agency was that 
its officials did not notify Patterson or Miller that they were working in a 
potentially hazardous area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cause of the fire has not been determined, officials have 
speculated that a spark from a chipping hammer used by the workers could have 
ignited a combustible mixture of enriched oxygen present near the work site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they (the prosecutors) should go as far as they can to find out what 
happened there," Andy Patterson said. "I lost somebody I loved very much."

GRAND JURY CRITICIZES JAIL COSTS, OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury blamed an inexperienced team of contractors and 
designers for contributing to $233,000 in cost overruns during the construction 
of the new City Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging report issued Wednesday, jurors also took issue with what 
they described as the jail's "controversial" system of inmate management, and 
expressed concern over whether prisoners were getting enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials said the jail meals meet state nutritional standards, 
the grand jury contended that the portions "appeared to be insufficient for an 
adult." The report also found that federal prisoners detained at the facility 
were provided additional "snacks and beverages" that were not available to 
other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expressed disappointment with the grand jury's overall 
assessment of jail development and operations, describing the report as "a 
little misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's hard to do an analysis when you are not part of the process," 
said Francisco Gutierrez, executive assistant to City Manager David N. Ream. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.9-million jail opened in December after an 18-month construction delay. 
It is designed as a temporary detention center until the city can build a 
planned $90-million facility, four times the size of the 78-bed jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report comes after a glowing review of the first six months of 
jail operations issued June 1 by the Santa Ana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have established and sustained a calm, peaceful, non-threatening 
environment which ensures safety and security for staff, inmates and visitors," 
the police report stated. "The facility has been inspected by a federal judge 
and representatives of the U.S. Marshal's Office. They found the facility well 
managed and had high praise for the overall operation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the grand jury was particularly critical of the cost overruns and project 
delays. Jurors found that there was little justification to support costly 
design changes, while project managers were cited for being unfamiliar with 
state and local construction regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said most of the additional costs were incurred after city officials 
decided to increase capacity from 48 beds to 78. The delays, he said, were due 
to poor weather and the relocation of utility lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, we not only got a fine facility, but we got a great deal," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the quantity of food provided for inmates, Gutierrez said the menus 
meet or exceed the state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail meals are prepared by the nearby Boardwalk Cafe, where manager Bryan 
Leighton said preparation has been supervised by a UC Irvine dietitian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell that the roast beef we serve at the jail is the same as we serve 
in our restaurant," Leighton said, referring to portion sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager said typical jail dinners include either lasagna, chicken, beef 
stew or meatloaf. All dinners are served with rice, a vegetable and roll. As a 
beverage, inmates get a choice of milk or fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds good to me," Leighton said. "We just don't put these menus together 
randomly. These are designed to meet the needs of an average person in the 
general population."

UCI PANEL RESPONDS TO COST-CUTTING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A UC Irvine advisory group that examined proposals to cut the university's 
budget by about $4 million has asked Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening to keep the 
education department open but agreed with plans to close its comparative 
culture program, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-April, the 19-member Academic Planning Council has pored over nearly 
700 written responses from the campus community to two task force reports 
issued in February that suggested ways to trim the budget, a UCI spokeswoman 
said. Many of those letters opposed recommendations outlined in task force 
reports to close the education department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's recommendation to keep the education department open "sends a 
strong signal that these (educational) services are important contributions 
that the campus makes to the community," UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been an outpouring of support for the education department," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council -- made up of faculty and staff members, administrators and 
students -- gave Wilkening the report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening will consider the council's report before she announces her plans on 
budget cuts sometime during the summer, UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members supported several suggestions on academic issues made by the 
two cost-cutting task forces: ending the comparative culture program for 
undergraduates and combining film studies and art history in an experimental 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council opposed various other task force recommendations on academic 
issues that included closing the physical education department; combining 
women's and ethnic studies programs into other existing schools; and 
consolidating the Spanish department with Chicano/Latino studies and Latin 
American studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening announced Wednesday that she supports all the council's conclusions 
on those academic issues, Granell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academic Planning Council, chaired by acting Executive Vice Chancellor 
Spencer Olin, set a lofty goal for UCI joining the upper echelons of academia, 
according to the council report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aspiration is to move UCI into the 'front rank' of the nation's research 
universities," the report said. "During the next decade, both UCI's research 
and graduate programs, and its undergraduate programs, should aspire to be 
among the 30 best in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members suggested that administrators move forward with that vision by 
carefully managing campus money. They also suggested investing in programs at 
UCI that are already distinguished and contribute to bettering education as 
well as research.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very supportive of the . . . report's focus on educational issues and 
moving UCI forward into the higher tiers of national universities," Wilkening 
said.

 President Clinton on Wednesday announced his intention to appoint Janice M. 
Johnson, long a prominent Laguna Beach patron of the arts, to the Committee for 
the Preservation of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the wife of General Services Administrator Roger W. Johnson, would 
serve on the committee that reports to the President and advises the National 
Park Service about the preservation and interpretation of the museum character 
of the White House.The committee is primarily concerned with the principal 
corridor on the ground floor of the presidential mansion, as well as the main 
public rooms on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A former music teacher and lifelong patron of the arts, Johnson moved to 
Washington with her husband last year when he was appointed by Clinton to head 
the GSA, making him the highest-ranking Republican in the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but the White House said 
her appointment is imminent, the paperwork needing only to be processed.  
</P>
<P>
 Now a resident of Georgetown, Johnson is already a member of the Board of 
Directors of the National Symphony Orchestra and Stratford Hall Board. She has 
also served on the boards of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Planned 
Parenthood, South Coast Repertory, the Pacific Symphony Assn. and the Board of 
the Art Institute of Southern California. She also was a founding member of 
Opera Pacific. In 1990, she was named the YWCA's "Woman of the Year for Arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a registered Republican, Johnson and her husband supported Clinton in 
1991. Her husband is the former CEO of Irvine-based Western Digital, a Fortune 
500 company.

SQUATTERS' RIGHTS; APARTMENT BUILDINGS ABANDONED AFTER QUAKE ATTRACTING 
SCAVENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Alvarez lives in what might be charitably called a mixed neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroin addicts keep to the apartments near the flood control channel. The 
hookers and crack dealers work the cul-de-sac across the street. Gang members 
are infrequent visitors, dropping by occasionally to drink some beers, bust a 
few windows and leave some more scrawl. 
</P>
<P>
 And the homeless find a quiet corner where they can. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a definite hierarchy among the inhabitants living in the string of 
abandoned apartment buildings that surround the intersection of Hubbard Street 
and El Dorado Avenue in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez considers himself near the top of the heap. After all, he is working 
for his food and cigarette money. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and two companions took a break Wednesday -- in between carting off 
furniture, appliances and anything else of value -- to talk about their 
informal recovery operation, also known as scavenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get $5 for these," he said, pointing to a set of window blinds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two months, Alvarez and dozens of others have been living in 11 
or so apartment buildings in this neighborhood that were abandoned by residents 
after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have $20 million, but are seeking additional federal money for 
fences -- even security guards -- to seal off quake-damaged buildings left 
abandoned throughout the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. Officials Tuesday 
identified 10 "ghost towns," clusters of empty quake-ravaged buildings in 
Sylmar, Northridge, Canoga Park, Sherman Oaks and Hollywood. Adjacent neighbors 
and police have already noticed rising crime rates, which they attribute to the 
ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far turned down requests 
for additional funds, saying it is a local problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners in the Sylmar neighborhood say they don't have the money to 
fix up their property or, in some cases, put up fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city signs ordering people away have long been torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they are really necessary. Huge cracks run across entire walls, 
overhangs pitch forward as if about to fall and there is broken glass 
everywhere. Most front doors are open or torn from their hinges. And inside, 
carpets have been ripped from the floors, appliances -- even kitchen faucets -- 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remain in many apartments are broken furniture, flies, paper trash, 
beer bottles, animal droppings and rotting food. In their haste to remove their 
possessions in the days following the earthquake, residents left behind only 
scraps of their lives here: a kindergarten report card, a brown teddy bear, 
empty prescription bottles, personal letters, a pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no running water and the electricity has been shut off. In several of 
the buildings, some squatters have managed to turn the electricity back on. 
</P>
<P>
 But without any fencing, even those dreary -- and dangerous -- conditions fail 
to discourage those seeking free shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those living here say as many as 50 people have passed through the buildings 
in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike some of his layabout neighbors, Alvarez said he isn't opposed to 
putting in a day of work now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're gonna throw this stuff away. At least we can get some cigarettes and 
food out of it," said Alvarez, dressed in shirt, pants and shoes found in one 
of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was among those who lost his apartment during the quake, and has 
been unable to find any construction work since then. So, he said he has lived 
in the abandoned buildings, moving from apartment to apartment, bunking in 
"whichever one is the cleanest." 
</P>
<P>
 His companion, Jess Torres -- another out-of-work laborer -- holds up a clock 
radio that he hopes will fetch $5. "This is lunch, a hamburger and a soft 
drink," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two homeless men are piling the stuff into the back of Terry Bratton's 
pickup truck. Bratton has a home but said he is trying to keep a family afloat 
on disability payments. So he needs the extra income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just scavenging what I can," said Bratton, who lives in Sylmar. "We had 
someone who wanted a dresser but we haven't been able to find one." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the first-floor air-conditioning units are gone from the apartments on 
the 14600 block of Hubbard Street. They were sold for $10 each, the same rate 
paid for refrigerators and washing machines, the men said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the city attorney's office said the men have no right to take 
the property. As a practical matter, they will not be prosecuted for the petty 
thefts, a misdemeanor, unless the owner of the property reports it stolen to 
police, said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman for the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that happens, what are they going to do to two homeless men? asked 
Alvarez. Put them in jail, give them a few free meals and a chance to shower, 
his friend answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The police occasionally conduct sweeps at the apartments but generally only 
arrest those with outstanding warrants or those who possess drugs, the men 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Alvarez and Torres return to work, asking Bratton about hauling out a 
mattress inside one of the apartments. He tells them to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She put in an order for a single mattress but that's a double," Bratton said. 
"I'd charge her double but I don't think she'd go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Oscar Marquez, one of the building owners, said he 
has the same troubles as the scavengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is financing," he said. That is why there is no fence and no 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez said he asked the Small Business Administration for a loan of $400,000 
to pay for $157,000 in needed repairs and to pay off loans on the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless he gets the money, he said, he cannot afford the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is helping us yet, and we are broke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Nuguid, who manages six of the buildings on Hubbard Street owned by 
his father Al Nuguid, said he has tried unsuccessfully to board up the vacant 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are tearing down the boards," he said. "It's getting ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Nuguid said he, too, is waiting for an SBA loan to repair the yellow-tagged 
buildings. If he doesn't get the SBA loan, he said, he hopes the city will loan 
him the money. But the failure of a $2-billion state bond issue for quake 
repair earlier this month forced the state to cancel a $500-million program 
which was designed specifically to help apartment owners restore their 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to give up on these buildings," Nuguid said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bratton said he may soon. Most of the good stuff has already been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a gold mine," he said, gesturing to the string of two-story, 
brown-and-tan apartment buildings. "But they all run out eventually." 
</P>

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RESEDA; TEEN DRAFTSMAN HAS DESIGNS ON A BRIGHT FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he arrived in Reseda eight years ago and was introduced to gang life, 
11-year-old Jose Sosa immediately knew he wasn't interested. He had already 
seen enough bodies lying in the dirt streets of his Salvadoran barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangsters want to kill each other," said Sosa, now 19. "I didn't want to see 
that. I had already seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 So, when his friends and schoolmates began running with gangs, Sosa took up a 
more docile pursuit -- architectural drafting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the long hours sitting under a hot lamp -- pencil in one hand, ruler in 
the other -- are paying off. The Reseda High School senior recently won the 
first-ever National Drafting Competition, sponsored by the National Assn. of 
Women in Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are (draftsmen) who have been out there for years who can't draw this 
well," said Sosa's drafting instructor, Bela Palagyi. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken Sosa took home a $1,000 prize for a design that was not only 
aesthetically original, according to the judges, but also involved extensive 
research and incorporated little-known building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition consisted of designing an affordable three-bedroom, two-bath 
house for a family of four. Other than the fact that the house had to be 
accessible to a disabled person, the assignment was fairly straightforward. And 
many students handed in straightforward solutions to the architectural 
problems, Palagyi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
 His house is a flowing half-circle, a crescent-shaped miniature mansion 
arching across a hillside. Cars are parked beneath the living room, and the 
primary building material is plastic foam blocks. And once these are filled 
with concrete, not only would the house be well-insulated, it would also be the 
perfect place to ride out the Big One, according to Women in Construction 
spokeswoman Cynthia Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Palagyi) said he wanted something different," Sosa said with a shrug. "So 
I gave him something different." 
</P>
<P>
 The national award is the latest in a long line of compliments not only for 
Sosa, who has won several area competitions, but also for Palagyi, a drafting 
instructor for 36 years whose Reseda High students have won 20 out of 24 annual 
Los Angeles drafting contests. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's no question about Sosa's talent for original design and concise 
drawings, his future in the field is not yet clear. He planned on joining the 
U.S. Marines in order to take advantage of the GI Bill and go to school when he 
got out. Now the young artist is considering other options, hoping for a 
scholarship maybe, or money from another competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll find a way," he said. "I've wanted to do this all along." ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; 2 BLACK BEAR CUBS ARRIVE AT WILDLIFE 
FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cinnamon and Kachina, two female black bear cubs, are among the newest 
residents of the Wildlife Waystation, a rescue, rehabilitation and relocation 
facility for wild and exotic animals in the mountains above Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-month-old cubs, weighing in respectively at 15 and 30 pounds, were 
brought to the facility by separate private owners, one from Oregon, the other 
from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Martine Colette, president and founder of the Wildlife Waystation, said she is 
delighted to have two cubs come in at once. "They will have good companionship, 
and they'll grow up being real bears," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the bears were born in captivity, they can never be released into the 
wild, according to California state law. Therefore, these babies will join the 
800 other permanent wildlife residents at the facility, where there are three 
other black bears.  
</P>
<P>
 Cinnamon and Kachina are expected to live up to 40 years, and when fully grown 
will weigh 200 to 300 pounds, said Colette. 
</P>
<P>
 Kachina was inadequately fed by her original owners and, as a result, has a 
severe calcium-deficiency problem that has her in and out of the orthopedic 
veterinarian's office, Colette said. Kachina has to wear a half-body cast to 
keep her bones from breaking.  
</P>
<P>
 When Cinnamon was brought in, she was dirty, which Colette said indicates the 
cub may have been mistreated. "Animals, when they get good care, stay clean," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Wildlife Waystation, there's no chance of their not receiving 
enough attention. Colette had a 400-square-foot cage built for the cubs, where 
they scamper about, playing with their stuffed toys and a little red wagon.  
</P>
<P>
 Every day, the bears eat at least three bowls of nutrient-rich bear chow mixed 
with yogurt, and for a special treat, berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the little bears are adorable, Colette warns that they are far from 
tame. "When bears bite, they bite down to the bone," she said. "Even the 
babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the bears have become the stars of the Wildlife Waystation, drawing 
oohs and ahs from visitors and staff alike. Benches had to be set up around the 
cage to accommodate all of their fans, said Jan Brown, the facility's outreach 
representative. MAKI BECKER

 A new program designed to help property owners obtain funds to repair their 
earthquake-damaged apartment buildings has been initiated by Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be an expansion of the city Housing Department's project to

loans.  
</P>
<P>
 Although three of the 13 tracts are in Sherman Oaks, the department has 
resources to give significant help to only one tract -- which includes Willis 
and Natick avenues between the Ventura Freeway and Ventura Boulevard, according 
to Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's office will present details about the program, as well as a 
proposal to declare Sherman Oaks a redevelopment area, to community leaders at 
a meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman plans to hire a consultant to help owners of apartment 
buildings in a larger, as-yet-undetermined area of the town.  
</P>
<P>
 The consultant would ask property owners about their financing needs, advise 
them of governmental loan programs for which they are eligible, and act as a 
facilitator between the building owners and the loan agencies, such as the 
Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Michael Jimenez, worked on housing and redevelopment issues as 
an aide to Yaroslavsky from 1989 to 1992, when he began working at the 
Community Redevelopment Agency as its liaison to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez will be paid from council office funds that accumulated when the 
office did not fill staff positions that were open, Katz said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a government program that we're taking to the people," Katz said. 
"We're not going to wait for people to come to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go door to door, saying 'Here's what we have to offer.' We 
hope it will have a big impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez will work under a six-month contract. His salary has not been 
finalized, Katz said. Community leader Jeff Brain said the program would give a 
needed boost to Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great step," Brain said. "I can't wait until it's in place.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to call (the council office) and offer any help I can." KAY HWANGBO

 A 4.1-magnitude aftershock to the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake rattled 
Southern California on Tuesday night, but it caused only minor damage, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10:59 p.m. temblor was centered three miles east-northeast of the city of 
San Fernando, said Caltech spokesman Jay Aller. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock, one of more than 8,000 since the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, was 
felt from Santa Monica to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning about 7:13 a.m., a 3.1-magnitude aftershock to the 1992 
Landers earthquake rocked the Yucca Valley in San Bernadino County, but it 
caused no serious injuries or damage, authorities said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MAYOR NAMES PANEL TO PROBE HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens announced this week the members of a Community 
Relations Task Force formed at the request of local Armenian groups to 
investigate a hate crime at an Armenian-American youth center last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will meet several times, with its first meeting scheduled in 
the next two weeks, Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is charged with recommending ways the community can "work 
together to encourage intercultural understanding," Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Armenian groups called for the City Council to nominate a committee to 
study the May 14 vandalism of the Homenetmen Armenian General Athletics Union 
and Scouts Building at 544 W. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals painted swastikas on the building's walls and on several vans parked 
nearby. Police have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism set off a round of insults aimed at Armenians by other residents 
who claimed Armenian immigrants, who make up about 20% of Glendale's 195,000 
residents, were asking for special treatment from city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will include Pierre Chraghchian, a Homenetmen board member; 
Mayor Eileen Givens; Mary Hamilton, former Chamber of Commerce president; Susan 
Hunt, president of the Glendale Council PTA; Chahe Keuroghelian, intercultural 
relations coordinator for the Glendale Police Department; Harry Kimm, an 
interpreter with the Stanford International Group, and Karen La Madrid, 
associate general counsel, Department of Legal Affairs, Southern California 
Assn. of Seventh-day Adventists. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: Angus MacLeod, past president of the Glendale Council on Aging; Rabbi 
Carole Meyers, head of Temple Sinai of Glendale; Alice Petrossian, director of 
special projects/intercultural education for the Glendale Unified School 
District; Frank Quintero, a member of the Arroyo Verdugo Sub-Regional Planning 
Committee; Glendale City Manager Dave Ramsay; Herman Sillas, an attorney with 
Ochoa & Sillas, and the Rev. Phil Wood, senior pastor, First United Methodist 
Church, Glendale. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; SOCCER STAGE PARENTS READY FOR SHOW TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wait is finally over for the San Fernando Valley's top soccer parents, the 
Wynaldas and the Joneses, the banner-waving foursome looking as though they 
stepped out of a Fourth of July parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday is show time for their sons, when the U.S. national team meets 
Switzerland in their first match of the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is in for a surprise," predicted Dave Wynalda, father of Eric 
Wynalda, a forward for the underdog Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got talent the world is unaware of." 
</P>
<P>
 The talents of Wynalda and teammate Cobi Jones are becoming legendary in their 
hometown of Westlake Village as hype over the monthlong mega-event grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in stores are starting to recognize me as Eric's mom when they look at 
my checks and see 'Wynalda,' " said Sue Wynalda.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to behave myself now." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Wynaldas' store, Soccer Kick, has for months been a hub of enthusiasm 
for the tournament, as locals drop by to browse World Cup shirts, key chains 
and other paraphernalia, watch videos or just talk soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending their son's top-level international matches is nothing new for the 
Wynaldas.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric, 25, played in the 1990 World Cup in Italy and is a member of a German 
professional team. 
</P>
<P>
 For Freeman and Mada Jones, though, watching their 24-year-old son compete for 
the world's most coveted sports prize caps 16 years of trudging to youth 
league, high school, college and national team games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an end of an era," said Freeman Jones.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's different than when we watched him play as a boy and as an amateur. Now, 
he's at the epitome of soccer, and he's a man." 
</P>
<P>
 As images from the World Cup are beamed to an unprecedented number of 
television viewers, some cameras may fix on the Westlake Village contingent -- 
the Joneses and the Wynaldas -- who plan to attend each game the United States 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll be the ones in red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has to bring flags to the games," said Sue Wynalda. "I don't want to 
see any U.S. fans there without flags.  
</P>
<P>
 "It helps our boys to look up and see their colors waving in the crowd. It 
gives them courage." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; HISTORICAL LANDMARK PROPOSAL IS STALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has deadlocked over an ordinance that would, for the 
first time, enable the city to designate its own historical landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law was given preliminary approval June 7.But Tuesday, when a 2-2 
vote was taken, council members Susan Spanos and Dave Golonski opposed the 
legislation and asked that a portion of it be amended. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opposition was based on a requirement in the ordinance that they 
considered to be too restrictive -- the formation of a five-member historical 
commission made up of two nominees selected by the Burbank Historical Society, 
two by the Burbank Chamber of Commerce and one by the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Bill Wiggins and Robert Bowne voted in favor of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 A final vote is expected once Councilman George Battey Jr. is able to return 
to the council meetings. Battey has missed recent sessions for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the proposed law would enable sites such as Burbank City Hall and 
Bellarmine-Jefferson High School to be considered historically worthy by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, state and federal agencies designate landmarks in Burbank, such as 
the downtown Burbank post office and the Bob's Big Boy restaurant on Riverside 
Drive. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; CONDO OWNERS VOTE AGAINST REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Sherman Court Homeowners Assn. have voted not to rebuild their 
132-unit condominium complex, and to offer lenders the deeds to their 
quake-damaged units in lieu of future mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote, taken Tuesday night, was 46 to 11, said Daniel J. Perwich, an 
attorney representing the homeowners group. The group needed 75% of its 
dues-paying members present for a valid vote, he said. Since the earthquake, 
some of the association members have not made dues payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the association will continue to pursue a lawsuit against a 
construction company whose alleged substandard work failed during the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, Perwich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to rebuild at some point," but it may not be this group of 
homeowners," Perwich said. "This is in excess of a $10-million asset, with a 
couple of million in problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hodel, president of North American Mortgage Co., in Santa Rosa, said his 
company last week obtained a court injunction to prevent the association from 
demolishing the complex and selling the land before reaching an agreement with 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage company holds loans on about 87 of the 132 units, which were 
purchased for about $100,000 each, Hodel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodel said deed offers from loan customers in good standing would probably be 
accepted as long as the units had not been stripped of such permanent fixtures 
as kitchen cabinets, doorknobs and bathroom fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage company also will write letters on behalf of homeowners 
explaining the deal, a move that will help preserve good credit ratings, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deeds of homeowners who defaulted on loans before the earthquake will 
probably not be accepted, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage company will try and refurbish or sell the units back to 
government lenders or, in cases where government loans are not involved, sell 
to private real estate companies, Hodel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how long something like this will take, because we've never done 
anything like this before," Hodel said. CHIP JOHNSONMORTGAGES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; OPEN ENROLLMENT PLAN TARGETED FOR '95

<P>
 The Las Virgenes Unified School District plans to offer parents more 
discretion over which schools their children attend by the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to comply with state requirements that school districts offer more 
open enrollment, the Las Virgenes school board voted unanimously Tuesday night 
to open space in schools to all students, based on a series of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Priority for enrollment in any school will be given, in order, to students 
currently enrolled in that school, new enrollees who live in the school's area, 
students with medical or child care-related reasons for wanting a transfer, 
those who simply prefer another school, and out-of-district applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to displace someone who lives across the street from their 
school, obviously," said Assistant Supt. of Education Services Leo Lowe. "And I 
think most of the preference is going to be based on convenience, because most 
observers will say the schools aren't radically different in quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will consider the choice issue again later this month before 
it becomes policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who want their children placed in schools outside their neighborhood 
in the fall of 1995 would be required to apply by next June 1. A lottery would 
be held for spaces sought by too many applicants, Lowe said. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; GROUP TO STEP UP BOYCOTT ON POLE SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraged by community support for a boycott against 10 businesses attempting 
to keep their pole-mounted advertisements by suing the city of Agoura Hills, a 
community group has pledged to increase pressure on the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to spread the word as widely as possible," said Les Hardie, a member 
of Citizens Against Pole Signs."We want to encourage people to show their 
disagreement with the pole sign businesses by not patronizing them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Chevron, Unocal, McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King, Denny's, Jack in the 
Box, Lumber City, Roadside Lumber and the Fence Factory filed separate lawsuits 
against the city last month, charging that the ban on tall signs along the 
Ventura Freeway will hurt their profits, some residents called for a boycott.  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, nearly 50 residents protested in front of the businesses, urging 
people not to patronize them. But some of the businesses said the boycott is 
not likely to affect sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see it having any negligible effect," said Rick Stull, a material 
salesman at the Fence Factory. "If people need fencing, they'll come here 
anyway. If anything, it will draw attention to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The city outlawed pole-mounted advertisements nine years ago, saying they 
spoil the scenic view of the foothills and gave merchants seven years to remove 
them. In November, voters sanctioned the ban by a 3-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses argue that the signs are necessary to attract the freeway travelers 
they say they rely on for profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But CAPS Chairman Ron Kapla said the boycott's goal is to make the businesses 
lose customers from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If enough people do it, (businesses) are going to have to look at their 
bottom line and realize something happened," he said. SUSAN BYRNES

POLICE PRIMER; WORKSHOP GIVES YOUTHS, ADULTS A TASTE OF MEAN STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The officers went out on a routine call -- a homeowner complaining that her 
neighbors' party was too loud. Augustine Lorenzo and Susanna Ventura had seen 
all the movies. They had their training. They were ready. Or so they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But these weren't your average officers. Augustine and Susanna are both in 
seventh grade. And when they were forced to act as police officers in a 
workshop with actual cops, they got more than they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine, a student at Washington Irving Middle School, stared down Guadalupe 
Maciel, a student playing the party's host. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn the music down or I'll take you to court," Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe shrugged. "So?" 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine was baffled. His classmates giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Susanna and Augustine were two of nearly 600 seventh-graders from six Los 
Angeles area middle schools who met with 60 police officers Wednesday to get a 
taste of life as an officer. The event at the Los Angeles Convention Center was 
the capstone of a yearlong experimental civics curriculum called CityYouth, 
designed by the nonpartisan Constitutional Rights Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 And while CityYouth worked to teach the students about police officers, The 
California Wellness Foundation separately worked on a plan to teach adults and 
children about urban violence against young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that handguns kill more young people than disease, drugs or car 
crashes, the group will begin airing television commercials today in an effort 
to raise awareness of handgun violence, said Gary Yates, president and chief 
executive officer of the state Wellness Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had found a new disease that had killed more California kids than any 
other cause, there would be a public outcry to do something about it," Yates 
said. "And we think we've identified the disease. Handguns are killing more 
kids than anything else."  
</P>
<P>
 At the Convention Center workshop, Sgt. Pat Connelly stepped in to give 
Augustine some advice. Tell them you can impound their radio if they don't turn 
it down, he said. Tell her that she could spend six months in jail if charges 
were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn," Guadalupe said. "I'll turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Clark, executive director of the Constitutional Rights Foundation, said 
the day was designed to give students an appreciation of the difficulties of 
being a police officer. "And," he said, "to give (officers) an understanding of 
how difficult it is to grow up in a city like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wellness Foundation designed its new commercials as a sobering reminder of 
the dangers on the streets for police and kids. The spots, narrated by actor Ed 
Asner, will air in Los Angeles and Scramento.  
</P>
<P>
 In one spot, viewers will watch the mass production of handguns, while Asner 
ticks off the statistics: Every 20 seconds a new handgun is produced in this 
country. Ten children are killed by them every day. Every eight hours a young 
person commits suicide with one. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ad will show a car weaving down a road while Asner asks, "Do you know 
what the No. 1 killer of kids in California is?" The segment ends with the car 
wrapped around a tree and the young driver slumped over. There is a close-up of 
a bullet hole in the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are concerned about gun violence," Yates said. "We want to let them 
know there's something they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation planned a yearlong campaign costing $1 million to show its 
30-second spots decrying handgun violence against young people and another $1 
million for additional public information efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do something," viewers will be implored. The nonprofit group ends each of the 
segments with a phone number, 1-800-222-MANY, for more information on getting 
involved in local efforts to prevent violence.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the state Wellness Foundation and other private groups allocated more 
than $30 million to a five-year project that aims to prevent violence. The 
group was created by law in 1992 when Health Net was converted from a nonprofit 
health maintenance organization to a for-profit HMO.

SUN VALLEY MAN KILLED IN BURBANK SHOOTING

<P>
 A 32-year-old Sun Valley man was shot to death Wednesday morning as he waited 
for a car pool of friends to take him to work in Valencia, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alfredo Aguilar, whose occupation was not immediately known, was shot 
once in the upper torso at 6:12 a.m. and was pronounced dead about 30 minutes 
later at St. Joseph's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the shooting was gang-related, but gangs have been 
active in the past in the area where Aguilar was shot, said Police Lt. Joseph 
Valento. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said a large blue vehicle pulled up to Aguilar's car in the 1600 
block of Grismer Avenue, a high-density residential street lined with apartment 
buildings and single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar talked briefly to the person inside the vehicle and was shot with a 
handgun as he tried to walk away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no suspects in custody Wednesday.

 Neighboring residents and business operators acknowledged a past crime problem 
in the area, but said they believed the situation had been improving lately.

<P>
 "Once in awhile, you have a robbery or a car theft. But on the whole it's a 
very calm area," said Ervant Demirchyan, manager of a nearby gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are police all around the clock working here. It's very unbelievable," 
he said of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth homicide in Burbank this year.

KEY PERMIT DENIED FOR GOLF COURSE; DEVELOPMENT: ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS SAYS 
JAPANESE FIRM'S PROJECT IN BIG TUJUNGA WASH WOULD JEOPARDIZE RARE PLANT. 
</P>

 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday denied a permit crucial to a 
Japanese company's bid to build a championship golf course in scenic Big 
Tujunga Wash, a rugged area identified as one of Los Angeles' most 
environmentally sensitive sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the $50-million, 355-acre project, including state Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), hailed the decision by Col. R. L. VanAntwerp, district 
engineer, to oppose the project on the grounds that it would jeopardize the 
existence of the slender-horned spineflower, a tiny plant listed as an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have determined that, on balance, your proposal is contrary to the public 
interest," VanAntwerp wrote to Satoru Suzuki, an executive with Cosmo World 
Corp., the development company. 
</P>
<P>
 In his denial, VanAntwerp also stated that the golf course project "would 
eliminate at least 120 acres of alluvial fan sage scrub habitat, a plant 
community the California Department of Fish and Game considers the most 
threatened in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers had a key decision-making role in the matter 
because the proposed golf course would have encroached on a stream, which is 
protected under federal law. Rugged Big Tujunga Wash tumbles out of the San 
Gabriel Mountains at Sunland on its way to containment at the huge Hansen Dam 
in Lake View Terrace. The area affected by Wednesday's decision is a 
boulder-strewn flood plain east of Foothill Boulevard at Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Army Corps of Engineers letter left open the possibility that 
Cosmo or another owner could come back with a new, more environmentally 
sensitive proposal, most observers believed the decision was a fatal blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bill Eick of Shadow Hills, an activist who had fought the project, 
said he was "very pleased" by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he believed the decision should disabuse the developer of any idea 
that his property can be developed commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't build a golf course on the site, then they certainly can't 
build much else there," Katz said. A golf course, he reasoned, was about the 
least obtrusive kind of development for the wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman said it was time for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to 
renew its efforts to acquire the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz estimated that the decision should make it easier and cheaper to acquire 
the property as parkland. Stripped of its development potential, the land is 
worth less and thus could be purchased at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developer's position is significantly weakened," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that the company could reap a lot of public good will and some 
tax advantages by donating the land to a parks agency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Cosmo World -- which has sought since the late 1980s to develop 
a golf course rival to the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades on the 
land it owned in the wash -- could not be reached for comment, nor could 
land-use attorneys for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the exasperated developer, with the advice of Orange County 
attorney Hugh Hewitt, threatened to invoke a little known state law and remove 
the spineflower population from the wash so it could proceed with its golf 
course plans. That proposal triggered an outcry and a slew of counter-threats 
by state and local authorities. Eventually, the developer backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peterson of Sunland, a member of a business group that had supported Cosmo 
World's project, decried the engineer corps' decision, saying it was "silly" 
and would deny the northeast San Fernando Valley a chance for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community needed an economic shot in the arm," Peterson said.

DRIVER GETS 18 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR DOUBLE FATALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Van Nuys man was sentenced Wednesday to 18 years to life in prison on a 
second-degree murder conviction resulting from a 1992 drunk-driving accident 
that killed two young people as they returned home from a miniature golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel McGinnis, 39, apologized in court to the families of his victims before 
Superior Court Judge Michael J. Farrell imposed the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinnis, who had two prior drunk-driving convictions and was attending a 
court-ordered alcohol awareness school at the time of the crash, had admitted 
to police that he knew he was too drunk to drive. He testified during the trial 
that he had blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Most drunk drivers involved in fatal accidents face vehicular manslaughter 
charges. But prosecutor Phillip H. Rabichow convinced the jury to convict 
McGinnis on the murder charge -- a rarity in drunk-driving deaths -- on the 
argument that he made a conscious decision to drink and drive, even though he 
knew from his court-ordered alcohol safety school sessions that such conduct 
was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinnis' blood alcohol level was .025% -- more than three times the legal 
driving limit -- when his Ford Ranger ran a red light at Woodman Avenue and 
Valerio Street shortly after midnight on July 27, 1992. The Ranger plowed into 
a Hyundai Excel at 52 m.p.h., instantly killing two back-seat passengers, Maria 
Henriquez Delcarmen, 16, and Eynar Contreras, 25. The driver and another 
passenger were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, the pair who died were returning from an evening of 
playing video games at a miniature golf course. McGinnis had been drinking at 
one bar and was on his way to another.

DRIVER IN FATAL ACCIDENT SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unidentified driver of a car involved in a hit-and-run accident that 
killed a 10-year-old boy Wednesday surrendered to police about three hours 
after the accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, also unidentified, was crossing the street in the 6700 block of 
Vineland Avenue in North Hollywood about 6:15 p.m., when the accident occurred, 
police said.He was pronounced dead at the scene, said Brian Humphrey, a Los 
Angeles Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The car that hit the victim was traveling north at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, accompanied by two passengers, showed up at the North Hollywood 
police station, where he surrendered about 9:20 p.m., said Los Angeles Police 
Sgt. Robert Ontiveros. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four people in the car at the time of the accident, Ontiveros said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BACKERS OF CHARTER SCHOOL APPEAL TO COUNTY; 
EDUCATION: DISTRICT'S BOARD HAS REJECTED PLAN TO CONVERT THE PALMDALE CAMPUS. 
BUT SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE WAITED TOO LONG. 
</P>

<P>
 Supporters of a proposal to convert Highland High into a charter school are 
trying to make an end run around the Antelope Valley Union High School district 
board, which has already rejected their plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highland Charter Committee sent an appeal Wednesday to the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education in hopes of getting the local board to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our belief that our charter was treated unfairly (by the school 
board)," said Glen Horst, head of the charter committee and a Highland High 
English teacher. "We want the county to order them to reconsider." 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee may have waited too long to make its appeal. Procedures 
adopted by the county Board of Education call for appeals to be filed 30 days 
from the time the proposal is rejected by the local board. The Highland High 
charter was turned down by the school board six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Hoffman, assistant director for curriculum and instructional 
strategies with the county office, said the county's 30-day appeal limit is 
being reviewed by legal staff. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 law allowed for the creation of 100 charter schools in California as a 
means of achieving the decade-long effort toward educational reform. To date, 
53 charters, which are not bound by the requirements of the extensive state 
Education Code, have been granted. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote, the district board had rejected the charter plan for the 
Palmdale campus, saying it was too vague and failed to include financial 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 But charter committee members wrote in a 12-page letter to the county office 
that they believe the proposal was turned down because the board majority 
doesn't understand school reform. Committee members also wrote that they would 
use the first year of the charter as a development period during which the plan 
could be more fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of court record that the board majority has acted in the 
recent past in an arbitrary and capricious manner," Horst said in reference to 
the board's recent refusal, until ordered by the courts, to administer the 
California Learning Assessment System test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that type of behavior first manifested itself in the way they 
cavalierly dismissed a year and a half's work" on the charter plan, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Horst said the committee was frustrated even more when the board, shortly 
after rejecting the Highland High proposal, authorized a feasibility study on 
the possibility of the district establishing a charter school. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Billy Pricer, who voted with members Sue Stokka and Tony Welch 
to deny the charter, said the plan was rejected because it lacked substance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard that thing to death," Pricer said. "We gave them options and 
opportunities, and what we asked for -- a detailed setup -- never came to 
fruition."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 15 INMATES INJURED IN FIGHT AT HONOR RANCHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen inmates were injured in a fight Tuesday night when as many as 800 
prisoners at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho battled each other using crude 
weapons for about 15 minutes before guards were able to restore order, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting began about 7:45 p.m. in a minimum-security compound at the jail 
when prisoners began arguing about the theft of money from an inmate, said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the battle had divided along racial lines, with 750 to 800 
Latino and African American inmates squaring off against each other using mop 
and broom handles, socks filled with rocks and prison-made knives, Ramirez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty deputies, some using pepper spray, were able to quell the brawl, Ramirez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two injured inmates were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, one with a 
broken clavicle and a cut above his eye, the other with several stab wounds to 
the torso, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital declined to give their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other inmates were taken to County-USC Medical Center to receive 
stitches, and 10 prisoners were treated at the jail's medical clinic, Ramirez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No deputies were injured in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other inmates involved in the brawl have been transferred to different 
sections of the jail -- a common practice after such incidents, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail has been the site of hundreds of brawls between Latino and African 
American inmates in recent years. Prison officials attribute the violence to a 
power struggle at the jail.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN GETS LIFE SENTENCE FOR SETTING 
EX-GIRLFRIEND ON FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Val Verde man convicted of attempting to murder his ex-girlfriend by pouring 
gasoline on her and setting her on fire was sentenced Wednesday to life plus 
three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Mack Finney, 39, told Superior Court Judge Candace Beason he was sorry 
for the August, 1993, attack and meant no harm to Janice Johnson, 31, who 
sustained second- and third-degree burns to a quarter of her body. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson urged a stiffer sentence at the hearing. She told the judge that she 
still fears for her life and asked that Finney be given a life sentence without 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 But state law doesn't allow the judge to deny parole eligibility to Finney on 
this conviction, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas. The sentence he received 
makes him eligible for release after only 10 years, but Jonas said the nature 
of the crime makes it unlikely Finney would get an early parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll be taking his meals through a straw before he sees the light of 
day," Jonas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard Waco, who argued during the trial that the 
attack was a misguided attempt by Finney to frighten Johnson, said he doesn't 
believe Finney will remain in prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say if he behaves himself I would think somewhere around 15 years 
might be in the ballpark," Waco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said the assault came after Johnson broke off the 
relationship. Finney asked Johnson to go into the bathroom of her Val Verde 
home to talk to him, officials said, and once there emptied a two-liter plastic 
drink bottle of gasoline on her. He then threw a lighter at her as her three 
children watched. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who drove Finney to the house, not knowing his intentions, heard 
Johnson screaming and rushed in to put out the fire with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, now living in California City, is on disability due to the 
disfigurement from the burns and her limited use of one arm.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WIFE, ADOPTED SON FACE TRIAL IN OFFICER'S 
DEATH; ARSON: THE RETIRED LAPD SERGEANT'S RELATIVES ARE ACCUSED OF SETTING FIRE 
TO THEIR HOUSE AND LEAVING HIM INSIDE TO DIE. 
</P>

<P>
 More than a year after their arrest, two family members accused of killing 
retired LAPD Officer Tom Hooker by setting fire to his Littlerock home were 
ordered Wednesday to stand trial on murder and arson charges. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing, Antelope Municipal Court Judge Ian R. Grant ruled 
that there was sufficient cause to order a trial for David Warren Hooker, 32, 
the officer's adopted son, and Joy Girard Hooker, 50, the officer's third wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators have alleged that David and Joy 
Hooker became lovers and set the fire to collect insurance money on the house. 
The pair left Tom Hooker, who was legally blind and in poor health, inside, 
where he died of smoke inhalation, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's hearing, Grant rejected motions from David Hooker, who is 
serving as his own attorney, and from Joy Hooker's attorney, who both argued 
that the charges should be dropped because the evidence did not prove that the 
fire was anything more than an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the defendants implicated themselves in the crime. Doral 
Riggs, a Sheriff's Department homicide detective, testified Wednesday that 
after repeated questioning by deputies, both defendants admitted setting fire 
to the house because the family could not keep up the mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Hooker "indicated that the fire had been set on purpose, that (she) and 
David set the fire," Riggs testified. "She said she'd been going through a lot 
of financial difficulties. . . . They felt that setting this fire would delay 
the foreclosure and give them operating capital to get back on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was told about Joy Hooker's confession, David Hooker also admitted 
that he helped start the fire for financial gain, Riggs said. But David Hooker 
also said he did not expect the fire to harm his father, the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas W. Hooker, who rose to the rank of sergeant in the LAPD, had boasted 
that he was the inspiration for the 1980s television series "T.J. Hooker," but 
the creator of the series has denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 58 when he died in the fire on April 19, 1993, in the master bedroom of 
his Littlerock house. Before his death, he was suffering from diabetes and a 
failing heart and kidneys, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hooker had moved in with his father and stepmother in September, 1992, 
after his release from prison, where he had served time for a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Hooker, while coping with the family's financial troubles, had grown weary 
of caring for an invalid husband, sheriff's investigators allege. They believe 
she joined David in setting a sofa afire. The pair rescued a family dog as they 
fled but left the ailing Tom Hooker inside, deputies allege. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe she intended for Tom Hooker to die in the fire," Riggs testified. 
"I believe she just wanted to get rid of him. I think she was tired of taking 
care of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Hooker's attorney, Laizer D. Gould, disputed this view. "I don't believe 
there's any evidence of any intent on the part of Joy Hooker to murder her 
husband," he said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants were ordered to remain in jail pending a June 29 arraignment in 
Lancaster Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said the case has been prolonged partly by David Hooker's 
decision to serve as his own defense attorney. He wore an orange Los Angeles 
County Jail jumpsuit while questioning witnesses during Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, he sought unsuccessfully to remove Grant from the case, 
asserting that the judge was biased against him.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 8 STUDENTS FROM HART HIGH WIN NATIONAL 'QUIZ 
BOWL'; COMPETITION: IT IS THE FIRST VICTORY IN FIVE TRIES FOR THE SCHOOL. TEAM 
HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A LONG SHOT IN THE AMERICAN CHALLENGE.

<P>
 Winning a national "quiz bowl" feels almost as good as not being in school, 
according to Val Williams, a junior at William S. Hart High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Val was one of eight Hart students greeted by school cheerleaders and faculty 
members when they returned Wednesday evening with the first-place trophy from 
the American Challenge National Invitational Tournament held in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart team had been considered a long shot to beat 15 teams from other 
public and private schools that had qualified for the three-day competition 
that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the semifinals, we beat the top-ranked team in the country," said Lori 
Huenink, the team's academic coach. "They were as stunned as we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Four-student teams answered questions in a game-show format, trying to give 
the correct answer before the opposing team. The questions covered history, 
science and a variety of other topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was any obscure fact you could think of," said Cheryl Cina, a junior at 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is one of five national academic competitions, including four 
"quiz bowl" contests and an academic decathlon, Huenink said. The decathlon 
requires students to write essays on books that they have been given. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has competed five times in academic tournaments. It placed fifth in the 
inaugural Nashville tournament last year, but never had won a competition 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also included Christian Edstrom, David Golombek, Sharon Armstrong, 
Brian Johnson, Oliver Bajracharya and Sarah Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 The school received $1,500 for winning the tournament, plus $500 for community 
service during the Northridge earthquake, which will be used to pay for some of 
the team's travel expenses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams qualified for the Nashville competition by submitting an essay on ideas 
to help the country and a resume of the school's participation in previous 
academic bowls, Hart Principal Laurence Strauss said. The members of the Hart 
team are students in a special class who receive school credit for preparing 
for such competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian, a senior, said students have been arriving at school at 7 a.m. each 
day to spend an hour quizzing each other and preparing for the competition. He 
said students also studied during their lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has no intention of letting all of his hours of studying obscure 
facts go to waste, even though he won't be able to compete next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes for great stuff at cocktail parties," he said.

 An autopsy showed that a 15-year-old girl was not under the influence of drugs 
or alcohol when she collided with two other vehicles on June 1, killing herself 
and two other passengers in her car, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema du Bois of Canyon Country was weaving her grandmother's car back and 
forth on Seco Canyon Road moments before the collision, according to 
witnesses.A friend in the car said Du Bois was trying to amuse a 3-year-old 
passenger, but speculation that the teen-ager might have been under the 
influence of drugs had circulated among her peers and family members of the 
five girls in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Luster, Du Bois' uncle, said he knew about the rumors but they didn't cause 
him any additional grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to me, because I knew there was nothing there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Du Bois -- an unlicensed driver who reportedly took her 
grandmother's car without permission -- the accident took the lives of Gena 
Watkinson, 15, and Jesika Noell, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois' sister, Barbara, 14, remained in critical condition and Alicia 
Acevedo, 14, was in stable condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 
said Deborah Moore, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of the other vehicles were not seriously injured.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LINGERIE SHOP'S REVEALING BILLBOARD IS 
CRITICIZED BY RESIDENTS; SANTA CLARITA: SOME CITIZENS CONTEND THE IMAGE DEMEANS 
WOMEN AND IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. THEY PRESENT PETITIONS URGING THE CITY 
TO TAKE ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 A billboard of a woman in a low-cut bra, lace underwear, stockings and high 
heels has angered a group of residents who say the image demeans women and is 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 During the month that the sign -- an advertisement for the Naughty But Nice 
lingerie shop in Saugus -- has been on Soledad Canyon Road, offended citizens 
have gathered more than 1,500 signatures asking that the city do something 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of the petition drive presented it at a City Council meeting 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my daughters thinking that this is the way to attract men," Lori 
Burris told the council. "I don't want my young son to view a woman in the 
lowest common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard's critics say the advertisement -- which shows the woman 
straddling a chair and also includes the Mae West quote,"When women go wrong 
men go right after them" -- is more suitable for an adult magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not belong on this street. It does not belong in this community," 
said Steve Rice. "My 6-year-old daughter cannot be shielded from this. My 
9-year-old daughter cannot be shielded from this." 
</P>
<P>
 The strong public reaction has startled Sharon Dallas, owner of the lingerie 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is three seconds going past a billboard on a major street," she said. 
"It's not posted above somebody's house." 
</P>
<P>
 Although critics of the picture say it shows the woman in a provocative pose, 
Dallas said the photograph in the advertisement is no more revealing than those 
appearing in department stores ads in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 12-year-old," she said. "If my son sees a billboard like mine, he 
says 'So what? It's a woman in her underwear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas said she chose the photograph from a calendar after talking with 
customers. She said it's tamer than others she considered. 
</P>
<P>
 This is of no solace to the billboard's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was offended as a woman and embarrassed as a mother," said Sheila Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, speaking to the council, drew comparisons between the billboard and 
the murder of popular martial arts instructor Veronica Estrada here six months 
ago. Estrada was strangled during or after a sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sign says, 'When women go wrong men go right after them,' " she said. 
"What did Veronica Estrada do wrong that made this man go after her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were inclined to take down the sign, but were 
doubtful they have the authority to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand and I sympathize with them completely, however, the First 
Amendment is still in place," said Mayor George Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been racking my brain every time I go by there about what I can do," 
said Councilwoman Jan Heidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt said the city might be able to force it down because the billboard was 
elevated for better visibility months ago without a permit. City planning 
staffers are researching the issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas, meanwhile, has been targeted with phone calls and name-calling. But 
she said that the more she feels abused by her critics, the less she is 
inclined to take the sign down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of removing the billboard until I get tired of looking at 
it," Dallas said. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time Santa Clarita residents have objected to 
eye-catching advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, complaints were lodged against a rock 'n' roll radio station 
that ran a series of billboard messages claiming their station was "Better Than 
Sex -- And Safer."

BY DESIGN; OFF THE CUFF; MORE TO HAIR THAN MEETS THE EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T ony Ray and Homer Prefontaine, owners of Stainless, a full-service salon in 
Encinitas, know hair -- from the fluffy to the droopy, the glorious to the 
goofy .  
</P>
<P>
 Ray has been a critic of bad hair for years. He 's written a book ("Silver 
Gray Beauty"), a syndicated column ("Let's Face It") and articles for 
magazines. Ray may not have invented the buzz cut, but he did come up with the 
"La Costa look," a fuss-free, natural approach to hair and makeup made famous 
by the Carlsbad spa.  
</P>
<P>
 His salon partner, Prefontaine, has styled hair for nine years and often 
travels to Europe to catch the new waves.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allow people in the 
fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray: CNN did a special on me because I go up to people in shopping centers and 
offer to clean them up. The sin people commit is that sometimes they have a 
great look and they ruin it by overdoing it. Or there are those who look like 
disasters and they think they look good. I've learned the best way to deal with 
anyone is to be very blunt. They may not like what they hear, but everyone 
wants to look better. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefontaine: I used to be more opinionated about what people do to their hair, 
but now I just think that they haven't taken the time to know what's 
appropriate. Stylists have to remember that they have power to help someone 
achieve a look. No stylist should make a client feel degraded. Some stylists 
are patronizing, and that's why clients are afraid to try new things. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray: People place such an emphasis on hair that they think they can't live 
without it. It's just the crowning glory; it won't break anyone's career. If a 
man's losing his hair and he's overweight, he should get in shape and not think 
about his hair anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 Men who are losing their hair should face the fact: You lose it, and that's 
it. You then have choices: get a hairpiece, get implants or cut it really short 
and forget that your hair was ever important. If you don't have much hair and 
you comb a few strands over the top of your head, you don't cover it up. You 
make everyone say, "Look at this silly bugger." 
</P>
<P>
 Prefontaine: My advice to people is to ignore the flaws, the bags and 
wrinkles, and to look at the positive. If you have blue eyes, bring them out. 
But when you do, don't overdue it with too much makeup or jewelry. Less is more 
elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried hair, blue eyeliner and eraser marks for cheekbones don't look natural. 
Eye shadow is just that -- shadow . It's not eye coloring . Use it to create 
shadows that enhance or minimize. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray: I'm still seeing racing stripes, those big streaks of blush on the sides 
of the face. It just isn't done anymore. And raccoon eyes, where they just 
circle their eyes in black. For people who don't know what to do, I say go to a 
licensed makeup artist, someone who is trained and who is not just selling 
makeup. If you pay for the makeup lesson, by law the person has to be licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefontaine: A client from hell is someone who goes to a stylist with a 
reputation to have a change, then hates it. This is because the client and the 
stylist didn't communicate. She may bring in a picture without considering what 
kind of hair she has and without realizing that half of these pictures are 
airbrushed or done with computers and the hair is flawless. That's not how it's 
going to look in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray: If a woman brings in a picture of Claudia Schiffer and wants her hair to 
look like that, she will be disappointed if it's not the right look for her; so 
will the woman who says, "My husband likes my hair long." If her husband likes 
her hair long and blond, he's probably having an affair with someone with short 
brown hair because it's a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefontaine: The designer should know the client. What does she like? What's 
her lifestyle? He then can create a look that fits her. I don't think any one 
look is in fashion. It's what fits that person. In the '90s, more people are 
finding what works for them and not following trends.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray: Fashion can be aging because it sets a limit on what you do at the time, 
be it spike heels or platforms. But the classic look is timeless. Lauren 
Bacall's hair has always been the same, yet she's made it look feminine, chic 
and tailored. Coco Chanel and Audrey Hepburn, too, never looked overdone. The 
more you do, the harder it is to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefontaine: The greatest feeling is to see someone being more confident about 
themselves. It's inner beauty that translates out. Any designer knows this is 
what makes everything worthwhile. When clients hold up their head, that's 
gratifying to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray: The funny thing is, if you sit them in a chair, it's almost like a flower 
starting to unfold. As you finish, they sit up straight and feel better about 
themselves. You didn't change them, you just made what they have look so much 
better.

BEHIND THE SCENES; SPORTING THE PRACTICAL TO PLAY SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the 22 members of the U.S. national soccer team, there's little time or 
energy to kick around such mundane pleasures as what to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 They're up early for a grueling four-hour practice session, then back in the 
evening for another couple of hours.Even the fabulous grounds of the Dana Point 
Resort, their home base until the end of the World Cup, proved no match against 
the quiet sanctuary of their rooms, where players crashed every afternoon after 
lunch and later after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The general look? Sweat-drenched hair stuck to foreheads and necks. During the 
course of a game, a player might run as much as five miles. No doubt, with this 
in mind, forward Ernie Stewart had his head shorn. As for the hippest and 
practical sporto 'do, midfielder Cobi Jones wears his in short dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The official team uniforms, by Adidas, come in the requisite red, white and 
blue. For the games, players will either don a shirt with red and white stripes 
or one with white stars on a blue denim-like background. Both shirts will pair 
up with denim-like shorts.  
</P>
<P>
 Adidas also monopolized the team practice threads. Indeed, the trefoil logo 
was everywhere on the Mission Viejo practice field these past few weeks, from 
duffel bags to jackets. Other sponsor logos crept up on dry gear players 
changed into after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, these guys are not just athletes. They're also walking billboards.

FAUX PAS REPORT: THERE'S NO SECRET TO WHERE THE UNDER-COVERED HAVE BEEN

 They usually appear early in the evening, leaping out of their cars and into 
the supermarket or mall to pick up a few things on their way home from the gym. 
In other countries, they'd probably be flogged, but here, we accept women who 
leave their aerobics class with an inadequate "cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women don't want to change their clothes at the gym; they just want 
to throw something on when they leave," says Susan Shaw of Dancegear in Fashion 
Island Newport Beach. "But the sweat shirt they tie around their waist may not 
cover their backsides completely, which isn't very flattering no matter what 
kind of body you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Long, oversized tops are available that can coordinate with aerobic wear and 
offer adequate cover-up. Make sure they're a few inches below the rear so they 
won't bounce up while you're walking. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hair where?: You're becoming your father. You've noticed that your little 
talks with your kids are becoming lectures; your idea of a great evening is a 
meat loaf dinner followed by an episode of "Matlock" you haven't seen before, 
and when you look in the mirror -- hair is sprouting from your ears. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an attractive trait. You can't imagine Mel Gibson with little black 
and gray whiskers popping out where they shouldn't be, but it's common. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the hair is on the outer portion of the ear, it shouldn't be a problem 
removing it," says Candy Connors, an electrolycist with the Hair's End in 
Tustin. "When it's coming from the ear canal, we can't see which direction the 
follicle is growing, and electrolysis is difficult. You can probably cut them 
using a tool for removing nose hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tug on unwanted ear hair and, of course, don't use sharp objects like 
scissors around your ears. If trying to remove them doesn't work, you can 
always let the hair on your scalp grow long enough to cover them. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mess pattern: Women who wear patterned or seamed hose often reveal how tough 
their day at the office was without saying a word. The lines, flowers or other 
patterns are pulled and twisted into something that looks like it was designed 
by Jackson Pollack rather than Donna Karan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just need to check them periodically to make sure the pattern is still 
even," says clothing designer Ellen Corcoran of Yorba Linda. "Of course, if a 
particular pair is causing you more problems than normal, it may be too 
stretched out." 
</P>
<P>
 The current hot hose patterns are light and subtle. Anything wild may make 
your legs look like they're a step behind the times.

 Sales increases for men's products have meant an enlarged stock at Crabtree & 
Evelyn shops. Having the Sienna products listed among the top 10 fragrances in 
Details didn't hurt sales, says Alan Calgaro, manager of the South Coast Plaza 
store. For Father's Day, find a full line of alcohol-free shaving products and 
beautiful old-fashioned shaving sets. The traditional brush and razor sets come 
in black, red, blue, gray and nickel. Tools are $17.50 to $110. Products, such 
as hard soap in a mug, sell for $8.50 to $35. Less Gap 
</P>
<P>
 Dig the Gap's wardrobe staples but not the prices? Then you'll love the Old 
Navy Clothing Co., which prices 80% of its stock for babies to parents at less 
than $22. Take men's cotton pique shirts for $14 or khakis for $22. The chain, 
sure to be the hippest in the value-priced market, opened its Tustin 
Marketplace store Wednesday -- the ninth in the chain and the first in O.C. The 
12,000-square-foot store goes for industrial chic with concrete floors, exposed 
ducts, lockers as display cases, checkout counters and shopping carts. 
Spokesman Richard Crisman calls it "family-friendly." There are plans to open 
45 nationwide this year alone -- mostly in strip malls and other areas where no 
Gap stores exist. After all, it is a division of Gap Inc., which also operates 
the higher priced Banana Republic. "It's a three-tier strategy for us," says 
Crisman, "but it will assume its own identity like the others." A Real Catch

 Bluewater Wear is more than quality duds for the fashionable fisherman. The 
Irvine label has its practical side too, like shorts made of stain-resistant 
Supplex with a map-size back pocket. Even blood spills are no trouble. Started 
in 1989 by Sea World co-founders Milton and Peggie Shedd, Bluewater Wear is a 
division of AFTCO Mftg, the international leader of big-game fishing-rod 
components. The line ($40 to $55) also takes a cue from sailing, diving, 
surfing and other marine sports. So ocean-occupied is the Bluewater crew that 
10% of profits go into conservation efforts. "We're the real thing," says 
spokesman Ben Secrest. "I can tell when an artist forgets a fin." To keep that 
authentic edge, the sales and design team must spend at least 100 days a year 
fishing -- mostly catch and release. How do they handle the stress? ROSE

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; ROCKETTE SCIENCE; LIFE FOR TROUPE MEMBERS ISN'T AS EASY 
AS IT SEEMS, BUT IT DOES HAVE ITS PLUSES, THEY SAY AT POST-PERFORMANCE PARTY 
</P>

<P>
 It wasn't hard to spot the Rockettes among the approximately 100 guests who 
attended a cast party for the legendary Radio City precision dance troupe: They 
were the tall, leggy, beautiful women toting makeup bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockettes and Susan Anton, the statuesque star of "The Great Radio City 
Music Hall Spectacular" that opened Tuesday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, stood out among the crowd attending the post-performance bash at 
Diva restaurant in Costa Mesa. The center's board of directors staged the party 
as a thank-you to supporters of the Costa Mesa theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Their Kicks 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from kicking up their heels in Segerstrom Hall, the Rockettes arrived at 
Diva to nibble on tortellini and chicken stuffed with fontina cheese while 
describing life on the road as a Rockette. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton, who exceeds the Rockettes' height limit of 5-foot-9 by several inches, 
admitted she'd never seriously hoped to be a Rockette, despite singing a song 
expressing otherwise during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fudged that a little bit. The truth is I'm much too tall," said Anton, 
with husband Jeff Lester in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton has nevertheless found herself among the Rockettes on their first 
nationwide tour, singing several numbers during the performance while clad in 
glittering gowns. The Rockettes are visiting 44 cities through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockette Lori Mello, a dark-haired beauty, explained how the Rockettes form 
their perfect kick lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use a lot of peripheral vision," she said. "And when we're in a line, we 
lightly touch the middle of the other girl's back" to keep the formation 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Before putting on a new show, the Rockettes practice about eight hours a day, 
six days a week for three weeks until the days right before the opening 
performance. Then they put in three or four 11- and 12-hour days, Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockettes have learned the value of teamwork. During the "Rockettes in 
Diamonds" number, when they kicked up their heels in sparkling black and silver 
showgirl outfits, the dancers had to contend with falling beads. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all over the stage," Mello said. "It was like a battlefield. We 
just kept kicking them out of the way for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's a Star 
</P>
<P>
 Rockettes not only must perform high kicks, but also be proficient in tap, 
jazz, ballet and modern dance. They even have to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda Jackson and Michael Kessler, the featured husband-and-wife dance team 
that performed a romantic undersea ballet with the Rockettes, keep in shape by 
doing ballet and yoga and by swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also have to have your head together," said Jackson, who said a healthy 
body and mind are crucial to their demanding dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockettes know they share the limelight with other members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you want to shine, you have to shine in the group," said Deanna 
Fiscus-Ford, a Rockette who sported a massive 40-pound Spanish gown during the 
"Bolero" number. "We're 24 women with all of these different emotions," but 
that has to be put aside for the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet being a Rockette does bring notability. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden you have a title," Fiscus-Ford said. "People are impressed. 
They should be, because it's hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the impressed guests were Dr. Gordon Fishman and his wife, Rita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen the Rockettes perform in New York, and it's just as wonderful 
here," he said. "The girls are just as beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got the curves in all the right places," Rita said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other party-goers were: Mary Dell Barkouras, Michael Schulman, Ed McGrath, 
Christopher Vietch, Betty Beldon Palmer, Elaine Redfield, Kent and Nancy 
Snyder, and Susan Strader. KATHRYN BOLD

 "Thanks, honeybunch," he coos in a sub-basso profundo rasp. "Don't get that 
brain thing from that cellular phone." He waits till she's out of earshot to 
add, "L.A. people -- you see 'em coming when you're driving, it's like, holy 
(expletive), that guy's on the phone!" 
</P>
<P>
 With his Brooklynese dialect and his anti-automatic-dialing bias, Poindexter 
is definitely not of Los Angeles, and not really of this cellular world as we 
know it. He is, of course, the high-haired alter ego of definitively New York 
rocker David Johansen, a seemingly time-transported character created to bridge 
the gap between swing time and the swine era. 
</P>
<P>
 Poindexter's swaggeringly arch timelessness seems to carry an 
intergenerational appeal -- which may explain why he was chosen as the sole 
artist to perform Saturday afternoon at the local opening ceremony for the 
World Cup soccer games at the Rose Bowl, a prominent gig that follows hot on 
the heels of his Palace show tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the character shares an anecdote, it's usually apocryphal and impossibly 
anachronistic, like the story he likes to tell about the time he and reggae 
singer Eek-a-Mouse and Noel Coward had a swell night out together. Not at all 
contemporary, but not quite conceived as a time-capsule character, either, 
Buster Poindexter represents some kind of nostalgic post-modernism, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean like as opposed to prima donna, like post-Madonna?" he offers in 
response. "I'm no prima donna, that's for sure. No, I don't know much about 
contemporary-ism, if you want to know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses to gather up ironic momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear they're doing some marvelous things, the young people, these days," he 
adds, like a real Rat Packer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompadoured Poindexter hasn't had much chance to impress the kids lately, nor 
has his floppier-banged real-life doppelganger. Johansen first came to cult 
stardom as the lead singer of the New York Dolls in the mid-'70s. After that 
seminal glam band flamed out, he went on to a solo career under his own name, 
but never had a radio hit till he struck with "Hot Hot Hot" under the Buster 
nom de plume in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 But, not surprisingly, perhaps, follow-up hits have been slow in coming for 
Poindexter, whose "pre-Hays Code" bop doesn't exactly lend itself to house 
remixes. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a new recording contract and a new album out, but isn't kidding himself 
about the prospects of a novelty record gliding into the mainstream again. 
That's why he's doing "a cross-promotional kind of deal," hosting a new weekly 
series for cable network VH-1 called "Buster's Happy Hour," which also happens 
to be the name of the album. 
</P>
<P>
 The series -- a half-hour mixture of Poindexter's singing and guest comedians' 
riffing -- premieres June 24 on the music-video network, and Poindexter hopes 
it will help build interest in his album, which may have a hard time getting 
radio airplay. 
</P>
<P>
 The set at the former Chevy Chase Theatre in Hollywood, as newly decorated for 
Poindexter's show, looks terrific, capturing a sort of elegant Cocoanut Grove 
vibe. The previous evening's taping had the host hosting, trading quips at the 
faux bar with a faux waitress and bartender and introducing comics, but not 
jumping in with any jive tunes due to laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coulda sang last night, but I woulda sounded like crap, and the only reason 
I'm doing this show is to promote this unpromotable record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just totally my trip," he says of the disc, on the Rhino subsidiary 
Forward Records. "I mean, who's gonna play this record?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who indeed? Public radio? He scoffs at the thought. And not likely Top 40 -- 
not when nearly all the tunes come from the late '40s and very early '50s, the 
most recent of the vintage being "Rocket 88," which, he notes, some 
musicologists consider the first rock 'n' roll song. 
</P>
<P>
 And the beginning of the rock era is pretty much the cutoff point for what 
Poindexter goes back to as his musical source material, though his brand of 
stage patter -- which is filled with rousingly delivered non sequiturs -- is as 
close to the modern tone of Janeane Garofolo (one of the hot young comics 
appearing on "Buster's Happy Hour") as to Jackie Gleason. 
</P>
<P>
 Poindexter has been a fixture on the New York club scene over the last decade, 
often doing shows on a weekly basis at the Bottom Line, while rarely taking his 
12-piece big band out on the road because the sheer size of the combo makes for 
grievous touring economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, as part of a Bottom Line anniversary celebration, Johansen put 
together a different band, wrote some new material in an Americana-ish vein and 
actually performed four shows as David Johansen, which he hadn't done in about 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his deal with Forward/ Rhino is for three albums, he does have a clause 
that allows him to make albums under his real name elsewhere should he choose 
to again. Can he emerge from behind his now-better-known alter ego and have at 
least a dual career again? 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell ya, I had a lot of fun," he allows about the shows as Johansen, "but 
it was a lot of work, because I put together a whole new band in a whole new 
style of music for me, kind of Americana; we had pedal steels and banjos and 
mandolins and stuff like that. I'm good friends with (folk singer) Bill 
Morrissey, and he turned me onto a lot of (rootsy) stuff. I got a band there -- 
we rehearsed like, Jesus, three or four times. So I might do it a couple more 
times and see if there's any interest in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he's resented Poindexter's effectively eclipsing the real him in the 
public eye. "I'll take it any way I can get it, I think," Johansen says. "I 
think Buster has a more universal appeal. I don't know about now; I'm probably 
back to square one," he admits, with admirable cynicism. "But the Johansen 
thing and the Dolls thing and all that was kinda for the hip kids, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of this record is to play at parties. Say you're a flustered 
yup and you've got too much on your mind and you're gonna have a party. You can 
just kick up that record and you're in business."

ROAR OF THE BASS FROM ANOTHER YOUNG LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL GALLO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christian McBride, the new oracle of jazz bass, is performing with an 
astounding ease and swagger. He smiles over at pianist Benny Green as the two 
perfectly synchronize a melody line for bass and piano, gently swinging over a 
steady rhythm. On the bandstand, McBride seems peaceful. He beams from behind 
his upright bass; it's where he feels most comfortable expressing himself, 
where his self-confidence is rooted and his ability to communicate is at its 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
 And in his case everyone is noticing. In a hurry. He has been signed to a 
long-term exclusive recording deal by one of the preeminent record labels in 
jazz, Verve. He's being honored Sunday by the Mellon Jazz Festival in his 
hometown of Philadelphia. He is the bassist in two of the hottest bands in jazz 
-- the Joshua Redman Quartet and the Benny Green Trio -- and can be heard on 
five jazz albums released this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for his services is so great that his manager can tell you exactly 
where he'll be every day from now through the end of the year. On Saturday, for 
instance, he'll be at the Hollywood Bowl, appearing with Redman at the Playboy 
Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of this year's new crop of young lions, Christian McBride -- at 22 -- is 
being heralded as the one musician who has the goods to move jazz into the 21st 
Century with freshness, integrity and innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 So far he has responded gracefully to the acclaim, which has occurred after 
just a handful of years in the business. But there is also part of him that 
wants nothing to do with the hype, gala concerts and worldwide tours. 
</P>
<P>
 As he heads into a rigorous summer of tours and recording sessions, he seems 
to feel the need for time to better prepare himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting bored with myself and I'm getting really, really critical (of my 
playing)," he says. "I'm trying to unlock a chain in my brain. (To expand 
professionally) I just need an artistic spark. You can't force it on yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . If I listen to as many records as possible, I'll learn more music -- 
that will give me a larger vocabulary. I've been trying my best to listen to 
records but I've been so busy that I haven't been able to. I need a month off 
-- do nothing but listen and practice. Really sit down and woodshed. It would 
satisfy me personally. I need some time to not burn out." 
</P>
<P>
 In several conversations over the last few months, McBride takes his time 
answering questions and often laughs. He talks at length about the 
compositional greatness of Duke Ellington and Wayne Shorter, rattling off album 
credits as if he spent his life reading liner notes. He works hard at being 
concise in his comments, yet it's obvious at times he hasn't had enough time to 
let sink in everything he has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been achieving since the age of 17, when he made his recording debut on 
Wallace Roney's "Obsession." A quick listen to his recorded output reveals he 
is truly comfortable in the recording studio. On Joe Lovano's new disc, "Tenor 
Legacy," McBride emphasizes a relaxed and swinging groove; on Joe Henderson's 
Grammy-winning "Lush Life," he provides exquisite support in a duet, walking 
his instrument sprightly around the saxophonist's radiant solo, and gets 
aggressively tough on the rest of the selections; in his three recordings with 
Benny Green, the interplay is telepathic -- McBride and Green overlap on solos 
and alternate supporting each other's explorations, always retaining coherence 
and elan. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains his role: "All I try to do is contribute what they want and a 
little more -- if that's all right with them. I don't want to go in and just 
play notes." 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians view McBride's strengths from several standpoints: Green praises his 
knowledge of jazz history; trumpeter Freddie Hubbard lauds his ability to write 
and play the piano; pianist Billy Taylor was impressed by McBride's willingness 
to study the music before a session and enter the studio with ideas. "You don't 
see that from many musicians -- young or old," says Taylor, 72, who used 
McBride on his new recording for GRP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seldom do you find someone with a great melodic sense like Christian -- and 
for such a young cat he sounds like himself," says Hubbard, the first artist to 
provide McBride with a full-time gig. "I've played with (bassists) Ron Carter, 
Paul Chambers, Reggie Workman. He's got a jump on them all -- to know as much 
as he does at such an early age. There's no limit to what he can do -- no 
reason why he shouldn't be a major musician." 
</P>
<P>
 The "sound" of McBride that Hubbard describes is big and muscular -- a 
throwback to the classic jazz bass sound of the '40s and '50s that started with 
Jimmy Blanton in Duke Ellington's band and progressed through the hands of 
Oscar Pettiford, Ray Brown (Chambers and McBride's personal favorite) and Ron 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the work of Chambers that may have had the biggest impact on 
McBride. It was just a decade ago that McBride's great-uncle gave his nephew 
"piles of jazz records" to listen to and study. McBride, who was just 10, had 
dedicated two years to learning the bass. Included in that pile was Miles 
Davis' "So What," with the strong opening bassline by Chambers. It was the tune 
that McBride says made him stick with the upright bass and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter that McBride was forsaking playground games and sports to 
stay indoors to study the instrument. "Playing the bass was so much fun that 
there was nothing else that was that much fun -- other than street football," 
says McBride, who does have the physical build of a small fullback. "It felt so 
natural to me that there was never a question of what I wanted to do. I'd run 
home every day from school and play the bass." 
</P>
<P>
 And as he studied classical music and tried other instruments at Philadelphia 
High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, nothing else came remotely 
close to the rewards the bass offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a message from above that told me to play the bass. I can't 
play the drums well enough to say anything on them and I can't play the piano 
well enough to say anything there. It always felt so natural that it must be a 
message from God. I believe that's what I was meant to do. There are no 
specific answers. Other than imitating James Brown, nothing comes that 
naturally to me -- except eating." 
</P>
<P>
 At 16, McBride moved to New York to study at Juilliard but left the school -- 
and classical music -- after a year. Three months after his 17th birthday, he 
made his recording debut on Roney's "Obsession" album. 
</P>
<P>
 After a number of sessions, McBride joined Hubbard's band, where he met Green. 
They have since recorded four albums and continue their partnership -- the trio 
performs Aug. 7 at the Pasadena Jazz Festival -- as it offers McBride an 
opportunity to both lead and support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question," says Green, "Christian's musical character is a vital part 
of the musical palette. In composing and arranging, the trio is centered on his 
sound, his concepts and his pulse. The things he plays behind me feel perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The energy he emits," Green adds, "I liken to a child's drawing of a house 
and yard. And the sky is a blue line and the sun is in the corner with the 
beams coming out of it up in the right-hand corner. Christian is the sun. He 
makes things feel better."

BALLET SELECTS CHOREOGRAPHERS FOR JULY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ballet Pacifica has announced the four choreographers who will create works 
for the company during its fourth annual "Pacifica Choreographic Project," 
which runs July 17-30. Rebecca Kelly, Pascal Rioult and David Allan, all of New 
York City, and Paul Vasterling of Nashville, were selected from a pool of 25 
applicants by Molly Lynch, the troupe's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly has danced with Lar Lubovitch and the Charles Weidman Theatre Dance 
Ensemble and has her own company. Rioult, a native of Caen, France, has been a 
member of the Martha Graham Dance Company since 1986. Allan danced with the 
National Ballet of Canada from 1977 to 1988 and has created more than 35 
ballets, eight of which were commissioned by Erik Bruhn for the Canadian 
company. Vasterling has danced in the Ohio Ballet, Ballet Austin, Ballet 
Mississippi, Ballet San Antonio and, most recently, the Nashville Ballet. He 
also has participated in the Carlisle Project, a choreographic workshop in 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ballet Pacifica project will culminate in a performance of the new works 
at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa on July 30. Information: (714) 642-9275.

KID STUFF: SCIENCE OF THE TIMES; WEEKLONG ADVENTURE CAMPS HELP TO TAKE THE GEEK 
FACTOR OUT OF THE LEARNING EQUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 16 years of schooling, I have essentially retained two scraps of 
scientific knowledge: 
</P>
<P>
 1) When placed in a glass of tinted water and left on a sunny windowsill, a 
common celery stick will become . . . truly disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
 2) People with head colds make great lab partners. (" You cut the thing open. 
You can't smell anyway!") 
</P>
<P>
 I could blame this lack of scholarship on my teachers, burdened as they were 
by large classes and microscopic budgets. But the fault is really mine. Like 
many of my classmates, I ranked the study of science extremely high on the geek 
scale, second only to flossing one's teeth in the lunch shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Things haven't changed that much. There are still plenty of kids who consider 
science class a nerd's no-man's-land, and overtaxed teachers who lack the time 
and resources to correct their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's kids do have one advantage my generation did not, however. Responding 
to a need for hands-on science education brought about by shrinking school 
budgets, several area businesses have developed programs they hope will ignite 
interest in science by stressing the fun of experimental learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach-based Science Adventures is one of these. Founded in 1979 by 
Bill Gregory, a former science teacher in the Placentia-Yorba Linda School 
District, Science Adventures has grown from a small field trip program at the 
Fullerton Arboretum to a network of in-school classes and special programs in 
400 public and private schools from Ventura to San Diego counties; programs for 
Scouts and other youth groups, including home schools, are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Science Adventures, which maintains offices in Huntington Beach and at the 
Fullerton Arboretum, also coordinates summer day camps at 50 sites across the 
Southland for children entering kindergarten through sixth grades. In Orange 
County, the sessions begin June 20 at eight locations: Fountain Valley, 
Fullerton, Irvine, Laguna Niguel, Newport Beach, Orange, San Clemente and Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeklong camps are offered in half-day or full-day sessions. There are five 
different themed sessions offered, including Science Detectives Camp, in which 
participants create their own 3-D decoders, metal detectors, flashlights and 
other tools to solve a "crime"; and Science Magic Camp, which has kids learning 
about physical science by creating "slime," superballs and motorized 
inventions. Other sessions include Space Rocketry Camp, in which you build and 
launch your own model rocket; Animal Explorers Camp, which teaches animal 
anatomy with dissections and other projects, and a new session, Gizmos, Gadgets 
& Goop, which encourages children to learn how things work through hands-on 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp sessions are led by credentialed teachers or graduate students who have 
completed Science Adventures' training program, said Kerry De Line, the group's 
marketing director. Children are grouped by age, and activities are tailored to 
meet that group's abilities and interest, she added. Curricula, which are 
created by Science Adventures staff, are changed and updated each year. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer marks the 12th year Science Adventures has offered the summer 
camps, which cost $100 for a week of half-day sessions and $175 for full-day 
sessions. De Line admitted that some first-time campers, especially those in 
the upper grades, are initially pretty peeved with the idea of spending their 
vacation in science class, but once they've been introduced to the program, 
their outlooks change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them come into camp with the concept that science is geeky," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to turn kids on to the fact that science can be fun; we can teach 
them about animals, about solar systems . . . and it's all hands-on."  
</P>
<P>
 De Line says that a majority of summer camp participants come from Science 
Adventures' in-school programs. Fees for the program are paid by each school's 
PTA groups, through fund-raisers or by parents. Science Adventures also 
operates a separate, nonprofit foundation that provides scholarships for the 
summer camps to individual students. (There are no more scholarships available 
for the upcoming sessions, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 What: Science Adventures Summer Day Camps. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Summer sessions run Monday, June 20, through Aug. 26 
</P>
<P>

LITTLE BIG MAN; RICHARD PENNIMAN WASN'T JUST BORN TO ROCK, HE WAS BORN TO ROCK 
LARGE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are celebrities, and then there are celebrities , the ones whose 
personas are writ so large, so distinctive and so fully in-character at all 
times that you have to wonder, "Do they ever let it drop and act like the rest 
of us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Did Jimmy Durante continue to declare "I got a million of 'em!" when he was 
among friends? Did Mae West drop the sultry act when she was talking to her 
mom? Does Barney the Dinosaur hunker down with a copy of "Busty Brontos" when 
no one's looking? Don't you wish you could have a microphone in their homes to 
see what they're really like? And wouldn't you especially want one in Little 
Richard's home?  
</P>
<P>
 In the flashy, flamboyant world of rock music, there has possibly never been 
anyone quite so flashy and flamboyant as Little Richard, the self-proclaimed 
King and Queen of rock 'n' roll, the Bronze Liberace, "the liberator , the 
originator , the prime mover , the emancipator of rock and roll" if he may say 
so himself. Little Richard talks as if italics are his birthright. 
</P>
<P>
 On one now-legendary occasion in the early '70s, Richard was a guest on Dick 
Cavett's ABC-TV program. He'd already done his bit, and the show moved on to a 
heated argument between caustic critic John Simon and "Love Story" author Erich 
Segal, while Richard sat there at the edge of the screen growing more and more 
peeved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shuddup, shuddup, shuddup!!!" he finally interrupted, proceeding to chastise 
the two for having, in their literary criticisms, neglected to mention him , 
Little Richard, the architect of rock, the liberator, the . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has had the exhausting pleasure of interviewing Richard can't help 
but note that his self-promotion switch seems to be permanently hard-wired to 
the "on" position. Why, did you know that he gave the Beatles and the Rolling 
Stones their start? That Mick Jagger would curl up and sleep at his feet, and 
Paul McCartney would beg just to touch his shirt? That Jimi Hendrix, the man 
who used to be called Prince, David Bowie, et al., ad infinitum, existed only 
as a result of his glorious example? 
</P>
<P>
 His claims aren't without elements of truth. Moreover, the debt that rock 
music owes to Little Richard Penniman couldn't be repaid even if a gold 
mountain were built in his image. Along with starting to rock before most folks 
got the notion to, from the get-go Richard was the one who showed how far rock 
could go, how wild, how emotional, how abandoned, how volatile the music could 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than singing some laborious tome about freedom, as more recent rockers 
have done, Richard -- in exultantly shouting "AWOP-BOP-A-LOO-MOP 
ALOP-BAM-BOOM!" -- embodied freedom and release. As those who saw him tear 
through "Good Golly Miss Molly" last week on the "Tonight Show" can attest, 
even at age 61 he is a rocking, screaming sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly considering the amount of prose given to subsequent performers 
who merely stepped lightly in his high-heeled footprints, there could never be 
enough said about Little Richard. Still, one does wish for that open microphone 
in his home, to find out if Little Richard ever, ever wearies of proclaiming 
the good news about his resplendent self. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, while speaking to Richard over the phone last Thursday, that 
electronic conduit suddenly was there: Before the interview got underway, he 
excused himself, and for something like five minutes apparently forgot the 
receiver was there as he busied himself with other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely coming over the phone line, his voice could be heard saying: 
</P>
<P>
 Put that up under that box there. . . . Take that, too. Just put it on the 
floor right there . . . . No-no-no-no-no, just leave them right there.  
</P>
<P>
 Is Richard ordering a cadre of followers to build his own gold mountain? 
</P>
<P>
 How many more out there? Come back. Take that one more here. . . . Now, put 
that in there, whatever that is.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, Richard's renounced his wayward ways, so surely he's not directing one of 
his once-notorious orgies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all these footlockers go into storage . . . and put that across the hall 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Then he picked up the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, we're moving stuff to paint things here, and the people that work for 
you, they're busy doing nothing if you don't watch them," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting? Griping about the hired help? Next he'll expect us to believe that 
he sleeps, eats and pays taxes, as mortals do. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps time has mellowed him a bit. But just a bit. In the ensuing 10-minute 
conversation, he only plugged his Sunday Coach House gig three times. At one 
point, he even maintained, "I'm just a regular, ordinary old guy." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what they must have thought in his hometown of Macon, Ga., when in his 
youth, he was going around in drag with half-foot-high marcelled hair. It's 
what white parents must have thought in the '50s when their daughters applauded 
this sweat-drenched black man's uninhibited performances by throwing their 
panties at him. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been with Richard in mind that one particularly ugly leaflet of 
the time warned: "Notice! Stop! Help save the youth of America. Don't buy negro 
records. . . . The screaming idiotic words and savage music of these records 
are undermining the morals of our white youth in America." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the finer turnarounds in our cultural history, in which parents once 
tried to keep Richard from influencing their teen-age children, parents today 
are buying his music specifically for their toddlers. His version of "Itsy 
Bitsy Spider" on the Disney "For Our Children" benefit album led to the hit 
1992 album "Shake It All About," on which he applies himself to rockin' little 
numbers like "On Top of Spaghetti" and "Here We Go Loopty-Loo." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents used to be scared of me because I was something different, something 
new on the scene, you know what I mean? It was something they'd never heard 
about. They'd never seen no man with his hair as high as mine. Mine was higher 
than a top hat, and they didn't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it was my race, and some the type of music I was doing. Everyone else 
was doing rhythm and blues, and I was rockin' , you understand me? Of course, 
we know that rock and roll is really rhythm and blues up-tempo, and I had the 
piano talking and screaming till the top of my voice and had on all of these 
loud colors, and this hair high up in the air, and they said, 'Whay-o, who is 
this? What is this? Whay-re is it coming from? And now they find out that I'm 
just a regular, ordinary old guy that loves everybody and that just makes good 
music and entertains the public. And it's accepted now, thank the Lord for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's mulling offers to make another, more adult rock album and, in the 
meantime, has made his presence felt on the country chart-topping current 
"Rhythm, Country and Blues" album, on which he duets with Tanya Tucker on 
"Somethin' Else." 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "I do a lot of country music as well as rock and roll. You know 
today's country music is really the 1956 rock and roll to me. . . . The country 
people come out to hear me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Others do as well, he said, noting there was an audience of 80,000 for a 
recent festival he headlined in Jackson, Miss. He'll be playing for several 
stadium-loads of people in August, since the Rolling Stones have chosen him to 
open shows on a leg of their tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I love it!" he shouted. "You know Mick Jagger is my buddy. He started 
with me. It's just like going home, going back with the guys that worked with 
me years ago. I know it's only rock and roll, and you know I like it. I'm going 
to get some satisfaction this time." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of feeling neglected and ripped off by the music business, he 
believes he's finally getting his due. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's without any doubt. I feel good about the whole thing. It's so 
great. That's the reason why I want everybody down around the Coach House in 
Orange County to come to the Coach House, because I call this, once in a 
lifetime . We don't come down that way for appearances that much." In fact, 
Richard hasn't performed here at all in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a chance to see the originator , the emancipator , the architect of 
rock and roll. To come and hear the piano talk ! You know, let me make it talk 
for them, you know? And let me scream and sing this (Richard seemed to start 
channeling Bob Seger at this point) good old time rock and roll, the kind of 
music that will sooth your soul, and we can reminisce from the days of old!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything in the old days was that wondrous. Like most artists of his 
day, particularly African Americans, he saw little recompense for his talents. 
On most of the millions of records he sold, Richard was lucky if he saw a 
half-cent per-disc royalty. He says that has now been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, now we're getting paid instead of getting (cheated)," he declared. 
"We've been getting paid for a few years now." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had threatened lawsuits, he said, "some of the people just came 
forth and started paying us. It was overdue, and it came in due time. Better 
late than never. And we thank God that we didn't have to wait forever, and 
we're just glad that we're in our health and strength so that we can enjoy some 
of the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard did a tremendous amount of reminiscing in the garishly candid 1984 
authorized biography "The Life and Times of Little Richard, the Quasar of 
Rock." At the time the book came out, he was appearing more in churches than in 
concert halls, and like a preacher who shows the measure of his salvation by 
revealing the depth of his sins, his narrative revels in the excesses and 
extremes of his life. He talks of backstage parties where he indulged every 
possible combination of drugs and sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a debauched Paul Bunyan, his excesses, as he related them, were nearly 
mythic in proportion. In describing the effects of his cocaine abuse in a 1984 
interview, he had related, "I would blow my nose and all you'd see on my 
handkerchief would be flesh and blood. My membranes was coming out 
fantastically." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviewing him, one sometimes notices that a few of his stories 
contradict one another. Ask him further questions and you'll only get a third 
story that does nothing to reconcile the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 There were periods in his life when he gave up rock music. He stunned his fans 
in 1957 by quitting stardom to attend Bible school, his religious thought 
having been prodded by fears that a plane he was in would crash, and by having 
seen the Soviet satellite Sputnik in the sky. Though he made gospel albums, it 
was seven years before he returned to rock 'n' roll. Then in the late '70s, he 
renounced rock again, instead selling Bibles and preaching. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '84 biography, of which he swore every word was true, he is quoted: "My 
true belief about rock and roll -- and there have been lots of phrases 
attributed to me over the years -- is this: I believe this kind of music is 
demonic." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked last week, though, if he hadn't at times considered rock to be sinful 
and quit performing it, he insisted, "No, but a lot of people said it was like 
that. I'm still an old rock and roll singer, an old country boy from down in 
Macon, Georgia, a milk-drinking, syrup-sopping Little Richard, you know. I 
haven't changed at all.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody had it out that I became an ordained minister. I never became 
ordained in my life. I (quit performing in the '50s) to go to school. You know 
I was very uneducated. I didn't even know how to count the money that was being 
brought to me, how to figure different accounts and bills. So I went back to 
educate myself a little more so I'd be more qualified. That's what I went back 
to do. You know, I got through, you know I know what to do. I'm trying to be 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, he doesn't see such a sharp division between religious and 
secular work these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people have more understanding now. I don't think people are as 
self-righteous. I think now they understand that people have got to live, 
they've got to work, and there ain't nothing that's given to you in this life. 
The only thing that's given is God gave us a body, a brain and he gave us love 
, praise his name. I think we've got to work . You know, God put the birds 
here, and he put the worms in the grass, but the bird has to go and find them, 
you understand me? So God wanted us to know that there's gold and silver there, 
but we've got to dig . When I say dig, we've got to work. Some people sit back 
and wait for things to be given, but there ain't nothing like doing a good 
day's work and getting paid for your job." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks the job he does in concert halls and nightclubs is beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music uplifts their spirit. It uplifts their soul. And I think it gives 
them joy. When they feel discouraged and depressed and down, I think I give 
them a lift. And that's with all races, creeds and colors. They say Little 
Richard has still got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock and roll is a fun music, more of a good-time music. I think with some of 
the stuff people hear on the radio today, they welcome rock and roll. Rock and 
roll did not carry violence with it. You see so much happening today that you 
didn't back then. Then you could go see a show and know that you'd make it back 
home. Now you may not." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dangerous world out there, but one worth braving for some things, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I encourage everybody , everywhere, wherever you are, whatever you're doing 
to lay it aside and come to the Coach House to hear the originator. And you're 
going to enjoy it. You'll hear me scream 'Tutti Frutti,' 'Long Tall Sally,' 
'Good Golly Miss Molly,' ' Rip It Up,' and 'Ready Teddy .' Yeah. We're going to 
give our all and let all the people come out of Orange County to hear some good 
ol' rock and roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so remarkable. It's a great feeling to be alive at this time, at the age 
of 61, to still be able to do it, and to still have the people -- young, old, 
black, white, red, brown and yellow, the rich and the poor -- come to see me . 
That's so beautiful."

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: CAPTAIN BEEFHEART AND THE MAGIC BAND "DOC AT THE RADAR 
STATION" (1980) CAROLINE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An American original through and through, Captain Beefheart (born Don Van 
Vliet in Lancaster, Calif.) was a profound influence on the cutting edge music 
of the '70s and '80s. Such New Wave artists as Pere Ubu, Devo and Public Image 
Ltd. owe a sizable debt to the quirky and challenging sounds of this 
iconoclast. Unfortunately, most of the listening public didn't, and doesn't, 
know Captain Beefheart from Captain Kangaroo. 
</P>
<P>
 Beefheart albums were hailed by critics but shunned by commercial radio as 
being simply too weird for popular consumption. Indeed, it says a lot about the 
rather oblique nature of the Captain's music that "Doc at the Radar Station" is 
among his more accessible works, and it's still pretty far out there. 
</P>
<P>
 With its many herky-jerky rhythms and off-kilter arrangements, "Doc" is in 
many ways a typical Beefheart opus, intended to shake up the rock 'n' roll 
status quo. "Brickbats," with its odd instrumental dissonance and skewed vocals 
by our lovable eccentric, aptly captures his inimitable, anything goes 
approach. One also can sense Beefheart having loads of fun during "Making Love 
to a Vampire With a Monkey on My Knee": Combining some blue language with 
avant-rock trimmings and schlock-horror film score influences (dig that surreal 
use of the mellotron), it's like nothing you've ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of this album do stray as close to the mainstream as you're likely to 
find Beefheart getting. "Sue Egypt" reveals some of his early blues and soul 
influences. His guttural singing recalls the wicked intonations of Howlin' 
Wolf, and the song's grinding guitar riffs are of a Stones-like rawness. The 
catchiest number here is "Run Paint Run Run." Anchored by a tribal rhythm, it 
comes with a chorus you can practically hum in the shower. It most likely is a 
reference to Beefheart's love of painting (his art work is represented on the 
cover). He recorded one more album after "Doc at the Radar Station" (1982's 
"Ice Cream for Crow") before retiring from the music scene and taking up 
painting full time. MORE CLASSICS:

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: LEON REDBONE "WHISTLING IN THE WIND" PRIVATE MUSIC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leon Redbone opens his latest album with an original number that sounds as 
genuinely antique as the vintage outside material he's been covering for the 
past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The song, "Dancin' on Daddy's Shoes," explains in a couple of short verses his 
continuing fondness for pre-World War II popular music: 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing else I'd rather do  
</P>
<P>
 Than to sit around and talk to you  
</P>
<P>
 And reminisce about a simpler time  
</P>
<P>
 The music that we made  
</P>
<P>
 Was simple but it stayed  
</P>
<P>
 In my memory and on my mind  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 More than simple nostalgia, Redbone's performances continue to command 
interest because he never winks at the listener, never patronizes songs that 
others might play strictly for kitsch value. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he can have fun dueting with Ringo Starr on the Hawaii-as-paradise 
fantasy tune "My Little Grass Shack." But then he turns around and sounds as if 
he means every word of "Settin' by the Fire," an ode to the virtues of laziness 
on which he teams up with Merle Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 With the early-jazz backing of Vince Giordano & the Nighthawks, Redbone sounds 
as if he walked straight off the sound stage of a 1930s MGM musical on the 
quick-stepping "You're Gonna Lose Your Gal." 
</P>
<P>
 It all comes down to the one quality that Redbone shows this music and which, 
in turn, he reaps in equal measure: R-e-s-p-e-c-t. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Redbone appears tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $18.50. (714) 496-8930.

WANNA DANCE?: GARAGE IN IRVINE OPENS DOORS TO CUTTING-EDGE SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cool club in the heart of Irvine's business district that knocks the 
platforms off so-called underground nightclubs in Orange County? It's hard for 
even a club veteran to believe, but with the opening last week of the Garage at 
McCormick & Schmick's, it's true. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other surprises at Friday's opening were the tunes delivered by Top 40 
radio station Power 106's party crew, Power Tools. The deejays' selection of 
house, deep house and old school blew away the tired mix of vintage and new 
commercial hits that most clubs can't seem to get out of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Deejays Richard (Humpty) Vission and Tony B! dominated the evening, much to 
the glee of the packed house. The only hitch came mid-evening, when deejay Jon 
Jon started to spin old school disco and new wave: He was apparently more 
intent on proving his power with unnecessary, jarring mixes than maintaining 
the flow. Indeed, he was quickly shuffled off the stage after only half a dozen 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The music, however, was more cutting edge than anything anyone was wearing on 
opening night. The 21-to-mid-30s crowd showed up in everything from tidy jeans 
to tailored suits -- and not of the Brooks Bros. variety. They were a trendy 
bunch for the most part, but not the crowd you'd expect to find in a comparable 
club in New York, Hollywood or even San Diego, where hip centers on the wild, 
bizarre and unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
 Power Tools, however, manages to create a big-city mood with videos of 
futuristic graphics showing on large screens and a live performance by rappers. 
(Those rappers, unfortunately, felt compelled to overuse profanities in hopes 
of keeping up crowd enthusiasm when the sound system temporarily went wacky. It 
didn't work.) As for the go-go dancers, they entertained, but not always the 
way they probably intended. The guy's attempts to move like a robot (or was he 
vogueing?) were weak and didn't quite match up with the music. His constant 
need to pull his purple Spandex briefs above his super tiny hot pants also 
proved more comical than sexy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:30, a queue still stretched outside the door, but it wasn't the 
doormen's way of making the club look popular to passersby. Inside, patrons 
filled every space, from the entrance area to the back patio, where the lack of 
a dance floor mattered not. 
</P>
<P>
 The upstairs lounge area offered some relief, as well as plenty to look at. A 
fabulous collection of framed Playboy covers from the '60s and '70s hangs along 
a wall, as do less interesting posters of famous rockers, including Chuck Berry 
and the Sex Pistols. There is also a view of the first level from the balcony, 
a perfect point for locating lost friends or finding new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack plenty of George Washingtons. Dollar drinks are announced throughout the 
night, from domestic draft beers to the trendy sex-on-the-beach or kamikaze 
shooters. Otherwise, the bar sells domestic bottles of brew for $2.50 and 
imports for $3.50; cocktails run $4 to $5. A glass of wine is $3.75 to $5.25, 
and sodas are $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a $10 cover after 9 p.m., but there are three ways to get around it -- 
offered, no doubt, to drag in the masses in the early evening. Dine in the 
adjoining restaurant until 11 p.m. and be escorted into the club via a special 
entrance; dishes, mostly seafood, range from $10 to $20. Come in for happy hour 
from 4:30 to 8 p.m. and stay on until the Garage officially kicks in. The best 
bet is picking up a flyer with a two-for-one offer before 10 p.m. Flyers are 
handed out as guests leave the club or can be picked up during happy hour on 
other days.

COFFERS BREWING; SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY ENDS ITS 7TH SEASON WITH A 
CONCERT, SEVERAL MAJOR GIFTS AND BIG PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southwest Chamber Music Society will end its seventh season Friday feeling 
fat and sassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, comparatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Its budget this year is around $98,000; next year it jumps to $175,000. "We've 
had an incredible convergence of major gifts shored up by an impressive 
increase in personal gifts," explained artistic director Jeff von der Schmidt. 
These gifts, received since January, include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A two-year $20,000 grant from the Clarence E. Heller Charitable Foundation 
in San Francisco to rehearse and perform a complete cycle of Beethoven's 17 
string quartets; 
</P>
<P>
 * A $15,000 gift from the Ahmanson Foundation in Los Angeles to launch the 
group's first summer season, at the Huntington Library in San Marino; 
</P>
<P>
 * A three-year $45,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation in Los Angeles 
to boost the group's administrative structure and to expand its educational 
outreach programs; 
</P>
<P>
 * A $30,000 matching grant from Chamber Music America in New York for a 
three-year residency at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena; 
</P>
<P>
 * A two-year grant of $40,000 from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation in Los 
Angeles for general operating support, and 
</P>
<P>
 *An $8,500 grant from the National Endowment of the Arts to record a CD (the 
Society's second), a set of late chamber works by Ernst Krenek, for release in 
the fall of '95. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obviously grateful," said Von der Schmidt. "Who wouldn't be excited in 
this era of riots, fires and quakes to raise these types of funds? It's a 
validation of just keeping your nose to the grindstone. A lot of the 
convergence will look like it happened overnight, but believe me, there was a 
lot of sustained work. Not every proposal we threw in got funded." 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1987 to be the Southland's first resident chamber music ensemble 
modeled on the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York, the 
Southwest Chamber Music Society drew on various combinations of area musicians 
to offer concerts in Santa Ana, Pasadena and Claremont. Its first annual budget 
was about $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the group's fortunes have waxed and waned. Some venues were added; 
others dropped out. Eventually, the group found itself playing mainly in two -- 
the Pasadena Library and Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the Society expects to play in about 10 Southland locations. But 
the core series will continue in Pasadena and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 A program at Chapman on Friday will reflect a typical Society mix of 
traditional and new: Halsey Stevens' Trio for Violin, Viola and Cello, composed 
in 1959; Brahms' String Quintet in G, written in 1890, and music for the 
theater by 17-Century composer Henry Purcell, with soprano Mary Rawcliffe and 
lutanist James Tyler, founder of the London Early Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to renew the standard repertory by invigorating it with performances 
of the best of early contemporary and world music," Von der Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what does he plan to do with all the new money? "We're going to play 
better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 What: The Southwest Chamber Music Society, playing music by Halsey Stevens, 
Brahms and Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, June 17, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Bertea Hall at Chapman University, 333 N. Glassell St., Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the Garden Grove (22) Freeway to the Glassell Street exit; 
head north, cross Chapman Avenue and go three blocks to the university. Or, 
take the Chapman Avenue exit from either the Santa Ana (5) Freeway and head 
east, or from the Costa Mesa (55) Freeway and head west, to Glassell Street and 
then head north for three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $8 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (800) 726-7147. MORE MUSIC/DANCE IN COSTA MESA: THE ROCKETTES

WET & WILD: SEA OF CHANGE IN BIG-GAME HUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Alexander has lots of big fish hanging on his walls. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the 300-pound black sea bass he got in Baja California. A 92-pound 
gulf grouper reminds him of another trip south. And a 54-pound yellowtail comes 
close to breaking the record for that species. 
</P>
<P>
 All the fish were shot by Alexander -- with the sleek custom teak spear guns 
he handcrafts for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like building things," explains the 49-year-old Costa Mesa resident. 
"I figured I may as well build something that I'm also involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 One of a handful of cottage custom spear gun producers in America, the former 
mold maker creates big-game guns -- called Alexanders -- that are well-known by 
divers on the West Coast and in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably one of the finest spear guns available," says Harry Ingram, a 
longtime diver who has been using an Alexander for years. "They are just 
beautiful guns; Steve is an artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander got his start in making spear guns after discovering spearfishing 
seven years ago. An avid line fisherman at the time, he was fishing aboard his 
boat off Catalina one day when he ran into some spearfishermen shooting 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of that," he recalls. "I started talking to them and 
attended a couple meetings of their club. The difference between fishing and 
spearfishing is that you don't have to sit on your boat and wait for something 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few weeks, he was trying his hand at the sport. Like most avid 
spearfishermen, Alexander shuns the unsportsmanlike scuba gear. Instead he dons 
only a mask, fins, snorkel and wet suit, holding his breath long enough to 
descend to where the fish roam. 
</P>
<P>
 But he soon became frustrated with the quality of the commercial spear guns 
available. Primarily designed to shoot small fish at close range, they just did 
not pack the wallop or accuracy necessary to bag the big game that was becoming 
popular among the sport's most ardent practitioners. So Alexander began 
tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started modifying and trying to make it better," he recalls. "What I found 
was that it just wasn't up to what we were doing, so I started from scratch and 
built a whole new gun." 
</P>
<P>
 From fine-grained teakwood, Alexander fashioned a longer stock -- making it 
more powerful -- than most being made. Then he manufactured a handle, trigger 
mechanism, spear shaft and tip designed for high performance against big fish 
at great distances. 
</P>
<P>
 The first guns were for personal use only. Later he began making them on 
request for friends. Finally, when the bottom fell out of his mold-making 
business four years ago, Alexander began producing and selling his special 
brand of spear gun full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he says, he sells about 30 guns a year ranging in price from $294 for a 
46-inch one capable of shooting a small fish from 12 feet away, to $648 for a 
six-footer that can bag big game at 35 feet. Alexander's guns cost 30% to 40% 
more than guns of the same size that are commercially produced and sold in 
diving shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiting period for the spear guns -- for which he also sells parts -- is 
two to four months, Alexander says. "I've never advertised," he says of his 
business, which supplies spear guns for divers up and down the West Coast, in 
Hawaii and as far away as Florida. "It's all been word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of mouth has it that the guns are worth waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Maas, a Ventura diver considered one of the best spearfishermen in the 
world, says he recommends them to friends who ask what gun they should use. 
"He's got the closest gun to the state of the art that there is right now," 
Maas says. "He's a fine craftsman and has sound mechanisms." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ingram swears by his Alexander as if it were a longtime companion. "The 
guy's just a perfectionist," he says of the spear gun maker. Shooting one of 
his spear guns, Ingram says, "is like squeezing the hand of a pretty girl." 
</P>
<P>
 When Alexander is not making spear guns, he can usually be found shooting 
them. A member of the Long Beach Neptunes, a spearfishing club, he has traveled 
worldwide to bag big game, but there's an irony to his fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, the spearfisherman admits, "I don't eat fish. I just don't like 
'em. The reason I hang them on the wall is to justify shooting them."

REWIND: UNLIKELY VILLAIN AMUSES AS MUCH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO

<TEXT>
<P>
 There have been a number of science-fiction movies made about the impending 
destruction of the human race by alien invaders. But it's doubtful there has 
ever been one quite like the uproariously funny and campy "Robot Monster," 
available for rent at Unearthly Videos and Books. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the preposterous-looking space villain at the heart of this 1953 
low-budget film has to rank as one of the cheesiest aliens ever to stumble onto 
the silver screen. It's simply hard to take seriously a paunchy bad guy attired 
in a gorilla suit and a diving helmet with antennae. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the makers of "Robot Monster" seem to have had their tongues 
planted firmly in cheek when they were concocting this delightfully absurd work 
(though some critics believe otherwise). The often loony actions of the 
characters and the stiffly delivered dialogue seem to have been designed to 
elicit laughs rather than the fear that earthly civilization is about to come 
to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robot Monster" kicks into gear when an alien, Ro-Man (George Barrows), 
unleashes a cosmic ray that wipes out all but eight humans. These earthlings 
manage to survive because they happened to have ingested a newly created 
antibiotic that makes them immune to the lethal powers of the evil alien. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Ro-Man (which is also the name given his galactic species) is 
hell-bent on destroying the last remaining humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But his mission is partly undermined by his own feelings of doubt and even 
love. Through a video transmitter, he admits to his leader that for the first 
time in his life he feels unsure of himself. To this shocking revelation his 
stern superior responds, "You sound like a human, not a Ro-Man!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ro-Man really loses sight of his duties when he falls for Alice (Claudia 
Barrett), a fetching and brainy earthling. Knowing his weakness, Alice sees an 
opportunity to save the last humans on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robot Monster" is great fun, and the enjoyment is heightened by the fact that 
it was shot in "Three Dimension Process." So put on those 3-D glasses (supplied 
by Unearthly Videos and Books) and have a blast following the adventures of 
Ro-Man. 
</P>

IT'S A LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS AND CAMPINESS; UNEARTHING WORDS AND IMAGES FIT 
FOR ALIEN CONSUMPTION 
</P>

<P>
 For Ana Dahlen, life is a never-ending treasure hunt. As the owner of 
Unearthly Videos and Books in Long Beach, Dahlen spends much of her free time 
searching high and low for hard-to-find science fiction and horror videos, 
books and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go everywhere ," she says with a look of feigned exhaustion. "I go to 
garage sales; I go to other video stores (looking for rare videos), I go to 
library sales up and down the Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlen's diligence has paid off. Though her tiny shop is only a fraction of 
the size of a Blockbuster store, she's managed to squeeze together a fairly 
impressive collection of about 1,400 mostly rare horror and science fiction 
videos for rent and about 2,000 similarly themed books. In addition, she has 
for sale a number of collectible items such as a "Star Wars" plastic model 
space ship and a rare alien anatomy manual from the original "Star Trek" TV 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to these cinematic genres, the former structural planner for the 
Lockheed Corp. seems to have something to satisfy just about every possible 
taste. Looking for a camp classic? She's got "Queen of Outer Space," a '50s 
sci-fi doozy in which Zsa Zsa Gabor plays a man-starved Venusian. Want Japanese 
cyberpunk? Try "Tetsuo: The Iron Man." In the mood for a terrifying, modern-day 
vampire movie? Take a peak at the bloodcurdling "Near Dark." 
</P>
<P>
 "Each customer seems to have a different video that excites them the most," 
says Dahlen, who opened Unearthly Videos and Books about 1 1/2 years ago. "It's 
an individual thing. There are people who come here who love incredibly bad B 
movies. It's like the worse the better. Some want only special effects. Other 
people want older campy films like 'The Brain From Planet Arous.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlen seems most proud of her display of used science fiction and horror 
paperbacks and hardbacks. Among the books for sale are a number of valuable 
first editions and complete book series by such authors as science 
fiction-fantasy writer Robert Adams and horror scribe Piers Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to deal in books as well as videos was easy for Dahlen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Selling the books is what I really enjoy doing," she says. "It's just more 
rewarding to me, because I don't think there is anything you can put on a 
screen that can match an individual's imagination. There isn't anything more 
exciting than reading a book and allowing your imagination to just soar." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unearthly Videos and Books is at 210 Orange Ave., Long Beach, (310) 437-3317. 
Store hours are Sunday, 2 to 7 p.m.; Monday and Thursday through Saturday, noon 
to 8.

SPECIAL SCREENING: CAPRA STYLE DEFINED BY HIS GOOD 'DEEDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Capra had found success before "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," but he hadn't 
quite found himself yet. 
</P>
<P>
 There were hits -- snappy comedies like "Lady for a Day" (1933) and "It 
Happened One Night" (1934) -- but not the personal revelation that came with 
"Mr. Deeds." It was through the 1936 movie that the since much-discussed Capra 
style crystallized, setting the tone for a handful of recognized classics to 
come in the ensuing 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Mr. Deeds" (screening Friday afternoon in a free presentation at the 
Cypress Senior Citizen Center), Capra started to evolve into the national 
anthem of Hollywood directors, a pro-American sentimentalist with a knack for 
combining jug-eared comedy with breathless melodrama. Nobody could be quite as 
corny, or as satisfying, as Capra. 
</P>
<P>
 From "Mr. Deeds," Capra went on to make "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939), 
"Meet John Doe" (1941) and "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), all true to his 
vision of a utopia where doing the right thing always meant that things would 
turn out right in the end. There's nothing cynical about Capra, and that made 
sense to a post-Depression generation of moviegoers who wanted to believe that 
life could be sweet again. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mr. Deeds," Capra invented the simple formula, both in plot and technique, 
that he learned to rely on so often. The story pits a good, naive man against a 
greedy, opportunistic society. As usual, a good-looking dame is tossed into the 
mix; she's a little too friendly with the bad guys, but she'll soon be reborn 
in the hero's uncompromisingly pure image. 
</P>
<P>
 The savior this time is the ever-stalwart Gary Cooper (he also starred in 
"Meet John Doe") as Longfellow Deeds, a "corn-fed bohunk" thrown onto the mean 
streets of New York after he unexpectedly inherits $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl is ever-spunky Jean Arthur (she played opposite James Stewart in "Mr. 
Smith Goes to Washington"), a newspaper reporter who deceives him, then falls 
in love with him as hard as a Bowery tenement collapsing under dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
 As Capra introduces us to Deeds in the rural village of Mandrake Falls, we can 
see what a simple life he leads. He'd rather play the tuba when told about all 
that money by a team of shysters who want it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 When they talk him into going to Manhattan to settle his affairs, Deeds 
doesn't even have a suitcase; he has to borrow a neighbor's. On the train, he 
worries more about the town band, now that it's minus a tuba player, than what 
he's going to do with all that cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur, as "Babe" Bennet, enters the scene after Deeds' arrival in New York. 
She tricks him into believing she's an innocent country girl, all the while 
feeding embarrassing stories of his antics to her circulation-happy editor 
(George Bancroft). Deeds finds out, and it just about does him in. It may be 
his most painful disillusionment, but it's only one in a series. Welcome to the 
big city, boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw comes when his plan to use the inheritance to start a farming 
program for the unemployed is threatened. Deeds' moral certainty crumbles, and 
the comic edge of the film all but disappears. This is Capra, though, and you 
know the world will be bright again, usually sooner than you think. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, June 17, at 12:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Cypress Senior Citizen Center, 9031 Grindlay St., Cypress.

KIDS ON FILM: 'RENAISSANCE' FANS TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a frequent contributor to The Times Orange 
County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny DeVito plays an unemployed ad executive who grudgingly takes a job 
teaching eight educationally challenged Army recruits at a local post. (Rated 
PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want the kids to come along with you to see "Renaissance Man," 
tell them that most of the pivotal scenes take place inside a classroom, deep 
in the throes of Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you're planning to take them and want to stoke the fires 
of expectation, remind them that Danny DeVito rappels ingloriously down the 
side of an Army training tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, it's not all nonstop yuks in this formula comedy -- a kind of "Welcome 
Back, Kotter" in fatigues.  
</P>
<P>
 Serious personal issues are addressed, from the wrenchingly deprived 
backgrounds of DeVito's supposedly dumbbell students to the very real need to 
teach them how to survive in combat, Shakespeare or no Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the film is peppered with enough boisterous hokum to reel kids back in 
just about the time the action tends gets earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 The rap song, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Amthor and Ryan Sandoval, both 13, said the scene that stood out for 
them was the students' performance of a rap number based -- as loosely as a 
pair of fatigue pants -- on Hamlet's soliloquy. 
</P>
<P>
 Music, of a sort, also figured in 12-year-old Joe Zorrilla's analysis. He said 
he liked the Shakespeare rap, but "I also liked it when they made up funny 
marching songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not songs, actually, but cadences to keep time as they marched. And nothing so 
dry as a simple "hut-two-three-four." The modern Army, apparently, drills to 
R&B. And drill sergeant Gregory Hines marches his charges up a hill to the 
lyrics of "Tiny Bubbles." 
</P>
<P>
 There being no kids in the film, apart from the brief role of DeVito's 
daughter and rapper Marky Mark, who plays one of the students, DeVito got the 
nod as the kids' favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the advertising buildup on TV, but nearly every kid mentioned 
DeVito's tiptoe descent of the "victory tower." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really funny when he had to get down that tower and he got scared," 
said Danny Dickson, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Zach Stone also enjoyed the sight of DeVito twisting slowly, 
slowly in the wind, but he said he also appreciated the intellectual awakening 
of the students and "how they all came together and became stronger, and in the 
end when they all saluted (DeVito)." 
</P>
<P>
 "Renaissance Man" can be a tear-jerker at times, but no self-respecting kid 
will ever admit to being affected. Jeremy deflected the pathos onto Roberta 
Steponovich, who had taken him and Ryan to the screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "She cried through the whole thing," he said. "I think she really came to see 
Marky Mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Though virtually all the kids who attended two screenings of "Renaissance Man" 
came out of the theater with thoughtful looks rather than grinning replays of 
gags, all pronounced it funny.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Zorrilla, 10, one of three Zorrilla brothers attending the movie with 
their parents, said it was "really funny. But I really liked it when they went 
to the play." 
</P>
<P>
 His mom wasn't sure she heard him correctly. Could he have actually enjoyed 
the scene in which DeVito takes his class to a performance of "Henry V"? 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean when they were singing on the way to the play, right?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, the play," said Jeff, who added that he'd like to go to a real 
Shakespearean performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bard, apparently, also plays well in khaki.

PEKING DUCK ON A WHIM? YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of coral-shelled prawns cluster at the bottom of a home-style aquarium 
near the front podium of China Palace. Soon they'll be steamed, peeled and 
eaten with a mahogany-colored ginger-soy dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Live prawns are hardly a rarity in Chinese restaurants nowadays, but we are in 
Newport Beach here, not San Gabriel, Westminster or L.A. Chinatown. It's China 
Palace that is the rarity -- a quality Chinese restaurant catering to a 
predominantly non-Chinese clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 China Palace is one of those hokey-looking, tropical-themed beachside 
restaurants cast from the same mold as Don the Beachcomber or the more urbane 
Trader Vic's. But in the dozen years owner Jack Mau has been operating this 
place, he has been sneaking authentic Chinese dishes onto his menu one by one. 
I am not surprised when the steamed prawns with ginger-soy sauce turn out to be 
fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Few driving south on PCH past Newport Boulevard can fail to notice the 
restaurant's blue-and-red, Op Art-style sign. It's that thing that hurts your 
eyes as you drive by. For that matter, the inside of this place might hurt your 
eyes too, at least at first. 
</P>
<P>
 The main dining area could pass for a transplanted rain forest resort; it is 
that crowded with jungle plants and cane furniture. The south end of the 
restaurant has a sushi bar, closed at the moment because Mau's longtime sushi 
man is on hiatus in Japan. That means you will have book your table in the rain 
forest and content yourself with Mau's largely Chinese American menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for an odd compendium of dishes such as salmon in black bean sauce (a 
very un-Chinese choice of fish; more traditional would be, say, steelhead) or 
red sticky ribs (instead of braised ribs) with pumpkin and rice crumbs. But not 
to worry. Almost everything that comes out of this kitchen is tasty, even if 
composed of ingredients that would cause curious stirrings in Mau's home 
province of Sichuan.  
</P>
<P>
 Ask nicely, by the way, if you intend to eat with chopsticks. The management 
is expecting you to use knife and fork. 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought I'd be admitting this on the record, but my favorite things to 
eat here are these sticky red spareribs, throwbacks to the Chinese restaurants 
of our youth. Mau uses baby back ribs exclusively, and the meat is so tender 
and sweet it practically falls from the bone. They are the polar opposite of 
the tough, gristly ribs you can expect in unenlightened Chinese restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more appetizers not to miss are shau mai and fried dumplings, both 
mainstays of the Chinese tea house. Shau mai are essentially round, minced pork 
dumplings in thin noodle wrappers, sometimes (as here) crowned with shrimp. 
These shau mai are too meaty for the Chinese palate, but their fine, fatty pork 
fillings suit me. As for the fried dumplings, they're crescent-shaped and eaten 
with a light rice vinegar. These golden-brown masterpieces, six to an order, 
spit appetizing juices when their thick skins are dissected. 
</P>
<P>
 The best soup is crab meat and asparagus, which costs $6.25 and yields four 
small bowls. The clear broth is chock-full of razor-thin slices of fresh green 
asparagus and lump crab meat which, remarkably, has retained much of its 
natural essence. The restaurant's more mundane hot and sour soup is shot 
through with a heavy dose of vinegar, which obscures the taste of its fine 
components: tree ear mushrooms, dried tofu and chopped bamboo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's showpiece is Peking duck, a winged masterpiece with finely 
lacquered skin. This is one big, beautiful bird, presented whole at your table, 
carved and then served with scallions, bao zi (steamed buns) and pancakes, the 
latter waiting to be smeared with plum sauce by a team of solicitous waiters. 
Mau says he sells a dozen ducks a night on busy evenings, and this volume is 
what makes it possible for you to order one on a whim. In most places, Peking 
duck has to be ordered at least one day in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise caution with main courses. Many of them -- particularly those marked 
with a symbolic chili to indicate added hotness -- are overly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Aromatic shrimp, for instance, somehow rates a chili, but the only detectable 
flavor is sweet tomato sauce. Orange-flavor chicken is prepared with a light 
cornstarch batter and plenty of sauteed orange peel, but also with enough sugar 
to sweeten a pitcher of ice tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger duck is the poor man's Peking duck, where duck meat is sauteed with 
onions and lots of fresh ginger. It too has a cloying sweetness that renders it 
uninteresting after two or three bites. 
</P>
<P>
 I will vouch for the dry saute string beans -- they're crisp, snappy and 
spiced with zest. The moo shu pork, another pancake-wrapped novelty, is good 
too: shredded vegetables, egg and pork that you eat like a light, elegant 
burrito. (Make sure they go easy on the plum sauce, though.) 
</P>
<P>
 The popular kung pao in two flavors contains chicken, shrimp and peanuts, all 
sauteed with a spicy black chili sauce. Mau uses little more than a spoonful of 
fresh oil in the saute, hence the absence of the dish's telltale oil residue at 
the bottom of the serving platter. Another good dish is salmon with black bean 
sauce. The fish is not overwhelmed by the salty, full-flavored sauce, and the 
natural sweetness of the salmon comes forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else do you find salmon in a Chinese restaurant?" asked Mau with pride 
as he presented the dish at our table. 
</P>
<P>
 Not very many places, surely. Never mind that it is clearly a stretch to think 
of China Palace as textbook Chinese. After a dozen years in Newport, even 
someone from faraway Sichuan might up and go native. 
</P>
<P>
 China Palace is moderate to expensive. Appetizers and soups are $4.50 to 
$9.95. Main dishes are $7.75 to $26.

PARKER'S PLACE: FATHER'S STICK AND OTHER MEASURES OF A MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm holding in my hands a device made by my father, circa 1966. He was always 
good at making things, and still is, and I'm proud of this handy little item. 
It's about four feet long, fashioned from an old broom handle, and from one end 
protrudes a quarter-inch-diameter metal rod, which is bent at the end to form 
what looks like the top part of an "s." The rod is set in a hole at the end of 
the wood, which is wrapped tightly with wire, then shrink-wrapped so the two 
pieces will stay together. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad made this for me to catch snakes with when I was a boy. New, it featured 
my name handwritten down the wooden handle in the clear, no-nonsense printing 
my father used on a thousand blueprints and designs he worked on as an 
engineer. The ink has long faded, but I know exactly where my name was because 
it held up for a surprising amount of years. I've probably caught 100 snakes 
with it. In fact I used it just last week, when a large and unhappy Western 
rattler wandered onto the driveway and did battle with my dogs. (No one was 
hurt in the encounter.) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm thinking about my father because Father's Day is this Sunday, though I 
think of him a lot anyway. Curious about what the World Book Encyclopedia would 
say, I looked up father, and found it sandwiched between Fates ("The Fates were 
stern and gloomy goddesses. . . . Men offered them gifts to escape death, but 
never to thank them for blessings. . . .") and fathom, which is of course a 
"six-foot unit of length used to measure ropes or cables and the depths of 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Father, I was a little surprised to learn, "is a title of honor given to those 
who establish anything important in human affairs." The World Book goes on to 
list some great fathers: Father of American Methodism (Francis Asbury), Father 
of Angling (Izaak Walton), Father of English Prose (Alfred the Great), and 
Father of Lies (Satan). 
</P>
<P>
 Father's Day, I learned, was started by Mrs. John Bruce Dodd of Spokane, 
Wash., in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 But historical fathers and holidays for fathers interest me a lot less than my 
own father, who was probably the single greatest influence on my life and who, 
in many ways, still is. I doubt that he'll ever be listed in World Book as 
Father of Jeff Parker, but this diminishes him not one bit in my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems odd -- and awfully self-involved -- that we usually remember parents 
by listing what they gave us. But we can't remember them by the things they 
tried to give us and we were too dumb to take, so we're stuck with the actual 
rather than the ideal, which is probably a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Few could rightly desire to be remembered by a snake stick. However, that 
snake stick seems wholly representative of my father, for a number of reasons. 
First, as I mentioned, he made it himself, and making something yourself has 
always been a point of pride with my dad. He's a born inventor, designer, 
improver. My brother once gave him a book for his birthday titled "All the 
Things That Robert Ford Parker Can't Fix," and the pages of the book were all 
blank. Of course, Matt made the book himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Dad made that snake stick well enough to last 28 years and show no 
signs of giving out soon. I can't remember anything that my father made -- from 
the bow he crafted for me when I was 4, to the doghouse, lizard cages, gun 
stocks, cabinets for the camper and a host of ingenious gadgets for his current 
passion (growing grapes) -- that wasn't built to last. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an inherent contradiction in a snake stick of any kind that, for me, 
symbolizes one of my father's best qualities. A snake stick is built for 
handling dangerous or poisonous serpents, which by definition are best left 
unhandled. But my father would never quash an enthusiasm. He would never have 
forbade us from playing with dangerous things, so long as we had the right 
training and the right tools for the task. The stick says: If you're going to 
try something weird, son, take a chance, use me well, and go for it! 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen this concept of brinkmanship in my father for as long as I can 
remember. He's probably never put it so prosaically (Dad's a great raconteur, a 
superb rhetorician), but there's been a "when in doubt, go for it" strain in 
him for, I can only assume, his entire life. Of course, this attitude has 
gotten him into trouble, but it's gotten him more good than bad, and any trait 
that yields a plus in the final column is OK with most of us. Without it, 
nothing very interesting would ever get done. 
</P>
<P>
 It's telling, I think, that Dad made this snake stick with materials at hand, 
rather than buying ones he thought might make the ultimate, envy-of-the-block 
snake stick. My father was never the kind of man to do much for appearance' 
sake. In fact, he took a certain relish in flying in the face of convention, 
caution, the socially approved. 
</P>
<P>
 I clearly remember more high-tech tools, but they were heavy, unwieldy and 
unforgiving. One, made from a golf club, was so rigid you were likely as not to 
brain your poor snake if you didn't keep an awfully light touch on it -- the 
very lightness of touch that can let a rattlesnake slip the pin at the last 
second and sink its fangs into your thumb. Dad's design -- inexpensive and easy 
to produce -- has an ingeniously right amount of give. Perhaps it was his 
engineering background that led Dad to employ so perfect a weight-to-strength 
ratio. More likely, he just saw the broom handle and metal rod and went for it. 
</P>
<P>
 One can say that the primary purpose of a snake stick is to keep certain 
things -- snakes -- at a safe distance. My father has kept lots of other things 
distant also, on the surface, at least. He doesn't call every week. He rarely 
writes. (Neither do I.) But through 40 years of being my father, he's come 
through for me in every way that matters. He's felt my heartaches and my joys; 
he bailed me out of jail and watched me graduate from college; he smiled when I 
married my love, and cried when we buried her; he drove 600 rainy miles to sit 
in Edwards South Coast Laguna cinema and watch the debut of "Laguna Heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a snake stick keeps distance, but more importantly, it keeps you engaged 
with the object of your desire. Men of my father's generation were accused of 
being distant, just as men of my generation are accused of exactly the same 
thing. It's a tired old song, and the words are true. 
</P>
<P>
 But distance is necessary, and it is good. Distance is bridged within hearts 
in the time it takes electricity to jump a spark plug gap. (Dad would know 
exactly how much time that is.) I've learned from 40 years of being his son 
that distance is not disconnection any more than the line of the horizon is the 
end of the world. Distance is what the hawk glides over, what the waves build 
upon, what you love someone across. 
</P>
<P>
 So, from my distance to yours, a short few hundred miles: an arc of spark from 
heart to heart, son to father this special Sunday in June. May we share many 
more.

3-HOUR TOUR: AN ANIMAL ATTRACTION IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those of you wondering what to do with your leisure time for the rest of your 
lives might want to check out any of several businesses on or near Brookhurst 
Street in Huntington Beach. Become an artist? Raise tarantulas? Make your 
decision over succulent sticks of satay. 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5: You can get a whole new perspective on animals at Pet Metro -- "The 
Ultimate Pet Metropolis." 
</P>
<P>
 You enter the fish room, for instance, beneath an arched aquarium, so you see 
the bellies of the fish. Inside you'll find some of the most incredible 
creatures on this planet -- cowfish, guinea fowl puffer, dragon wrasse and blue 
box fish -- all more outlandish than their names could possibly suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 If those aren't special enough for you, a "special critter" section offers a 
blue spot stingray, snails and decorator crabs; electric scallops actually 
appear to send bolts of electricity across their lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Finches flit, and crested cockatiels perch contentedly in the bird room, but 
the big attraction is the nursery. Baby birds are hand-fed and sold from 
controlled-environment "isolettes" when they're ready to bond with new owners. 
Most impressive were a 12-week-old white Moluccan cockatoo ($2,299) and, only 7 
weeks old, a spectacular blue and gold macaw ($1,399). 
</P>
<P>
 Reptiles, arachnids and amphibians share a room. African chameleons are 
fascinating, but to really impress company, choose among Mexican red-knee or 
curly hair tarantulas, Israeli or emperor scorpions, Indonesian jumping tree or 
barking tree frogs, and a baby Borneo blood python. Centipedes, of course, are 
cheaper by the leg. Your pet will feel right at home with Repti-Scenes, 
terrarium backdrops featuring Amazon cliffs, tropical beaches or desert buttes. 
</P>
<P>
 From chinchillas to pedigreed rats, small animals are big at Pet Metro. 
Twenty-five kinds of dog biscuits are sold in bulk at $1.49 a pound, nine kinds 
of cookies at 35 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shop doesn't sell dogs or cats. Instead, it works with pet rescue 
groups. Said company spokesman Scott Hudson, "We're hoping to make adoption a 
mainstream thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 5:40: Drop in at Art Waves, and a class is sure to be in session. Be it 
painting, drawing or ceramics, children, teens or adults, budding artists flock 
to the place. Professional-looking works by children line the walls; several 
former students have gone on to successful art careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Waves offers a wide variety of workshops. Learn to sew T-shirts, design a 
hat or decorate glass ornaments for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees range from $5 for an open-table ceramics session to $40 (supplies and 
firing included) for a "Glass Plate With Pansies" workshop this Saturday. For 
ceramics classes, students buy an unfinished piece, learn to clean it, then 
paint it; Art Waves fires the project. Called bisque if it's been fired once, 
greenware if it hasn't, ceramic ware includes coffee cups, dragons and castles, 
rhinoceroses, angels playing accordions and life-size basset hounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Waves also carries cute foods, including pumpkin butter and carrot jam. 
Unusual gifts include mirrored base tic-tac-toe boards with pewter cupids and 
hearts or bunnies and cabbages. 
</P>
<P>
 5:40 to 6: Tole painting is decorative folk painting on tin or unfinished 
wood, and at the FolkArtist, a few miles south, Kitty Lemley offers "a unique 
and individual approach." Whereas most tole painting schools assign one project 
to all students in a class, "I don't," Lemley said. "I let everybody paint what 
they want." Supplies initially run $75. Classes are $7.75 or $26 for a series 
of four lessons. Class camaraderie runs high, and it's fun just to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 7: The cuisine may be exotic, but Dewi Indonesian restaurant is 
down-home. The owner's mother knits behind the counter, and the dinette set 
decor has Southeast Asian dolls next to the Seven Dwarfs; Frank Sinatra singing 
in the background with game shows on the TV; "Beauty and the Beast" decals on 
the front door and maps of Jakarta on the walls -- yet it's all perfectly 
agreeable. A "market" at the rear, basically several shelves, offers sambals 
(pepper pastes) and bumbus (spice mixes), klapper (desiccated coconut) by the 
pound, and Komodo shrimp crackers that the label says are "suitable for 
souvenir."  
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers should start with nasi rames ($5.95), a "rice table" sampling of 
half a dozen dishes. Satay (barbecue pork or chicken sticks, $5.25) and gado 
gado (bean cake salad, $4.95) feature peanut sauce. Very spicy empal pedes (hot 
meat with coconut, $6) is highly recommended. If that's your choice, you can 
cool off with ice tjampur ($1.75), a refreshing concoction of red vanilla 
syrup, gelatin-like red jelly and exotic jack fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The food was wonderful and an incredible value. But my mind was on electric 
scallops.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: HANGING BY FINGERNAILS COULD RUIN A MANICURE; 
PANCHO DOLL SAYS CLIMBING IS SAFE, BUT SO WAS THE TITANIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm no hero, no daredevil. Never been described as "hellbent for leather." I 
get my kicks vicariously, willingly letting others thumb their nose at death. I 
admire the courage of anyone who withdraws money at an ATM after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sit in front of the computer writing this column -- as perilous an 
undertaking as I care to have today -- I'm beginning to hyperventilate over the 
subject of this week's centerpiece. Rock climbing. I can't fathom holding onto 
your life with your fingernails, especially with manicures so expensive these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff writer Pancho Doll, an evangelical rock climber, has been driving me up 
a wall to get me to climb a wall, but I politely declined (OK, so I threw him 
out of my office). He says climbing is safe, but so was the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people associate rock climbing with danger," the persistent Doll said. 
"But that's not what it's all about. It's about using skill and judgment to 
manage risk and go where others can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Doll, who started climbing in Alaska nine years ago, so far has managed to 
persuade a couple of male colleagues to accompany him on his vertical journeys, 
but he's striking out with women. Too bad, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people think rock climbing requires brute strength when in fact what 
counts is the ratio of strength to weight," Doll said. "The best climbers are 
almost pitifully thin. Women make excellent climbers because lots of them have 
better strength-to-weight ratios than the guys you see clanging big iron in the 
gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Doll learned that rock climbers were originally on the oddball fringe of 
recreational athletes. But in the last few years the sport has become more 
mainstream as artificial climbing walls provide accessible practice venues, 
enabling participants to gain experience only a few feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Ventura County is not a climber's dream. "Natural climbing rock in the 
county is only average by Southern California standards," Doll said. "Since 
it's a long way to Joshua Tree National Monument and other climbing meccas, 
practice walls are popular here." 
</P>
<P>
 The county may not be known for its challenging monoliths, but rock climbing 
owes a lot to Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia founder and a legendary climbing 
pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although climbers may be thrill-seeking adrenaline junkies, they're not 
suicidal. The right equipment is as important as the right moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Doll recently invested in a deluxe equipment package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent an amount of money I'm not comfortable disclosing, but there's a 
comma in it," Doll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he now a better climber? "No, I'm still really bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants me on the wall with him? Does he think I have rocks in my head?

SOUNDS: WATSON LETS HIS ART MATURE WITH TIME; * THE ALTO SAXOPHONIST AND LEADER 
OF THE BAND HORIZON IS CAPABLE OF INTENSE IMPROVISATIONS AND ECLECTIC BLENDS OF 
STYLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Josef Woodard is an avowed cultural 
omnivore who covers art and music.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are at least two things distinguishing the sleek but free-spirited group 
known as Horizon from the general jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
 First, this particular lineup -- hot players, all -- has been together for 
five straight years, a solid track record in a music world always subject to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the fearless and indefatigable leader, alto saxophonist Bobby Watson 
actually slipped into his (gasp) fourth decade on the planet last year. Ageism 
tends to govern much of the current jazz market, dominated by either 
twentysomething players or rediscovered older veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson is busy staking out a rewarding middle ground, letting his art mature 
in due time. Watson was young before being young was popular in jazz. He took 
his time getting to where he is, and can now be counted as one of the best and 
most well-versed alto players around. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Lawrence, Kan., Watson went to the University of Miami before heading 
up to New York. There, he traveled in avant garde circles and, on the 
straighter side of things, wound up spending five years with Art Blakey's Jazz 
Messengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Blakey in 1981, Watson formed Horizon, which eventually hit its stride 
with the addition of drummer Victor Lewis, who now writes some of the band's 
best material. The band, which will hit Ojai's Wheeler Hot Springs on Sunday, 
also includes trumpeter Terrell Stafford, pianist Ed Simon and bassist Essiet 
Okon Essiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the band's albums is 1991's "Post-Motown Bop," a telling title for a 
band that mixes soul with its post-bop. The new live album on Columbia, 
"Midwest Shuffle," may contain the steamiest and most fluid ensemble playing 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Horizon is Watson's main thrust, but he continues pursuing side projects. The 
Watson bio, to date, also includes his 17-piece Tailor Made Band and a music 
credit for the Robert De Niro-directed film "A Bronx Tale." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed last week from his home in midtown Manhattan, where he lives with 
his wife and two children, the amiable Watson had just returned from a European 
tour with the now 11-year-old 29th St. Sax Quartet. That group has earned 
acclaim as a kinder, gentler answer to the World Saxophone Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, generally, is one of jazz's kinder, gentler firebrands, capable of 
intense improvisations and eclectic blends of styles. But there's something 
more affirming than abrasive about his adventures, which are underscored by 
gentility and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be a Midwest connection? 
</P>
<P>
 "Midwest Shuffle" -- did the title come after the song, or vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
 It came later. Listen to it: the groove reminds me of someone on a horse. 
That's what the Midwest shuffle is. It's like a gallop. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you have a sense back when you started Horizon of what the group identity 
might be about? 
</P>
<P>
 I always had a vision. With this record, we've come a closer to what I wanted 
to do back then. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been categorized in different ways that I had no control over -- like I 
was hard bop. I was just hoping that I would finally get the right combination 
of guys so that we could stretch the boundaries and come to this point. It's 
taken this long to come to where I've wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very free and open to more experimental things when I first got to New 
York. I was making bird sounds and was listening to Eric Dolphy. Working with 
Art, being a Jazz Messenger, you can't be that way. I realized then that I had 
to learn more about swinging, so that when I went out again, I'd be saying 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 It's taken me this long to work my way back out again, only this time with a 
little more swing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming out of Art Blakey, were you inspired by the quintet format and wanted 
to continue that into your own work? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. With two horns, you get the beginnings of harmony and counterpoint. The 
arranging part of me had to have a quintet. I tend to write more line against 
line, whereas with Art, it was more block-style. We all played the same rhythm 
at the same time, and we had to follow the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to write where the trumpet player can mold his part the way he wants, 
and my part is flexible enough against his part so that I can do what I want. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that a lot of the younger jazz players, now in their 20s and early 
30s, are more conservative than you are, not as open to bringing together 
different styles or trying out new ideas. Do you sense that irony? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. I feel like a dinosaur sometimes. These guys are so conservative. That's 
one thing about jazz: It was never about conservatism. It's about everybody 
having their own philosophy and being a character. All the greats had their own 
philosophy that went with their style. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what to think about all this homogenous stuff. But they're going 
to grow out of it. When I was their age, I was exactly the same. The older you 
get, you start to find yourself. The only difference was that I wasn't 
recording like they are now, being put up there. But we were exactly the same, 
going through those phases. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing that displeases me is that (the jazz market is) putting that out 
there as being what's happening, and it ain't. It's guys my age -- Joe Lovano, 
Jack Walrath, cats who have been out there and found their niche. That's where 
the pinnacle of this music is, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Art Blakey used to say, this is an art form and things take time. He 
could just see my frustration when I'd want to do something and it wouldn't 
work the way I wanted it to. He'd say "Bobby, now just take it easy. Rome 
wasn't built in a day." That was his favorite saying. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd say "I know, I know, but I want it so bad." 
</P>

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: RIGHT MIX FUELS PATRONS FOR A FAST PACE; * THE DANCER-FRIENDLY 
CACTUS COUNTY BAND PUTS OUT PLENTY OF HIGH-ENERGY MUSIC AT THE BORDERLINE BAR 
AND GRILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the past three weeks, I've checked out several bands and visited clubs 
from Santa Ynez to Malibu. Despite the mileage, I only saw one fight break out. 
And that biker brawl was nothing compared to the parking lot scene between one 
of the musicians and an old flame who showed up unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks find such antics entertaining. But for me the highlight of my 
recent club-hopping was a Monday night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in 
Thousand Oaks. I had so much fun line dancing at the opening of their new 
live-band format that I'm headed for the ice pack -- and maybe traction. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue, a dancer-friendly band like Cactus County, and deejay Rick Borja 
mixing the break music resulted in a high-energy evening with a healthy turnout 
of patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has made sure to book bands that will play a strong dance club 
format, and will call and count down the dances. So if you liked the 
controlled, consistent deejay music before, you'll find this format enhances 
the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But watch out for those fast Walkin' Wazzi's. The Borderline is the only place 
I've seen two fast-and-faster Tush Pushes regularly played back-to-back. So 
check with your doctor before getting on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cactus County will play every Monday in June. And you can bet Randy 
Carpenter's mom will be out there each week in her black cowboy hat, jeans and 
Cactus County T-shirt to cheer 'em on. And her pride is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 This five-piece Simi-Valley-based country band first rehearsed in September 
and first performed at the end of January. Yet they've already appeared at last 
month's Conejo Valley Days and are booked for next year. In addition to the 
Borderline, they'll continue to appear at Cousin's and Schooner Time, both in 
Simi Valley. And you'll soon be able to catch them at the Crazy Bull in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our set list caters to the dancers as it should," said Tom Galella, who 
described himself as the drummer and one-fifth of a team. The remaining lineup 
includes: Andy Fontana (lead vocals, lead guitar), Rene Ames (lead vocals, 
keyboards, rhythm guitar), Randy Carpenter (rhythm guitar, lead vocals), and 
Rene Ames' husband Tim on bass guitar and vocals. Galella said their music fits 
within the New and Hot country labels.  
</P>
<P>
 For such a young band, Cactus County has a tight, seasoned sound. And it 
probably doesn't hurt that Fontana and Carpenter are line dancers. They also 
write for the band along with Rene Ames, whose country alto voice is 
well-matched to her medium two-step, "It Won't Be Long Now." Although she wrote 
the song several years ago, it's a timely addition to the current crop of tunes 
made popular by K.T. Oslin and Kathy Mattea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hillman, of the legendary Byrds and more recently, The Desert Rose band, 
has lately been donating his time to local charitable and civic events 
including last month's annual Ventura Police Block party and the DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the renewed popularity of the Eagles' music and that special 
12-string guitar sound, I asked him during a phone interview about the fate of 
The Desert Rose band and any plans for a Byrds revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the Byrds are concerned, there's only three of us left. But David 
Crosby and I would like to go out on the road. And I will present the project 
to Roger McGuinn early this summer," said Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he said it, he admitted he was torn about touring. "I'm 50 years 
old in six months; I'm never gonna quit music, that's what I do for a living," 
he said. "But I'm taking a year off because I've toured or been on the road 
every year since 1963, except for one summer. But I got burned out and had to 
stop. I had to miss five of my 10-year-old daughter's birthdays." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fans of The Desert Rose band can expect release of its final album, 
"Life Goes On," this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only band I had that stopped working under the best of terms," 
Hillman said. "I felt that the way country radio is now, it was virtually 
impossible for us to get back on the radio after being perceived as having hits 
between 1989-1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we decided to retire with dignity. I didn't want the next step to be a USO 
tour. And we're proud of what we accomplished," said Hillman, adding that he's 
writing new material and plans to go into the studio in about eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desert Rose was one of the best musical groups I've ever been associated 
with," Hillman said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As expected, some folks have taken issue with the line dance article I wrote a 
few weeks ago. And I would love to hear from you for a column I plan with 
rebuttals. So please mail or fax your comments -- the address is listed below 
and tell us why you love line dancing. We hope to hear from you by the end of 
June.

THEATER REVIEW; SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL OFFERS COMEDY WITH TRAGEDY; * LOOK BEYOND 
UNEVEN PERFORMANCES FOR PLEASANT SURPRISES IN 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' AND 'THE 
LION IN WINTER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In its second year of operation, the plucky Santa Barbara Shakespeare Festival 
has established a solid beachhead in a highly saturated cultural market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the formidable challenges involved even for established presenters 
(witness the recent Pasadena Playhouse exit from the Lobero Theatre), many a 
fledgling theater company would be hard-pressed to deliver a single production. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to its credit, the festival has taken the plunge with two ambitious 
efforts now playing in repertory -- Shakespeare's problematic comedy "The 
Merchant of Venice," and James Goldman's anachronistic historical drama "The 
Lion in Winter." 
</P>
<P>
 To be frank, there's no mistaking these for professional caliber productions. 
Both reflect the uneven performances and limited resources that go with the 
territory in community theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you can look past the medieval cloaks accented with Doc Martens, there 
are enough pleasant surprises in both shows to make the time well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival Artistic Director Sean O'Shea finds humor in all the right places in 
his staging of "The Merchant of Venice." Bawdy entendres, lively exchanges and 
exuberant slapstick abound in this very dark comedy about ideals, loyalty and 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Angi Paul makes a feisty, engaging Portia, the heiress who handily deflects 
her campily unsuitable suitors, weds her true love (Justin Ward), and 
(disguised as a male doctor of law) saves the day at the trial of Antonio (a 
somewhat distracted George Williams). 
</P>
<P>
 The tone takes an appropriately darker turn in the courtroom when the vengeful 
Jewish moneylender Shylock (Bob Langenbucher) sues to extract his lethal pound 
of Antonio's flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most current-day apologist productions, Director O'Shea seeks to mitigate 
the "Merchant's" inherent anti-Semitism. A deeply felt performance by 
Langenbucher articulates Shylock's resentment for the racist mockery he 
receives from the citizens of Venice, and his rage over the loss of his 
daughter to a Gentile husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Shakespeare accorded more humanity to Shylock than was 
customary in his time, the play's construction stops far short of anything like 
true tolerance. In Shakespearean comedy, the happy norm always reasserts itself 
for the deserving protagonists, of which Shylock is clearly not one. His 
ultimate defeat and disgrace -- forced to renounce his faith or forfeit his 
property -- is the same kind of unredeemed retribution reserved for the truly 
villainous, like Don John in "Much Ado about Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Shakespeare let the brutal prejudice of his Gentiles go 
unpunished, and clearly had no qualms about a society in which Jews had no 
place -- unless they were willing to convert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where Shakespeare brought a somber cast to comedy, "The Lion in Winter" 
punctuates human tragedy with piercing wit. James Goldman's play -- one of the 
best-written in modern times -- uses a fictionalized portrait of England's 
Henry II to evoke the universal conflicts in families. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Shea's courtyard set, with its generic arches and stairways, does double 
duty for Renaissance Venice and 1183 Chinon. 
</P>
<P>
 Enlivened by Goldman's thoroughly contemporary dialogue, Henry (Larry Cross) 
and his tightly leashed Queen, Eleanor of Aquitane (Judith Olauson), wage a 
battle of intrigue over the ultimate successor to the throne. 
</P>
<P>
 Lashing out at each other's weak spots without a trace of pity, these royal 
antagonists are direct forebears of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf's" George 
and Martha. 
</P>
<P>
 In the play's most accomplished performance, Olauson's Eleanor flits 
magnificently between venom and passion. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Henry, Cross proves nowhere near her match -- too much the amiable bon 
vivant, he shows little trace of the fierce warrior king that rose to dominate 
an Empire as great as Charlemagne's. Cross is a lion with very little roar -- 
more of a meow. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Director Kathy Biesinger still manages to wrest a compelling, 
tightly paced production that's ultimately more successful than "Merchant." 
</P>
<P>
 David Morgan is a stellar supporting presence as the sullen, unkempt Prince 
John, and Sacha Denison is fragile and sad as Princess Alais, the political and 
sexual pawn in Henry and Eleanor's cat-and-mouse games. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Merchant of Venice."

 Charles Brown, Tom Ball and Kenny Sultan, Flora Purim, The Acousticats, Cats 
and Jammers, Pele Juju, The Cache Valley Drifters and The Turtle Island String 
Quartet are among the more than two dozen acts scheduled for the Live Oak Music 
Festival, Friday through Sunday at Live Oak Camp. The campground is off Highway 
154 west of Santa Barbara, near Lake Cachuma. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people are expected to turn out for the mix of musical styles -- 
which will include various forms of blues, bluegrass, zydeco, jazz, Cajun, 
swing, ethnic, western and folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be musical workshops, a Friday night Barn Dance, the Hot Licks 
Cafe for after-hours entertainment, an arts and crafts marketplace, 
storytelling and children's musicians and activities. Breakfast (with musical 
accompaniment) will be served daily ($5 adults, $3.50 children under age 10). 
</P>
<P>
 Now the tricky part. Tickets are going swiftly. Many folks camp out for the 
three days, but no more camping spots are available. Single-day tickets still 
remain and may be available at the gate. Prices are $20 for Friday, $25 for 
Saturday or Sunday. Children under age 13 are free with an adult. To check on 
ticket availability and for schedule information, call 781-3030.

 Celebrate the Summer Solstice in uniquely festive -- and offbeat -- Santa 
Barbara style with the 20th anniversary Summer Solstice celebration Saturday 
morning to Saturday night. The theme of this year's extravaganza is "Hot." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual a collection of creative minds and talented hands have come together 
to create costumes for the parade, which will go up State Street from Cota 
Street to Micheltorena Street beginning at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will conclude at Alameda Park (at Micheltorena and Anacapa streets) 
where, not coincidentally, the Family Festival will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. 
Party-goers will get to view the elaborate parade costumes up close, and 
celebrate with local dancers, musicians and storytellers. 
</P>
<P>

 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, Steve Stein spray-painted the boarded up windows 
of his battered Sherman Oaks art gallery with the phrase, "The Glass is Half 
Full." Beginning Saturday he will share more of this positive approach when his 
"Picking up the Pieces" exhibit opens at the Steve Stein Gallery in Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein created the art from what was left of craft work that was broken in his 
studio during the quake. Among the titles of his pieces are "It's Not My Fault, 
It's Not My Fault" and "Chicken Soup, Great for the Shaking." A portion of sale 
proceeds will go to the American Red Cross Earthquake Emergency Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening receptions are set for Saturday from 5 to 9 p.m. and Sunday from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. The Gallery is at 1155 Coast Village Road. Call 565-2032 for 
more information.

 The beginnings of the Solidarity movement in Poland, the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall, the crumbling of Czechoslovakia's Communist government and other 
historic European events are depicted in the exhibit "Art As Activist: 
Revolutionary Posters From Central and Eastern Europe," opening Tuesday at UC 
Santa Barbara's University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 82 posters in this Smithsonian Institution show were taken 
directly from public places in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania and the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. They represent a form of 
expression from professional artists and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, on display through July 31, will open with a lecture called "Protest 
Posters: The Art of Opposition." It will begin at 6 p.m. at the museum's main 
gallery, and will be followed by a reception. The museum is open Tuesday 
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

MUSIC; FIDDLE VIRTUOSO BRINGS HER ACOUSTIC SOUND TO FESTIVAL; * LAURIE LEWIS & 
GRANT STREET WILL TAKE THE STAGE ON FATHER'S DAY AFTERNOON AT THE LIVE OAK 
EVENT IN SANTA BARBARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Live Oak Music Festival, a three-day epic featuring all sorts of eclectic 
acts, will offer those in attendance a chance to slurp and slug under the oaks 
up the road apiece from Santa Barbara. The site is approximately 10 miles north 
of Santa Barbara on Highway 154. There's no address, but that's why there are 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Acoustic music fans can thrill to the gigs by the Cache Valley Drifters, the 
Acousticats and Tom Ball & Kenny Sultan. Mellow blues fans can check out 
Charles Brown on Saturday, while those of the pointy-shoe persuasion will be 
aiming toward fiddle virtuoso Laurie Lewis & Grant Street when they take the 
stage on Father's Day afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is a famous fiddle player with over 20 years of experience, twice 
winning the California State Women's Championship. Jerry Logan is the new bass 
player of Grant Street as of last February, joining mandolin player Tom Rozum 
and guitarist Peter McLaughlin. The group's latest, "True Stories," came out on 
Rounder late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play roots-based original music that's acoustic," said the fiddler during 
a phone interview from her Berkeley home. "When I first started playing in the 
Bay Area in the early '70s, there were a lot of women in the bluegrass music 
scene, and a lot of old-time fiddle players. But right now, there don't seem to 
be many women doing what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is one of those in-betweeners whose music is difficult to pigeonhole. 
She received Female Vocalist of the Year award for 1992-93 from the 
International Bluegrass Music Assn. Her stuff gets played on Country Music 
Television because she's got that twang; but other times, the band plays 
relatively straight folk music; and there's some blues in there somewhere 
sometime too. In any case, it's all performed acoustically. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Lewis' country-flavored songs have recurring themes -- nature and the 
nature of things, which is often love gone bad. Happy-ever-after country love 
songs are about as common as Clint Black doing Beach Boys songs. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote the late Harry Nilsson, who definitely had it figured out, "If you 
never had an answer, you never had a question. And if you never had a question, 
you never had a problem. And if you never had a problem, everyone would be 
happy. And if everyone was happy, there wouldn't be any love songs." Not 
really, says the fiddle player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think country music has a lot more to say besides love stinks. The many 
messages of country music are what attracted me to it in the first place. It's 
very direct when it comes to speaking about problems, but in an entertaining 
way with visceral qualities. You can use that forum to spell out anything you 
want. I'm actually a fan of the early country music, stuff like Bill Monroe and 
Jimmy Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, one of the more memorable songs on "True Stories" is "You'll Be Leaving 
Me," a potential theme song if and when there's ever a Soap Opera Channel. 
Here's a sample line on this subtle serenade for sobbing suckers: 
</P>
<P>
 "When your heart breaks for the first time, you know it's not that hard to 
mend. But the healing goes more slowly every time it breaks again. Where once 
you gave love freely, now you're holding it inside. You say you're learning how 
to live, but you're just learning how to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides writing clever songs, Lewis has the voice to pull it off. Crystal 
clear and perfect, Lewis' voice has been compared to Alison Krauss, but there's 
really no one who can sing any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The songwriting process really varies for me. Sometimes, they just jump out 
whole and it's over. Other times, it takes years to get the words just right 
and keep rewriting a song. How long it takes has nothing to do with which ones 
are my favorites; it just varies. Between everyone in the band, we could 
probably play almost forever. We know a lot of songs between us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and the band are firmly entrenched in that endless bluegrass festival 
circuit, doing almost 200 dates per year, and they recently returned from 
Europe. Since they're usually doing festivals or workshops, the band rarely 
plays bars, so the drunks screaming for "Freebird" aren't really an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I'd like to have a bigger audience and I'd like to be able to pay 
the band more money. But our music isn't really that accessible; and people 
have to seek it out if they like it. Yet, I feel real lucky that I get to do 
what I do and make a living. I think if you really want to do something, then 
just do it. If you're doing something you don't want to do, then do something 
else. I do this because I have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Things are looking up for the band. For one, they're still alive after being 
involved in a bad car accident in March. They'd much rather be in Santa Barbara 
than opening for Elvis. Lewis suffered a fractured skull among other assorted 
dings. Rozum broke his hip, wrist and shoulder. The band canceled six weeks of 
gigs to recover, but everyone is playing again. 
</P>
<P>
 The band is booked through September at venues all over the country, according 
to its newsletter. Lewis will be easy to spot. She'll be the blond with the 
fiddle -- and without a Dodger hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little out of it this year, but we don't like the Dodgers up here." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Laurie Lewis and others at the Live Oak Music Festival. 
</P>

CENTERPIECE: NEW STONE AGE; ROCK CLIMBING IS HIP, BUT DO SOME MISS THE POINT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For four years, Cam Donnahoo painstakingly glued chips of alabaster and tiny 
bits of quartz onto a flood control wall at the end of Kalorama Street in 
Ventura. The 29-year-old environmental engineer and rock-climbing enthusiast 
spent evenings and weekends lugging 40-pound bags of rock chips, the trimmings 
from a sculptor's supply store, into the arroyo. This, along with a gallon can 
of Bondo auto body repair putty. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the putty to glue rock fragments onto the vertical concrete slab, and 
when he was finished, he had created an artificial climbing wall 40 feet long 
and 25 feet high. It became a second home for him and his wife, Kathy, until 
the couple moved to the Seattle area 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned in late April after pronouncing the Pacific Northwest 
unlivable, Donnahoo naturally went to visit his creation. To his surprise he 
found a waiting line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm proud that people are enjoying it and taking care of it 
reasonably well," he said. "But it's kind of weird. This place was like my 
living room." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Donnahoo, many who have been climbing rocks for more than 10 years are 
amazed at the popularity, even hipness, of the esoteric pursuit formerly 
carried on by oddballs who didn't like sports between the white lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock and Ice magazine says 4.4 million men, women and children climb. The 
American Alpine Club, the nation's oldest climbing organization, and one that 
has a strict and narrow definition of a climber -- someone who spends a minimum 
of 20 days a year climbing -- places the figure at a modest 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the number, rock climbing is a booming sport and one that owes at 
least some of its popularity to Ventura County residents, most notably 
Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, who is to climbing what Arnold Palmer is to 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Chouinard and a handful of other veteran climbers in the county represent the 
traditionalists. But it is the newer breed -- the "sport climber" -- that has 
flocked to the sport, while significantly changing its style. 
</P>
<P>
 While the traditional climber has spent years learning a combination of alpine 
skills (rock climbing among them) in order to ascend mountains, sport climbers 
concentrate on shorter, physically challenging climbs, usually less than 100 
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sport climbing is considerably safer owing to the way the rope is attached to 
the rock. Sport climbers use bolts that are laboriously drilled into the rock 
face. The bolts are permanent and extremely safe in preventing falls. 
Traditional climbers typically use removable pieces of hardware that, while 
more versatile, are not as secure and take a great deal of skill to place 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that sport climbing's shorter, safer routes have brought 
a lot of people into the sport," said Steven Tucker, co-author of a 
just-published guide on climbing in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said many new climbers were introduced to the sport through artificial 
walls like the Kalorama Wall or the indoor walls that the Ventura Athletic Club 
has installed at its Ventura and Camarillo sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoor walls are constructed of heavy plywood with bolt-on plastic holds. 
Unlike outdoor glue-up walls, which are usually vertical, plywood walls can be 
constructed with slopes ranging from moderately steep to overhanging, and the 
holds can be changed to create more variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had it since October and tons of people are using it," said Eric 
Bartels, manager of the Ventura club. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy accessibility of climbing walls and their comparative safety make 
them more attractive than traditional climbing on natural rock, where safe 
climbing often demands more practice and patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience is not something young sport climbers have in great supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "They develop about 10 times faster," said Reese Martin, unofficial spokesman 
for another glue-up wall under the bridge where the Ventura Freeway crosses the 
Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: Gabriel Lockwood of Santa Barbara. With less than two years of 
climbing experience, Lockwood recently completed a climb called "Maximum 
Ghetto" at Malibu Creek State Park that 10 years ago would have been considered 
unclimbable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a lot of people, I started in a climbing gym," Lockwood said. "I was 
hooked right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stillman, 21, of Ventura is another recent convert. Although not purely a 
sport climber -- he's never worn Lycra -- he's certainly of the sport-climbing 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 With just three years of experience, he can cruise up the slightly overhanging 
face of Mugu Rock in the time it takes to climb a stairway of equal height. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stillman gets to the top, he walks off the back side and climbs again and 
again in a demonstration that resembles both vertical ballet and a hamster in a 
Habitrail. 
</P>
<P>
 He paused between laps to describe his contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stillman, many sport climbers have tattoos (Grateful Dead album 
art is popular) and marijuana is the drug of choice. About 40% of young 
climbers use tobacco, Stillman estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dip snuff every once in a while, but cigarettes are my vice." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockwood said young climbers in his circle began smoking to mimic European 
climbing stars. Since sport climbs are a short, often anaerobic activity, 
climbers don't need superior cardiovascular fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a weird way, it shows how climbing is more mental than it is physical," 
said Mike Graham, 37, one of the premiere big-wall climbers of the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, owner of Gramicchi, a Ventura County sportswear manufacturer, was 
known for laying siege to rocks so high and so unrelentingly vertical that he 
had to sleep while anchored to the sheer cliff. He once completed a six-day 
solo climb of El Capitan, the granite monolith that dominates Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost 25 pounds. Most of it from shivering." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists like Graham criticize sport climbers, saying that, rather than 
seeking the combined mental, spiritual and physical alpine experience, sport 
climbers just go for the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran climber who just doesn't get it is Rick Ridgeway, a filmmaker 
and photographer who operates a photo stock agency in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway, 44, was part of the first American team to climb K2, the 
second-highest peak in the world, without supplementary oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 He has an open mind. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I climbed on a plastic wall," he said. "Once." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway recalled an assignment that he said sums up the difference between 
traditional climbing and sport climbing: 
</P>
<P>
 "Last September I was making a film on rock climbing for ESPN. I wanted to 
portray various aspects of the sport, so I put together a team with different 
backgrounds -- a mountaineer, two big-wall climbers and a fourth who was a 
young, up-and-coming sport climber. I spent a month with them, and I can say 
that there is a big difference in attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway explained what happened when the group approached its main objective, 
"The Shield" route on El Capitan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sport climber was apprehensive about whether she had the patience. We 
wanted to climb it without hammers. That meant placing the pitons by hand and 
gently putting the load on them, then removing them as we ascended. It was a 
real time commitment, six or seven days vertical." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway said during the first three nights they were bivouacked on the wall, 
there was a full moon over the valley. It's the sort of experience -- dangling 
1,000 feet above the valley floor in a sea of lunar light -- that answers the 
question why. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of who we are is developed by the amount of time we've spent in 
mountains," Ridgeway said. "I don't see that with hard-core sport climbers. 
This woman didn't have that sense of awe." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway said the woman abandoned the climb about a third of the way up and 
rappelled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "She approached the whole thing as an athletic event. If she wasn't getting 
three or four hours of pump a day, she was bored. It was like a shark that has 
to keep swimming to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham hears stories like that and says he simply can't relate to the way 
sport climbers dismiss the alpine experience and focus instead on higher and 
higher difficulty ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best climber in the world isn't the guy doing the biggest numbers," he 
said. "It's the guy having the most fun." Peak Experiences 1. Sespe Gorge 2. 
Foothill Crag 3. Camarillo Grove Park 4. Point Magu * The long-awaited second 
edition of "Climbing in Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo" is due out 
this month. Authors Steve Tucker and Kevin Steele spent four years reviewing 
new crags and new routes to update the 10-year-old first edition.  
</P>
<P>
 Steele, a climbing instructor at UC Santa Barbara, cautioned that anyone 
attempting rock climbing should first get adequate instruction, either in the 
form of a class or from a friend who is a skilled and patient teacher. Despite 
advances in safety equipment, climbing is a potentially dangerous sport that 
could result in serious injury or death. Don't mess around. 
</P>
<P>
 FOOTHILL CRAG 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, climbers drove up Foothill Road, turned off on a private gravel 
road and parked. Tucker said the owners don't want people driving up there 
anymore. The Pratt foot trail is now the proper access. It's about a 20-minute 
hike.  
</P>
<P>
 SESPE GORGE 
</P>
<P>
 The moderate difficulty and relatively long routes make this one of the best 
places in Southern California to learn multipitch climbing. A pitch is 150 feet 
or less, about the length of a standard mountaineering rope. 
</P>
<P>
 MUGU ROCK 
</P>
<P>
 A classic crack. Mugu Rock is slightly overhanging, but myriad hand and foot 
placements give this tiny boulder a near infinite variety of climbs. It has the 
easiest approach in California. Whereas climbers have long hikes to many crags, 
Mugu's location right on Pacific Coast Highway means you can belay from your 
car. Public location means a huge "Dig Me" factor. 
</P>
<P>
 CAMARILLO GROVE PARK 
</P>
<P>
 A block coughed up by a volcano, the rock lies just below the Conejo grade. 
The back side has huge pockets, the easier to walk up and top rope the bolts 
placed above the more challenging front face. Those susceptible to poison oak 
beware. The place is overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 INDOOR WALLS 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Athletic Club has indoor walls at both its Camarillo and Ventura 
locations. "We've had it since October and tons of people are using it," said 
Eric Bartels, manager of the Ventura club. "We get all ages, males, females. 
It's such a growing sport."

CLIMBERS DISPUTE SPORT'S REPUTATION FOR BEING DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Splatter is one of many glib neologisms climbers have for falling. A few 
others are grounder, crater, screamer, bounce, pop, peel, winger, whipper, or 
frappe and do the fish dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gravity is an ever-present hazard, there's some dispute about how 
dangerous rock climbing really is. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Safety Council ranks mountain sports as the third most dangerous 
recreational activity behind motorcycling and hang gliding. But Jed Williamson, 
editor of The American Alpine Club's annual report "Climbing Accidents in North 
America," contends that accidents among properly trained climbers are 
relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said despite the increase in participants, serious accidents have 
held steady at about 200 per year. Fatalities average about 28, many of them 
occurring not on rocks, but on high mountains like Alaska's McKinley where 
killer storms take their toll, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't come across a single fatality resulting from sport climbing and 
I've been compiling these statistics for 20 years," Williamson said.  
</P>
<P>
 He criticizes the National Safety Council's reporting criterion as misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a first-time hiker stumbles off a scenic overlook, that's counted as a 
mountain climbing accident," he said. "Well, if I'm driving by the Indianapolis 
Speedway in my family car, decide to hop on the track and get killed, should 
that count as an automobile racing accident?" 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario Williamson paints is just the sort of ill-conceived spontaneity 
that Casey Abbott, an occasional rock climber from Ventura, witnessed in March 
along California 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott had paused above the Rose Valley turnout to have a look at the 300-foot 
sandstone slab called the Sespe Wall, which he hoped to climb sometime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two guys getting ready to climb the wall. I noticed that they were 
in street clothes, wearing basketball shoes and they didn't have a rope," 
Abbott said. "It was getting pretty late in the afternoon to start a long climb 
like that, so right away I thought that these guys must be good or have done 
this before or something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two were brothers from Maricopa -- David Billingsly, 28 and 21-year-old 
Robert, who the family called Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair ignored two well-established routes and began climbing over an 
unused, lichen-covered rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The older brother, when he was about 30 feet up, asked me if he thought a 
fall from that distance could be fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott told him of course it could. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I realized that they weren't climbers and that they were probably 
going to get into serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bobbie Billingsly had climbed far above his older brother, 
advancing more than 200 vertical feet in 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "His athleticism was unbelievable," Abbott said. "I thought he was possessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott described what happened when Billingsly found a hold that was 18 inches 
out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He jumped. He was more than 100 feet up and he just jumped up and grabbed it. 
I'm telling you my heart stopped. I turned to my girlfriend and, I wish I 
hadn't said this, but I said to her, 'I think we're going to see somebody die 
today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They did. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 50 feet from the top, Billingsly veered onto a part of the rock 
where the holds are thin. Abbott said he appeared to be retreating when part of 
the rock he was holding broke. The fall lasted five seconds -- long enough, 
according to deputies, for Billingsly to shout, "Look out. I'm coming down." 
</P>
<P>
 He landed on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 That left David Billingsly paralyzed in fear 130 feet directly above his 
brother's body. Abbott said although he tried to rescue the older brother, 
David Billingsly spent well over an hour clinging to rock before being assisted 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Search and rescue volunteer Mike Jauregui, a 52-year-old optometrist from 
Ojai, climbed above Billingsly on one of the clearly discernible routes that 
the brothers had earlier ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Jauregui set an anchor, then lowered a rope to the shivering man, who had 
inexplicably taken off his shirt and one shoe and thrown them down the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Climbing rescues are a seasonal thing, Jauregui said. "Most of them are people 
who are drinking and doing the macho thing. They start climbing rocks, get 40 
feet up, take one look down and freeze." These are the sort of incidents that 
give climbing the undeserved reputation as a dangerous sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest irony, he said, is that sport climbing is safe precisely because 
climbers fall so often. Since the goal is to climb at the limit of their 
ability, they always take the proper precautions to prepare for a slip-up, by 
using bolts and ropes to catch themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott is not persuaded. He said it took him days to get over witnessing 
Billingsly's fall and he doubts he will return to climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know those skills might be helpful in rescue situations so I'm not going to 
abandon them, but as far as doing it for fun, no, not any more." PANCHO DOLL

REEL LIFE FILM & VIDEO FILE; CREATURES OF COMFORT TAKE TO DRIVE-INS; * THE 
ONE-O-ONE ATTRACTS PARENTS WITH SLEEPY KIDS, SENIORS WHO CRANK UP THE SOUND AND 
THOSE WHO LIKE TO SMOKE AND TALK. 
</P>

 On one night last weekend, pajama-clad kids stacked in pickup trucks and 
minivans watched intently as the Flintstones careened into the Bedrock Drive-In 
for a flick. It was all oddly self-referential since the folks in the pickups 
and vans were watching "the modern Stone Age family" at the One-O-One, a 
drive-in theater in Ventura. Like some fossil fish discovered swimming off the 
coast of Madagascar, drive-ins are, much to everyone's surprise, still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have rediscovered them," said Milt Moritz, vice president of Pacific 
Theaters -- which, with 65 locations, including the One-O-One, is the largest 
operator of drive-ins in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to smoke, you can smoke," Moritz said. "If you want to talk, you 
can talk. Senior citizens like the privacy of their cars -- they can turn up 
the sound. If the kids cry or fall asleep, the parents can still see the film." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ruben Alvarez, a 43-year-old moviegoer from Ventura, points out, the 
drive-in is the only place where you control the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have your own area -- and nobody else can get into it. No people talking 
behind you. No territorial elbows with the guy in the next seat. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't say drive-ins are booming -- the last one built in Los Angeles or 
Ventura County was 15 years ago -- but the decline may have stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The drive-in era peaked in 1958, when 4,063 drive-ins dispensed entertainment 
across the country. Today there are only 870, according to the National Assn. 
of Theatre Owners, based in North Hollywood. The One-O-One was built in 1974 
and expanded to three screens in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Home videos, the proliferation of multiscreen walk-in theaters and escalation 
of land values made operating a drive-in less profitable than using the land 
for commercial development. Even daylight savings time, which was standardized 
in the late 1960s, contributed to the decline by pushing dusk back by an hour 
in the summertime. 
</P>
<P>
 But while multiplex cinemas subdivide at the rate of an overheated paramecium 
-- with screens reaching smaller dimensions even as ticket prices creep toward 
double digits -- drive-ins are becoming attractive again. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults get in for about $5 apiece at the One-O-One Drive-In. And that's for 
two movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Freeman, 18, on a date with his girlfriend, offered one more advantage 
of drive-ins: 
</P>
<P>
 "Your feet don't stick to the floor."

EARTHWATCH: A MIRACLE OF NATURE A SHORT VOYAGE AWAY; * SEA LIONS AND ELEPHANT 
SEALS, ONCE HUNTED TO BRINK OF EXTINCTION, NOW THRIVE ON SAN MIGUEL ISLAND 
BREEDING GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you willing to trek 17 miles round trip over a desert island just to see a 
miracle of nature? Here's an incentive: There's a huge cast of pinnipeds 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they're not L. Frank Baum creations, but sea lions and elephant seals -- 
about 50,000 of them, the largest aggregation anywhere in the world. And they 
were rescued from near extinction, it turns out, right off our local shores, 
during our lifetime. Had I tried to find them during my Boy Scout days, there 
would only have been a few hundred alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Though you can nearly see the island domain of these large dramatic beasts 
from the Ventura Pier, you can't go watch them "haul out and pup," as the 
experts term it, unless you make arrangements with rangers from the U.S. 
Department of the Interior's Channel Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a carefully supervised visit to San Miguel Island, which intrepid 
nature fans can arrange, Carol J. Spears, spokesperson for the Park Service 
told me: "We want people to land and walk the 17 miles." 
</P>
<P>
 This involves a $65 boat trip, which has to be booked through Island Packers, 
and takes a full day. You cannot do this with your own boat, by the way, 
because cruising near the island shore where the animals mate is against 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 But what you'll see, if you make the proper arrangements, is unique in the 
world, according to Dr. Robert L. DeLong of the National Marine Mammal 
Laboratory, a unit of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked in the Channel Islands for all of my career," he said. But it 
wasn't until protective legislation was passed, first in the '40s and later 
during the Nixon Administration, DeLong said, that he finally saw an end to the 
indiscriminate killing of these creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, one of the unique reversals of mankind's depredations against a 
fellow animal, could be ranked with the return of the peregrine falcon in our 
part of the world -- achieved by banning DDT -- and the restoration of the 
sea-run trout off the Japanese coast, achieved by voluntary limits on fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the local sea lion, sometimes called "the elephant of the 
deep," this was accomplished, for the most part, when we humans simply stopped 
attacking them during their annual mass breeding and birthing seasons. Besides 
San Miguel Island, the only other site of such activity -- on a smaller scale 
-- is on a beach in South Africa. Folks used to come to the Channel Islands 
breeding grounds to hunt the elephant seal herds and their cousins -- the 
harbor seal, the fur seal, the Stellar sea lion and the California sea lion -- 
for sport and pelts. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern folks, fortunately, just want to watch in amazement as the largest of 
these creatures, big as Hondas and pretty as Jabba the Hutt, ponderously act 
out their annual drama. "Half of the 15,000 elephant seals born annually on San 
Miguel Island are pupped prior to this week (beginning June 12) and half 
afterwards," DeLong said. "But in the 1930s, only a thousand were born 
annually." 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason human activity near the pinnipeds is closely monitored during 
this time of year is that we can, just by coming too close, panic the sea 
mammals in their multitudes and cause pups to be suffocated or abandoned in a 
stampede. The rangers involved in the public's visit to the San Miguel Island 
watch humans very closely while the humans view the pinnipeds through 
telescopes, which are provided. 
</P>
<P>
 My own interest in this phenomenon of man nurturing, rather than exploiting, a 
fellow creature, was sparked by Dr. David Suzuki. During a speech I attended, 
the famous Canadian biologist was worrying aloud about the widespread 
destruction of species -- an issue he details frequently in his PBS TV series, 
"The Nature Of Things." Then he cheered up and cited the few exceptions. Ours 
was at the top of his list. 
</P>

birthing area on San Miguel Island this month, call Channel Islands National 
Park, 658-5730.

JAUNTS; JUST RIPE FOR PICKIN'; * FAMILIES FIND IT'S FUN TO GATHER PRODUCE 
RANGING FROM BLACKBERRIES TO BLACK-EYED PEAS AT MOORPARK FARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If the farmers' market or the produce stand still isn't fresh enough for you, 
there is still one option left: Pick it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what you do at Tierra Rejada Family Farms in Moorpark. You 
wander the tidy rows of fruits and vegetables spread out over 50 acres and pull 
off what you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the best pickings are blackberries, cucumber, zucchini, beans and 
strawberries, which are a new crop for the farm. Later summer offerings include 
apricots, lima beans, tomatoes, black-eyed peas and onions. There will be 
pumpkins in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm draws hundreds of people to the rural setting on weekends and they 
get a kick out of hand-picking what they will put on the dinner table that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick-your-own crowd has changed over the years, according to owner Rick 
Brecunier. Years ago, the do-it-yourself pickers were the no-nonsense people 
who canned their own fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's more recreational," he said. "Grandparents bring their grandchildren 
out. It's a nice environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Taschereau of Westlake Village was among a dozen or so pickers at the 
farm on a recent weekday. Her shoes were wet and muddy, but she didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here all the time," she said, after picking a basket of blackberries, and 
bags of green beans and baby squash. "Where else can you find things this 
fresh?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy cooking and when things are ripe here, I'm in heaven," she said. The 
price is right too. "I can feed six people at a dinner party with this," she 
said, holding up $1.65 worth of baby squash. 
</P>
<P>
 As for price, the strawberries were selling for 69 cents a pound, peaches and 
squash 55 cents a pound, green beans 75 cents a pound, and olalliberries -- a 
cross between a youngberry and a loganberry -- $1.50 a pound. (By comparison, a 
pint of strawberries at just under a pound was running about $1 at the 
supermarket.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brecunier said people are bowled over by the taste of freshly picked produce. 
"It knocks your socks off." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when people are picking they find it irresistible to sample the 
stuff. "That's expected -- as long as they don't sit down and make a meal of 
it," said Craig Underwood, owner of Underwood Farm Market in Somis. Underwood 
and his partner, James Barker, recently teamed with Brecunier to help operate 
the Moorpark farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The new one-acre patch of strawberries has been a hit this spring, and they 
plan to increase the crop next year. The berries are big, juicy, and the 
picking is fairly easy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the weekends, the busiest times, there might be 40 to 50 people picking 
strawberries at any one time. Throughout the ranch there might be 80 to 100 
pickers at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much you'll need to know before you head for the field. The 
produce stand at the entrance to the farm supplies bags and baskets, and little 
wagons for transporting produce back to the stand to be weighed. The crops are 
labeled, and to get to some, like the blackberries, you'll need to walk a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pickers are expected to work down a row and not hop from one row to the other, 
or trample the plants. Barker said they will guide people to the best picking 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they generally take no heed and dive in at the beginning of a row," 
Barker said. "A lot of them pick more than they intended to." 
</P>
<P>
 Many are repeat customers. In fact, a number of Italian families -- one from 
as far away as Las Vegas -- come back year after year to pick hundreds of 
pounds of tomatoes to can their own tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm grows 20 varieties of tomatoes, six kinds of cucumber, and four 
different green beans. The farmers are open to requests from customers for 
specialty crops, such as the mega-hot habanero pepper they grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not organic," Underwood said. "But we practice safe farming methods. We 
spray minimally -- only when we need to prevent crop loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Brecunier's father-in-law, Monroe Everett, bought the farm in 1935. Brecunier 
joined the operation in 1970 after he married his wife, Linnea. His first 
pick-your-own crop was pumpkins, and the farm now operates a popular pumpkin 
patch, as well as a cut-your-own Christmas tree lot.  
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren visit the farm and pick fruit and vegetables. By joining forces 
with Underwood Farms, Brecunier hopes to provide even more of a hands-on view 
of farming to the public.

FOR THE KIDS; DIVING INTO SUMMER READING; * LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY 
OFFER PROGRAMS AND PRIZES TO INSPIRE CHILDREN OF ALL AGES. SIGN-UPS ARE ALREADY 
UNDER WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 School is out. Kids have the long, hot summer ahead of them and lots of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to read. 
</P>
<P>
 If that prospect brings a ho-hum response from your kid, here's a way to make 
reading fun -- even cool. Libraries throughout the county offer summer reading 
programs that entice kids into reading by turning it into something of a game, 
with little prizes and stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 They've done it for years, using a different theme each summer. This year is 
not much different, despite severe budget cuts and the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
which heavily damaged one library. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county-run network of 15 libraries, it's pirates and buried treasure 
this summer. Kids will find Captain Elias K. Bookaneer and his "odoriferous 
crew" up to no good. 
</P>
<P>
 At these libraries kids of any age, even adults, can sign up for "Dare the 
Depths With Captain Bookaneer." They'll get a folder with the crafty pirate 
captain on the front, holding up a "contract" to serve aboard the vessel H.M.S. 
Readaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the folder is an underwater map with sea creatures and a buried 
treasure. For every five books they read, they'll get a gold sticker for their 
map and find their way to the treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 If they read 15 books over the summer, they'll get a T-shirt transfer. Those 
who reach 25 books will get a gold doubloon sticker with a ribbon for the front 
of their folders. 
</P>
<P>
 Preschoolers can be part of the program by having stories read to them. For 
the older kids reading chapter books, 50 pages equals a book. Treasure chests 
will be hidden at each of the libraries, and at the end of the summer those 
kids in the program will participate in a drawing for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer the libraries will also have special story times, music, 
crafts and programs, such as a visit from a Channel Islands National Park 
ranger who might talk about pinnipeds and tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer 6,000 kids joined in the reading program, according to Julie 
Albright of the county library's children's services division. That was down 
from the usual 8,000 or so because the county libraries cut their hours 
drastically last summer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program started this week, but kids can sign up any time over the summer. 
It ends Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard and Thousand Oaks libraries are not part of the county library 
system, but they are offering similar summer reading programs for kids called 
"Dive Into a Good Book," which also has a treasure-chest theme. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Thousand Oaks Library, which was hit hard by the quake, the program 
runs from Monday to Aug. 14. Kids of all ages can sign up and get a folder at 
the library or at its branch in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The books they have read are recorded on the back of the folder. Then, each 
week as they add books, they receive a prize and sticker to add to their 
folder. They also get a book bag to haul books and other treasures handed out 
during the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks kids can also attend special story programs at the two libraries 
during the summer. At the main library, story time for kids ages 3 to 5 is on 
Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m. beginning June 28, and for kids 6 to 10 
it's Thursdays at 1:30 p.m. beginning June 30. At the Newbury Park branch, 
story time for kids 3 to 5 is on Wednesdays at 1:30 p.m. beginning June 29, and 
for ages 6 to 10 it's Thursdays at 10:30 a.m. beginning June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer the Oxnard Public Library is changing from a summer reading 
program to a year-round program, broken into four sessions. The four-week 
summer quarter starts June 28. Kids keep track of the books they read on their 
treasure chest folder, and when they get it stamped each week by a librarian, 
they get a small prize. Also, each time they visit the library they fill out a 
form that will be entered in a drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard library has summer programs as well -- everything from a magic show 
to a visit from a volunteer at the Maritime Museum in Oxnard. The programs at 
the main library and the two branches are all at 3:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, 
beginning June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Paula Public Library this summer, dinosaurs are on the run. "Be a 
Readerosaurus" is the theme of the program there. Kids of all ages get a 
dinosaur folder in which they write down each book they read, and with each 
visit to the library they get stickers for their folder, bookmarks, buttons, 
bags or pencils. 
</P>
<P>
 The program kicks off Wednesday when the Alphabet Soup Puppeteers perform at 
the library at 2 p.m. It runs until the end of August. Throughout the summer, 
the library will have a special program for kids each Wednesday at 2 p.m. It 
might be face painting and puppeteers. Then, on July 5, Ronald McDonald makes a 
special visit to the library at 3 p.m. 
</P>

FASHION; THE PAST WEARS WELL; INTAGE STORES SPECIALIZE IN CLOTHES THAT, FOR

 At Flaun's Vintage Clothing in downtown Ventura, not much is new. Customers 
drift in -- some curious and hesitant, others keen on a goal. These last head 
for the close-packed racks and shelves holding relics from a hundred lives, and 
wade in. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Gilliard, who has spent her life gathering seasoned treasures, watches 
from a backdrop of extraordinary hats and magical garments of tulle, gabardine, 
batiste, satin and fur. 
</P>
<P>
 She can tell shoppers which shoes match the era of a gown they choose, the age 
of anything in the shop within five years -- and, should they have time, 
stories of many of the garments' original owners. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who don't understand vintage. Its quaint sentiment, its 
irresistible pull is lost on them. "These things are all used?" they say 
delicately from the doorway, and getting a ready affirmation, they duck out.  
</P>
<P>
 Vintage people are different. They have a fascination for the past, usually a 
particular decade, often the one that preceded their birth, Gilliard says. Once 
they find the look they like, they keep coming back to add to their wardrobe, 
drawn like lovers to a tryst. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who wear vintage don't ever think, 'I can't wear this here'; they just 
wear it wherever they go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the nostalgia trend in general, vintage is growing, said John Maxwell, 
editor of "Vintage!", the newsletter of Federation of Vintage Fashions 
published in Alamo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be two to three shows a quarter across the country; now we are 
having 15," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest, which picked up about seven or eight years ago, is still building, 
he said, and, "California is hands down the state with our greatest number of 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all people who buy period clothes have a time-warp mind-set. Some buy just 
a couple of pieces to mix with contemporary styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go more for the '20s and '30s stuff because it looks more like what 
they're doing today -- the sack things," said Barbara Bernstein of Rodeo Drive 
Resale in Thousand Oaks, "But they want to get it for less." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are the very occasional people, who may want to dress for a 
retro party, or just break their usual pattern on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
 At Flaun's, a young woman who appeared to be about 25 emerged from the 
dressing room in a gray lace cocktail dress about five years older than 
herself, and asked Gilliard's opinion on the fit. She was shopping for a 
wedding gown, and wanted something -- well, different. Told it was just right, 
she began a concentrated search for hat and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people still go mostly for '60s clothes; while those over 25 are 
starting to lean toward the '40s, Gilliard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most popular look for men is what I call the Ricky Ricardo look -- the 
long (suit) jackets with the rounded pocket, and the Eisenhower jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 The waist-length Eisenhower jackets are especially craved -- so much so, that 
a checked version with a yoke can bring up to $300 in Los Angeles, Gilliard 
said. Men's wear is more expensive than women's because there is less of it 
around. A man tends to wear his clothes, as she put it, "until they rot off his 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Large sizes also cost more, because of their rarity. People have grown 
considerably larger in the last generation, and bigger sizes in trendy items, 
such as gabardine shirts and saddle shoes, get snapped up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hot items are old Hawaiian shirts -- the sort with the "buttery" rayon 
that is no longer made -- anything Western, especially shirts with piping, the 
ever-popular poodle skirt, rayon dresses from the '40s, and Lucite purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never really makes any sense what becomes hot or why it becomes hot," 
Gilliard said. "If you were to tell people those purses are ugly, they would 
get real defensive about it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the purses, looking much like a see-through lunch box, rested on a back 
counter, marked $120. It would cost $200 in L.A., the shop owner insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, this stuff is more than a business. She began collecting used clothes 
from Ventura's thrift stores at age 12, and never really stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably have at least 5,000 pieces of clothing," she said, "This is about 
one-tenth of it. The fun part is finding it." 
</P>
<P>
 She finds it satisfying to fill customers' wishes. Not long ago, an older 
woman became excited over the shop's small hoard of satin bed jackets such as 
Gilliard herself used to wear years ago, knotted above blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me, 'I have been to every department store in the tri-counties to 
find some!' -- They virtually don't make bed jackets any more." 
</P>
<P>
 There was just a touch of awe in the voice. *

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MEXICAN CHAIN DELIVERS ON SIMPLE DISHES; * FRAGRANT SOUPS 
AND PUNGENT SHRIMP ARE AMONG LOW-PRICED TOP OFFERINGS AT SANTA PAULA'S EL 
PESCADOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chain restaurants, as happily American as the postwar automobile industry, 
bring the best and worst to dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Highbrow protests notwithstanding, it's a plain comfort to be able to enjoy a 
good Caesar salad or steak from a reliable purveyor at multiple locations. But 
it's also a shot from hell to be on the road and discover the only game in town 
is the place you avoid back home. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems, apparently for reasons of quality control, that the best of the 
chains run small in size and are only regional in presence. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pescador is situated on Santa Paula's west end, just north of the Santa 
Paula Freeway in a 1950-ish white and turquoise building with wraparound 
picture windows. One of a small group of El Pescador restaurants that run only 
throughout Southern California, the Santa Paula outlet projects a local as well 
as a chain feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lie its rewards and punishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The place turns a brisk business midweek from locals who show up for the 
remarkably low-priced and high-quality specials: Monday's cocido de res, or 
beef soup, ($3.95); or Tuesday's caldo de pollo, or chicken soup, ($3.95). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each arrives in a huge dinner-size bowl and is made special by deeply 
flavorsome, fragrant broths laden with fresh vegetables as well generous cuts 
of main-attraction ingredients. A shot of Mexican piquant sauce and squeeze of 
fresh lemon bring these vivid soups well above the commonplace and, coupled 
with warm flour tortillas, makes one of the best, nutritionally smart, cheap 
meals around. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Pescador reveals its bleak chain roots in the more ambitious offerings 
from its huge laminate menu: grilled whole red snapper and steamed fish of wide 
variety in a foil pouch. Sadly, the returns at this end of the culinary 
spectrum carry major disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The mojarra al mojo de ajo (red snapper marinated in garlic sauce, $8.75) is 
gray, dried out, flavorless, tough from apparent freezing, overcooked, 
inedible. Empapelado de mariscos (El Pescador's signature dish, $11) combines 
abalone, octopus, shrimp and fish fillet with vegetables and creamed mushrooms 
for steaming in foil. Alas, the butter-heavy sauce and undissolved mushroom 
goop overwhelm everything; though properly cooked, key ingredients have lost 
their distinct flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Best among the entrees are the simpler, more everyday choices. Filete Veracruz 
($7.95), in which a sparklingly fresh, thick and tender chunk of pollack -- a 
type of cod -- arrived in the classic vegetable/citrus sauce, was just right. 
And camarones al mojo de ajo ($7.95) may well be the entree of choice: fresh 
large shrimp coated in a pungent, salty garlic sauce and hot-seared, encrusting 
the outside while keeping things sweet and succulent within. 
</P>
<P>
 All dishes are served with a small soup, rice, tortillas, chopped lettuce and 
tomato and, inexplicably in some instances, potato salad -- over-salted at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to complain about a place as modest and as big-hearted as El 
Pescador. It's a clean, well-run shop that simply misses on the big plays. So 
keep it simple, order a middle-of-the road entree or do the Mexican thing and 
show up for a giant caldo with an appetizer on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Best among such appetizers is compechana , in which perfectly fresh and 
lightly cooked chunks of octopus join large shrimp in a fragrant tomato sauce 
($4.95 for small, which is actually quite large). Again, a shot of hot sauce 
and dash of lemon lend a defining edge to the flavors. Mixed seafood salad 
($4.50), incorporating shrimp, octopus and abalone with onion, tomato and 
cilantro, bursts with flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the weeknight soup specials is Thursday's caldo de albondigas , or 
meatball soup, ($3.95), and it is deeply satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pescador keeps a small list of inexpensive wines. But its beer selection is 
truly well-conceived, heavy on Mexico's heavier dark and amber brews such as 
Modello Negra and Bohemia -- just the right tonics for simple hearty eating. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: El Pescador. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 322 S. Peck Road, Santa Paula, 525-8846. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Open seven days from 7 a.m. for breakfast, with lunch served Monday 
through Friday only from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner seating stops at 9 p.m. 
Sunday through Thursday, at 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Major credit cards. Dinner for two, food only: $10-$30.

 It didn't take long for Reece Keck to find a new home for her cuisine. 
Beginning tomorrow evening the former dinner chef at City Bakery Cafe will be 
serving up her specialties Friday and Saturday nights at the Ash Street Coffee 
House in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients who enjoyed Keck's work during her four-plus months at City Bakery 
might be happy to know that she will prepare pretty much the same fare at Ash 
Street. And, as before, most of the menu will change weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought things went pretty well (at City Bakery) and I want to keep the 
momentum going," said Keck. "I'll continue with the Grilled Bread Salad -- that 
was the only thing that was on the menu regularly. I'll have a poultry dish, a 
pasta, a pizza, something vegetarian, and a fresh fish." Don't be surprised to 
find a meat special also. The Ash Street Coffee House is at 12 N. Ash St. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Look for The Greek Restaurant, formerly of Oxnard, to open its new Ventura 
Harbor location sometime this weekend. At least that's what the owners are 
shooting for. And there's been a slight -- though quite appropriate -- name 
change. The Greek Restaurant is now The Greek at the Harbor. It's located at 
1583 Spinnaker Drive, Suite 101.

 How does a salmon filet baked with fresh garlic and dill, finished with 
sun-dried tomato and dill hollandaise sauce with roasted pine nuts sound? How 
about a caponata served with fresh onion, flat bread toast and fresh grated 
Parmesan cheese? 
</P>
<P>
 Those were a couple of the items on the menu last week when Nona's Courtyard 
Cafe in Ventura began serving dinners Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. "It 
will be a fairly eclectic type menu, changing every week," said Jonathan 
Enabnit, creator of Nona's. "We'll have four different appetizers and at least 
six different entrees -- a fresh fish, pasta, veal, chicken, risotto, and fresh 
meats." 
</P>
<P>
 These new dishes will be prepared by Chef Annie Harfield, most recently the 
executive chef at Coco's Place in Ventura. Nona's is at 67 California St.

 It was about three months ago that Gail and Don Hobbs put out a final call for 
recipes for their self-published "Cookin' in Ventura" cookbook. Well, they got 
them -- 54 recipes from 33 restaurants spread around Oxnard, Ventura and Ojai. 
The book went to the printer last week.

 RAND's focus -- An editorial Saturday unintentionally gave the impression that 
the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. had, until recently, been engaged largely in 
national security work. In fact, RAND has been doing significant research and 
analysis on domestic policy issues for decades.
