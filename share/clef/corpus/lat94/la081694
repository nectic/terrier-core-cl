O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; MUCH OF 'BEAT SUMMER JAM' WILTS IN THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At various junctures on Sunday during the "92.3 The Beat Summer Jam," a 
capacity house at Irvine Meadows was informed by hypesters from sponsoring 
radio station KKBT-FM that it was witnessing "the hottest," "the phattest" and 
"the baddest" concert "of all time." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken literally, most of that hype was all too believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The oppressive heat of the day baked the life out of everybody for nine of the 
rap/funk/R&B extravaganza's nearly 13 hours, leaving the audience virtually 
inert to some of the day's better performances. During the draining daylight 
hours, more people stood in line for lemonade than stood up to dance to such 
worthy acts as War and Tony Toni Tone. 
</P>
<P>
 As for being phat, which in hip-hop parlance means being both splendid and 
substantial, this bill was merely fat. Not even the most gluttonous music fan 
wants to see 24 acts in one day -- especially when many of them are rap 
newcomers who may have scored radio hits but utterly lack the live performing 
experience to go over on a major stage. 
</P>
<P>
 And R&B singers who croon to recorded tracks -- a staple of Sunday's diet -- 
should be told to head back to the dance clubs until they find the wherewithal 
for a proper show with actual musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, if such track-reliant acts as Zhane, Shanice, Jamie Foxx and the 
Guy alumni association (a solo Aaron Hall and the new group BLACKstreet led by 
Teddy Riley) want to appear, why not recruit a house band of sharp session pros 
who can play their music note for note in real time? Isn't that how 
barnstorming stars used to operate on the legendary Chitlin' Circuit of R&B's 
formative days? It would have added an element of discovery and surprise to a 
bill with no impromptu collaborations between acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summer Jam" was for charity, with proceeds from the donated performances 
going primarily to Los Angeles area organizations that fight drug abuse or try 
to provide alternatives to youth gangs (no figures were announced). An argument 
can be made for including lots of acts who want to a) help, b) stay on the good 
side of a powerful radio station or c) both of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, pared down to the 12 or 15 best acts, playing over eight or nine hours, 
"Summer Jam" might have been more jammin' than exhaustin'.  
</P>
<P>
 Was it really the baddest -- as in worst -- show "of all time?" If you take 
away the climate conditions, not really. Nobody was brilliant, but good moments 
came courtesy of the Isley Brothers, War, Tevin Campbell and Zapp on the R&B 
side, and Heavy D, Public Enemy and Coolio among the rappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Eazy-E was as bad as bad can be, though -- according to Webster's 
definition, not Michael Jackson's. The usual gripe about gangsta rappers like 
Eazy-E, the Compton-based co-founder of N.W.A., is that they glorify violence 
and have brutish attitudes toward women. For the moment, we'll leave those out 
of the bill of indictment against Eazy-E. He stunk because he was as inept as a 
headliner on a major festival bill can be. 
</P>
<P>
 After not one, not two, but three dull introductory sequences, the star 
finally arrived and made things even duller by taking his interminable 
half-hour set at a stroll. Sometimes he strolled right off the stage, at one 
point leaving it to five white-shirted associates who came on and murmured what 
seemed to be the first gangsta rap version of a Gregorian chant. 
</P>
<P>
 One moment made it almost worthwhile: When the less-than-enticing Eazy-E's 
main sidekick commanded the women in the house to repeat the words, "I want to 
f--- you, Eazy," the silence spoke volumes. So did the parade of people who 
immediately headed for the exits, joining an exodus already well in progress. 
The place was nearly full when Eazy-E's set began; it was virtually empty when 
he finished. He concluded with his hit "Real (expletive) G's," a song blasting 
rival rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. Being there to watch Eazy-E bomb 
would have been their best revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of Public Enemy's new album "Muse Sick N Hour Mess Age" have 
suggested that the much praised band may be over the hill. Rappers Chuck D and 
Flavor Flav seemed bent on establishing that they still have their youthful 
vigor. They scampered through an almost frolicsome set that was high on energy, 
if low on the politicized agitation that made Public Enemy famous. 
</P>
<P>
 A succession of truncated versions of such oldies as "Fight the Power," "911 
Is a Joke" and "Shut 'Em Down" lacked thematic bite as the duo emphasized 
good-time performance. At one point, they seemed like a couple of kids playing 
touch football, Chuck feinting back and forth like a pass receiver while Flav 
tried to shadow him. The new single "Give It Back" was most noteworthy for its 
old-fashioned Southern soul groove. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer Coolio gave the day's best rap performance -- and benefited from 
being the first act to play after sundown for a crowd that seemed refreshed at 
last and eager for danceable beats. He and his large crew bounded about, 
verging on chaos but keeping the flow of the raps going. 
</P>
<P>
 Coolio offered substance along with energy on "County Line," about the 
indignities of life on welfare, and "I Remember," which began as an idyllic 
account of a safe and innocent early childhood, only to give way to a tale of 
family turmoil and a move to Los Angeles, "the land of the insane." He and his 
ensemble finished with a sharp version of his hit "Fantastic Voyage," with its 
daydreaming escape from insane realities. In all, a good blend of entertainment 
and humor with pointed commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the R&B bands, Tony Toni Tone, the promising young group from Oakland, 
suffered the worst from the heat. The Tonys started well with a funk-rock churn 
reminiscent of Sly & the Family Stone. They even including a snippet of "Dance 
to the Music." But nobody in the heat-prostrated crowd was dancing. Without 
encouragement, the band wilted over the rest of its 24-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 Older and steadier, War was able to withstand the day's heat and the crowd's 
torpor and turned in a solid set of Latinized funk. Three long groove numbers 
made up the 25-minute set: the classic "Low Rider" and two songs from the 
band's comeback album, "Peace Sign." Co-founder Howard Scott shrugged off the 
lack of audience reaction: "I know the sun's got a lot to do with it. At 8 
o'clock, we'd be rockin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with an after-dark starting time, Tevin Campbell, the teen-age protege 
of Quincy Jones and Prince, seemed headed for a good performance after 
delivering two songs, including his sleek but emotive hit "Always in My Heart." 
But two songs was all Campbell and his 10 member ensemble performed. Why go to 
the bother of drilling backing singers, dancers and players if you're only 
going to play 12 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
 Zapp, also playing at night, won the crowd with its familiar combination of 
clowning, catchiness and assured musicianship. Leader Roger Troutman and his 
band play pretty much the same set every time they pass through (this one being 
a truncated, 26-minute version), but one doesn't build up an immunity to their 
infectious sense of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 With War representing '70s funk and Zapp an '80s carry-over of traditional 
funk, the show's third historic band was the Isley Brothers, who debuted in 
1959. Singer Ronald Isley was in fine voice, sliding effortlessly to high note 
passages of the 35-minute set's highlight, a cover of Seals & Crofts' "Summer 
Breeze." Ronald's creamy voice contrasted with Ernie Isley's fast, edgy guitar 
lead to paint an evocative picture that was less about summer itself than a 
haunting memory of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald's wife, Angela Winbush, took over lead vocals toward the end of the 
set. For a band with limited time and a rich trove of songs, that was a 
mistake. It would have been better to play the classics for a young crowd than 
to serve up showy set pieces for Winbush, excellent as her voice is. 
</P>
<P>
 Some acts took a cheap "sex sells" approach. Laid-back rapper Domino wouldn't 
have had much of an act without the visual possibilities afforded by the 
compliant young ladies in hot pants who accompanied him. Hall, the former Guy 
singer, mimed various sex acts, bared his chest and paraded through the aisles 
so women could get a touch while he sang forgettable romantic schlock. 
</P>
<P>
 BLACKstreet offered more generic romantic schlock, and leader Riley 
distinguished himself by using a slur against homosexuals to dismiss males in 
the house who wouldn't make noise on demand. The day's themes were "Unity 
Through Music" and "No Color Lines." Maybe Riley should consider the lines he 
draws to protect his own prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 During Hall's set, a helicopter buzzed the amphitheater, making several passes 
at a height of no more than 100 feet above the crowd to drop leaflets 
condemning KKBT's management as racist. The anonymous tirade was itself fraught 
with bigotry toward Asians, whites and homosexuals. Station personnel swarmed 
the stage at the next break and dismissed the accusations as the work of a 
"disgruntled employee." They announced that federal aviation authorities had 
been notified of the helicopter's low flight through amphitheater airspace 
during a performance.

MUSIC REVIEW; CHAMBER MUSIC CON BRIO  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SummerFest, a.k.a. the La Jolla Chamber Music Festival, which began its ninth 
ambitious season this weekend, isn't the most glamorous endeavor of its kind. 
It certainly isn't the most pretentious. The music is the thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 The director, Heichiro Ohyama, is remarkably sophisticated, intrinsically 
serious and extraordinarily self-effacing. It may be significant that the 
festival program prints his name among the administrative credits in the same 
type-size afforded the resident page-turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles audiences may best remember Ohyama as first violist and assistant 
conductor under Andre Previn at the Philharmonic. His more recent activities 
include leadership of the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival (which bears close 
ties to La Jolla), the Japan America Symphony and the Santa Barbara Chamber 
Orchestra.  
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling La Jolla agenda this year embraces 11 subscription concerts, 
numerous educational events, open rehearsals, lectures, master classes and 
backstage seminars. All this plus social receptions, an art exhibit, a 
children's concert and something sweetly intriguing billed as an "ice-cream 
fest." 
</P>
<P>
 The central participants are 23 potential soloists with imposing national 
credentials (the roster includes pianist Ruth Laredo, violinists Ani Kavafian, 
Pamela Frank and Julie Rosenfeld, cellist Nathanial Rosen, oboist Allan Vogel 
and flutist Carol Wincenc). The supporting ensemble enlists 16 students 
euphemistically billed as "Rising Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 The SummerFest normally takes place at Sherwood Auditorium, but that venue has 
been closed while the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, to which it is 
attached, undergoes architectural renovation. Ohyama and friends have found 
temporary refuge in Parker Community Auditorium, an all-purpose 475-seat hall 
at the outer edge of the local high-school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker isn't exactly a dream showcase for the loftiest muses. The acoustics 
are dry. The atmosphere exudes little beyond no-nonsense efficiency. The 
aesthetic embellishments are modest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the ambience is appropriately intimate, the location is convenient, the 
seats are comfortable, the air-conditioning is welcome, and, mirabile dictu , 
there isn't a graffito in sight. Compared to blackboard jungles in other 
locales, this must be paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Jolla festival has never been noted for an adventurous spirit as 
regards repertory. The healthy dissonances associated with 20th-Century 
ear-stretching are not at home here. "Our audience," Ohyama conceded with wry 
exaggeration during an intermission, "still thinks Boccherini is modern." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, a stranger approached the SummerFest on Sunday 
afternoon with special curiosity. The climax of the program was supposed to be 
a potentially abrasive concerto grosso by a heroic avant-gardist from Russia, 
Alfred Schnittke. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, there was a changing of the avant-garde. Ohyama suffered 
second thoughts about Schnittke's accessibility in this performing context. 
Reluctantly, the maestro withdrew the dangerous novelty in favor of 
Shostakovich's C-minor Chamber Symphony, Opus 110a. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one had to regret the inherent caution, one certainly could find 
compensatory comfort in the brooding Shostakovich essay, which isn't exactly 
standard repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 The music was inspired by the composer's visit to Dresden in 1960. Reportedly 
horrified at the devastation of the city, Shostakovich spent three feverish 
days writing his String Quartet No. 8, which is officially dedicated to "the 
memory of the victims of fascism and war." The composer's biographers insist 
that the score -- replete with self-quotation -- concerns Shostakovich's 
private agonies as much as his sociopolitical concerns. Making only minimal 
changes, Rudolf Barshai arranged the string-orchestra version that became the 
Chamber Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a work of shattering impact, all the more poignant for its economy. The 
somber outer movements frame a wildly hysterical allegro and an eerily macabre 
waltz. The final largo offers no resolution, only a cadence of tragic 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohyama, a minimalist who can get along nicely with neither baton nor podium, 
led his youthful charges in a performance equally notable for sensitivity and 
clarity. The pathos was enhanced by understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the program, he used the same forces to luxuriate in another 
orchestral enlargement. The vehicle in this case, however, presented nothing 
more complex than the innocent lyricism of the andante from Schubert's 
"Rosamunde" Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, perhaps, Ohyama & Co. were less persuasive, and less stylish, in 
the 18th-Century music that is supposed to be a festival specialty. David 
Finckel of the Emerson Quartet served as aggressive soloist in a spirited but 
rough performance of Boccherini's D-major Cello Concerto. Hamao Fujiwara and 
Jennifer Frautschi were the dashing protagonists in a somewhat mechanical 
performance of Bach's D-minor Concerto for two violins. Although an inaudible 
harpsichordist appeared for the Bach, her services were deemed expendable for 
the Boccherini. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday-night program began with potentially provocative, much applauded 
gestures on behalf of Carl Nielsen and Benjamin Britten. The piece de 
resistance, however, took the indulgent form of Beethoven's indomitably cheery 
Septet in E-flat, Opus 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-integrated performance may have been more notable for exuberance than 
for finesse. Still, one had to admire the exemplary bravura of Fujiwara's 
fiddle, not to mention the vibrancy of Sheryl Renk's clarinet, the plangency of 
Michele Grego's bassoon and, perhaps most memorable, the dynamic sensitivity of 
Julie Landsman's horn. 
</P>
<P>
 * SummerFest continues through Aug . 28 at the Parker Community Auditorium, 
750 Nautilus St., La Jolla. Concert tickets $27.50. Information: (619) 
456-1023.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 'SUMMER JAM' CAN'T BEAT HEAT WITH A MIXED LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At various junctures on Sunday during the "92.3 The Beat Summer Jam," a 
capacity house at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre was informed by hypesters from 
the sponsoring radio station, KKBT-FM, that it was witnessing either "the 
hottest," "the phattest," or "the baddest" concert of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken literally, most of that hype was all too believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's oppressive heat baked the life out of everybody for nine of the 
rap-funk-R&B extravaganza's nearly 13 hours, leaving the audience virtually 
inert to some of the day's better performances. During the draining daylight 
hours, more people stood in line for lemonade than stood up to dance to such 
worthy acts as War and Tony Toni Tone.

<P>
 As for being phat , which in hip-hop parlance means being both splendid and

wants to see 24 acts in a day -- especially with the many rap newcomers who may 
have scored radio hits but utterly lack the performing experience to go over on 
a major stage. 
</P>
<P>
 And R&B singers who croon to recorded tracks -- a staple of Sunday's diet -- 
should be told to head back to the dance clubs until they find the wherewithal 
for a proper show with actual musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it really the baddest -- as in worst -- show of all time? If you take away 
the climate conditions, not really. Nobody was brilliant, but good moments came 
courtesy of the Isley Brothers, War, Tevin Campbell and Zapp on the R&B side, 
and Heavy D, Public Enemy and Coolio among the rappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Eazy-E was as bad as bad can be, though -- according to Webster's 
definition, not Michael Jackson's. The usual case against gangsta rappers such 
as the Compton-based co-founder of N.W.A. is that they glorify violence and 
have brutish attitudes toward women. Never mind content, though. Eazy-E's half 
hour was so plodding and ill-conceived that content hardly mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 One moment made it almost worthwhile: When Eazy-E's main sidekick commanded 
the women in the house to bluntly declare their lust for the rapper, the 
silence spoke volumes. So did the parade of people who immediately headed for 
the exits, joining the exodus already well in progress. The place was nearly 
full when Eazy-E's set began; it was virtually empty when he finished.

</P>
<P>
 Some critics of Public Enemy's new album have suggested that the much-praised 
band may be over the hill, but the group's rappers Chuck D. and Flavor Flav 
seemed bent on establishing that they still have their youthful vigor. The two 
scampered through an almost frolicsome set that was high on energy if low on 
the politicized agitation that made Public Enemy famous. Newcomer Coolio gave 
the day's best rap performance, combining near-chaotic energy and humor with 
substantial raps that imagined fleeting escapes from the traumas of ghetto 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the real-time R&B bands, the promising young Oakland group Tony Toni Tone 
suffered the worst from the heat, wilting when the fans were unable to dance to 
the Sly-inspired music. Older and steadier, War was able to withstand the 
weather and the crowd's torpor and turn in a solid set of Latinized funk. The 
always-entertaining Zapp triumphed after nightfall, generating heat that, 
finally, was merely figurative.

TV REVIEW; 'WHITEWASH' FAILS TO TRANSCEND ITS SURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an impressive vocal cast that includes Ruby Dee and Linda Lavin, 
"Whitewash," an animated special on HBO dealing with the issue of racism among 
children, is more notable for its good intentions than its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a real incident, "Whitewash" focuses on Helene Angel (Serena Henry), 
an African American fourth-grader who is attacked by a street gang on the way 
home from school.The gang members spray her face with white shoe polish to 
"make her white for a day." 
</P>
<P>
 The assault triggers a media frenzy, and the devastated Helene hides in her 
room until her classmates arrive to escort her back to school in a show of 
solidarity. Ntozake Shange's screenplay fails to explore Helene's feelings 
about the attack in any depth: All the viewer knows is that she hides in her 
room, remembering what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities remain underrepresented in animation, and producer-director Michael 
Sporn has worked to counter that problem, setting adaptations of the fairy 
tales "The Red Shoes" and "The Little Match Girl" in contemporary inner-city 
neighborhoods. But "Whitewash" sticks too close to live action and fails to 
exploit the power of animation to depict emotions symbolically. A child actress 
could have presented the pain the real little girl endured more effectively 
than these simple drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitewash" may provoke some valuable discussions between children and 
parents, but it's less interesting than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Whitewash" airs at 7:30 tonight on HBO.

DEFENSE LAWYERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Defense Lawyers and Truth: Just Where Do They Meet?" Opinion, Aug. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 I want to take Susan Estrich's column a step further. As a lawyer, she 
addresses, as a final question, the defendant's rights. As a private citizen, I 
must add, where are the victim's rights and the rights of the public in 
general? If O.J. Simpson is not guilty, so be it. But if he did commit these 
heinous murders, he (as any criminal) should be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that a clever defense could get him off, no matter what the 
truth, has done more to undermine my personal sense of safety than the riots, 
earthquake, and living adjacent to gang warfare ever has. 
</P>
<P>
 If a murderer (no matter who) can gain freedom because the defense 
deliberately creates doubt when that doubt is not substantiated, what does that 
say about the value of Nicole Simpson's and Ronald Goldman's lives? As a mother 
and member of this community, the lack of regard for truth in the justice 
system absolutely terrifies me.

 * Estrich misses the point in arguing that defense attorneys face an ethical 
dilemma because they cloud the "truth" when defending their clients. The penal 
system, as its name suggests, is not about "truth," but about "penalties." A 
finding of guilt does not unrape the victim, it puts the rapist in jail. Our 
penal system is premised on the concept that the state cannot penalize a person 
unless it can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty. It 
matters not whether the person is actually guilty or innocent; if the state 
cannot meet its burden, it cannot punish. The defense lawyer's role in this 
system is to check the power of the state to penalize. 
</P>
<P>
 A good defense attorney, therefore, is rightly unconcerned with what he or she 
believes is the "truth"; his or her concern is whether the state can prove its 
case. As Estrich well knows, there are often larger issues at stake than the 
guilt or innocence of a single defendant. If we deny a defense to defendants 
when a confession is beaten out of them by the police, or when, as in the 
Simpson case, the police illegally enter a person's home to obtain evidence, 
then we deprive ourselves of the protections against abuse of power by the 
state that our Constitution rightly guarantees and that people in less 
fortunate countries so desire.

 * I applaud Utah's controversial public defender Elliott Levine for respecting 
his client's wishes to seek the death penalty (July 31 and Aug. 1). It is 
reassuring to learn that there are lawyers today who are more concerned with 
justice than with being blindly adversarial. 
</P>
<P>
 Our legal system is out of control when high-profile defense attorneys are 
recognized more for their abilities as public relations directors than seekers 
of truth. At least Levine has a vision and some gumption.

 * The Simpson case has spawned an incredible pile of lawyer-speak. Courtroom 
hucksters, some identified as scholars, fill the airways with legal junk. What 
we are being shown is that the legal process, as now practiced in high-powered 
criminal cases, has little to do with justice, i.e., establishing true guilt or 
innocence. It's primarily about psychological manipulation and deception 
practiced on prepackaged, low-resistant juries.  
</P>
<P>
 Society pays a terrible price when a significant element of the legal 
profession turns into just another form of high-priced entertainment.

INEFFABLE COURAGE TO COMPROMISE; VOTES THAT COULD SPELL THE DIFFERENCE ON CRIME 
BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week the now-famous federal crime bill missed by just eight votes in the 
House of Representatives. The Los Angeles area has two of the votes that could 
push it over the top the next time. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as early as this week, the House will get its second shot at the 
procedural vote that could result in up to 100,000 new police officers on the 
streets, more prisons and more crime prevention programs. To be sure, 
resurrecting the $33-billion crime bill will take courage and compromise in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Congressional Black Caucus opposed the crime bill's broad 
expansion of capital punishment because African Americans are 
disproportionately sentenced to death. Even so, 27 of the 38 voting members of 
the caucus supported the Administration. They compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 It also took courage to support the assault weapons ban in the face of a 
withering barrage by the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican claim that the bill would result in the hiring of two social 
workers for every new police officer is wrong. There are surely a few rinds 
here and there, but legitimate crime prevention programs must not be disparaged 
as political pork. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the crime bill's benefits are directed toward poor urban communities 
like the district of Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, which includes Watts and 
other parts of South-Central Los Angeles. Waters voted against the crime bill 
because of her staunch, principled opposition to the death penalty. But her 
constituents would benefit so directly from more police and other new federal 
programs that, having made her point, she should now vote with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 All other California Democrats supported the procedural vote that would have 
allowed the crime bill to proceed last week. But all California Republicans 
opposed it. That wasn't the case in April. Back then, eight California 
Republicans voted for the more progressive House version of the bill, which 
included the assault weapons ban. Among those Republicans was Rep. Steve Horn 
of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the thoughtful and independent Horn, a political science scholar, 
voted against the rule to protest how the Democratic majority mistreats the 
Republican minority on procedural matters in the House. He needs to get his 
frustration behind him, especially since he strongly supports the assault 
weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 California stands to get perhaps $900 million from the bill. Only eight votes 
are needed to send the bill forward. Waters and Horn need to summon up the 
courage to compromise.

MEXICO WATCH; FOREIGN CRITIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican government rarely speaks out publicly about domestic U.S. 
political issues. (One reason, perhaps, is that U.S. officials tend to express 
themselves all too freely on issues in Mexico, as so many did during the debate 
over the North American Free Trade Agreement.)However, on the issue of a ballot 
initiative in California that bears directly on U.S.-Mexican relations, the 
Mexicans might be forgiven a bit of presumption. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech in Los Angeles, Mexico's deputy foreign minister knocked 
Proposition 187, on November's ballot, as a misguided effort to end illegal 
immigration that "not only won't solve the problem but, on the contrary, can 
only aggravate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Andres Rozental warned that the ballot measure, aimed at denying 
health care, education and other public services to illegal immigrants, if 
approved by the voters could create a huge Latino underclass here and 
exacerbate ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozental, a careful career diplomat who obviously spoke with permission from 
his superiors, said Mexican officials would express their concerns about 
Proposition 187 to California business leaders, citing its potentially negative 
effects on cross-border commerce. That reason, as much as any, is why 
thoughtful Californians should welcome Rozental having his say. More than any 
other state, California needs vigorous foreign trade. While life on the Pacfic 
Rim brings many benefits, it brings many challenges, too -- like illegal 
immigration. But a mature California can live with both, and with occasional 
foreign criticism.

GATT PROVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your July 31 editorial ("Greasing the Skids for GATT") expresses discomfort 
at the prospect of anything other than GATT's "slam dunk" approval by Congress. 
Your article, however, doesn't mention some greatly disturbing provisions in 
the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain hard-won environmental and other protective U.S. laws are in danger of 
being seriously undermined by GATT. For example, according to a report released 
by Public Citizen in April, U.S. federal, state and local food safety laws can 
be challenged by other countries as "illegal trade barriers" before secret 
tribunals of trade experts where public participation is barred. If any U.S. 
law is deemed "illegal" under GATT, the law would have to be changed or the 
U.S. would be stuck paying perpetual trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission designated by GATT to determine food standards for global trade 
(a body heavily influenced by the chemical and food industries) permits the use 
of 40 pesticides banned in the U.S. Eight of these pesticides are rated highly 
hazardous by the World Health Organization and six as carcinogens by the EPA. 
These facts alone mandate that GATT be voted down since, as you state, Congress 
cannot amend the treaty.

KENNETH STARR

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have a new Whitewater special counsel (Aug. 6). Kenneth Starr is an active 
Republican partisan, served in both the Bush and Reagan administrations, 
recently volunteered to write a legal brief opposing President Clinton's 
interests, and has never handled an investigation, thereby making him 
unqualified for the position.The new counsel was appointed by a panel of 
predominantly Republican judges, one of whom manufactured partisan legal 
arguments to reverse the convictions of Oliver North. That pretty well disposes 
of "perceptions of conflict" in the appointment of the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that Republican judges are as unwilling as Republican legislators 
to act from nonpartisan motives for the general good of the country.

</P>
<P>
 * Regarding your editorial (Aug. 8): You state that the independent counsel 
law stipulates that the special counsel was to be named by neither Republicans 
or Democrats but by a panel of three federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
 What you failed to state was that, of the three-judge panel, two were fervent 
Republicans appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush and one of them (David 
Sentelle) is a strong supporter of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and is one of the 
judges who reversed the Iran-Contra convictions of North, John Poindexter and 
Lyn Nofziger on technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
 You also failed to note that this "start over again" sham will not only cost 
the taxpayers more money (I thought the Republicans were the holy guardians of 
our taxes), but will, of course, prolong the life of this right-wing red 
herring closer to the 1996 election.  
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone actually doubt that the deck has been shamelessly stacked against 
President Clinton?

FOR THE JACKAL, NO PLACE TO HIDE; TERRORIST'S ARREST IN SUDAN SHOWS CHANGE IN 
INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's most wanted terrorist now sits in a prison cell in France, two 
years after he was convicted in absentia of the 1975 killings of two French 
counterespionage agents who were investigating attacks on Israeli airliners at 
Orly Airport in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela-born Illich Ramirez Sanchez, code name Carlos, media-bestowed name 
the Jackal, was arrested in Sudan over the weekend and promptly delivered to 
France. The circumstances of his arrest remain murky. Sudan says Carlos entered 
the country on a false diplomatic passport and along with others engaged in 
"suspicious activities" that could have embarrassed Sudan. French Interior 
Minister Charles Pasqua says that French intelligence spotted Carlos in Sudan 
earlier in the year and urged Sudanese authorities to arrest him. It's a 
credible guess that Paris put intense pressure on the Khartoum government to 
give up the man Pasqua says is responsible for terrorist attacks that killed 83 
and injured hundreds worldwide. If so, good for France. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two major implications of this arrest. First, the protection Carlos 
and others like him could once count on from many sympathetic or craven 
governments has pretty much come to an end. It's all but inconceivable that in 
the 1970s or '80s any Arab regime would have risked the wrath of Carlos' allies 
and sponsors by arresting him. The Cold War's end and what seems to be a 
maturing consensus in much of the Arab world that it's also time to end the 
long conflict with Israel are producing a new political climate, one in which 
-- just maybe -- terrorists will find they have run out of places to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 The second far-reaching implication of this arrest is its dramatic reminder 
that there cannot be any statute of limitations on terrorism, any amnesty, any 
lack of diligence in pursuing international killers. French intelligence, 
either acting alone or in cooperation with the agencies of other countries, put 
a lot of effort into tracking Carlos after and probably even well before he 
left his sanctuary in Syria. Finally, decades after his infamous career began, 
it appears that justice will be done. France in this case has earned the thanks 
of all who support the international rule of law.

COLLEGE MOM LOSES CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am appalled at the decision of the Mt. Clemens, Mich., judge who awarded the 
young unwed college student's 3-year-old daughter to the child's father because 
his mother promised to take care of the child full time (July 27). Why, he only 
is allowing the child's mother visitation rights on alternate weekends, 
holidays and other times. This is a horrendous judgment. He should be admiring 
her determination to better herself with a college education instead of being 
on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 My compromise suggestion is to let the grandmother take care of Maranda during 
the day in place of the present arrangements and allow the young mother to take 
her home into her care as she has been doing for the past three years. If need 
be, a transfer to a closer college might be advisable. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Those people who are shocked and dismayed that Maranda's father gained custody 
of her due in part to her stay-at-home paternal grandmother should really focus 
their energy on a system that grants custody to only one parent. Why wasn't 
joint custody granted in the first place, with Maranda spending half of her 
time living with each parent? Probably, as usual, because courts have always 
bent over backward to grant custody to mothers because they stay at home. 
Women's advocates can't have it both ways, getting custody because they stay at 
home and then keeping custody when they leave home to work or go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Good mothers and good fathers each deserve equal custody of their children 
whether the parent works, goes to school or just stays at home. Children 
deserve equal time living with each parent. Let's be sensible and stop the 
squabbling over the ridiculous issue of day care versus grandma. Both are 
viable options to be decided by a parent when the child is in his or her 
custody. Joint physical and legal custody should be granted in the first place. 
It is in everyone's best interest. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is completely unacceptable that the justice system would allow such 
ridiculousness to take place. Jennifer Ireland apparently has worked hard in 
order to both have care provided for her child as well as gaining an education 
to better both of their lives. She has done well for three years and the child 
is accustomed to the day care where she probably has many friends. So to say 
that she would be surrounded by strangers is way off base. This is an 
indictment of the entire day-care system in the U.S. It is sad that a judge 
would rather see a mother on welfare than to try to make something of herself.

WARNING SHOT FROM WASHINGTON; LABOR DEPARTMENT EFFORT LEADS TO CONSENT DECREE 
WITH AREA FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a dozen years of indifferent enforcement of civil rights laws by the 
federal government, there was heartening evidence last week of a change in 
attitude. The Labor Department indicated that it now means business. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa-based Canon Business Machines agreed to pay up to $633,000 to 30 
blacks, a Latino and a white woman who were denied jobs for which investigators 
found they were qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon, the subsidiary of a large Japanese company based in Tokyo, agreed to 
pay the fine to settle discrimination charges brought by the Labor Department, 
which investigates compliance with equal employment laws at all companies that 
do business with the federal government. The firm did not admit it 
discriminated but it did sign a formal consent decree agreeing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators who routinely reviewed Canon's hiring records reported that 
1,732 people applied for jobs with the company in 1992 and that of the 100 
African Americans among them not one was hired. The Labor Department said 30 
clearly met job requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are appalling figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese have been criticized at times for discrimination against 
minorities in their country and for their skewed views of race relations in 
this country. Several years ago a Japanese Cabinet minister compared 
prostitutes in Tokyo to African Americans, saying the latter "ruin the 
atmosphere" when they move into white neighborhoods. Later, under heavy 
pressure, the official apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department commented that, overall, Japanese-owned firms in the 
United States had discriminated in hiring but no more than American businesses. 
The fine is a needed reminder to all companies of their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan Administration had a poor record of enforcing laws on voting 
rights, fair employment and school desegregation. The Bush Administration had a 
mixed record at best. By contrast, the Labor Department settlement with Canon 
appears to signal that Washington plans aggressive enforcement of civil rights 
laws.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY TO FIND 'COMMUNITY'; CHARITY: CITY FOLK DON'T

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelenos are fond of the illusions they create for themselves. Take the one I 
commonly hear when I mention that I grew up in northwest Oregon, in the small 
town of Sheridan (population 2,500). It seems that many people here cling to 
fantasies about escaping the demands, challenges and frustrations of modern 
urban life for the presumed simplicity, harmony and easy sense of community 
found in rural America. It is this illusion about small-town life being easy 
that is distorted. 
</P>
<P>
 I am certain that in describing their civic participation, the word easy is 
not one that would be often used by the more than 70 men and women who staff 
and operate Sheridan's volunteer fire department; or the four community service 
clubs that annually sponsor more than two dozen events, including a three-day 
rodeo and two major scholarship fund-raisers, or the countless other residents 
who work year-round on the community's four-day Western festival, "Phil 
Sheridan Days," held each June. They would, however, say something like, "It 
was well worth the effort. After all, what would Sheridan be like without 'Phil 
Sheridan Days' every year? You know, these things just don't happen on their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 There lies an important truth -- things do not just happen on their own. Not 
in Sheridan. Not even in Los Angeles. But it seems that many Angelenos prefer 
day-dreaming about escape to getting involved in the communities, neighborhoods 
and organizations in which they live.  
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining a positive environment and a strong, healthy community takes a lot 
of effort and requires everyone to contribute. Close-knit communities of all 
sizes are built on the collective notion that every member has something of 
value to offer and contribute to the common good -- moreover, that each person 
has a responsibility to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 It is readily apparent in a small town like Sheridan what will happen if a 
large percentage of the residents do not participate in civic activities: The 
services, events and programs are simply no longer available to be used or 
enjoyed. The same is true here in Los Angeles. It may be not be as obvious, but 
the result is the same. Programs will cease to be offered. Community events 
will not be held. Friends will not be made. A sense of goodwill and respect for 
one another will not be fostered. 
</P>
<P>
 We must all do our part if Los Angeles is to once again be the kind of place 
we would proudly call home. We must begin by recognizing ourselves in one 
another. We must start by remembering that the person who moves more slowly 
than we would like them to, or requires more attention and service than we 
would want them to, could very well be us. We must recall the old saying, 
"There but for the grace of God go I." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that our lives are truly intertwined and connected in a 
multitude of ways. Just think back to the last time you were delayed on the 
freeway because of a single car breaking down. Or the time you stopped visiting 
a certain park or neighborhood because of activities you heard or saw take 
place there. And were we not all impacted by the upswell of feeling after the 
announcement of the first verdict in the Rodney King case? In Los Angeles, our 
lives are perhaps more interrelated than those of residents in smaller 
communities. The difference is that we have not consciously come to understand 
the need for us to utilize our connectedness in the most positive manner 
possible.  
</P>
<P>
 If the quality of life for all Angelenos is to improve, each of us must become 
agents of change. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County there are more than 25,000 nonprofit and community 
service organizations as well as countless grass-roots groups serving the 
particular needs of their communities. Become involved in at least one of them 
today. Instead of dreaming of a better quality of life that you believe 
effortlessly exists in rural America, put your energies into making Los Angeles 
the kind of place you want to live. Remember, a better L.A. won't just happen 
on its own.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JOHN J. PITNEY JR.: DEMOCRATS BRING BACK THEIR HIT MAN; TONY 
COELHO, WHO RAPPED GOP ETHICS BUT TOOK TAINTED S&L PERKS, RETURNS TO GUIDE 
PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. PITNEY JR., John J. Pitney Jr. is associate professor of government 
at Claremont McKenna College. He is co-author of Congress' Permanent Minority? 
Republicans in the U.S. House (Rowman and Littlefield, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his inaugural address, President Clinton said that Washington had become "a 
place of intrigue and calculation," where influential people and special 
interests maneuver for position. "Let us resolve to reform our politics," he 
proclaimed, "so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 America recently got a sign of how far the Clinton presidency has strayed from 
those noble sentiments. On orders from Leon Panetta, White House chief of 
staff, Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm has relinquished much of his 
authority to a new "special adviser": former congressman Tony Coelho of 
California. Power, privilege and cutthroat politics -- for Coelho, they're not 
a problem but a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 
1980s, Coelho had a simple creed, which he summed up in a speech to a lobbying 
group: Special interest is not a nasty word." As a Democratic colleague once 
said, Coelho gained "a reputation as the guy who sucked up all the PAC money in 
the world." He may have exaggerated, but only a little. Coelho aggressively 
solicited special-interest money by making bald references to his party's 
power. "Business has to deal with us whether they want to or not," he once 
said. On another occasion, he offered: "We're going to be in the majority for a 
very long time, so it doesn't make good business sense to give to Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1986 article, journalist Gregg Easterbrook put it another way: "If that 
pitch sounds like a mixture of protection racket (nice little multinational you 
have there; too bad if anything should happen to it) and an offer to play ball, 
that's exactly how it was intended to sound." Books such as "Honest Graft" and 
"The Big Fix" detail how the savings-and-loan industry, among others, used its 
privileged access to shape regulatory legislation during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Coelho's attitudes toward privilege also colored his view of justice. In 1981, 
he wrote a letter on congressional stationery seeking a lighter sentence for a 
campaign donor's son who had been convicted of a brutal murder. In 1989, he 
ardently defended a congressional aide whose criminal past had been uncovered 
by the Washington Post. Years earlier, according to the news account, the aide 
had assaulted a woman with a hammer and knife, but served only 27 months in 
prison. Though the aide had since risen to the top of the Capitol staff world, 
he never offered his victim any financial assistance. "Rightly or wrongly," 
Coelho said, the aide "owed his debt to society, not to this young woman." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be strange if Coelho emerged as party spokesman on crime victims' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 That probably won't happen, since Coelho always viewed public policy as a 
means to political victory, not an end in itself. "He comes out of the 
California school of politics," one Democratic aide said, "media and a lot of 
flash." As Coelho himself told columnist James Kilpatrick in 1984: "The issues 
are not that important to people. Issues will take care of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As the House Democrats' campaign chief, Coelho subordinated ideas to attacks: 
"My job is to be the hit man." In 1982, he tried to frighten elderly Americans 
into believing that Republicans would take away Social Security. He candidly 
admitted: "If the psychology of fear is reversed, then people will listen to 
the Republican message."  
</P>
<P>
 Coelho also attacked GOP ethics, but he eventually encountered ethical 
problems of his own. During the 1980s, a troubled savings-and-loan paid for a 
number of dockside cruises and parties for Coelho, who used the events to 
entertain rich political donors. When the arrangement was exposed, the campaign 
committee and Coelho's own reelection fund reimbursed the S&L. In 1989, the 
press revealed that an executive of another troubled thrift had bought Coelho a 
$100,000 junk bond and that Coelho repaid the executive with money partly 
borrowed from the S&L. By failing to disclose the loan, Coelho had apparently 
violated House rules and opened himself to withering criticism. Under fire, he 
resigned from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after his resignation did Coelho reveal the true depth of his cynicism. 
At the 1988 Democratic convention, he had thundered: "When the titans of Wall 
Street were looting the small investors on Main Street, where was George Bush?" 
Coelho pledged that his party would fight "the corporate cannibals on Wall 
Street." So what did he do after leaving the Hill? 
</P>
<P>
 He became a New York investment banker.

COLUMN LEFT/ RUTH ROSEN: SUMMER, 1964: A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUD BATH; WHILE THE 
MEDIA OVERDOSE ON WOODSTOCK REVISITED, REMEMBER A MORE SIGNIFICANT ANNIVERSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at UC Davis, writes regularly 
on political culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a nation chooses to remember tells us a lot about who we are. The media 
frenzy over the 25th anniversary of Woodstock has created a freeze-dried image 
of the 1960s and celebrates the least-threatening aspect of that decade -- the 
hedonism and self-indulgence that so easily turned into the narcissism of the 
1970s and greed of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 (I'm no curmudgeon, though -- I didn't attend Woodstock because, like so many 
in my generation, I had a job. But I danced many nights away and, yes, I 
inhaled.) 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we should ponder much more significant anniversaries. Thirty years 
ago, for example, during the fateful summer months of 1964, the 1950s ended and 
the United States formally entered the cultural and political wars of the 
1960s, from which it has not yet recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer of 1964, more than 1,000 Northern college students, black 
and white, "went South" for Mississippi Freedom Summer. They lived among the 
Southern rural poor, teaching in freedom schools, trying to register black 
citizens as voters. At night, they trembled as night riders' bullets whizzed 
through their windows. By day, they drove anxiously, terrified by the dangers 
of back-road Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Some died. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, three 
civil-rights workers who disappeared early in the summer, were finally 
unearthed from a dam in August. The deaths and beatings of so many white youths 
forced a nation indifferent to black casualties to acknowledge the violence 
that terrorized the Southern civil-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 That summer the dream of an interracial society collapsed at the Democratic 
National Convention. Excluded from the political process, African Americans 
formed the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party and demanded to replace the 
state's all-white delegation at the convention. Afraid to lose Southern whites 
to the Republicans, the Democrats turned their backs on all black Americans by 
refusing to seat the entire delegation. Many African Americans date the rebirth 
of separatism and black power from that humiliating moment in Atlantic City; 
the alliance with white liberal Democrats had been shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 That August also brought the shocking news that Vietnam had supposedly 
attacked a U.S. Navy vessel. Days later, Congress, with only two dissenting 
votes, passed the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The war that would shadow the next 
10 years of my life -- my entire college and graduate education -- had begun.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tonkin resolution ignited a fierce battle among Americans, eventually 
tearing the nation apart. Sometimes the polarization began between children and 
their parents. I was not the only anti-war activist whose parents fiercely 
supported the war. The generation gap, fed by the growing counterculture, 
widened rapidly. Stigmatized as filthy beatniks or communist sympathizers, the 
earliest anti-war protesters dared question whether the government had lied to 
the American people. (It had.) 
</P>
<P>
 When the summer ended, fall brought an uprising of thousands of students 
during the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley. The sleepy '50s ended abruptly: 
Police hauled off 800 students for protesting the university's prohibition of 
campus recruitment of students for civil-rights activity. The ban on free 
speech united students and faculty and was eventually reversed. Across the 
nation, hundreds of thousands of students, inspired by the news of a student 
movement, began questioning received wisdom as they fought against an 
escalating war. In the wake of these movements came spirited struggles for 
women's rights, gay rights and a new ecology movement.  
</P>
<P>
 But these are not the events we choose to remember this summer. For if we did, 
we might have to face the hard facts that the plight of African Americans has 
deteriorated since Freedom Summer and the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party, 
that the nation is still deeply divided over the Vietnam War and American 
foreign policy and that the hopeful idealism that fired the Free Speech 
Movement has been replaced by the hopeless despair of much of today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign observers often accuse the United States of having a bad case of 
historical amnesia. They're wrong. Like other nations, we choose our memories 
selectively, careful to avoid those that threaten our fragile national 
identity. Thirty years ago, thousands of Americans made enormous personal 
sacrifices to stop a war, poverty and racial intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 So much simpler, sexier -- and profitable -- to celebrate the mythic muddy 
lovemaking at Woodstock.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Anderson, 61, once recognized as the strongest man in the world, died 
Monday at a Vidalia, Ga., hospital after a long struggle with kidney failure 
and arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson set nine world records and 18 American records in weightlifting in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a gold medal in the 1956 Olympics at Melbourne, Australia, and set 
three Olympic records. He is the last American heavyweight to have won an 
Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still listed in "The Guinness Book of World Records" for having lifted 
the most weight with his back in 1957 -- 6,270 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's other feats included lifting a table with half a dozen people on 
top, the rear end of a pickup truck loaded with horses and a carousel with 
children sitting on ponies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's health problems started in 1983 and he later received a kidney from 
his sister, Dorothy Johnson. Anderson almost died when his colon ruptured a 
year later and he was in a coma for 10 days. Miscellany 
</P>
<P>
 A Nigerian track athlete was sent home from the Commonwealth Games in 
Victoria, British Columbia, when steroids were found in his suitcase. A

THE ITALIAN GRAND PRIX TO STAY -- TREES AND ALL; MOTOR RACING: FORMULA ONE 
LEADERS REINSTATE EVENT AFTER SAFETY MEASURES ARE TAKEN AT MONZA TRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Italian Grand Prix is back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after canceling the race, Formula One's governing body on Monday 
said it was reinstating the Sept. 11 event following agreement on new safety 
measures at the Monza circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation International de L'Automobile (FIA) said it had approved a 
proposal for changes to the second Lesmo Corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This solution, which changes the shape of the second Lesmo and reduces its 
speed, is acceptable to the FIA on the basis that it is for 1994 only," FIA 
said in a statement. "As a result, the 1994 Italian Grand Prix has been 
reinstated on the calendar of the 1994 FIA Formula One Championship." 
</P>
<P>
 The grandstand at the second corner will be removed and replaced with a gravel 
run-off area and new crash barriers, FIA spokesman Martin Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The angle of the corner will be made more acute, cutting speeds from 
approximately 161 m.p.h. to 105 m.p.h., Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monza organizers had suggested putting chicanes between the two Lesmo Corners, 
but that was ruled out by FIA. No change will be made to the first corner. 
</P>
<P>
 FIA had scrapped the race last Friday after local officials refused to make 
circuit changes that would have required cutting down 123 trees. The demand to 
cut the centuries-old trees in the Monza public park had outraged 
environmentalists, and the city's superintendent for environmental and 
architectural affairs, Lucia Gremmo, vetoed the felling of the trees last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Monday's agreement, no trees will be cut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either the trees that went or the grandstand," Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIA president Max Mosley agreed to the new changes -- proposed by Monza 
organizers, FIA experts and drivers' representative Gerhard Berger -- following 
talks with Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 "My government and I are very attached to the Italian Grand Prix and the Monza 
circuit," Berlusconi told reporters Sunday. "We have done everything in our 
power to make the race go ahead Sept. 11." 
</P>
<P>
 RAI state TV reported the "great satisfaction" of Cabinet secretary Gianni 
Letta, who, on behalf of Berlusconi, had met with Mosley on Saturday to press 
the government's campaign that the race be run. 
</P>
<P>
 FIA stressed the changes are short-term only and it will be actively seeking a 
long-term solution for the circuit for 1995 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety concerns in Formula One have been heightened since the deaths of Ayrton 
Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at San Marino Grand Prix in May.

ART; IMAGES OF BEHAVIOR; MIKE KELLEY'S WORK, NEGLECTED AT LAGUNA SHOW, DIGS 
DEEP INTO YOUTH REBELLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Kustom Kulture: Von Dutch, Ed 'Big Daddy' Roth, Robert Williams & Others," 
last summer's big show at the Laguna Art Museum, was a ground-breaking 
exhibition that lingers in the mind. Its major appeal was the novelty of seeing 
a show primarily devoted to irreverent imagery that taps into teen-age male 
preoccupations with speed, violence, power, gross-out situations and automotive 
craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "& Others" portion of the exhibition -- a sampling of contemporary art 
that addresses aspects of the "car culture" mentality -- unfortunately came 
across as a dutiful postscript that didn't do full justice to the cultural 
perspective offered by key postmodern artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kelley is one of these artists, and the revelatory exhibition of his work 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (through Sept. 11) suggests that a 
greater emphasis on his sensibility would have given "Kustom Kulture" a welcome 
ballast. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his art is pointedly anti-macho and bolstered by a sophisticated 
intellectual background, it is rooted in the same state of adolescence that 
propelled "Kustom Kulture." 
</P>
<P>
 However, instead of catering to teen-age fantasies or rendering 
tongue-in-cheek fantasy versions ( a la Robert Williams), Kelley uses 
pop-derived -- and sometimes deeply taboo -- imagery to get at conflicted or 
buried feelings about such touchy subjects as family life, religion and body 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Had "Kustom Kulture" devoted more wall space to Kelley's art and more 
catalogue space to a discussion of his work, the show would have made a more 
persuasive case for the deeper significance of art based on the transgressive 
attitudes of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Kelley's unique perspective, the most banal everyday things -- from Bible 
illustrations to cartoons, from stuffed animals to hobbyist manuals -- mirror 
the tremendous gap between imperfect real life and the ideals and archetypes 
that are part of our cultural fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has described "the purest form of art" as "simple visual interest -- 
to look at what you find yourself driven to see. Higher notions of art tend to 
confine art with lofty moral restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelley's art is intensely involved with moral issues even as it thumbs its 
nose at the strictures of modernist aesthetes, liberal do-gooders and polite 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1954 in Detroit (Motor City), Kelley grew up in a working-class 
suburb. A generation -- and half a continent -- removed from the trio of 
car-culture artists (he didn't move to California until 1976), he was 
influenced in his youth by a mixture of counterculture, popular culture, 
traditional mores and art. They included proto-punk musicians Iggy and the 
Stooges, TV, Japanese horror movies, Catholic school, the avant-garde Fluxus 
group and the performance art and installations of Joseph Beuys and Allan 
Kaprow. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Kelley became a teen-ager in the '60s, the car culture stuff was 
available to him as a consumer -- Von Dutch's creative car painting (flames, 
flying eyeballs), Roth's Rat Fink caricatures and Williams' Zap Comix drawings. 
The fascinating thing is that Kelley seems to have absorbed all visual 
information in the same questioning way, not distinguishing between "high" and 
"low" art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Kustom Kulture trio primarily was interested in the way art looks , 
Kelley preferred to try to figure out how art (or any imagery) behaves . In a 
quote in the LACMA exhibit catalogue, he says that years ago he began wondering 
why Willem de Kooning's Abstract Expressionist distorted figures "don't have 
the same meaning" as those by Mad magazine cartoonist Basil Wolverton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably like (Wolverton) for the same reason I like De Kooning," Kelley 
said, "but he's funny and De Kooning's not funny. I started thinking about how 
something could be funny and not funny at the same time, depending on the 
context it was put in." 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, the work selected to represent Kelley in "Kustom Kulture" was 
the painting "Infinite Expansion" that was part of his 1984 performance piece 
"The Sublime." In the painting, a meandering, organic pattern flows outward 
from a blank central square. That blankness is at the heart of "the infinite" 
-- a concept with no actual counterpoint in reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Infinite Expansion" displays Kelley's typical method of presenting a 
daunting philosophical issue in a deliberately debased format (in this case, a 
gigantic notebook doodle), numerous other works of his might have been more 
relevant to the sophomoric high jinks of "Kustom Kulture." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the source for Kelley's curiously minimal "garbage" drawings was 
Sad Sack comics, the strip about the Army private constantly humiliated by his 
superiors and often assigned to KP. Remove all the figures and speech balloons 
from the strip, and the "landscape" turns out to be the cartoonist's scribbled 
shorthand for garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 By using this "throwaway" detail as the sole imagery in a series of drawings, 
Kelley located the ultimate symbol of human degradation and feelings of 
worthlessness at the heart of a popular, nationally syndicated cartoon strip. 
By beaming a relentless intellect on the banal corners of contemporary life, 
Kelley locates the confused, cynical and resentful adolescent in us all. 
</P>

 Almost unnoticed in the final blitz of rallies, opinion polls and punditry 
surrounding Mexico's most hotly contested presidential elections in six decades 
was this prediction by author Carlos Fuentes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico will have a bad president, with a good government. . . . He will be a 
little crippled, because of the way in which he will be elected, a bit 
one-armed, because of the composition of the Congress (that will be elected the 
same day), and therefore he will only be able to govern by negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in fact, is among the few shared truths in what promises to be Mexico's 
least predictable and yet most democratic national elections of this century. 
Sunday's electoral showdown is an experiment in pluralism, pegged at a cost of 
$2 billion by outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, that politicians 
and analysts agree almost certainly will chart a more democratic course for 
this nation of 92 million as it navigates through endemic poverty, elitist 
wealth, massive unemployment and potential social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Unprecedented in the uncertainty of its outcome after 65 consecutive years of 
rule by a single, monolithic political force, the heated and costly campaign 
for the presidency, Congress and two state governorships already has built 
several key pillars for fundamental democractic change. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight independent political parties -- the largest number ever -- are 
competing for power with the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI). The PRI-ruled government has spent $730 million on a state-of-art, 
computerized voter-registration and identification system that has been 
embraced by all but one of those parties. The government also will permit 
international observers and a U.N. team of experts to monitor the vote 
independently for the first time. And each of the three leading presidential 
candidates has, as a campaign centerpiece, shared commitments to a major 
overhaul of Mexico's often-corrupt and traditionally authoritarian political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent of those promised reforms are the candidates' vows of 
power-sharing in the omnipotent executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling party's candidate, 42-year-old Ernesto Zedillo, who has posted a 
commanding lead in opinion polls commissioned largely by international banks 
and other institutions that prefer the PRI, has vowed to consider members of 
the opposition for his Cabinet if he wins. His leading challenger, 53-year-old 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), 
has made a similar public pledge. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who many believe was 
cheated out of the presidency through fraud in the 1988 elections, has made no 
such public vow, but supporters of his center-left Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) said they expect some level of power-sharing if Cardenas surges 
from his third-place position in the polls to win. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are several less obvious but potentially more far-reaching reforms 
put in place by Salinas that will kick in with almost immediate effect after 
the elections. And, of those, the most dramatic are changes in the size and 
composition of the Congress. It is these changes that Fuentes and other 
respected Mexican analysts have concluded -- barring civil war or massive 
Election Day fraud -- inevitably will propel Mexico into a new era of lively, 
although potentially turbulent, democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, those analysts say, no matter which of the three leading 
presidential contenders is elected to lead the nation into the 21st Century 
this Sunday, this experiment in pluralist democracy is almost certain to 
transform the internal balance of power here. 
</P>
<P>
 And it will do so, they say, by shattering the traditional role of Mexico's 
Chamber of Deputies and its Senate, both historically rubber-stamp bastions of 
a president handpicked by the ruling PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, the 500-seat Chamber of Deputies, which will be elected under a new 
proportional representation system that precludes a two-thirds majority for any 
party, will become a far more autonomous political force, according to 
independent and ruling party analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate will double in size to 128 seats, many of which will go to the 
opposition. And both houses are expected to become far more free-wheeling 
marketplaces of power, in which the PRI will be unable to alter the nation's 
constitution as it has with abandon in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the constitution, the Congress does have extensive powers of checks and 
balances. It just never has chosen to exercise them. And under the new rules of 
the game, the opposition and ruling party alike agree that Mexico's political 
landscape is bound to resemble more the U.S.-style balance of power between the 
legislative and executive branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect is that the executive in power cannot pass all the laws he wants," 
said Carlos Castillo, PAN's president and chief strategist, who predicted that 
his party will win at least 140 seats in the new Chamber of Deputies. "It's a 
more balanced system of power, and it is the same if Zedillo or Diego will 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts, particularly those associated with Cardenas and the PRD, are 
not as confident that the changes will come so swiftly -- or even directly -- 
through the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Castaneda, a respected analyst and professor at the National Autonomous 
University of Mexico, said the PRI still could create an effective two-thirds 
majority by forming alliances with smaller parties, as it did after the 1988 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castaneda, who is among the founding members of a center-left collective 
of intellectuals known as the San Angel Group, said that fundamental 
power-sharing is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole San Angel premise is that no one will win with more than 40% of the 
vote," he said. The legislature will be fractious, the nation polarized and 
civil unrest a threat, Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such conditions, he added, "the premise is that Mexico is ungovernable 
with a PRI president. You will need a coalition government -- a real coalition 
that includes everyone. You have to share power -- really share power -- and 
you have to get a deal on a common program." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the PRI's Zedillo and his party's once-unbeatable political 
machine scoff at such a scenario. Using the final, though yet unproven, poll 
results released by pro-PRI institutions last Friday (most showed Zedillo with 
more than 40% support to 20% for Diego and 10% for Cardenas), they are striving 
to set the stage for a major PRI victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling party quickly points out, however, that even if he wins big, 
Zedillo has publicly committed himself to significant power-sharing and to the 
new, independent role of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 4 speech that shocked members of the PRI's old guard, who have come 
to be known as "dinosaurs," Zedillo promised a series of radical reforms, both 
within the party and in its relations with the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The premise of the relationship between the executive power and the 
legislature is that it strictly respects the legislature's autonomy," Zedillo 
declared. "The pluralist composition of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate 
represents a fundamental factor for independent politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The executive must not only obey the decisions of the legislature, it must 
also work respectfully and concertedly with Congress . . . (to) ensure a 
balance and a counterbalance between the powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly radical to a U.S. audience, such commitments from the PRI's 
presidential hopeful are borderline surreal when viewed through the prism of 
Mexican Congresses past. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a glimpse through that prism: 
</P>
<P>
 When the Mexican legislature adjourned for Christmas last December, Sergio 
Aguayo declared in a front-page commentary in the highly regarded daily La 
Jornada, "The Mexican Congress closed the year with another brilliant 
demonstration of irrelevance and insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "With few exceptions, the Mexican legislature behaved according to the 
absolutely predictable rules: One party, the PRI, dominated the Chamber of 
Deputies and the Senate; the members of this party always obeyed the orders of 
the president of the republic, and the result was: Congress approved everything 
-- absolutely everything -- that the executive sent." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the illustrations of that irrelevance culled from the files of the last 
Congress: the days-long debate about Madonna last October. 
</P>
<P>
 For seemingly endless hours, the deputies wrangled over a resolution to ban a 
scheduled Madonna concert. "Why Madonna 'No' and Michael Jackson 'Yes?' " PRD 
legislator Cristobal Arias asked PRI legislator Fernando Lerdo, who had 
objected to the singer's performance on the grounds of cultural sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 His arguments against the concert included: "It denigrates us; it's part of 
the garbage that other countries reject, and it promotes the most odious of 
sins, like homosexuality, lesbianism, sodomy." 
</P>
<P>
 Such have been the legislative realities that they have created a collective 
frustration among the opposition, which was embodied in one PRD legislator who 
came to be known as "the egg lady." She had tried -- and failed -- to bring 
baskets of eggs into the legislature to throw at the ruling party. On one 
occasion, however, she managed to play a tape of John Lennon's "Imagine" to 
underscore a vitriolic attack on the absence of democracy in the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the PRI power, there nevertheless have been illustrations of the 
popular demand among most Mexicans to reform the Congress into a truly 
democratic body. 
</P>
<P>
 During a particularly heated debate on a landlord-tenant bill that Salinas was 
pushing through Congress, a furious mob representing more than 20 civic 
organizations stormed the Chamber of Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 They smashed windows, wounded a security guard and spent seven hours 
protesting, trying to pressure the ruling party into backing away from the 
bill. But a month later, with the Chamber of Deputies under heavy guard, the 
bill skated through. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this kind of lopsided vote that opposition strategists such as PAN's 
Castillo expects to end when the new legislature is seated. It is not as if he 
expects his party to take control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said, he expects the PRI to maintain its majority in the 
legislature -- even if Fernandez wins the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castillo, confirming what several ruling party officials have indicated 
privately, said an ultimate irony would take shape if Zedillo wins and tries to 
force reforms on a legislature dominated by old-guard PRI deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Zedillo will have more problems than Diego in working with Congress," 
he said, "because Zedillo is not very well-appreciated among many within the 
PRI." Powerful History 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party has claimed up to 75% of the 
Chamber of Deputies in recent years. But new laws preclude any party from 
occupying so many seats. Elections for the body are held every three years.

WORLD VIEW; PICTURE THIS: ART THIEVERY IS THRIVING; IN EUROPE, ONLY DRUG 
SMUGGLING AND ILLEGAL ARMS TRADE EARN MORE FOR CRIMINALS.

 In late July, two thieves hid in Frankfurt's Schirn Kunsthalle until the 
gallery's closing time, then overpowered the sole security guard before he 
could activate the night alarm system. They handcuffed and gagged him, stuck 
him in an anteroom and patiently removed three paintings from the walls. Then 
they carried their booty out the back door to a waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
 The haul: two magnificent oils by English Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner and a 
landscape by the German master Caspar David Friedrich. The three paintings were 
insured for $45 million. There has been no word from the thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after the Frankfurt theft, someone broke through the main door of 
the Rembrandt House Museum outside Amsterdam and made off with two paintings by 
Rembrandt's tutor, Pieter Lastman. Again, no word from the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Norway's most famous painting, "The Scream" by Edvard Munch, was 
stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo. This time the thieves made contact, 
asking for more than $1 million in ransom for the painting, which was valued at 
$10.5 million. Police cracked the case, recovering the painting before the 
money was paid. Two men were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, in November, paintings by Picasso and Braque, valued at $60 
million, were taken from Stockholm's Modern Museum. The paintings have been 
recovered and two men arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, 38 works by master painters have been stolen from 
French museums. Last month, a pastel portrait by the 17th-Century painter 
Robert Nanteuil was stolen from the Louvre, between rounds of the guards. In 
Budapest last December, about 200 art objects worth $85 million were stolen 
from the main synagogue, repository of the largest Jewish collection in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Art theft, always an intriguing crime because of the familiarity and history 
of many of the pieces, is becoming rampant. Police in Europe now list art and 
antique thefts as the third most profitable criminal activity -- after drug 
smuggling and the illegal arms trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question, art thefts are very much on the increase, involving 
millions and millions of dollars," said Detective Inspector Jill McTigue of 
Scotland Yard's crack art and antiques squad. "Staggering," agreed London 
insurance adjuster Mark Dalrymple. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turners stolen in Frankfurt -- "Shade and Darkness" and "Light and Color" 
-- were painted in 1843 and, said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery 
in London, which had loaned them to the Schirn, "are masterpieces of European 
Romanticism. Their theft represents a major loss for the Tate Gallery and for 
European painting." The Friedrich, "Wafting Mist," was on loan to the Schirn 
from a museum in Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1991 and early 1994 in Italy alone, an estimated $500 million in 
artworks were stolen, with thefts doubling to reach about 2,000 instances. Said 
Jean-Michel Mimerand, director of the Office for Repression of Art Thefts in 
Paris: "France and Italy, closely followed by Spain, are the most pillaged 
countries. The criminal networks are well organized to get the merchandise out 
to transit countries very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Petersburg, sitting in his office in the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, Nikolai Musinsky spread photos of stolen objects on his desk and said: 
"These are almost all Faberge works. Weapons and drugs smuggling are dangerous, 
but in a way the theft and shipping abroad of cultural treasures is far worse. 
Who can say what loss the government takes if, say, someone steals a Titian 
from our Hermitage Museum?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian National Library is still trying to figure out what's left of one 
of the world's greatest collections of ancient Jewish documents. At last count, 
38 were missing. Librarians believe they were stolen over a period of years and 
have been offered at private auctions in Jerusalem and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is an art thief's dream. Museums are packed with works -- some 
commissioned by the czars, others confiscated by the Communist regimes -- and 
then there are the Russian Orthodox Church's riches, most of which are 
unprotected by sophisticated security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 One effect of the crime spree is a growing reluctance among museum directors 
to let treasures leave the building. "I hope thefts won't mean a major 
clampdown on lending paintings," said David Brown, curator of the Turner 
collection at the Tate. "We're borrowers as well as lenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes thefts show ingenious planning and inside knowledge, as in the 
Frankfurt heist; sometimes, as in a case at the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery 
in Britain last December, a theft is a simple rip-off. The Birmingham thief 
lifted off the wall a small painting by 15th-Century Flemish painter Petrus 
Christus, "The Man of Sorrows," and stuck it in his pocket. Five months later, 
London detectives recovered it from an art dealer in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the upsurge in art thefts? 
</P>
<P>
 "Partly, it's the publicity given these days to works of art," Detective 
Inspector McTigue said. "Everyone realizes the value of art. Further, a 
criminal who robs a bank risks getting shot by police, and if caught faces a 
very long prison sentence for a crime with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A robber taking things from an art gallery or country mansion does not run 
the same risks. If he is caught, we still have to prove where the property 
comes from. Our biggest problem is finding where artistic loot is stolen from." 
</P>
<P>
 London's arts and antiques squad is recognized as an authority in the field, 
partly because an estimated 60% of stolen paintings wind up in the British 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 McTigue and others point out that fine art, particularly paintings, has become 
a form of international currency, and as such can serve as coin for big drug 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art has become a favorite method of laundering money," said Philip Saunders, 
managing director of the art magazine Trace. "Let's say you have a lot of cash 
from a drug deal. Cash deposits of a certain amount in banks are monitored by 
police. But you could go into an auction house and buy a painting for hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "You then take the painting out of the country and sell it to a dealer in 
Amsterdam, Zurich or Los Angeles. You may lose a little on the transaction, but 
now the money is clean. In the same way, you can pick lesser-known works to 
steal and pay for them with dirty money and sell them for clean money." 
</P>
<P>
 The cleverest thieves target paintings below world-class levels because they 
are not as familiar and can be taken to other countries and sold as "school of" 
works -- paintings in the manner of a master -- at reduced prices but for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thieves steal paintings for the reward invariably offered by insurance 
companies, a delicate matter because while it is illegal to deal with 
criminals, the insurance companies naturally want the works back -- as do 
owners. Thus thieves might arrange to give "information" -- and collect the 
reward -- for paintings they stole. 
</P>
<P>
 More puzzling is the rationale for stealing paintings such as the Turners or 
the Munch, so well known that they would be recognized by any dealer or buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, thieves plan to ransom back the works to the museum from which they 
were taken -- or to the insurance companies that otherwise would have to pay 
off millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that the whole process is going to turn into a form of 
terrorism, cultural terrorism," said Eric Shanes, head of London's Turner 
Society. "Art theft could become a major form of kidnaping, art-naping." 
</P>
<P>
 Art thefts, of course, have occurred since the first art objects were made, 
and there are differences over what constitutes art theft. Archeologists have 
long stripped ancient tombs of their artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elgin Marbles were taken by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the 
Ottoman Empire, from the Parthenon in Athens in the early 19th Century. He said 
he took them for safekeeping during hostilities. But the sculptures still 
reside in the British Museum, though Greece insists they were illegally 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 And the audacity of thieves knows few bounds. In 1911, the world's most famous 
painting, the "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci, was stolen from the Louvre in 
Paris by an Italian workman. He returned it two years later. During World War 
II, Adolf Hitler and other top Nazis looted treasures in occupied Europe. 
Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces plundered Kuwait's national museum, which housed 
some of the world's finest Islamic art. 
</P>
<P>
 As of now, only about 15% of stolen art is recovered. What can be done? 
</P>
<P>
 First comes increased security inside museums and other collections, but this 
is expensive. Japan, where thefts were frequent after World War II, has 
tightened security systems and has significantly reduced thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, authorities are urging collectors to catalogue and photograph 
their works, with detailed descriptions that can be traced. 
</P>
<P>
 The wealth and expertise of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles are now being 
brought to bear with the Getty Art History Information Program, which seeks to 
cut down the illicit trade in art and the looting of archeological sites by 
accurately describing and depicting the objects themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet great art remains irresistible. The mystery surrounding major thefts 
invokes the vision of the rich collector, who orders paintings stolen for his 
own private viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt police chief Karl-Heinz Gemmer said the works stolen from the Schirn 
were too well known to be sold in the art market. Perhaps, he suggests, they 
were ordered by an obsessive collector who wanted "to enjoy them under cover of 
night."

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa's new black-led government has begun slowly but steadily to 
grapple with the legacy of apartheid and the complex challenges that lie 
ahead.On Thursday , President Nelson Mandela will address the new all-race 
Parliament in Capetown and give himself a report card on the progress achieved 
during the first 100 days of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts give him a mixed review so far. The economy has picked up, but 
foreign investors remain gun-shy. Political violence is down, but labor strikes 
have led to bloodshed. Mandela concedes he has yet to deliver on his campaign 
promise of a better life for all. "The wheels of government grind slowly," he 
explains.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Sri Lanka, the teardrop-shaped Indian Ocean island traumatized by 11 years 
of civil war, voters go to the polls today in crucial parliamentary elections 
following a bloody campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no dependable opinion polls, but many observers believe the 
opposition socialist People's Alliance will oust the centrist United National 
Party, which has been in power for 17 years.If it wins, the People's Alliance 
has promised to hold talks with the rebels who have been fighting for an 
independent Tamil homeland in a war that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. 
More than 130,000 police and troops are being deployed at the polls to prevent 
further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the makeup of Sri Lanka's new Parliament, President Dingiri Wijetunge 
will remain president until new elections for that office are held in November.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MEXICO CITY; PIVOTAL VOTE AT HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 45.7 million Mexican voters will head to the polls Sunday to elect 
a new president and National Congress in a key test of Mexican democracy and 
political reform. Under the watchful eye of about 35,000 independent Mexican 
poll watchers and, for the first time, several hundred foreign "visitors," 
Mexicans will choose from among nine political parties, among them the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party that has ruled the country through 
consecutive presidencies since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent opinion polls, permitted for the first time this year, showed the 
ruling party presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, with a comfortable lead 
over his closest rival, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action 
Party. But the polls also estimated that as many as 25% of the voters were 
still undecided as of last week. Despite Zedillo's lead, analysts do not rule 
out the ruling party's first defeat in 65 years.

 With trouble in the streets of Havana, visions of a repeat performance of the 
1980 Mariel boat lift, one of Fidel Castro's more unpopular exports, were 
raised on editorial pages around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In radio and television broadcasts from the Cuban capital, Castro, now in his 
34th year as Cuba's president, warned that he might open the gates and let 
malcontents on his island set sail for Florida. The Clinton Administration 
responded by threatening to order a naval blockade of Cuba, keeping its people 
ashore and preventing Florida-based Cuban Americans from seeking to deliver 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980 boat lift, about 125,000 Cubans fled to Florida in a motley 
flotilla. Some of them were prisoners or mental patients.

CULTURE; ONE GERMANY, TWO LANGUAGES, MUCH CONFUSION; EAST AND WEST DEVELOPED 
THEIR OWN LEXICONS DURING 40 YEARS OF SEPARATION. SOME VARIATIONS ARE MINOR, 
BUT OTHERS REFLECT DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD. 
</P>

<P>
 "When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer," George Orwell 
remarked in the politically befouled climate of 1946, at the dawn of the Cold 
War. He delivered himself of this pronouncement in his enduring essay "Politics 
and the English Language" three years prior to the founding of the German 
Democratic Republic and nearly two decades before bricklayers fell to work on 
the Berlin Wall, a.k.a. der antifaschistische Schutzwall , or anti-fascist 
protective wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But as is almost always true of Orwell, the man was dead right. The 
contrasting fortunes of written and spoken German in the two successor states 
to the Third Reich are more than proof enough.  
</P>
<P>
 No sooner did the Wall come down in 1989 than western and eastern Germans 
discovered thatthey had developed often ludicrously different ways of 
communicating during their 40 years of separation. Some differences were minor 
vocabulary quirks -- each side had come up with its own word for "grocery bag," 
for instance -- but in many cases the linguistic variations were politically 
charged, the stuff of two wholly separate ways of looking at things. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the process of German reunification is often proving to be an awkward 
business for all parties, with easterners resenting the west and vice versa, 
language is turning out to be one more factor underlining -- and at times 
perpetuating -- the national divide. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the east want to learn western German," says Ingrid Kuehn, a 
scholar of German language and literature at Martin Luther University in the 
eastern city of Halle. "But, of course, they don't know all the words, so they 
mix things up. They will be talking with a westerner about their 'work team,' 
and all of a sudden they'll forget and slip in the word ' Kollektiv .' Then the 
western German will say, 'What kind of weird language do these people speak?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Kuehn has been running a hot line out of her department at 
the university, where easterners can call and, free of charge, learn how to get 
back onto an even linguistic footing with their western compatriots. Though she 
takes calls just three days a week, and advertises with simple handbills tacked 
up on bulletin boards, she averages 60 inquiries per week, from people seeking 
help with everything from letter-writing -- how to close, if you don't say 
"with socialist regards" any more? -- to the pronunciation of the many English 
words -- "leasing," "cash," "surfboard" -- that have worked their way into 
western German over 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in eastern Germany have had to adopt a whole new system and, with the 
new system, a whole new vocabulary," says Kuehn, herself a former citizen of 
East Germany, officially known as the German Democratic Republic. "Right now, 
they don't feel comfortable in their own mother tongue. They don't want to go 
into a shop and make fools of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And unfortunately, to western ears, many eastern German words sound just that 
-- foolish. During the Cold War, no one in West Germany made any particular 
effort to shape the language along ideological lines, but in East Germany the 
government tried deliberately to write a new socialist lexicon -- and, with it, 
to nurture a new socialist identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what the authorities dreamed up sounds straight out of Orwell's 
"1984." The angels that decorate the tops of Christmas trees, for instance, are 
called "Christmas angels" in western Germany. But in the east, where angels and 
Christmas were politically incorrect? Nothing doing. They were sold in boxes 
labeled "Year-End Winged Figure." 
</P>
<P>
 A flag, likewise, was not a Fahne , or flag, in the GDR, but a Winkelement , 
or "waving element," because the authorities used to hand them out before 
parades and expect people to wave them. Communist agricultural planners even 
decided to call the lowly cow a Grossvieheinheit , or "large cattle unit." 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to show that a socialist cow was something special, different 
from a capitalist cow," says Siegmar Pfeil, an associate professor of German 
language and literature at Jena University, who like Kuehn has been watching 
what happens to the language as the former East and West come together. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeil notes that outside the Communist Party, few East Germans warmed to the 
Newspeak. They could watch Western television and see easily enough that, in 
the rest of the world, a Christmas angel was still called a Christmas angel.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they used these words, they did so with a twinkle in their eye," says 
Pfeil. And as soon as there was no more Eastern regime to reinforce the new 
language, the worst barbarisms died quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But just because easterners know that certain words are non-starters, Kuehn 
says, that doesn't mean they always know which western words to use. She finds 
easterners at the greatest loss when it comes to job-seeking -- a subject of 
intense interest, with the unofficial eastern German unemployment rate near 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
 A job-seeker who lets his easternness show in a carelessly worded letter of 
application runs a risk, Kuehn says, because the west German stereotype is that 
easterners lack a work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is discrimination," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her callers are often unsure how to describe themselves in terms suitably 
glowing and self-promoting for the tastes of a western personnel office. In the 
old East, after all, no one boasted about being "ambitious," or a 
"self-starter." Even the word "career" had negative connotations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see that some people are trying to avoid using certain words, like 
'career,' because they have difficulties with the values connected with them," 
says Kuehn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are unable to use them in a neutral way." 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have Resume-Speak pretty well down, where to send off your 
application? To the personnel director, of course, but the eastern term for 
"personnel" is Kader -- a word that sounds, dangerously, as if it has something 
to do with Marxist cadres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, that word now has a negative odor," says Kuehn. She advises her callers 
to write to the Personalchef . 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehn says she got the idea of a language hot line in 1991, when she went to a 
linguists' conference in the former West Germany and discovered that, on that 
side of the country, there were phone services in place to help secretaries, 
students and others with grammar and style problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I should start one in the east, because people here need it so much 
more," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four years since the east and the west united, Kuehn says, she has seen 
the linguistic gap start to narrow, but this is almost always because 
easterners are adopting western words. 
</P>
<P>
 But here and there, Kuehn and her colleagues are also spotting signs that 
easterners are resisting the western linguistic Anschluss , and reviving their 
own unique words. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasional shop window in the east now carries a sign saying "WtB," an 
abbreviation for the eastern term for "general store": a signal that 
made-in-the-east products are for sale inside. Many easterners now make special 
efforts to seek out locally produced goods, just for the sake of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it's not an organized effort, there is definitely a kind of protest 
going on, on the part of some people," says Kuehn. "I see it expressed mainly 
in letters to the newspapers. People will say things like, 'I will never use 
this stupid western word cash. I will always say Bargeld .' "

NATIONAL AGENDA; PITCHING AN IMAGE; BATTERED NICARAGUA PLAYS HOST TO THE WORLD, 
HOPING THAT BASEBALL WILL BURNISH ITS REPUTATION AFTER 15 YEARS OF POLITICAL 
VIOLENCE AND HARDSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There were no television cameras or newspaper photographers in the bathrooms 
at Managua's Estadio Rigoberto Lopez Perez last week, which was probably a good 
thing. Nevertheless, if you ask Yadira Soza and the rest of the women assigned 
to keep the stadium clean for the 32nd World Baseball Championships, a 
well-kept bathroom just might be what Nicaragua needs to get back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The reputation of a country was at bat here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in charge of keeping the stadium sanitary to leave a good image with 
those who have come here to Nicaragua, especially those from the 15 visiting 
countries," Soza said. "I'm proud that we could put on the tournament here." 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years of war, drought, strikes, rising crime and recurring political 
violence, polishing Nicaragua's tarnished international image is probably too 
great a task for Soza and her small crew alone. But many here were hopeful that 
a clean, well-run tournament -- with sanitary restrooms -- would mark the 
country's first step toward mainline respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people here are in favor of the tournament," said Edgard 
Rodriguez, sports editor of the daily newspaper El Nuevo Diario. "They feel the 
importance of the world championships to project a different image of Nicaragua 
-- that this is not a country of war and that we have nice things too." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the tournament's official slogan, "Friendlier Nicaragua," which was 
stamped on posters, banners and T-shirts all over the country, had been chosen 
with an eye to a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a hospitable people," emphasizes Carlos Garcia, who organized the 
tournament. "We aren't a country in which we are always fighting one another. 
The country is not bad like they say." 
</P>
<P>
 And what better vehicle to send the message than the World Baseball 
Championships, which are not to be confused with the World Series but 
nevertheless brought to Managua 16 international teams including the 
high-ranked Cubans, Americans, Japanese and the host Nicaragua squad -- all 
Olympic caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has been king here since the early decades of this century, as it has 
been elsewhere in Central America and the Caribbean, where American power and 
influence prevailed. Teams travel from city to city, bringing the game and some 
relief to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most optimistic boosters of the tournament -- the first major sporting 
event to be held in Nicaragua in two decades -- believe the event can do more 
than just improve the country's international image. They're hoping it will 
lift Nicaragua's badly bruised national ego and sagging economy as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people haven't had much to be happy about, and I think this will help get 
their mind off their problems," Cleveland Indian pitcher Dennis Martinez, one 
of five Nicaraguans to play in the U.S. major leagues, told The Times. "It can 
do so much for everyone's spirits. I think it's going to be really great for 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez starred for the Nicaraguan team in 1972, the last time the world 
championships were held in Managua. In the first round of that tournament, 
Nicaragua's Julio Juarez shut out Cuba, 2-0, in what is still remembered as one 
of Nicaragua's greatest sporting triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of great things that have happened to me in this game, 
but that was one of the greatest moments I've ever had," Martinez said. "(That) 
was as important as anything that has ever happened here. The whole country 
celebrated." 
</P>
<P>
 But the celebration didn't last long. Less than three weeks after the 
tournament concluded, a series of massive earthquakes leveled Managua, killing 
10,000. Widespread government corruption in the quake's aftermath helped 
ferment civic unrest, eventually leading to the bloody insurrection that 
dethroned dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was just the first of many blows Nicaraguans would have to endure. In 
short order, the country was ravaged by five-digit inflation, a hurricane, a 
volcanic eruption, a tidal wave, several droughts and an eight-year war against 
the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments that a baseball tournament can overcome all that gain credence from 
the fact that the event has already had a beneficial effect on the economy by 
arresting the downward spiral of employment, if only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great opportunity for me, even if it lasts just 12 days," said 
Soza, who supports a family of five with the $8 a day she earns cleaning the 
stadium bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Soza, who hadn't worked for two years, is among the estimated 80% of 
Nicaraguans without steady work. She joined a line that stretched for more than 
five blocks to get the job, waiting hours to be interviewed for one of 500 
positions created by the tournament. Those who made the initial cut were 
invited back for subsequent interviews over the next two months for openings as 
ticket takers, ball boys, vendors and janitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, the tournament is good because the people -- me, for 
example -- benefit," said Luisa Cordero, who works 14 hours a day at the 
stadium selling popcorn. "And afterward, we have experience to go look for 
other work. Without the tournament, I'd just be sitting in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has embraced the tournament, however. Shortly before the first 
pitch was thrown, a small bomb was detonated near one of the stadium's light 
towers. The explosion caused little damage, but police announced they had 
uncovered a plan to disrupt the games. As a result, the already tight security 
was stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed guards were posted at the stadium around the clock, and police 
protection, which had already been assigned to the U.S. and Cuban teams, was 
extended to the other teams in the tournament. In all, about 1,200 members of 
Nicaragua's 6,000-person police force were made available to tournament 
organizers at a cost of nearly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Such expenditures are at the heart of most opposition to the tournament. 
Garcia, the event's chief coordinator, estimated the cost of the games at $3.5 
million -- a significant outlay in a country with a national budget of $500 
million and an external debt of $10 billion, the largest per-capita debt in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the tournament's expenses were paid through corporate 
sponsorships, the government has been sharply criticized in some circles for 
allowing the games to proceed. Editorial cartoons have lampooned President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro as paying more attention to baseball than to the 
country's economy and, shortly before Chamorro presided over the tournament's 
elaborate opening ceremonies, radio commentator Fernando Calderon Villanueva 
wondered what there was to celebrate in a country where "80,000 families live 
in hunger." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight the stadium will be full of happiness," he said, "while the typical 
peasant house will be full of misery." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the newly renovated 25,000-seat stadium was rarely more than a 
quarter filled during the tournament. Ticket prices, which ranged from $2 to 
$10, were beyond the reach of most Nicaraguans, whose average monthly salary is 
less than $80. In the regional capitals of Leon, Masaya and Granada, where 
other first-round games were played, stadium workers and police officers 
typically outnumbered fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicaraguans love baseball, but in this way (with stadiums nearly empty) we 
feel the economic situation in the country," said journalist Ada Luz Monterrey. 
"I think (the organizers) should decide if this is a business or an event 
dedicated to the people of the country, who have earned it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field there was little controversy -- and even less surprise -- as the 
powerful Cuban team rolled to its fifth consecutive world championship. The 
original Big Red Machine, widely believed to be the best amateur baseball team 
ever assembled, has not lost an international tournament game of any kind in 
110 tries, stretching back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday night's final, Cuba beat South Korea 6 to 1. Japan placed third, 
Nicaragua fourth and the United States lost in the quarter-finals. 
</P>
<P>
 But those were just the scores on the field. It might be years before the real 
results of the tournament are known. "Someday, Nicaragua is going to be 
better," offered one taxi driver. "This could be the first step."

MEDIA; ALL THE NEWS THAT PAYS THEY PRINT; SOME RUSSIAN JOURNALISTS ARE 
ACCEPTING BRIBES TO ADVERTISE PRODUCTS OR ADVANCE POLITICIANS. THEY SAY IT IS 
THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Something very peculiar is happening in the Russian media. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll be watching the evening news, and suddenly, somewhere between squibs on 
the Cabinet meeting and Bosnia, a glowing report appears on how BMWs at a 
certain Moscow dealership are selling like hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you'll be reading a major national newspaper and come across an article 
whose only point seems to be lavish praise for a certain commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
 This, to cop a Russian phrase always delivered in sinister tones, is not a 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Russian media's dirty little secret that in the last year or two it 
has become common practice for poorly paid journalists and financially 
struggling media companies to accept money not only for advertising but for 
reports passed off as legitimate news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know newspapers where for $300 they'll publish a nice story on your firm or 
something bad about your competitor," said Pavel Gutiontov, head of the Russian 
Journalists Union. "They'll write on the front page that the chief prosecutor 
of Russia is interested in your competitor and demanding documents from him." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sad joke played on Russian readers and viewers. So soon after the 
media finally got free of the Communist Party's stranglehold, they fell into 
such dire financial straits that reporters began to sell out en masse to the 
country's new business people, bankers and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 If Soviet journalists once were vulnerable to party pressure, the new Russian 
press must fight the temptations that come with earning $200 or $300 a month in 
a country where many prices are higher than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale of the sellout is difficult to determine. Reporters tend to keep 
quiet about the money they get on the side, and it is nearly impossible to 
prove that an article was inspired by an under-the-table fee. But it has 
reached the point where Russian reporters, asked about it, shrug knowingly and 
say, "Everybody does it."  
</P>
<P>
 "There can't be an island in society. Corruption is everywhere, and it can't 
be absent in journalism," said Boris Pilyatskin, foreign advertising chief at 
the daily Izvestia. "I open newspapers and sometimes, just because we're 
acquaintances, I know a person got $500 or $1,000 for a story." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Journalists Union's new code of ethics, drawn up only this summer, 
warns twice that journalists should not take money from anyone but their 
bosses. "The very combination of journalism and advertising activities is 
considered ethically impermissible," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the audience is made up of very different sorts from the would-be 
Woodwards and Bernsteins who have populated American journalism since the two 
reporters broke the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are Russian journalists?" asked Mikhail Gurtovoy, formerly a top 
investigative reporter and now head of the independent International Center for 
Research of Political and Business Ethics. "They're people who used to write on 
the orders of the party. They're used to having a master who pays for 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Gurtovoy recalled the privileges he enjoyed from the Communist regime as a 
Pravda reporter -- dacha, car and prestige -- and the clout he wielded as an 
agent of the party, when every shortcoming he revealed would be promptly 
corrected. The ethics were clear too, he said, recounting the tale of a 
journalist who accepted a cut-rate mink hat from the manager of a fur factory 
he wrote about and was ignominiously kicked out of the party and ostracized.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were ethics, but when there was a call from the Central Committee of 
the party, the ethics fell away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurtovoy sees reporters who sell out largely as those who cannot deal with the 
loss of their former position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put yourself in the place of a journalist," he said. "He's used to being 
privileged, his wife is used to being better dressed, to the prestige -- and 
now who is he? No one. He comes to some organization and says he's from 
Izvestia and they say: 'So what? Hit the street.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The new Russian journalism enjoyed a real heyday in 1989-91, when the engines 
of glasnost powered revolutionary democratic change. But its fortunes changed  
</P>
<P>
 abruptly in 1992, when newly freed prices sent paper and other costs soaring, 
and the Communist Party no longer provided subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suddenly dispossessed and completely lost journalists, who were already 
disposed to take bribes, and the (rich businessmen known as) 'new Russians' who 
were ready to give them finally embraced one another," wrote free-lance 
journalist Oleg Pshenichny in the English-language Moscow Times. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has received more than a dozen offers to write positive stories 
about films, computer firms and politicians. Like other journalists, he 
complained, he must face an ugly set of choices: work honestly but lack the 
money to feed his children, moonlight for foreign media or take bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 And even working for the Western media has its corrupt side. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Artyom Borovik, editor of the popular monthly Sovershenno Sekretno (Top 
Secret), which specializes in investigations.  
</P>
<P>
 Borovik dispatched one of his top reporters to look into what promised to 
become a sensation -- the tale of a retired KGB officer who had taken part 
years earlier in an operation to harm then-renegade author Alexander I. 
Solzhenitsyn by planting a suitcase full of radioactive material near him. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Top Secret could get the story into print, it broke elsewhere -- in 
a British newspaper, a Spanish newspaper and even on Russian television, which 
cited the Western sources. The reporter, Borovik said, made no bones about 
having sold his story to the foreign newspapers, even though he had worked on 
it for Top Secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Artyom, you'd be able to offer me maybe $100. They paid me $4,000,' 
" Borovik recalled. In the end, Top Secret reprimanded the reporter and docked 
his salary but did not fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 Borovik said he and other editors also "look through their fingers" at 
made-to-order articles, because they do not want to force out their best 
journalists. Eventually, he believes, all this will pass -- though not without 
a trace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a means of surviving," he said. "When the market stabilizes, and an 
editor can pay as much as is needed for correspondents to maintain a normal 
level of life, this will disappear, but it may remain as a bad habit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, it demoralizes the world of journalism," he added. "A 
correspondent looks at any theme through the (prism) of money, and if he 
understands something won't bring in money or fame -- but mainly money -- he 
won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It does more than demoralize, believes Mikhail Berger, chief of Izvestia's 
economics department and one of the most vocal opponents of this Russian twist 
on checkbook journalism.  
</P>
<P>
 "These people undermine our authority with the public and abuse the trust of 
the readers," he said. "Also, they're robbing their colleagues, because the 
$500 they get for a story means the paper won't get a $2,000 ad," revenue that 
could have gone toward salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Made-to-order reports serve mainly businesses these days, but before 
December's elections for Parliament, demand soared for hidden political 
propaganda.

STRUGGLING TO RECOVER AFTER A TOP LEADER WAS ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY ORDERING 
THE MURDER OF A RIVAL.

 The crime was hideous yet not unprecedented in a country that has specialized 
in dispatching its leaders in hails of machine-gun fire, car bombs, explosive 
letters and other examples of the annihilative arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dead of night, three men in military fatigues climbed up to the 
fifth-floor apartment of Dany Chamoun, a prominent Christian political leader. 
As Chamoun wrestled with one of them on the floor, his 7-year-old son ran to 
Chamoun's briefcase and pulled out a gun. His father's attacker cut the boy 
down with a bullet in the head. His 5-year-old brother, screaming, "No, no, 
no!," was shot in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamoun's German wife was hit 10 times in the chest and stomach. And Chamoun, 
one of the most important Maronite Christian political figures left in Lebanon 
after Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's flight to exile in France a week earlier, 
collapsed and died with 15 bullets in him. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming on the heels of Syria's ouster of Aoun, the maverick former army 
commander who holed up for months in Christian East Beirut against both Syrian 
and rival Christian forces, the Chamoun murder on Oct. 21, 1990, seemed another 
notch in Syria's belt of domination around Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lebanese authorities, after investigating the case for nearly four years 
and interrogating one member of the assassination team, have concluded it was 
not a Muslim hit squad but rival Christian leader Samir Geagea who was 
responsible. Moreover, the government has accused Geagea of masterminding the 
bombing of a Maronite Christian church in Zouk, north of Beirut, Feb. 27, a 
bloody attack that killed 11, injured 50 others and brought to peacetime 
Lebanon a disturbing echo of 16 years of a civil war that most thought had 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Geagea's arrest this spring has removed from the scene the most influential 
Christian political figure remaining in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has left the Maronite Christian community that for decades dominated 
Lebanese political life in a state of frustration and disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Christians have fled the country since Geagea's arrest, adding to 
an exodus over the past five years that has further diminished the minority's 
representation in Lebanon. Although Christians are well outnumbered by Muslims 
(as much as 2 to 1, by some estimates), they still hold the presidency and half 
the Cabinet seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, most Christians are completely disillusioned," said Christian 
political analyst Paul Salem. "Most feel they have lost the war. Lebanon is 
dominated by the Muslims and by the Syrians. They believe the Christians of the 
East are finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure of where to turn, some of the Christian leaders have staked their 
political fortunes on calling for Lebanese resistance against Syrian 
domination. But not all. 
</P>
<P>
 While the most prominent leaders -- Aoun, former president Amin Gemayel, 
National Bloc party leader Raymond Edde and Chamoun's son Dori -- continue to 
harangue from exile in France against the presence of 35,000 Syrian troops in 
Lebanon, a number of key Christian leaders still in Beirut have, in the wake of 
Geagea's arrest, quietly begun making contacts with Syrian officials in 
Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 An unprecedented visit by Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir to 
Damascus may not be far away, pro-Syrian newspapers have reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true that we must reorient ourselves. We have been passing through more 
severe periods than ever before, and yet instead of being united all as 
Christians, every one of us is criticizing the other," said George Saadeh, head 
of the Falangist Party, the largest Christian political organization, and a 
bitter rival of Geagea. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, we must start to make relations within the Christian community. Then a 
good Lebanese-Lebanese relation, and after that we will discuss about the 
outside, with Syria," Saadeh said. "The Lebanese are in three parts now: One 
part is with the Syrians, and whatever Syria says, they will accept it. The 
other part is against the Syrians, no matter what. And the third part, which is 
the part where we are, say if things are good with Syria, we say OK, and if it 
isn't good, we will oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of pragmatic talk is a far cry from only four years ago when Aoun, 
barricaded in the presidential palace at Baabda, railed against Syria until the 
day Syrian tanks literally blew him out of his hiding place and into refuge at 
the French Embassy. (Aoun was later granted exile in France in exchange for 
five years of political silence -- which is nearing its end.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Geagea, 42, a bitter enemy of Aoun who brought war to relatively unscathed 
Christian East Beirut when the two Christian leaders' militias began slugging 
it out, carried on long after Aoun retreated to his elegant chateau outside 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the Lebanese Forces, a disarmed militia that had acted as a 
political party in the aftermath of the war, Geagea endorsed but never fully 
reconciled himself to the 1989 agreement reached in Taif, Saudi Arabia, which 
set the stage for ending political sectarianism in Lebanon and ended decades of 
Christian political domination. 
</P>
<P>
 His call for a federalist system that would allow Christians to have their own 
enclave -- safe from what some Christians viewed as growing "Islamization" -- 
was seen by the government as a front for a more radical plan to consolidate 
his power and establish a breakaway Christian ministate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing at the church in Zouk was said by the government to be an attempt 
on Geagea's part to create panic in the Christian community and enough 
instability to rekindle the war and demand international protection for a 
breakaway Christian ministate. 
</P>
<P>
 His indictment in the Chamoun killings, based in part on interrogations of 
members of Geagea's security apparatus, alleges that his Lebanese Forces 
continued to maintain secret weapons stashes and were aided in carrying out 
their activities by the Israeli secret service. 
</P>
<P>
 Geagea and others charged, many of whom are in exile, have denied any 
involvement in the bombing or the Chamoun family murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian strongman, who had dined at the home of Sunni Muslim Prime 
Minister Rafik Hariri only days before his arrest, accused the government as he 
was being led off to prison of "wanting to muzzle every opposition voice." 
</P>
<P>
 A Lebanese Forces official and Geagea confidant, who asked not to be 
identified, said Geagea's arrest represents the political failure to guarantee 
Lebanese Christians even those rights granted to them under the Taif agreement, 
including guarantees for an end to Syria's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem of Dr. Geagea is not a problem of crime, it's not a problem of 
security, it's not a problem of arms, it's not a problem of militia," the 
official said. "The problem of Dr. Geagea is a political problem consisting of 
the fact that Dr. Geagea and other Christian leaders oppose the way of 
implementing (Taif), especially the problems of individual liberty and common 
liberty." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Geagea is being punished for speaking out about lack of Christian 
political representation in Lebanon. Though half of the 30-member Cabinet is 
Christian, about 10 to 12 of them are allied with the Muslims. A Christian 
boycott of the 1992 parliamentary elections left Lebanon's most important 
Christian political factions unrepresented. Maronite Christian Elias Hrawi is 
president, but his powers under the Taif agreement are very few. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is we want a real political life, we want democracy, we want 
liberty, and we have none of this," the Geagea confidant said. "And Dr. Geagea 
was the man who talked about this. He was the only Christian leader in the 
opposition who had a party, who had a media, who could act. Politically, he is 
dangerous for the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet political analysts here say it is the Christians themselves who have been 
their own undoing, first with the war in East Beirut launched by Aoun and 
Geagea, later by the elections boycott and the assassinations and feuding that 
have destroyed some of their most important political groups. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, many say, the demise of Geagea may actually pave the way for new 
Christian leadership to develop that may be more healthy for the community and 
the country.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; CHINA IS NOW THE WILD EAST FOR MANY TRAVELERS; HIGHWAY 
ROBBERY, PROSTITUTION AND CROOKED COPS ARE MORE COMMON AS TOTALITARIAN CONTROL 
FADES FAST. 
</P>

<P>
 On a recent trip here in China's deep south, the American found himself in a 
taxi traveling at night between Guangzhou and the Shenzhen Special Economic 
Zone on the border with Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant seafood restaurants, lit up like Las Vegas casinos, lined the route. In 
the shadows between the neon islands moved tides of slumping migrant laborers 
who had come south to get rich, traveling by foot at night to avoid the 
overbearing heat and humidity of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 It should have been a routine trip of 100 miles in the fast, imported Japanese 
car. But the taxi driver, a handsome hipster in his early 30s who chain-smoked 
Marlboros and tapped his gloved fingers on the steering wheel to the pulsing 
beat of a Hong Kong rock station, had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 His young girlfriend, sitting beside him, lacked the appropriate papers to get 
through the police checkpoint outside Shenzhen, which requires special work 
documents for Chinese citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign guest had already refused the girlfriend's company, offered for a 
price. So there was no chance getting her through the checkpoint as the special 
friend of the gweilo , local slang for foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: The girlfriend went in the trunk. Once clear of the checkpoint, the 
driver pulled over and let her out. After a few straightening tugs on her 
miniskirt and pats to shake the dust, she was back in the front seat, smiling 
conspiratorially. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel in China used to be a staged and choreographed affair. Foreign 
visitors, especially official guests and journalists, were kept to rigid 
agendas featuring visits to model factories, model schools and model families. 
Official escorts dogged every step and monitored every bite in dreary 
restaurants "approved for foreign guests." 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. Today's China can be a wild ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic "opening up" of China initiated by 90-year-old leader Deng 
Xiaoping brought in waves of foreign visitors, both business people and 
tourists, making it virtually impossible for the government to track their 
activities. The virtual elimination of the local work permit system in most 
urban areas has created a huge, floating population of as many as 100 million 
Chinese migrants, mostly from the impoverished interior. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a country, once the paradigm of totalitarian control, where 
almost anything goes. "I call it Dodge City," said one American journalist, who 
on a recent trip to Sichuan province was shocked to see the body of a laborer 
on the roadside attracting scant notice. When he brought it to the attention of 
his taxi driver, the man shrugged. "He has no family here," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not yet the wild China of the late 18th Century -- when pirates ruled 
the rivers, and gangs of secret-society bandits sometimes led by women, 
terrorized the land. But in just the past few years, travel here has become 
increasing adventurous and, in some cases, dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to the Chinese northeast, in Jilin province along the border with 
North Korea, two American journalists and several South Korean businessmen 
found themselves guests of a narcotics cop nicknamed "Nobody" -- shorthand for 
"Nobody messes with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had a reputation as a tough guy, the burly cop was attempting to 
be a cordial ideal host for his foreign guests.  
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of beer, served in champagne glasses, and fresh fruit and 
dried squid as they watched the floor show at a funky '30s-era nightclub at the 
White Mountain Hotel. Female singers wearing slinky sequined gowns belted North 
Korean love songs as young men in tuxedos did Fred Astaire dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to make sure his guests were completely happy, the cop made a quick phone 
call. Ten minutes later, attractive female escorts sidled up to the table, one 
for each American guest, courtesy of the local P.D. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Tibetan area of Qinghai province in far western China -- an area known 
for the practice of mystical Tantric rites -- an American traveler witnessed a 
local photo studio engaging in a thriving trade in pornographic movies. They 
were being rented by young Tibetan priests. 
</P>
<P>
 In Qingdao, the picturesque former German treaty port on the Yellow Sea, a 
visitor spent the evening in the company of waterfront petty criminals running 
a small-scale protection racket. Up the coast in the beach town of Yantai, he 
entered a casino supposedly for "foreigners only." But most of the expensive 
imported cars parked outside bore military license plates, and the big winner 
of the night was a local official, peering down at the crap table over a stack 
of 1,000 yuan chips (about $114). 
</P>
<P>
 By American standards, China remains a fairly safe place to travel. In its 
latest travel advisory, the U.S. State Department states that "China has a low 
crime rate; however, crime has increased in the past few years, principally in 
the major cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents of road crime are increasingly common. In June, a truck transporting 
movie equipment from Beijing to Sichuan, where a Warner Bros. company was 
making a film, was hijacked, its drivers beaten with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most serious recent incident, 24 Taiwanese touring by boat in Zhejiang 
province were murdered by robbers who stole their valuables, forced the 
passengers and crew below deck and set the boat on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shenzhen and other important economic centers, prostitution is rampant and 
little attempt is made to hide it. The ranks of prostitutes also include some 
foreigners, mainly Russian women favored by rich Chinese businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of foreign prostitutes is small, the general knowledge of 
their existence has made travel a hell for many unaccompanied young foreign 
women. An American graduate student with several years of experience in China 
recounted a recent nightmare experience in Guangdong province: 
</P>
<P>
 "I checked into what looked like a good Chinese hotel. There were several 
leering men hanging around in the lobby. As soon as I got to my room, the phone 
began to ring, men offering to come up and visit me -- asking how much I 
wanted. I complained to the management, but it went on like that all night." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who last came here in the early 1980s, just as the country was 
coming out of its shell after the horrors of the Great Proletarian Cultural 
Revolution, travel in this bold new China can be a shocking experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the books published in the flush of that opening period featured 
anecdotes about railroad attendants who followed tourists to faraway cities to 
return ballpoint pens. 
</P>
<P>
 The innocence of those days is gone, and the visitor today is more likely to 
get a different picture of China than those who came only a few years ago.

 The thrones of England: Jean Desmond of Rancho Palos Verdes says her family 
recently held a reunion that drew relatives from all over the nation, as well 
as from overseas. "The members of the British contingent all took home 
souvenirs -- cushioned toilet seats from Sears," she said. "They don't have 
them in England. We don't appreciate the luxuries we have here. I'd love to 
have seen the faces of the customs officers in London."

along a racetrack program noting that a horse named Caughtinthehay has

 List of the day: Fans of Oscar Levant (1906-1972) will be delighted by the 
wealth of caustic one-liners recounted in "A Talent for Genius," the new 
biography of the concert pianist, actor, author and -- yes, it's true -- L.A. 
talk-show host. Some samples of the Levant wit from authors Sam Kashner and 
Nancy Schoenberger: 
</P>
<P>
 * On why he was so confident about being hired by Channel 9 or Channel 5 after 
Channel 13 fired him: "They'll take anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 * On his role in the film biography of George Gershwin, "Rhapsody in Blue": "I 
played an unsympathetic part -- myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * On Liz Taylor: "Always a bride, never a bridesmaid."  
</P>
<P>
 * On Hollywood: "Strip the phony tinsel off Hollywood and you'll find the real 
tinsel underneath." 
</P>
<P>
 * On a famous cowboy actor: "John Wayne? He's too subtle for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * On Joe DiMaggio's divorce from Marilyn Monroe: "No man can excel at two 
national pastimes." 
</P>
<P>
 * On extramarital affairs: "I could never have a mistress because I couldn't 
bear to tell the story of my life all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 * On breaking a sponsor's "unbreakable" radio by throwing it across the room 
during a live TV commercial: "Why should everything be unbreakable, anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 * On his looks: "When I was young I looked like Al Capone, but I lacked his 
compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 After he left Channel 13, by the way, Levant moved his show to Channel 9.

 Janis Joplin wouldn't understand: Brett Stone of L.A. received a phone call 
from some fellow Angelenos who were at Woodstock '94. "They were in seventh 
heaven," he said, "because they had found somebody out there who had a solar 
battery recharger." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? To power their cellular phone, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 They told Stone that they were relieved to know they could "talk as much as 
they want. They can leave the phone on because like, you know, wow, we have 
someone who can charge batteries. And the guy wasn't charging for charging."

AL MARTINEZ: DAYS OF FIRE AND CLOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sweltering day in old L.A. The radio says it's 120 in Burbank and it feels 
almost that hot along the ocean. The beaches are jammed and so is Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Saturday and I'm on my way to the Malibu Wildfire Preparedness Fair. The 
timing is perfect. It was in just this kind of weather that the murderous 
flames of autumn burned through the mountains last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of their devastation lingers. The greening of the slopes and the 
thickening of the underbrush haven't yet obscured the bare and blackened 
branches of the laurel sumacs, reaching like claws to the cloudless heavens. 
God needs more time. 
</P>
<P>
 These are nervous days for canyon-dwellers. Not all the chaparral burned in 
'93, and the brush that remains is as dry as a witch's bones. Firetrucks patrol 
and arson-watchers are on the alert. Everyone listens for the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this heat, all this danger and no baseball," a fireman says to me as I 
walk toward the fairgrounds at the Malibu Civic Center. "But at least there are 
no Santa Anas either. Those damned winds. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds of the wind linger in memory like the cry of a child in distress. I 
remember them as I look to the dry slopes and recall a vision of flames burning 
toward our house. I can still smell the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Snatches of conversation come to me at the fair. "I saw the firestorm and ran. 
. . ." "The brush behind the house suddenly caught fire. . . ." "The house was 
burning and we. . . ." I approach the woman whose house had burned. "It was 
surreal," she says, "like a night in hell," and wanders off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu fair mixes disaster with conviviality. A clown in a red fright wig 
entertains a cluster of children while he teaches them safety. "What do you 
never do in a fire?" he asks. The lesson he's taught comes back in a lyrical 
chorus of voices: "Never hide in the closet," they say. The clown nods in 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something for everyone at the fair: a cheese pizza for $2, a disaster 
relief trailer for $110,000. You can buy a gasoline pump or an air mask or 
fire-retardant tarps or a rooftop sprinkler system activated from afar with a 
phone call. Or you can just sit, sip a Diet Coke and watch a remote-controlled 
plastic fire hydrant roll through the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat grows more oppressive in the lengthening afternoon, like a shroud 
drawn over the dead. On a lawn in front of the city library, the demonstration 
of a water tank and pump system turns into a cooling shower for the kids who 
run through it. But even their cries of delight are muted beneath the 
sweltering shroud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Touch me and it might cool down." The offer comes from a paunchy, bearded man 
wearing a top hat and dressed in black. He stands at a booth that advertises 
him as "the flue doctor." His name is Daniel Drake and he's a chimney sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend born in the Middle Ages has it that good luck comes with the touch of a 
chimney sweep. I don't believe in luck, but I shake his hand just in case. "You 
never can tell," he says, laughing, "it might rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake has been a sweep for a dozen years. His father was one before him. When 
he cleans chimneys, he wears the traditional top hat and tails, like Dick Van 
Dyke in "Mary Poppins." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people mistake me for a burglar," he says, amused. "But what 
burglar would be up on a roof in top hat and tails in this kind of heat?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The high, thin wail of a siren creases the distance. I look around. Movement 
has ceased at the booths and at the concession stands. Everyone listens in a 
still-life of uneasy anticipation. The siren grows louder then dies. Movement 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 I spot Allen Emerson sitting at a table, taking it all in. A former actor and 
restaurateur, he's been patrolling the Santa Monicas for 11 years as team 
leader of the Topanga Arson Watch. His own Disaster Preparedness Fair is coming 
Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson is looking toward the mountains in the distance, which still bear 
dusky traces of last year's wildfires. He is thinking about the flames of 
autumn and about the incendiary energy stored in the dead foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could happen again," he says, mopping his brow. "There's a time bomb out 
there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As I leave, someone in a Smokey Bear costume passes by, dying in the heat. The 
clown rides a golf cart around and waves at some children. The lady whose house 
burned sits alone, thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The air is no cooler now than when I arrived. The interior of my car is a 
steam bath. I remember what the fireman said. All this heat and danger and no 
baseball. I drive off thinking about rain and a cold beer.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; WHOEVER WINS MUST SHARE POWER; ENOUGH DISSENTING VOTES 
WILL BE CAST SUNDAY TO DEPRIVE ANY WINNER OF A MANDATE. A DEMOCRATIC 
RECONCILIATION IS CRITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist and longtime 
critic of the PRI and the Salinas government. He hosted the first meetings of 
Grupo San Angel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grupo San Angel, the 70 or so reformers from across Mexico's political 
spectrum, felt from the outset that the country's real problems would start to 
emerge only after next Sunday's election, and only then could the country's 
democratic transition begin. So far, the group's main achievement since its 
inception in early June lies perhaps in its contribution to laying out a 
post-electoral agenda that attempts to go beyond the mistrust that has become 
pervasive in the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the presidential election will probably receive around 40% of 
the vote in a three-way race with no run-off. At least one of the two losers 
will almost certainly question the fairness of the process; the armed groups in 
Chiapas and elsewhere in the country will do the same. Moreover, all of this 
will occur in a country lacking a democratic electoral tradition and deeply 
divided over just about every imaginable issue. Hence the question of 
governability: Who will govern the nation under these circumstances, and how 
will it be governed? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, according to the group, lies in the the winner of the election 
making a commitment to assemble a government of national concord, whose 
composition and platform would truly reflect the exceptional conditions Mexico 
finds itself in today. That government's program should stress two basic goals: 
profound, substantive political reform, and the type of social reform that a 
country with Mexico's gaping inequalities is clamoring for. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, what the group is saying is that whoever wins the election, the 
actual political outcome should be pretty much the same. As Carlos Fuentes, a 
founding member of the group, put it, Mexico might end up with a lousy 
president but a good government doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 On all of these points, Grupo San Angel agrees. On a more specific blueprint 
for the future, and what actually will happen on Sunday, it is appropriate to 
comment on some of the ideas that are shared by many members of the group but 
are not yet part of the consensus it has built. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the group believe that Mexico's next government should rest on a 
power-sharing agreement that includes the three main political parties, the 
business sector, the intellectual community, the non-governmental organizations 
and the grass-roots social movement that has sprung up in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to this move toward democratization, the government should 
implement a program that sets forth those economic and social policies that 
must remain more or less the same, albeit with significant adjustments, such as 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, trade liberalization, privatization 
and foreign investment, and those that must change: Raise taxes on the wealthy, 
improve income distribution, increase social spending and expenditures on 
infrastructure, and make it possible for workers to fight equitably for higher 
wages. This scheme should last only for a limited period, perhaps a couple of 
years, after which Mexican democracy would begin to take root and truly 
significant, competitive, free and fair elections could be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the essential problem facing Mexico today, in the opinion of 
many, though not all of Grupo San Angel's members. Matters were left unattended 
for too long in Mexico; today, the country is too polarized, too mistrustful 
and too bereft of any democratic tradition to solve all of its problems with 
this one election. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a rapidly growing risk that, whatever the purported cleanliness of 
the vote, a huge number of Mexicans, undoubtedly a majority, will not only vote 
against the ruling PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party); they also will not 
accept its permanence in power, no matter how cleanly PRI candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo may have won (if he does). This is true, of course, of the armed groups 
and the supporters of opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, but it also 
holds for the conservative National Action Party electorate. For these millions 
of disaffected yet highly politicized and even militant Mexicans, after the 
PRIstas' 65 years in power, it is time for them to go.  
</P>
<P>
 It has never been clear to Mexicans that the best way, let alone the only way, 
to change governments or political systems is through the ballot box. Mostly, 
things here have changed through other means. If Sunday's election delivers a 
victor, and a margin of victory, that only frustrates and deeply disappoints 
millions, some of them will follow another road: the one the Zapatistas chose 
last Jan. 1. The sense of frustration and despair that could quickly engulf 
this Mexico if the PRI wins, cleanly or not, could be devastating for the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what Grupo San Angel is deeply concerned about: helping our country to 
find a way out from an extremely complicated situation.

ADDRESS POLLUTION AT EL TORO BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times has had front-page articles on the El Toro base land swap proposal 
by the Irvine Co. At the same time, there is a conspicuous omission in those 
articles about the question of ground and air pollution on the base as detailed 
in a number of official reports.It appears to be a consensus that such 
pollution as exists at El Toro cannot be cleaned up until the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the contention of Dr. Lee B. Reichman, as president of the American 
Lung Assn., (in 1992) that 60,000 Americans die prematurely each year from 
exposure to particles alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a team of scientists writing in Science (February, 1992), the 
prestigious scientific journal of the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science, claim that "attaining air pollution standards may save 1,600 lives a 
year in the region" (of the South Coast Air Basin of California). 
</P>
<P>
 Official reports indicate that there are at least 24 different areas of the El 
Toro base that require cleanup of pollution hazardous to health -- surely 
before the base is put into active operation. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe it is premature to plan for utilization of the base, with multiple 
costly studies, until this severe problem of pollution is addressed properly 
and scientifically.

WHO'S THE BIGOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a free society, Christians have the same right to advocate laws reflecting 
their moral code as everyone else. It is not bigotry to have a set of moral 
beliefs, nor is it a "phobia." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy being used against American Christians is to accuse them of the 
sins being committed by the accusers. The intolerant liberal accuses the 
Christian of being intolerant and while speaking hate against the Christian, 
accuses Christians of being hateful. The liberal accuses Christians of trying 
to force their beliefs on others while trying to force their beliefs on the 
public with their allies in the press parroting their politically correct 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairness? Discrimination? Convenient words when pointing at someone outside 
their secular orthodoxy. Well, double standards and hypocrisy are accepted 
tactics in politics. The real issue is that in America anyone -- religious or 
non-religious -- can run for office and all of them are free to promote the 
values they believe in.

MORNING BRIEFING: BAD SHOWING LANDS AMERICA IN THE ROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that American golfers have been swept in the four majors in the same year 
for the first time, there's only one thing left to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Find someone to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost some of our aggressiveness toward winning golf tournaments," 
Arnold Palmer told the Dallas Morning News. "That doesn't mean we don't have a 
lot of good players. It doesn't mean we're not capable. But we've lost an 
aggressiveness the foreign contingent maintains. We go through periods where 
we're happy with the way it's going and don't maintain the vigil to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches? 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreigners aren't victims of the over-discipline and coddling of American 
college golf," said Frank Hannigan, ABC-TV analyst and former U.S. Golf Assn. 
executive director. "If Lee Trevino had gone to college, somebody would have 
imposed discipline and the genius would have been taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add golf: Robert Floyd, the 18-year-old son of tour veteran Raymond Floyd, on 
the advantages of having a famous father:  
</P>
<P>
 "You get to meet a lot of people. You get to play with pro golfers and learn 
from them year-round. I've played with Fred Couples, Greg Norman, as well as 
Michael Jordan and Dan Marino." 
</P>
<P>
 So who did he learn the most from? 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Jordan," said the younger Floyd, who will attend Florida on a golf 
scholarship in the fall. "He knows so much about competitiveness and being 
competitive and just giving 100% no matter what you're doing. Even during just 
a friendly game, you realize how competitive he is. It just shows a desire to 
win no matter what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What distinction does Andres Guibert, a reserve center with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves last season, hold? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Water(s): When last seen in a game that meant something, Denver defensive 
coordinator Charlie Waters was praying on the sidelines in the fourth quarter 
of the regular-season finale against the Raiders. With good reason: the Broncos 
were in the process of wasting a 30-13 halftime lead en route to an overtime 
loss that knocked them out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting a little tiring hearing about that," Waters told Newsday. "The 
one thing I learned about that game is that I learned I need to pray for the 
team in private, not in public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Striking back: This baseball strike thing has been them vs. us all along, so 
Kroger's figures it works both ways. Just look at the full-page ad the grocery 
store chain took out the other day in Atlanta. Prices on one side for players 
and owners, "prices for the rest of us" on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: Players and owners can buy whole fryers for $159 a pound with a 
limit of four "with $2,000,000 additional purchase," while the general public 
can get the same fryer for 49 cents, with a limit of four with a $10 additional 
purchase. A four-roll package of bath tissue goes for $249 for baseball 
personnel and 79 cents for others. A six-pack of a soft drink could be picked 
up for a mere $379 in baseball money or $1.19 for others. 
</P>
<P>
 No word on whether I.D. is required. 
</P>

 Trivia answer: He is the first Cuban to play in the NBA. Guibert was a member 
of the national team before defecting to Puerto Rico.

RECORD 112,376 SEE OILERS BOG DOWN COWBOYS; PRO FOOTBALL: MEXICO CITY CROWD 
BECOMES LARGEST EVER TO SEE AN NFL GAME AS HOUSTON WINS, 6-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys won the crowd. The Houston Oilers won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers outscored the Super Bowl champions, 6-0, Monday night in Azteca 
Stadium, more historic for its soccer, concerts and last year a boxing match 
featuring national hero Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer field was converted to American football for one night of fan 
celebration with an NFL-record crowd of 112,376 cheering almost everything, 
even the pregame warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, who won a fight in the stadium in 1993, participated in the pregame 
coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's Darryl Lewis, whose interception halted a Cowboy threat in the first 
half, said it was "great to play in front of a crowd this big. I think some of 
them started off the game as Cowboy fans, but I think we are turning some of 
them to our side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican people have made us feel very welcome. I feel like Michael 
Jackson with all their attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, who have beaten the Cowboys in 11 of the last 12 meetings -- 
including two in the regular season -- used field goals of 37 and 26 yards by 
Al Del Greco for a 6-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Carlson guided the Oilers to the Cowboy 20, highlighted by a 19-yard pass 
to Pat Coleman, before Del Greco's 37-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oiler defense, second in the NFL in forced turnovers last season, set up 
the second field goal after a diving interception by Lewis at the Houston 17. 
The Oilers drove to the Dallas nine, from which Del Greco made his second kick. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little excitement in the second half until the closing minutes, when 
Dallas' Shelby Hill took a pass to the Oiler two before fumbling when hit by 
Houston's Emanuel Martin. Tony Brown recovered for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rain before the game didn't dampen the crowd's excitement but did keep 
Emmitt Smith, the NFL's three-time rushing leader, from playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was scheduled for his first exhibition action, but the soggy field kept 
him on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Coach (Barry) Switzer after warm-ups and we both felt that the 
footing wasn't going to be good enough," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really disappointed because I was really looking forward to playing 
some." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman left after one drive in the second quarter and 
was replaced by Rodney Peete, who drove the Cowboys to a missed 21-yard field 
goal attempt by Richie Cunningham in the final seconds of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman was three of seven for 12 yards with one interception. Carlson played 
the first half and was 11 of 16 for 120 yards and was sacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ibarra, 30, an architect, attended the game with a Cowboys star painted 
on his face and wearing a Cowboys headband. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear NAFTA, I wish that is stood for North American Football Trade 
Agreement," he said. "We've been waiting years for this."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BOYKIN INVOLVED IN AUTO ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim police said Monday they expect to cite starting strong safety Deral 
Boykin for speeding and driving with a suspended license after he wrecked his 
1991 BMW in a one-car accident early Monday morning in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin said he lost control of his car when he hit a wet spot on Canyon Road 
and the car jumped the curb and hit a tree. Boykin, who said he was wearing his 
seat belt, was treated for a sore neck and was hospitalized overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin's license was under suspension for a previous accident in Ohio. He 
admitted Monday that he was exceeding the 45 m.p.h. speed limit on Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said no alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident, and that Boykin 
was alone in the car at the time of the accident. He was followed by tailback 
Jerome Bettis, his Ram teammate and roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very blessed that I'm alive today," Boykin said. "That's the closest I've 
ever been to death, and I don't want to go back. You don't have to worry about 
me speeding anymore, hitting any wet spots or any trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin expects to return to practice today or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was the second setback in a week for Boykin, who received six 
stitches and a tetanus shot after he was hit on the head with his own helmet by 
offensive lineman Darryl Ashmore during a fight in practice.

 Coach Chuck Knox would not acknowledge obvious changes in the offensive line 
and defense two days after a 28-10 exhibition loss to New England. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll announce the starters just before the opener (Sept. 4) against Arizona," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Wayne Gandy worked with the first string at left tackle, in place of 
veteran Clarence Jones. Gandy, a first-round draft pick from Auburn, accounted 
for four penalties in the New England game for lining up too far off the line 
of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Newberry, last year's starting left guard, worked for the first time as 
the backup center to Bern Brostek. Second-year player Chuck Belin appears to be 
ready to take over the starting left guard position from Newberry, who has a 
guaranteed contract worth $800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Raider Joe Kelly also appears to have locked up the starting left 
outside linebacker position. He started in place of Henry Rolling on Saturday 
and practiced with the first string Monday. 
</P>

 The Rams trimmed their roster to 77 players when they released cornerback 
Mitchell Price and safety David Wilson. Price played in five games with the 
Rams and two with Cincinnati last season. MIKE REILLEY

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The refreshing topic of the day is ice -- as in ice hockey. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What was it, about two weeks ago when the New York Rangers skated around the 
Madison Square Garden rink with the hardware? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Well, it is less than three weeks until the Kings begin practice at the 
Iceoplex in North Hills in the San Fernando Valley on Sept. 4. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose is eager to prove that their drive to the Stanley Cup 
finals two years ago was no fluke and their failure to reach the playoffs last 
year was a fluke. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I want us to be a much tougher club this season," Melrose said. "I want other 
teams to worry about coming into the Forum. That didn't happen last season." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the Kings traded Luc Robitaille to the Pittsburgh Penguins 
for Rick Tocchet and a second-round draft choice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The fan reaction has been negative. Popular opinion is that the Kings should 
have gotten more for one of the NHL's most prolific scorers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the fans see Rick, they'll realize that we got an awful lot for Luc," 
Melrose said. "He's a great, great player. He's been on two Stanley Cup winners 
and his numbers are huge. He's the kind of power forward that every team 
needs." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky's critics said that his fingerprints were found all over the 
trade. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that the first player we discussed Tocchet with was Marty 
McSorley," Melrose said. "That's because Marty played three months with him in 
Pittsburgh. Wayne is taking a lot of undue heat. Two people made the deal -- 
Sam (General Manager Sam McMaster) and I." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings might be able to flex more muscle now, but the question is whether 
they will have enough firepower. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We lost last year not because we couldn't score goals, but because we weren't 
strong enough," Melrose said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "A healthy Tocchet -- and the doctors tell us that he is 100% -- can score 
more than 40 goals. Don't forget that we're getting Tony Granato back full 
time. He can score. So can Robert Lang, and he's improving. Jari Kurri has 
another two or three outstanding years left. I'm not worried about us putting 
the puck in the net." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the newcomers Melrose likes is the general manager, McMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam is a very hard worker and well organized," Melrose said. "He knows young 
players. We can't afford to make the same mistakes we have in the past in the 
draft." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The consensus was that the Kings got a bargain when they were able to select 
goaltender Jamie Storr with the seventh pick overall. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Storr will be given a chance to make the roster. But he won't sit around as a 
seldom-used backup to Kelly Hrudey. He will stay with the big club only if he 
is good enough to play 20 to 25 games. Otherwise, he will spend the season 
gaining experience in the minors. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Melrose looks back at his first two years of coaching in the NHL and says, 
"I'm a strong believer in the old saying, 'Losing feels worse than winning 
feels good.' " . . .  
</P>

 How strong is the Pacific 10 Conference at quarterback? Under the passing 
efficiency system installed by the NCAA in 1979, Jim Plunkett, in his Heisman 
Trophy-winning season of 1970 at Stanford, would have finished behind Dave Barr 
of California, Rob Johnson of USC, Danny O'Neil of Oregon and Steve Stenstrom 
of Stanford last year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those four and all the other starting quarterbacks in the league are back this 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson on practicing in the heat: "It's a little scary. 
That's why we have rules that you can't put on pads the first few days." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Biggest upset over the weekend was the defeat of 3-year-old star filly Lakeway 
by Heavenly Prize at Saratoga, the track known as the graveyard of champions. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Former junior lightweight champion Rafael (Bazooka) Limon, best remembered for 
his three great fights with Bobby Chacon, has been licensed by the State 
Athletic Commission. Record books list him at 40, but he claims he lied about 
his age and he is really 35. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Before Lennox Lewis gets around to Riddick Bowe, he will defend his World 
Boxing Council title against lightly regarded Oliver McCall in London on Sept. 
24. Lewis-Bowe is being planned for December or March in Las Vegas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the annual Zurich meet, which is Wednesday, often is the best in 
track and field. The promoter has a $2-million talent budget. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Name Game: A member of the German women's team that won the 400-meter relay in 
the European Championships was Bettina Zipp.

 Although it appeared Ashmore failed to adequately protect quarterback Chris 
Miller on his first two passing attempts Saturday night, a review of the game 
on videotape demonstrated that Ashmore clearly was not at fault. In fact, after 
studying Ashmore's work, Knox had praise for the team's starting right tackle.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; JAEGER TEES OFF ON STEELER PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the Kings' Marty McSorley and his illegal stick? 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Jeff Jaeger and his illegal tee. 
</P>
<P>
 Except the McSorley incident was in an NHL Stanley Cup final and Jaeger's was 
in an NFL exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 And McSorley was found guilty, whereas Jaeger proved to be innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider kicker thinks the whole thing was petty. 
</P>
<P>
 It began before Saturday night's exhibition between the Raiders and the 
Steelers at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Under new NFL rules, kicking tees must be no higher than one inch, rather than 
three as in the past, cutting down on the ball's hang time. Jaeger has been 
using a tee that looks different from most but has been approved by the league 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher, however, protested after watching Jaeger warm 
up. When the Raider kicker trotted out for his first kickoff, he was told he 
could not use the tee. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's been approved," he protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Get another one, he was told by an official. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jaeger did. 
</P>
<P>
 But between the first and second quarters, Jaeger explained his position to 
another official and got permission to go back to his original tee. 
</P>
<P>
 When he brought it out again, Cowher protested again, claiming the tee Jaeger 
had shown between quarters was not the one he was now using. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at it," Jaeger said. "Is this a different tee? It has the same tape on 
it. It's the same one. I only have one tee." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Cowher lost the argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked them to pull out a ruler and no one seemed to have a ruler," said the 
Steeler coach of his discussion with the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Jaeger was still shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps me see the ball better," he said of the tee. "I have better 
perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, we're talking about a kicking tee. The whole thing seemed pretty 
petty to me. If other teams couldn't use it, that would be one thing. But if 
it's such a big advantage, (the Steelers) ought to use it themselves." 
</P>

 For the second time this summer, defensive back Lester Ridley has been cut. 
Ridley, signed as a free agent, was released in mid-July, re-signed last week, 
then cut again Monday, this time to make room for defensive back R.J. Kors, a 
three-year veteran, also back for the second time this summer. . . . Defensive 
back Lionel Washington, defensive lineman Jerry Ball and offensive lineman 
Bruce Wilkerson sat out practice Monday because of injuries . . . Defensive 
lineman Chester McGlockton returned to practice, the leg he bruised a week ago 
having sufficiently healed. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; JETS' RECEIVER MOORE HAS BROKEN 
WRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Jets, already thin at wide receiver, have lost one of their two 
experienced starters, Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets disclosed that Moore broke his wrist in Saturday's victory over 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I have to wait a week and let it calm down," Moore said, 
"They'll take the cast off in 10 days and see what it looks like." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Miami Dolphin safety Louis Oliver, still recovering from a broken foot 
he suffered last November, could miss the first six games for the Cincinnati 
Bengals. Oliver underwent surgery in April to repair the stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Cecil, a Pro Bowl safety with Green Bay two years ago and a seven-figure 
player last season, was released by the Arizona Cardinals. . . . Kicker Scott 
Sisson was one of seven players cut by the New England Patriots. . . . Wide 
receiver Reggie Rembert was released by Cincinnati along with Patrick Robinson, 
who set a team record last year with 43 punt returns.

THOUSAND OAKS WINS WORLD SERIES OPENER; LITTLE LEAGUE: STRAUSER, HOWARD TEAM UP 
TO PITCH ONE-HITTER IN 3-0 VICTORY OVER PUERTO RICO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Strauser and Kevin Howard combined on a one-hitter Monday to spark the 
Thousand Oaks 13-year-old all-stars to a 3-0 victory over defending champion 
Puerto Rico in the opening game of the Little League World Series in Taylor, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will face Jacksonville (Fla.) in a second-round game of the 
eight-team, double-elimination tournament Wednesday.Jacksonville defeated 
Vestal (N.Y.), 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard (6-1), who came on in relief with none out and a runner on first in the 
fourth, gave up one hit, struck out six and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauser did not give up a hit and struck out two, but he walked six. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks (15-1) scored a run in the first, fifth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the first, Matt Rogers singled and stole second. After Howard 
walked, Wes Munyon singled in Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was hit by a pitch with one out in the fifth before moving to third on 
a double by Munyon and scoring on an error by Puerto Rico (9-2). Rogers walked 
to lead off the seventh. Pinch-runner Manuel Apodaca stole second, went to 
third on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Howard.

TUBER, NORTHRIDGE SPARKLE; LITTLE LEAGUE: PITCHER THROWS ONE-HITTER IN 12-0 
VICTORY OVER ALBUQUERQUE IN WESTERN REGIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The soft but clean single into right field hit by Nick Matthews of 
Albuquerque, N.M., ended foggy journeys down memory lane taken by several 
longtime officials Monday night at the Little League Western Regional 
Tournament for 11- and 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Never, claimed Frank Yost, Frenchy Lebel and Tom Boyle, had a perfect game 
been pitched since regional play began here in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on the mound stood Peter Tuber of Northridge, mowing down New 
Mexico hitters neatly and in order. Thirteen up, thirteen down until Matthews 
singled with one out in the fifth inning of the six-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials could simmer down and go back to watching the game along with 
the rest of the 4,500 fans. They saw Northridge defeat Albuquerque, 12-0, and 
advance to the semifinals against Taylorsville, Utah, tonight at 8. Northridge 
(15-0) and Utah are the only unbeaten teams in regional play. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the second of the tournament for Tuber, who defeated Alaska on 
Friday by allowing one hit in five innings. After his one-hitter against 
Albuquerque (8-1), Tuber has allowed two hits in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about (the perfect game) after the third inning," said Tuber, 
a 5-foot-9 right-hander. "I wasn't too happy with the hit, I hung a curve. But 
I loved my defense. They made all the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Most noteworthy was a sliding catch of a line drive by right fielder Spencer 
Gordon to open the fourth. Shortstop Matt Fisher and third baseman Gregg Wallis 
also turned in nice plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tuber clearly is no small potatoes, the title of staff ace remains 
with Nathaniel Dunlap, who will get his first regional start tonight. Manager 
Larry Baca has used Dunlap as a one-inning closer in two games, but he said it 
is time to let the 5-11 right-hander work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see that we don't take a step down with our other pitchers," Baca 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis and Fisher each doubled and singled to lead Northridge's 14-hit attack.

VAN BERG KEEPS MATCH RACE ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For a few long hours Monday morning, Del Mar's first match race in 56 years 
looked as if it might be no match at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Harper, the thoroughbred track's president, had learned that Cool Air, who 
was to race against Soviet Problem on Sunday, had been scratched by trainer 
Gary Jones because of an infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeted in the racing office by trainer Jack Van Berg, Harper replied glumly, 
"I was doing pretty well this morning until I found out Cool Air was out of our 
race Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck," Van Berg said, "I've got a filly who can beat either one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Berg's Mamselle Bebette, owned by actor John Forsythe, will replace Cool 
Air in the $100,000 match to be run between the fifth and sixth races Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to ship the filly to New York," Van Berg said. "But I talked to 
Mr. Forsythe and we decided to go for this race instead. My filly hasn't run 
against Soviet Problem, I don't think, but she's beaten Cool Air." 
</P>
<P>
 The match race, the first at Del Mar since Seabiscuit beat Ligaroti in 1938, 
will match 4-year-old fillies over 5 1/2 furlongs on turf. Soviet Problem will 
be ridden by Chris McCarron, but Van Berg is undecided about a jockey for 
Mamselle Bebette. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty to pick from," he said. "We only need two." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he grew concerned about Cool Air after a sub-par five-furlong 
workout Saturday. An examination revealed an infection that can only be 
properly treated with penicillin. Procaine, a banned drug, is one of 
penicillin's ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamselle Bebette appears to have the credentials to be a legitimate substitute 
against Soviet Problem. She has earned $411,175 in 19 starts, seven of them 
victories, to Cool Air's $448,503 in 26 starts, 12 of them victories. She was a 
four-time stakes winner last winter at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, owned by Harris Farms and Donald Valpredo, worked six furlongs 
on the turf Monday morning in 1:14 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out at 7 a.m. that the other horse wasn't going to compete," trainer 
Greg Gilchrist said. "But it was a work-day anyway, so we worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 El Trenzador held off Shandon Lake to win the $51,000 turf feature at Del Mar 
by a half-length over favored Shandon Lake. Ridden by Gary Stevens, El 
Trenzador covered 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 4/5 and paid $8.80, $4 and $2.80. The 
win was the fourth in 23 lifetime starts for El Trenzador and was worth 
$28,050, increasing the 6-year-old Argentine-bred gelding's career earnings to 
$186,677. 
</P>
<P>
 The first- and second-place finishers in last Sunday's La Jolla Handicap will 
use that race as a steppingstone to the Sept. 5 Del Mar Derby. Marvin's Faith, 
the upset winner, will run in the Derby, according to trainer Ian Jory, as will 
Unfinished Symph, beaten in a near dead heat. Oceanside Stakes winners Powis 
Castle and Saltgrass are also expected in the Derby.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; TROJANS' LOSS BECOMES LANCERS' GAIN

 Saladin McCullough, the star prep tailback from Pasadena Muir who never made 
it into USC last season, is suited up at Pasadena City College, ready to play 
tailback for coach Dennis Gossard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nation's most intensely recruited running backs after his 1992 Muir 
season, McCullough signed with USC but became involved in a controversy over 
his Scholastic Aptitude Test score.McCullough passed the exam, but his score 
was challenged by the Educational Testing Service, which oversees the test.  
</P>
<P>
 McCullough lost his arbitration case. He then took the American College 
Testing exam, but did not meet the NCAA qualifying score. He must now earn a 
junior college AA degree to play NCAA football.  
</P>
<P>
 McCullough, 5-feet-11 and 190 pounds, scored 36 touchdowns his senior season 
at Muir.

 Keith Burns, who coaches the Trojan safeties, on freshman Grant Pearsall from 
Villa Park High: "Right now, he's covering deep as well as anyone we have. He's 
a natural center fielder. Right now, we're very happy with where he is, but 
we'll want to see how he tackles later this week." 
</P>

<P>
 The mid-90s temperatures at USC's practice field have triggered fond memories 
of the Trojans' training camps of recent summers at UC Irvine, where 
temperatures were 10 to 12 degrees cooler.  
</P>
<P>
 After 10 summers in Irvine, USC has moved its preseason camp back to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally didn't like being down there," said Don Lindsey, USC's defensive 
coordinator, of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, football camps are supposed to be hot. It's just part of the 
discipline of football. When I see our defensive backs bent over in the heat, 
tired and hot . . . and have to cover Ken Grace and then Keyshawn Johnson 30 
and 40 yards downfield on back-to-back plays, I learn something about them."

 Firms to Produce Air-Conditioning Systems: Caterpillar Inc. will jointly 
produce large-capacity systems powered by natural gas-fueled engines with York 
International Corp. The systems will be used to cool industrial and commercial 
buildings as efficiently but more economically than most electric systems, said 
Richard Thompson, Caterpillar vice president. York is a maker of heating, 
ventilating, air-conditioning and refrigeration products. The new units will be 
made at Caterpillar's Lafayette, Ind., plant and at York's plants in York, Pa., 
and San Antonio.

 Stocks and bonds treaded water Monday as investors hesitated ahead of a 
possible interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average bobbed near unchanged levels during most of 
the day until a selling wave dragged it under slightly toward the close. The 
blue chip indicator finished at 3,760.29, down 8.42 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Program selling also depressed broader indicators. The New York Stock Exchange 
composite index dipped 0.25 points to 254.52 and Standard & Poor's 500 fell 
0.71 points to 461.23. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing and declining stocks were separated by only a 
handful of stocks on the Big Board where the trading pace slowed to 223.57 
million shares from 249.28 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks also marked time through the uneventful session. The Nasdaq 
composite index inched up 1.28 points to 732.89. 
</P>
<P>
 The listless session on Wall Street reflected an unwillingness by market 
professionals to act aggressively on the day before what could be a crucial 
meeting of the Federal Reserve Board's policy-setting panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields were unchanged at 7.50% in extremely slow 
trading as players made minor portfolio adjustments ahead of an expected rate 
hike by the Fed. However, the 30-year bond's price fell 3/32 point, or 94 cents 
per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 But yields on Treasury bills, which stand to be hurt most by a hike in 
short-term rates, shot higher as traders braced for the Fed's expected decision 
to push up a key rate at its policy-making meeting today. Other maturities were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices headed lower after the Fed reported that output at the nation's 
factories, mines and utilities advanced 0.2% in July, slightly higher than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The report added to sentiment that economic growth, despite slowing in recent 
months, remained somewhat stronger than Fed policy-makers feel comfortable 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists and market strategists believe the Fed will decide to push up 
its target for the federal funds rate -- what banks charge each other on 
overnight loans -- by a quarter of percentage point to 4.75%, to ease economic 
growth and prevent inflationary pressures from building. 
</P>
<P>
 While the increase in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities 
was a bit stronger than estimated, the report was consistent with recent 
evidence suggesting that economic growth remains vigorous enough to induce the 
central bank to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Release of the industrial production figures incited a brief flurry of selling 
in the bond market, where modest price gains were temporarily replaced by 
modest losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late in the day, the selling had subsided and the price of the key 
30-year Treasury bond had mostly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Among stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Cyanamid fell 1 7/8 to 90 7/8. Suitor American Home Products said 
late in the day that it would raise its $95-a-share offer to $100 if Cyanamid 
agreed to a friendly transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 * A growing belief that efforts to change the nation's health care system are 
moving along slowly buoyed companies in the drug group, traders said. Merck 
gained 7/8 to 33 1/8, and Johnson & Johnson rose 7/8 to 49 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gensia rose 2 3/4 to 12 1/4 after an Alex. Brown analyst said completion of 
clinical trials for the firm's drug to treat heart attacks is positive, and a 
source said Hambrecht & Quist also had positive comments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Syntex rose 1/8 to 21 7/8 after attracting interest as Roche Holding denied 
speculation that it might scrap its $5.3-billion bid for Syntex. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell Atlantic fell 1 to 56 5/8 after announcing that it will eliminate 5,600 
jobs and revamp accounting methods in cost-cutting moves intended to make the 
telecommunications company more competitive. The measures will result in a 
$2.3-billion charge against third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kmart gained 1/4 to 17 1/8 after posting lower earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Viacom Class B shares were up 1/8 to 36 1/8. The stock was active as the 
multimedia and entertainment company reported quarterly results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover news stirred interest in one Amex-listed issue, Sundowner Offshore 
Services. The stock soared 2 5/8 to 16 5/8 in heavy trading after Nabors 
Industries said it has agreed to acquire Sundowner in a stock swap. Nabors was 
the volume leader on the Amex, rising 1/8 to 6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Featureless sessions on foreign markets failed to inspire much reaction at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed up 13.74 points at 2,651.5. Frankfurt's 
30-share DAX average ended up 14.16 points at 2,138.84, while Tokyo's 225-share 
Nikkei average ended down 37.50 points at 20,626.33. London's Financial Times 
100-share average fell 0.1 point to 3,142.2.

 Goodyear to Abandon Some Lines: The Akron, Ohio, company will stop making 
tires for lawn mowers, garden equipment and industrial and small highway 
trailers and will shift production to farm tires. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. 
said the specialty tires made at its Kelly-Springfield plant in Freeport, Ill., 
represent less than 2% of its replacement tire sales in the United States. The 
move will allow the company to concentrate on its core tire businesses and make 
better use of plant capacity, said Sam Gibara, executive vice president of 
Goodyear's North American region.

HOME BUYER BOND MEASURE TAKEN OFF BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wary of asking Californians to approve more bond measures, Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Monday signed legislation, approved only hours earlier by the Assembly, 
removing from the November ballot a $185-million bond measure designed to help 
first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Julie Bornstein (D-Palm Desert) pressed for the removal because 
she believed that voters would defeat the proposal, Proposition 182, just as 
they turned down a similar measure in a 1993 special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters' attention is distracted elsewhere," said Bornstein during a brief 
debate in the Assembly, which sent the proposal to Wilson on a 71-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor signed the legislation so it could be deleted from the voters 
pamphlet set to be printed late Monday or early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's actions were triggered by a special election in November in which 
voters defeated Proposition 173. That measure would have authorized the state 
to sell $185 million in housing bonds to provide mortgage insurance for low- 
and moderate-income first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was automatically reset to be placed back before voters in the statewide 
general election on Nov. 8, according to Melissa Warren, a spokeswoman for the 
secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the primary two months ago, the state's voters rejected all four bond 
measures on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said Monday's removal of Proposition 182 from the ballot was the first 
time in recent memory that the Legislature has acted to delete a measure set to 
go before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, an effort to remove a $1-billion rail bond act from the 
ballot was turned down Monday by the Senate on a 15-14 vote. Proponents needed 
27 votes in the 40-member upper house to delete Proposition 181 from the 
ballot. The measure was granted reconsideration, which means the issue could 
arise again before the Legislature adjourns Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd twist, Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Hanford), who authored the rail bond 
proposal, pushed for its removal, citing the state's dismal economic situation 
and the voters' unwillingness to support more bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Reardon, a Costa spokesman, said another reason the assemblyman wanted 
the measure removed is that the Legislature is discussing placing a $1-billion 
prison construction bond as well as education bonds on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief is that education and prisons are a higher priority than rail," 
Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Election year politics may have played a role in the vote on the rail measure 
by Costa, who is challenging rookie Sen. Philip Wyman (R-Tehachapi). While 
Costa pushed to remove his own rail proposal, Wyman, who opposes the measure, 
urged Senate colleagues to leave the proposal on the ballot.

LEGISLATORS PRAISE HART AS A 'GIANT' IN EDUCATION; POLITICS: THE STATE SENATOR, 
WHO HAS SERVED MUCH OF THE COUNTY FOR 20 YEARS, IS LAUDED FOR HIS ETHICAL 
STANDARDS. HE RETIRES IN DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State Sen. Gary K. Hart, for 20 years a legislator representing much of 
Ventura County, on Monday sat through yet another of the lengthy testimonials 
he's heard plenty of during his long tenure in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this time, the topic was Hart himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hourlong tribute, more than a dozen senators rose to honor Hart as they 
bid adieu to the 51-year-old politician who opted for retirement over a run for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Hart was recognized for his role as a leader in the field of 
education. "He's been a giant for years for his knowledge of education. The 
institution is going to sustain a great loss when he leaves," said Sen. 
Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland), comparing Hart to the democracy fighters of 
ancient Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's announcement last year that he would choose family life and a new 
career over another Senate term or a bid for state superintendent for public 
instruction came as a surprise to supporters and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart said Monday that he was ready for a change, and he found the prospect 
of another campaign -- and more time away from his three daughters and wife -- 
"debilitating." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years is a long time," he said in an interview. "It's easy to get 
burned out. It's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hart is silent about his future job possibilities after his term ends 
in December, he says he plans to remain in Sacramento, where his family put 
down roots some years ago. A former teacher and current chairman of the Senate 
Education Committee, Hart said he will probably wind up in the field of 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Several senators who took to their microphones Monday said they were 
disappointed that Hart bowed out of this year's race for state schools 
superintendent, a job being sought by Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser, 
Maureen DiMarco, and Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont). 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my candidate," said state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside). "I was 
ready to support him in any way I could. I was sorry he chose not to run." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In speeches both eloquent and verbose, senators expounded on the various 
qualities they saw in Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the Santa Barbara-based Democrat -- who last week won 
recognition for his integrity from the public watchdog group Common Cause -- 
has been revered as an ethical model by fellow senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) recalled that, "Once upon a 
time, he refused to schedule appointments with lobbyists . . . . He's been 
especially concerned about the integrity of the house and the propriety of the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Hart said, his biggest disappointment in two decades as a state 
lawmaker is the Legislature's failure to adopt meaningful campaign finance 
reform. He praised Lockyer for advancing a bill to provide public financing of 
campaigns as part of a package of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said that, in his view, the system to elect state legislators is flawed 
-- largely because campaigns have become so expensive. Consequently, too much 
time is spent raising money and not enough remains to adequately address 
California's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One result is that the state's mounting fiscal woes have yet to be confronted 
realistically by lawmakers who have found it more politically expedient to roll 
over California's debt, Hart noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next two years, some combination of tax increases and spending cuts 
may be needed, he said. "All I know is that there will be a lot of blood on the 
walls and it will be a difficult process." 
</P>
<P>
 The senators gave a rundown of Hart's legacy: author of higher education bond 
measures that freed up $2 billion in funding; architect of landmark education 
funding reform; backer of the charter school movement; champion of the 
environment, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) was among the realists as he noted that 
Hart's political philosophy at times leaned further left than did his 18th 
Senate District as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come from a district where you may have to cover up how liberal you are 
so that you can come back," said Dills, praising Hart's skill at striking a 
balance between his principles and the district's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which once stretched across Ventura County to include portions 
of the San Fernando Valley and Malibu, has been redrawn and now encompasses the 
cities of Ojai, Santa Paula and Ventura in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter registration in the 18th District, which also includes conservative 
portions of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, is 44% Republican and 
41% Democratic. Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), whom Hart endorses, 
is facing Republican Steve MacElvaine, a former San Luis Obispo County 
supervisor in a race to replace Hart in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks to the Senate, Hart expressed gratitude to voters who have 
returned him time and again to Sacramento: "I'm someone who has not always seen 
eye to eye with my constituents and I appreciate the leeway they gave me. I'm 
very fortunate to have had constituents so forgiving in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
 During the remaining 2 1/2 weeks of the regular legislative session, Hart is 
concentrating on salvaging the controversial CLAS test, a $26-million-a-year 
state investment spurred by his earlier legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System may fizzle out if current 
legislation by Hart to extend its life does not win approval of the Legislature 
and the governor's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's bill would attempt to clear up problems with scoring the tests, as well 
as smooth out other kinks in the program designed to move standardized testing 
away from multiple-choice and toward essay answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said he will carry on negotiations with Wilson's office during the next 
couple of weeks over changes the governor is seeking in the CLAS program.

SANTA CLARA DISTRICT SHORT ON CANDIDATES FOR THE BOARD; REPRESENTATION: IF THE 
LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE CAN'T COME UP WITH A SECOND PERSON WILLING TO SERVE, 
COUNTY OFFICIALS MAY HAVE TO STEP IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Little Red Schoolhouse on the outskirts of Santa Paula prides itself on an 
old-fashioned style of education. Kindergartners sit next to sixth-graders 
working out arithmetic problems or tapping on computers under the tutelage of 
two teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-room school, with its 38 students, is one of the few remaining 
frontier schools in California. Its small scale provides an intimate atmosphere 
missing from most public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tiny Santa Clara School District has found that its size is also a 
drawback. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the district's 106 voters has stepped forward to run for the three 
available seats on the board of education. And if no one can be coaxed into 
public service, the Little Red Schoolhouse alongside California 126 may fall 
under the control of county school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like 'suppose they had an election and nobody ran,' " said 
Georgia Dennehey, assistant administrator of the county elections office. 
</P>
<P>
 In every election, the Santa Clara district struggles to find enough people 
willing to serve, school officials said. But this is the first time that there 
aren't enough candidates to fill the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that everybody's lived here most of their lives," said Deann 
Hobson, the only candidate to file so far. "And everybody's served on the board 
already. It's like, 'I've already done it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If the election fails to attract at least one other candidate by the 5 p.m. 
Wednesday deadline, county school officials may have to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the incumbents on the three-member board, only Hobson is running for 
reelection. The other two -- Shirley A. Diamond and Jean Faught -- declined to 
seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the problem: The three-member board requires two trustees for a quorum. 
And without a quorum, says state Education Department attorney Roger Wolfertz, 
"they can't do any business." 
</P>
<P>
 The district would then face two possible scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Either the county superintendent of schools would take control of the district 
to manage its affairs, or the county Board of Education president, a position 
held by John McGarry, would appoint interim trustees to serve on the Santa 
Clara school board until permanent replacements are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson said she believes the area's ranch families take too much pride in 
their historic school to let it slip into county control. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will not happen," Hobson said. "When it comes time, somebody will step 
forward. If not, we'll drag them." 
</P>
<P>
 Built by frontier families 98 years ago, the bright-red Santa Clara 
schoolhouse still operates much as it did when it was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's high teacher-to-student ratio draws students from throughout the 
Santa Clara River valley -- half of the children are transfers from either the 
Santa Paula or Fillmore school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet parents of transfer students are not eligible to run for school board 
because they don't live in the district, Supt. Tamera McCracken said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of joke how we always tell the board members that if they want to get 
off the board, they have to get a replacement," McCracken said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diamond said board members take that responsibility seriously. She said 
she is so troubled that she has not found someone to take her place that she 
would be willing to be appointed to another term. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has only one three-hour meeting a month, and trustees generally put 
in another three to five hours a month researching school issues or doing 
related work, Diamond said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't really that much," she said.

SCHOOL'S EFFORT TO COVER COSTS DRAINS RESERVES; EDUCATION: THE COUNTY 
SUPERINTENDENT ASKS SIX DISTRICTS FOR BUDGET PROJECTIONS TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY 
WILL GET BACK IN BLACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Squeezed between stagnant state funding and rising costs, three-quarters of 
Ventura County's 20 school districts are spending more than they expect to take 
in this budget year, and six districts -- including the Conejo Valley and 
Ventura unified districts -- have dangerously low reserves, the county 
superintendent's office says. 
</P>
<P>
 The county agency has instructed the six districts with low reserves and high 
deficit spending to supply budget projections for the next two budget years, 
explaining how the districts plan to get back in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that, because of the level of their deficit spending, we would like 
to look at their budget projections for the future," said Kenneth H. Prosser, 
director of school business and advisory services for the county office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosser recently sent letters to the Conejo Valley Unified, Ventura Unified, 
Pleasant Valley Elementary, El Rio Elementary and Moorpark Unified school 
districts, asking for information on how they plan to stop the flow of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sent a letter to Oxnard School District, warning that the district's 
projections "show a level of deficit spending resulting in a 1.8% available 
reserve. . . . Failure to minimize deficit spending could jeopardize the future 
financial standing of the district." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Prosser elaborated on what he sees as a disturbing trend. "By 
no means are those districts facing insolvency," he said. "But insolvency could 
result if they continue to spend at the same level." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials across the county said they have labored to reduce expenses 
and hope to bolster reserves by spending less than budgeted for the upcoming 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been working very diligently to reduce our expenses," said Carmela 
Vignocchi, assistant superintendent of finance with Moorpark Unified. "And it's 
getting increasingly difficult to maintain our reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark schools have left vacant at least 10 administrative positions in the 
last four years, Vignocchi said. Yet, with this year's revenues nearly $1 
million short of expenses, the Moorpark district's reserve has dropped to 
2.44%. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education recommends that districts with fewer 
than 30,000 students -- which includes all districts in Ventura County -- keep 
a reserve of at least 3% of their total expenses. Districts can get in trouble 
when they allow reserves to drop below that figure and are unable to rebuild 
the nest egg, Prosser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "School districts in the last few years have tended to spend their reserve 
because it's the only way to maintain programs. Often they have been able to 
replace those reserves," Prosser said. "But regardless, we would like to see 
their future spending projections."  
</P>
<P>
 District officials say that, given state budget cuts in the last three years, 
they have to make ends meet with very little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because state funds have decreased, our deficit has gone up 11% to 12% 
compared to one-half percent three years ago," said Sarah Hart, assistant 
superintendent of business services at Conejo Valley Unified. "We understand 
that the state has significantly less tax revenues. We are not blaming them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the state Department of Education said more than half of 
California school districts are spending more than they are receiving in 
revenue. What's more, officials predict no increase in state funding any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most districts are deficit spending. They depend pretty much on the state for 
their income, and the state is not coming up with that money," said Janet 
Sterling, manager of the state education department's Office of School 
Financial Report. "It's just the state of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 If state revenues continue to be flat, Prosser said, schools throughout 
Ventura County will have to develop new ways to finance education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools don't have a lot of options, but they are trying to do everything 
they can to maintain important school programs," Prosser said. "They may make 
more cuts, look for grants or come up with new ways to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
 While state aid to schools has remained steady since 1991, inflation has 
contributed to an increase in costs. So districts have tried to come up with 
creative ways to reduce expenses while minimizing reductions in school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reductions in the classroom are the last thing we want to do," said Hart of 
Conejo Valley Unified. "We have made several cuts, mainly in administrative 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Conejo Valley Unified budget reductions have included a 3% salary 
cut for teachers, managers and supervisors; an increase in employees' health 
benefit deductible from $150 to $250, and the elimination of at least 10 
management and 30 support staff positions and 20 teaching assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Conejo Valley Unified in the 1993-94 school year began to charge 
parents $400 a year per student for bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, other districts, such as Oxnard Elementary, Ventura Unified and 
Moorpark Unified, have drastically reduced the number of management and support 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard School District projects a $2.3-million deficit in this year's 
budget, the highest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 13,000-student district's reserve is near the 3% recommended by 
the state, district officials predict that it will drop to less than 2% in the 
1995-96 budget year, which worries county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard School District officials said they hope to be able to save up to 
$600,000 during this school year by keeping a tight rein on spending. "We are 
closely monitoring our expenses and we feel that our budget is manageable," 
said Supt. Bernard Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get to the point in which we feel we are in jeopardy, we will have to 
make more drastic reductions," Korenstein said. "We just don't know where." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Ventura Unified, one of the largest districts in the county 
with 15,000 students, said they are surviving because of money saved after 
severe cuts imposed in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to use our savings to balance our current budget," said Georgeann 
Brown, director of budget and finance for Ventura Unified. "We are surviving at 
the same level of money we received in 1991-92. We hope by 1996-97 we will be 
able to get additional funds from the state."

FANS' BUDDING DILEMMA ENDS; ENTHUSIASTS MUST ENTER AFRICAN VIOLETS BY TODAY OR 
SHRINK FROM FAIR'S COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florence Naylor of Ventura owns about 400 miniature African violets. Her 
collection includes pink ones and purple ones, white ones and blue ones.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Shaver of Thousand Oaks tends a mere 100 of the plants, known for their 
deep green leaves and vibrantly hued blooms. Shaver's violets are distributed 
in stands and on windowsills in a spare bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the two of them, Naylor and Shaver probably possess enough plants to 
fill the Ventura County fair's entire African violet display. Despite months of 
plucking, pruning and fretting over their finicky plants, however, both women 
are wavering on whether they want to enter any violets in this year's fair 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just aren't blooming," said a frustrated Naylor, who has decided to 
enter only two of her beloved plants in this year's contest.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaver believes that none of her violets is beautiful enough to compete. 
Instead, she will donate about four or five plants for an exhibit booth, where 
her plant-growing reputation will not risk coming up short against those of 
green-thumbed colleagues. For African violet growers and other potted-plant 
enthusiasts -- specifically, owners of ferns, wax plants, ivy, begonias, 
orchids -- today is the deadline they've been anticipating since last year's 
fair ended. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m. today judges will pull out their note pads and begin the process 
that ends in blue ribbons for some, red and white ribbons for others -- and the 
embarrassment of not making the cut at all for a multitude of dedicated plant 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear of failure was so intense, in fact, for Scottie Dubay of Port 
Hueneme, that last year he refused to enter any of his violets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say, 'I'll show, I'll show,' but then I always back out at the last 
minute," he said. "My plants are like kids to me, and I don't want other people 
being critical of them. I'm critical enough of them myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubay, 32, figures he spends 50% to 60% of his free time with his violets, 
most of which are displayed in a living room bookshelf-type fixture. Over each 
shelf hangs a fluorescent light that provides African violets with the optimum 
growing environment. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Dubay hopes to muster up his resolve and enter "Sheer Heaven," one 
of his favorite plants, in the contest. It is a full-sized violet, with deeply 
pink blossoms and green leaves shot through the same pink color. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubay admires it so much he has made a "baby" of it from its cuttings -- so if 
he does enter it, he would not risk the health of his other plants by bringing 
Sheer Heaven back from the fair. "The fair is so open that (the violet) could 
end up bringing pests home," he explained, coddling the plant in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dubay has witnessed firsthand the destructive power of voracious bugs. This 
spring, Marla Henderson, his mentor in growing African violets, threw out all 
but 50 of her 400 beloved violets after an insect infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, 63, a retired bookkeeper and Ventura resident, is still recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really went through some buggy times earlier this year," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 A back injury prevents Henderson from getting out in the garden and digging, 
so the indoor plants give her the perfect outlet for her green thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fair looming on the horizon, Henderson has gone into overdrive in 
recent weeks. She selected her favorites in May, then blitzed them with a 
series of treatments designed to maximize their blooming potential.  
</P>
<P>
 Called "disbudding," the process involves changing the fertilizer brand, 
increasing the plants' "daylight" hours under fluorescent bulbs, and snipping 
off buds that blossom too early. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to really be on the ball when they start blooming early," she said. 
"I've been . . . praying a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, who belongs to both the Ventura County African Violet Society and 
the Thousand Oaks African Violet Society, started tending the blooming plants 
when a friend gave her some eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But many members of the county's two African violet clubs say they began their 
love affair with violets at the grocery store. According to African Violet 
Magazine, African violets are the most popular houseplants in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant traces its history to Africa's deep tropical jungles, where the 
flowers flourished in the low light. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the magazine, Europeans took interest in the violets in 1892, 
when Baron Walter von Saint Paul sent specimens of the plant home to his father 
in Germany. The baron was serving as imperial governor of East German Africa -- 
now Tanzania -- at the time. The transplanted vegetation landed in the Royal 
Botanical Gardens in Hanover, where it received its scientific name, 
Saintpaulia, in honor of the Saint Paul family. 
</P>
<P>
 Importers introduced African violets commercially in the United States in the 
late 1920s, according to the African Violet Magazine, which is published by the 
African Violet Society of America. The society was organized in 1946, the same 
year it held its first show, an Atlanta, Ga., convention that attracted about 
9,000 people from 11 states. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the two Ventura County clubs alone will in good years see their members 
submit up to 100 plants for the individual plant competition, said Ventura 
County club member Jean Shipley. There are also garden and educational exhibit 
competitions pitting the African violet clubs against each other as well as 
clubs organized around other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Naylor, who owns the 400 miniatures, hopes her two sufficiently budding 
violets stand up respectably to the tough competition. Nearly all the fair 
submissions come from violet society members. 
</P>
<P>
 By day a chemist for Clairol, Naylor has been a violet addict since the early 
days of her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she opened her car door on April 1, 1975 to find three pretty, 
blooming violet plants on her car seat, a gift from her new husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out as an April Fool's joke," she said, laughing. "But now, the 
joke's on him."

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; A PLACE TO USE 
DETECTIVE AND LISTENING SKILLS

 To Jerome Nilssen, the best volunteers are part compassionate listener and 
part detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best kind of volunteer is the one that knows how to listen and doesn't 
make assumptions about what people need," said Nilssen, the area director for 
Lutheran Social Services in the San Fernando Valley. "But, No. 2, they need to 
be the kind of person who is willing to do some detective work and won't settle 
on the obvious solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers for Lutheran Social Services, which runs an aid center out of a 
Lutheran church in Van Nuys, can count on working with people. Nilssen needs 
volunteers to help with initial client interviews of the poor and the homeless 
looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Nilssen said, the obvious answer to someone who says he needs 
food and can't pay the rent may seem to be to get a job, "But we need to be 
willing to ask questions that get closer to the heart of the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, with some digging the volunteer will find out what the real trouble, 
and the real need is, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutheran Social Services serves about 35,000 people a year. But because of the 
Northridge earthquake, that number has already hit 30,000. The agency provides 
food, clothing, housing vouchers, transitional housing, counseling, employment 
assistance and referrals to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good volunteer cares about the clients but doesn't have a need to do 
everything for the client," Nilssen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group gets no help from welfare programs and those who are meeting the 
community service requirements of a court sentence, but other volunteers can 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always use volunteers," Nilssen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lutheran Social Services is located at St. Andrews Lutheran Church, 15520 
Sherman Way, Van Nuys. To reach Nilssen call (818) 785-2114. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Civic Light Opera needs volunteer backstage assistance as stage 
crew members, curtain attendant and other jobs for the Sept. 8, 9, and 10 
evening performances of "The Pirates of Penzance" at Starlight Bowl. The work 
would also include technical and dress rehearsals preceding the show. For more 
information call (818) 380-3444. 
</P>
<P>
 The Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) is looking for volunteers 55 years 
or older to form an "Emergency Preparedness Corps" so they can help their 
neighbors during a disaster. Training will be given on the latest in 
earthquake, fire and flood preparedness. The seniors will then pass on that 
training to their neighbors. The training includes a basic session of three 
hours. More training is available if desired. For more information call (818) 
908-5070. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Shanti, an organization that helps those with AIDS, is looking for 
volunteers in the San Fernando Valley to help with community outreach and 
educational programs. The group also is starting a new five-week program that 
encourages safe sex by discussing in group sessions why unsafe practices are 
still going on. Volunteers would also help with seminars, workshops and support 
groups. L.A. Shanti provides all training. For more information call (213) 
962-8197 or (818) 908-8849 from the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ark Trust, a nonprofit animal protection organization in Sherman Oaks that 
works on a wide range of animal-rights issues, is looking for volunteers to 
handle general office work, filing, mailings, data entry. However, none of the 
work involves direct contact with animals, but rather help with advocacy on 
animal-related issues. For more information contact Kirsten Rosenberg at (818) 
786-9990. 
</P>
<P>
 Forester Haven, a nursing facility for 110 senior-citizen residents in Lopez 
Canyon, is looking for volunteers to help with activities such as calling 
bingo, going for walks with residents or teaching music or hobbies to 
residents. For more information contact the activities director, Dorothy Supri, 
at (818) 899-7422. 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AGENCY HELPS GUIDE MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS

 Jorge Corralejo understands the hardships that minorities must overcome to 
start their own businesses: He experienced them firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had problems raising funds and in marketing," said Corralejo, who started 
an equipment leasing business in Los Angeles 10 years ago. "But I learned some 
valuable lessons back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Corralejo is imparting his hard-earned knowledge to Ventura County's minority 
entrepreneurs at the Oxnard Minority Business Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit agency, which moved to Heritage Square in Oxnard two weeks ago, 
provides minority owned and operated companies throughout Ventura County with 
technical assistance in such areas as locating capital, putting together loan 
applications and writing business plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capital access is a major problem," Corralejo said. "Studies show that 
minority communities are greatly underserved. We work with them to try and get 
them business loans." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank's Barber Styling Shop in Camarillo is doing fine -- so well, in fact, 
that its owner, Hank Robles, wants to add a beauty shop, tanning salon and 
facial room to his operation. But Robles wants to proceed carefully, so he 
visited the center Monday for advice.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking to get more educated in bookkeeping and financial planning so I 
can expand my business," Robles said. "I want to make sure I don't throw away 
what I have." 
</P>
<P>
 George Baldonado, president of Oasis Technology in Camarillo, is looking to 
sell the company's customer service and tracking software to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 He met with Corralejo on Monday to discuss the plan and possible sources of 
capital.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving into larger procurements, and it's a whole different animal," 
said Baldonado, 42. "I thought it would be smart to take advantage of their 
services," he said of the development center. "We would have to hire a whole 
group of people to do what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 The center was founded eight years ago, and was formerly operated by the 
Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now run by the Century Freeway Affirmative Action Committee, an 
Inglewood-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone who goes through our doors is ready to run a business," said 
Corralejo, who has been providing assistance to minority entrepreneurs for 
seven years. "But we try to guide as many people as we can in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The center will hold an open house from 4 to 7 p.m. Aug. 31 at its offices, 
741 S. A St. in Oxnard. For information, call 385-6277. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MORE HOT WEATHER AND SMOG FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The oppressive summer heat in the east county continued to force Simi Valley 
and Thousand Oaks residents to seek relief in pools and air-conditioned homes 
Monday, and forecasters said the end of the sweltering weather is still several 
days away. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, where temperatures hit 97 degrees and air quality approachedan 
unhealthful level, city-run day camps canceled plans for more strenuous outdoor 
activities in favor of games that were either quiet or wet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dividing our time between the shade of the trees and the public pools," 
said Diana Riley, city recreation supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest concern has been the smog," she said. "Most of the children don't 
like the heat, but they are pretty accustomed to it by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high temperatures, county officials reported smog levels in Simi 
Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks were lower Monday than initially expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality for the inland part of the county was rated as moderate, not 
unhealthful, which county forecasters said was a welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually when you have a high pressure system like the one that's bringing us 
this heat, you expect it will act like a lid, and keep pollutants trapped in 
the area," said Gary Arcemont, a Ventura County Air Pollution Control District 
meteorologist. "But that isn't always the case, as we can see today." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the district is forecasting unhealthful air in Simi Valley today and 
possibly throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality in Thousand Oaks will be near the unhealthful level today, while 
it will remain moderate in the rest of the county, district meteorologists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today and Wednesday, temperatures in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are 
expected to remain in the 90s, while temperatures in Ojai and Fillmore were 
expected to hit 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal areas will remain cooler in the 70s and 80s, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooler breezes from over the Pacific Ocean are not expected to reach inland 
areas until the end of the week, said Curtiss Brack, forecaster with 
WeatherData Inc., which forecasts weather for The Times. MATTHEW MOSK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PSYCHIC FAIR WILL FEATURE READINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will have "A Cosmic Affair" this weekend -- a psychic fair offering 
readings by at least a dozen psychic readers and healers from a variety of 
disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Kathy Scott said her fairs are geared for "psychic virgins" and 
veterans and draw an average of 100 to 150 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who have always wanted to go to a reader it's very good, because 
they can come with a friend and see that there's nothing scary going on," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Readings offered will include Tarot cards, palmistry, astrology, psychometry, 
iridology, dream analysis, handwriting analysis, bioenergetic healing and 
"script channeling," in which the spirit guide gives the reader messages 
through her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Aura photography will be available Sunday only. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair runs from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the Hyatt 
Newporter, 1100 Jamboree Road.  
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $3, with reading prices ranging from $15 to $40, depending on the 
length of the reading.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL OKS TRAFFIC HUMPS FOR 3 STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to slow traffic in three Simi Valley neighborhoods, the City Council on 
Monday unanimously approved the installation of traffic humps on three city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete humps, which traffic engineers predict will slow traffic speeds 
by 5 to 10 m.p.h., will be placed on Delilah Street between Tracy and Sequoia 
avenues; on Justin Avenue between Cochran and Larch streets, and on Texas 
Avenue between Corpus Christi Avenue and Walnut Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pretty effective method of keeping speeds down in areas where the 
residents have perceived there to be problems," said Bill Golubics, city 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 300 miles of streets in the city, so we can't just rely on the 
police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golubics said the city began using traffic humps to slow traffic in the 
mid-1980s and has installed them in 18 locations to date. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain city approval for the traffic humps, two-thirds of residents in the 
neighborhood must have signed a petition requesting the improvement, and a city 
traffic study must show the humps are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilson, a resident of one of the neighborhoods involved, said there have 
been two accidents on his street, including one involving a child who was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just request that the city address this matter before someone gets 
killed," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all three cases discussed by the City Council Monday, the required number 
of signatures were gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 All three streets have speed limits of 25 m.p.h., but city studies show that 
average speeds on them are between 30 and 32 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The humps will be installed within four to eight weeks, Golubics said. MATTHEW 
MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOLS MAY ACQUIRE ENERGY-SAVING BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District hopes to receive up to 10 
energy-efficient school buses by participating in a statewide program that is 
demonstrating the new environmentally-friendly vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have recommended that the school board pay a consultant 
$3,300 to write a grant proposal to the California Energy Commission to get the 
new buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will vote on the expenditure at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The new buses would be a major boost for the school district's transportation 
fleet, which has deteriorated in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the school board approved spending $259,000 to purchase several 
badly needed vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, four school buses, seven maintenance vehicles and a delivery 
truck have been taken out of the fleet because they are beyond repair, a 
district report said. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Three Camarillo City Council members will face three political newcomers in 
the fall general election, while two Moorpark office holders will run 
unopposed, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday was the deadline to file nomination papers for the Nov. 8 election 
in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to late filings, however, it was not clear until Monday what the final 
list of candidates would be in those city races. 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, council members Charlotte Craven, Stan Daily and Ken Gose will 
square off against Richard Lundberg, an engineer; Jackie Mathis, executive 
director of an Oxnard defense contractor, and Robert Radnoti, director of 
quality management for Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis said he decided to enter the race because he believes he can use his 
managerial skills to help the city better plan for the future while reducing 
city operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city of Camarillo is ready for some new leadership," Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason and Councilmen Bernardo Perez and John 
Wozniak will not have to worry about campaigning this year. All are unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Planning Commissioner Michael Wesner pulled nomination papers, he did 
not file them by Friday's 5 p.m. deadline, said City Clerk Lillian Hare. CARLOS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW DEADLINE FOR FEE HIKE FEEDBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County ranchers and others around the country who oppose proposed 
increases in fees for grazing cattle on public lands can send written comments 
to the federal government through Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Forest Service extended the deadline to receive public comment on the 
proposed revisions that were published in the Federal Register last April. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions would double the fees that Ventura County ranchers pay for their 
livestock to graze on public lands in Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1997, fees would increase from $1.98 to $3.96 per "animal unit," defined as 
the grazing needs for a cow and her calf for one month. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was designed to force ranchers who use the land to pay a greater 
share of the costs of protecting sensitive wildlife habitats that their cattle 
might trample. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen Ventura County ranchers graze 700 head of cattle in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Frost, president of the Ventura County Cattlemen's Assn. said the rising 
costs of grazing may drive the ranchers out of the business or force them to 
find other lands to lease for grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Written comments should be sent to Rangeland Reform '94, P.O. Box 66300, 
Washington, D.C. 20035-6300. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; OFFICERS ARREST MAN, 29, AFTER 7-HOUR 
STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old Fillmore man who barricaded himself in his girlfriend's 
apartment and held 50 law enforcement officers at bay for more than seven hours 
was arrested Monday after officers distracted him with a noise-maker and rushed 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents from nearby homes and the tenants in the four-apartment 
building were evacuated while officers attempted to lure Jeffrey Lloyd from the 
Sespe Avenue home in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, who claimed to be armed, was treated at Ventura County Medical Center 
for self-inflicted wounds to his forearms before he was taken to Ventura County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd barricaded himself after officers attempted to arrest him on a warrant 
for allegedly failing to appear in court last week on a drunk driving charge. 
He threatened to kill anyone who tried to take him to jail, Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, who was alone at his girlfriend's apartment, refused to open the door 
to deputies at 7:45 a.m., said Sgt. James R. Southwick. Although he claimed to 
be armed, deputies discovered later that his weapons were kitchen knives. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8:30 a.m. the sheriff's special weapons and tactics team had surrounded the 
small apartment building and evacuated the area. For the next several hours, 
authorities talked to Lloyd on the phone and through one of the apartment's 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times throughout the day, Lloyd, in sunglasses and a white baseball 
cap, yelled obscenities from the window and asked deputies to shoot him. He 
told authorities and his girlfriend on the telephone that he did not open the 
door to the deputies because he did not want to go back to prison.  
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m., the SWAT team used a device called flash/bang to distract Lloyd 
while they entered the apartment and arrested him without further struggle, 
Southwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd's mother, Linda Lloyd of Santa Paula, said her son has been in and out 
of jail since 1980 for various alcohol-related crimes. He had been released 
from state prison on June 6, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried everything I can to help him, but he continues to drink," Linda 
Lloyd said. "I'm crying out for help. Instead of taking him to jail, I wish 
they would take him to a hospital and treat him." CHRISTINA LIMA

<P>
 A 24-year-old Camarillo man died Monday morning from injuries he received 
following a solo car accident on Cawelti Road about a mile west of Lewis Road 
just south of Camarillo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon L. Dixon died at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital around 10:30 a.m. 
from critical injuries sustained in the 6:55 a.m. crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Dixon was traveling eastbound on the road at about 55 m.p.h. 
when he lost control of his vehicle. His car then slammed into a large 
eucalyptus tree that sheered Dixon's car in half, said California Highway 
Patrol Officer Bryan Demattia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese said that an autopsy of Dixon was 
pending, but that investigators so far are unsure why the man lost control of 
the car. J.E. MITCHELL

<P>
 Thirteen townhouses for low-income residents could soon be built in the Barry 
Street area of Camarillo's southwest end if the city's Planning Commission 
approves the proposal tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing complex, composed of two-story townhouses, would be situated near 
the corner of Barry Street and Glenn Drive. The complex is being proposed by 
the Cabrillo Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Boden, Camarillo's director of Planning and Community Development, 
said his staff is recommending the project be approved by the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly one-acre site is on undeveloped, graded land owned by the city.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE PIRU; SEARCH FOR DROWNED MAN IS SUSPENDED 
</P>

<P>
 The search for the body of a North Hollywood man believed drowned in Lake Piru 
was suspended Monday, after divers and helicopter rescue teams combed the 
waters for nearly 11 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Amado Carraza, 27, is believed to have drowned in the lake late Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Carraza left a rented boat at the lake to go for a swim, according to 
Sheriff's Lt. Steve Giles. But shortly after he entered the water, Carraza 
began struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of his family aboard the boat threw him floating devices and at least 
one life vest, but the equipment was no help. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative of Carraza's dove in to try save him but had to let go when the 
struggling swimmer began to pull the other man under the water, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe the accident occurred on the western side of the lake but 
outside of a designated swimming area where water depths range from 15 to 65 
feet. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FARMING FIRM GETS OK TO BURN TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard farming operation will be allowed to burn an estimated 1,200 tons of 
dried out orange trees from its property under a special agreement with the 
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Berry Farms, a farming company whose fields are located near the 
corner of Rice Avenue and 5th Street, was preparing to burn all of the trees 
but agreed to burn only a smaller portion each day over the next three weeks in 
order to cut down on air pollution, said Kent Field, a meteorologist with the 
air pollution control district. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, struck between the grower, the district and the Ventura County 
Fire Department, stipulates that Western Berry officials will call the district 
each morning to secure permission to burn an estimated four to five piles later 
that day. All 1,200 tons is expected to be consumed by the end of the month, 
Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not permission is granted for the company to burn the materials is 
based on daily atmospheric and smog conditions, Field said. On heavy smog days, 
the farm operator would be asked not to burn the trees. Field said the 
agreement was an example of cooperation between the farming company and 
government in that the grower has the legal right to burn field materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Field said that because the former trees are so dried out, they will burn 
hotter and emit less smoke. The agreement between the district also calls for 
the burns to occur only in the afternoon hours after daily onshore winds begin.

 At KCRW (89.9 FM/Santa Monica; 89.1 FM/Oxnard, Ventura, and 89.3 FM/Indio, 
Palm Springs), our signature station identification says, "National Public 
Radio for more of Southern California." And indeed, since February, 1993, from 
our full-power transmitter in Oxnard and for several years prior via microwave 
and low-power transmitters, KCRW has been providing a wide-ranging menu of 
National Public Radio news, information and cultural programming to Ventura 
County listeners -- many of whom we proudly count among our members. 
</P>
<P>
 While a new public radio station is a reason for any community to celebrate -- 
and we wish KCLU/Thousand Oaks good luck in its endeavor -- we think that your 
readers will be pleased to know that, even though our home base is Santa Monica 
College, KCRU/Oxnard, Ventura (89.1 FM) is on the air 24 hours a day, providing 
the high-quality programs upon which National Public Radio has built its 
award-winning reputation.

KEEP RIGHT TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little while ago I signed a petition for a landfill to be on the ballot this 
November. Then I read that the elections office had approved of the petition 
and that the Board of Supervisors had voted to place it on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I read that there is a move to not allow us to vote, and if the newspapers 
are telling the story right, some supervisors don't want us to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it always important for us to vote for supervisors but they don't feel 
we should vote on anything else? Do we get dumber after we have elected them, 
or is the right to vote a very selective thing, such as voting only when we 
elect them? 
</P>
<P>
 We should be allowed to vote on an initiative, and it seems pretty bad when we 
are told we can't.

GOLF COURSE IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article about the need for more golf courses in Ventura County stated that 
neighbors of the planned Hill Canyon golf course "have come out strongly 
against the proposals." This is not true in the case of the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Rosa Valley Community Assn. represents residents and homeowners 
associations in this valley. We support the principle of the city of Thousand 
Oaks building a golf course in Hill Canyon. When this was first proposed by the 
city, we objected to the attempt to include a 50-acre parcel of county-owned 
property in the golf course with little in return. This parcel was purchased by 
Ventura County to create a park for county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Our association has proposed to the County Parks and Harbor Commission that a 
small part of this 50 acres be made into a regional equestrian and multiuse 
park. The remainder would then be available for incorporation in the golf 
course. There are other issues that need to be resolved in the development of 
the golf course. However, we would like to work with the city of Thousand Oaks 
to see this proposal come to fruition.

OBITUARIES ; GENE CHERICO; JAZZ MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Cherico, a jazz bassist who took up the instrument as therapy for a 
debilitating arm injury and later performed with such greats as Benny Goodman, 
Stan Getz and Frank Sinatra, has died. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 A former resident of Encino and Simi Valley, Cherico died Friday of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at a Santa Monica convalescent home, said his former 
wife, Mary Lusk of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while stationed in Germany with the Army in the early 1950s that 
Cherico suffered the injury that led to his musical career. At the time he was 
a drummer. But after a train collided with the car he was driving, Cherico took 
up the double bass to strengthen his severely weakened arm. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the service in 1955, he attended Boston's Berklee College of 
Music for three years, where he met pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi. With drummer Jake 
Hanna, they formed a trio that played numerous gigs between 1956 and 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked the original trio," Hanna recalled Monday. "We had a lot of fun with 
that band." 
</P>
<P>
 As a sideman, Cherico went on to play in groups led by Benny Goodman, George 
Shearing, Stan Getz, Maynard Ferguson, Red Norvo, Herb Pomeroy and Peter Nero 
between the late 1950s and early 1970s. Later he played in bands that 
accompanied such singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Carmen McRae and Nancy 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Cherico moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded with a big band led 
by Louie Bellson and a band headed by Akiyoshi and her husband Lew Tabackin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherico retired shortly after he was diagnosed with lymphoma 10 years ago, 
Lusk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a great feel and a very good ear," his friend Hanna said. "Probably 
the best of all the bass players." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Eugene Valentino Cherico on April 15, 1932, in Buffalo, N.Y., he took 
drum lessons as a child and later became a drummer with an Army special 
services band. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his daughter, Amy Cherico of Ventura; a stepdaughter, Ann 
Cherico of Ventura; and two brothers, Anthony Cherico and Gerald Cherico. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no funeral. Cherico will be cremated and his ashes scattered at 
sea. Aftercare California Cremation & Burial Society in Van Nuys is handling 
the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to a trust fund for Amy 
Cherico in care of the Bank of A. Levy, 2499 Harbor Blvd., Ventura, 93001.

GTE OFFICIALS DISCIPLINE WORKERS IN ETHICS CASE; LEGAL: SPOKESMAN SAYS 
CURIOSITY ABOUT O.J. SIMPSON RECORDS PROMPTED ATTEMPTS TO BREACH CONFIDENTIAL 
TELEPHONE FILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Telephone company workers curious about the O.J. Simpson murder case have been 
disciplined for trying unsuccessfully to tap into confidential phone records, a 
GTE spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of action, even though it was unsuccessful, is a violation of the 
code of ethics of GTE," spokesman Larry Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the Thousands Oaks-based company has already met with most of the 
affected employees and administered punishment. He declined to comment on a 
report that at least one person was fired and 18 others had been disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 Punishment for ethical code violations, however, could range from a verbal 
warning to outright dismissal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the workers did not actually gain access to the confidential files, 
because the company put certain phone records off-limits to all but a handful 
of security officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, it became apparent that there was going to be an inordinate amount 
of curiosity about people in the O.J. Simpson case," Cox said. "We literally 
received dozens of calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, employees in GTE's billing office can call up detailed phone logs 
to answer questions for customers. But shortly after the June 12 slayings of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, the phone company 
restricted key files. 
</P>
<P>
 But any employee who tried to call up records for O.J. Simpson, his ex-wife, 
her parents or family friend Al Cowlings saw nothing more than a blank screen, 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, their efforts to access the file were recorded, he said, 
tipping the phone company off to violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox acknowledged that the records were unprotected for a short time 
immediately after the double slaying, but said pertinent phone calls may not 
have appeared in the records that soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time was the information in jeopardy," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE has turned the information over to law enforcement officials, who have 
used phone records in trying to establish the time of the slayings. Defense 
attorneys and prosecutors have focused in particular on a call Nicole Simpson 
made to her mother on the night Simpson died.

MOTHER TO BE TRIED IN INFANT ENDANGERMENT; COURTS: THE OXNARD WOMAN IS ACCUSED 
OF DROPPING 3-MONTH-OLD GIRL OVER A FENCE ONTO CEMENT SIX FEET BELOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard woman accused of dangling her 3-month-old infant over a chain-link 
fence and dropping the child onto the cement six feet below must stand trial on 
battery and child endangerment charges, a judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aretha Marcell Chester, 23, reacted with tears and anger as Municipal Judge 
Herbert Curtis III sent her case to Ventura County Superior Court and set bail 
at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see my kids?" Chester asked her lawyer in court after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 3-month-old baby who needs me," she wailed plaintively. "If I was 
going to hurt my baby, I would have done it at home, not in public." 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses who told police she dropped the baby over the fence were "lying 
on me," she shouted at her court-appointed attorney, Joel Steinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinfeld declined to say what his client's defense would be, but said he 
expected her to plead not guilty at her Aug. 29 arraignment. "She was just 
having a dispute with the baby's father," he said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Steinfeld argued that Chester should be released from jail, so long 
as she stays away from the child. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors argued that Chester had already lost custody of the eldest of 
her four children. The 3-month-old, her youngest, is now living with Chester's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester's criminal record includes several past arrests and a conviction for 
battery, for which she is currently on probation, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby, Sara Kimbrough, was hospitalized with a fractured skull after the 
July 31 incident at Sierra Linda Park. The child was released the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses said they saw Chester and a group of men arguing loudly at the 
park just outside Oxnard, Oxnard Police Officer Lisa Ragone told the judge 
Monday. One of the men was the baby's father. 
</P>
<P>
 When the men jumped over the six-foot-high fence and began walking away, 
Chester dangled the infant over the fence and released her, said a married 
couple who, with their children, were having a picnic about 150 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very upset about it," Ragone told the judge. "They had their four 
children with them." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the couple's account and other witnesses, Chester then climbed 
over the fence and began arguing with the man who had picked up the child, 
Ragone said. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving several reports of the incident, police found Chester on her 
way to the hospital. Ragone described Chester as hysterical, saying at one 
point, "My baby, my baby, I dropped my baby." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chester told police that the baby had fallen out of its car seat, the officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester did not testify at Monday's hearing, but expressed disbelief at the 
testimony given by the police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say I can't see my kids, because I take care of them, because people 
are lying on me," she said to her lawyer after the hearing.

RESIDENTS APPLAUD VICTORIA CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victoria Care Center is our home. The article your paper printed on Aug. 4 
hurt us because we know Victoria Care has become a very good place to live.You 
printed the old, bad news and left out the current, good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The article took most of its information from a 1992 and an only-now-released 
1993 report by a biased advocacy group in San Francisco. We're now eight months 
into 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Those San Francisco people never came here to find out what's going on now. 
They never talked to us or our families or our staff. Your reporter was invited 
but didn't come here to get the current story either. This is our home. We know 
what's going on here. You should have asked us. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they signed on last September, our new administration has hired and 
trained an almost entirely new staff, and everyone has been working their socks 
off these last 11 months to turn things around at Victoria Care. They've 
succeeded.

SIMI SCHOOLS MAY DIP INTO FUNDING FOR ADULT PROGRAM; FINANCES: OFFICIALS SAY 
THE $450,000 SHIFT WOULD OFFSET THE DISTRICT'S $3.2-MILLION SHORTFALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school system is considering taking more than $450,000 from 
its adult education program's budget to offset the school district's 
$3.2-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-time transfer of funds would be justified, school board members said, 
because adult education did not sustain significant budget cuts during the 
district's budget overhaul earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of carefully saving more than $4.5 million, adult education 
administrators do not want to see their nest egg reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that revenue has been generated by prudent expenditures," adult 
education director Sondra Jones said. "We saved that money . . . None of that 
was ever intended to fund the K-12 program." 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of funds, which will be discussed at tonight's school board 
meeting, is possible as a result of a change in state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The state budget, which was approved last month, allows for a 10% shift in 
adult education revenue for the 1994-95 school year. The decision overrides 
existing state regulations that restrict how adult education funds are spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, adult education was never affected because we have other 
legislation that says money raised in adult education must stay in adult 
education," said Gerold Kilbert, an assistant superintendent for the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, the Legislature decided the districts should be able to use 
that money, Kilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said the decision will help school 
districts struggling to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unusual because previously the education code had protected adult 
education from transfers, but I think that might have taken place because there 
are so many districts around the state that are going to need resources to 
balance their budgets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking funds from Simi Valley's adult education program, which is the largest 
and wealthiest in Ventura County, would help fund programs threatened by the 
district's $3.2-million deficit, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We prefer not to take any funds from any program anywhere. However, if there 
is an opportunity to make a shift that will affect the entire school district, 
the school board needs to look at that," Wolford said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We could be facing a district crisis and we have to look at every opportunity 
we have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of funds would not affect adult education class programming, 
which serves about 11,000 people, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult education reserve fund does not include funds set aside for 
construction of a new adult education building, officials said. The district 
hopes to have the facility built by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, administrators plan to use the $450,000 in question to repair 
the existing facilities, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to use that to provide additional space for the adult education 
program in the form of portable (classrooms) and to improve facilities," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the school board approves the transfer of funds, there will be no money for 
those improvements, she said. "We will have to severely restrict expenditures 
in the 1994-95 school year," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Diane Collins said the transfer will probably be approved when it 
comes before the school board for final action in September. 
</P>
<P>
 When the subject was discussed in the past, she said, "It looked like 
something we didn't want to do but is going to be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in very serious financial trouble right now, and this would be the 
first time the adult school budget has taken any hit. I think there is a 
general feeling that we all need to share the pain."

MAILING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA ON SBA LOAN PROCESS; DISASTER AID: DESPITE 
DEADLINE EXTENSION, AGENCY DENIES THE ACTION WAS PROMPTED BY A SURVEY 
INDICATING CONFUSION OVER APPLICATION PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the heels of a survey that showed many quake victims did not understand 
Small Business Administration loan procedures, the federal agency announced 
Monday it will send out 313,000 letters offering additional data. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters, which will be sent to earthquake victims in Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties by the end of this month, will also include toll-free 
telephone information numbers and notice of the recent deadline extension to 
Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials denied there was a connection between the announcement and the 
results of the agency's own survey that showed 17% of all those who did not 
return applications said they misunderstood the loan procedures and needed more 
information. That percentage represents 51,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials also denied the new program was prompted by criticism from city 
officials and newspaper editorials that pointed out that only 42% of all SBA 
loan applications have been returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy with this return rate," said SBA spokeswoman Rebecca McKenzie. 
"We are constantly looking at ways to make this better. To say they are 
pressuring us is not accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Carrillo, director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce, said he hopes the 
letter will help residents in the city, where 50 downtown buildings had to be 
demolished in the earthquake's aftermath. Carrillo said he frequently talks to 
quake victims -- including many Spanish speakers -- who are bewildered by the 
SBA loan process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea to send out this letter," Carrillo said. "But I 
hope they are going to send it out in Spanish as well as English." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo himself applied for a SBA loan to help with $25,000 worth of quake 
damage to his mobile home, which was thrown off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA approved his loan, but instead of the 3.5% interest rate he and his 
wife thought they would be getting, SBA offered them 7.5% rate of interest, 
based on their income level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it was on the paper somewhere and we were told about it," Carrillo 
said. "But let's face it, for two months people were in shock and if they told 
me stuff, it went right over my head." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Carrillo and his wife took out a $5,000 bank loan with a 5% interest 
rate, and made up the difference with a small FEMA grant, insurance payments 
and money from their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard, who represents Simi Valley, Moorpark 
and other areas hard hit by the quake, said she understands how some people are 
confused by the forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read over those loan documents, and there are some things that are very 
difficult for people to understand," Howard said. "Ironically, we just 
scheduled a meeting with SBA in September to answer some of the questions that 
residents still have." 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, the Simi Valley City Council approved use of $50,000 in relief 
funds to hire an earthquake assistance coordinator whose duties will include 
helping residents sort through federal earthquake assistance applications. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 10, nearly 506,000 disaster applications had been issued by the 
SBA, but only about 213,000 have been returned, leaving nearly 300,000 
applications outstanding, according to SBA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But SBA officials defended the return rate, saying it is comparable to the 
response they had after disasters such as Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta quake 
and the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA survey, conducted by telephone Aug. 5 through 8, found that the 17% 
who did not return applications were mainly laboring under three 
misconceptions: they didn't know the SBA would lend money to cover the 
earthquake insurance deductibles, they didn't know the original deadline had 
been extended and they simply didn't think they qualified for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the others who did not return applications: 
</P>
<P>
 * 26% said they did not want additional debt or did not need a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 25% said they were not interested and only had minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 20% said they had money of their own or had other funding, such as insurance 
money, to pay for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6% said they had sufficient assistance from FEMA's temporary housing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6% said they could not meet the applications filing requirements, such as 
providing evidence of a positive cash flow or copies of tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman Russ Edmonston urged quake 
victims to take advantage of the extension and apply for an SBA loan, even if 
they do not want or need it, because victims cannot qualify for a state grant 
until they have been rejected by the SBA.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW LISTLESS; TREASURY BILL YIELDS RISE

 Short-term market interest rates moved up Monday, awaiting today's Federal 
Reserve Board meeting, while stocks finished mixed in slow trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average closed lower in a mild late selloff, losing 8.42 
points to 3,760.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, winners and losers were nearly even on the New York Stock 
Exchange. The market's strength continued to be in smaller stocks: The Nasdaq 
composite index added 1.28 points to 732.89. 
</P>
<P>
 While stock trading has been listless on Mondays all summer long, traders 
noted that investors had good reason to stay away on this Monday, in advance of 
the Fed's meeting. The central bank is widely expected to raise short-term 
interest rates for a fifth time this year, in an effort to slow the economy and 
retrain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bill yields, which had drifted lower last week, jumped again Monday, 
anticipating Fed action. At the Treasury's weekly auction, the three-month 
T-bill yield hit 4.71%, up from 4.54% last week and the highest since November, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But longer-term yields were mostly steady. The 30-year T-bond yield closed 
unchanged from Friday at 7.50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists believe the Fed will decide to push up its target for the 
federal funds rate -- what banks charge each other on overnight loans -- by 
half a percentage point, to 4.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fed needed another sign that the economy is healthy enough to stand a 
rate increase, it got it Monday: A monthly survey on output at the nation's 
factories, mines and utilities showed a 0.2% advance in production in July, 
slightly higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 That report sparked a brief selloff in bonds early in the day, but the selling 
receded later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists say long-term bond yields could hold steady or perhaps decline 
in the months ahead, even as short-term interest rates rise. The reason is that 
long-term yields key off expectations for growth and for inflation. If the Fed 
succeeds in slowing the economy, bond investors should in theory be willing to 
accept lower yields. 
</P>
<P>
 But that argument had also been made earlier this year when the Fed first 
began to tighten credit, and the surprise was that long-term yields moved up 
sharply with short-term yields. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the stock market, traders say the market's relative strength in recent 
weeks suggests that investors are beginning to lose their skittishness over 
higher short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traders are pretty much assuming the Fed will raise rates half a point, and 
they hope that's the end of it," said Len Hefter, managing director of Nasdaq 
trading at Jefferies & Co. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks continued to benefit from takeover rumors and from growing 
belief that the national health care reform effort is stumbling on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson gained 7/8 to 49 1/2, a new 1994 high. Also, Merck rose 7/8 
to 33 1/8, Schering-Plough jumped 1 to 70, Warner-Lambert added 5/8 to 78 1/4 
and Biogen was up 1 1/2 to 47 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among smaller biotech shares, Gensia rose 2 3/4 to 12 1/4 after two analysts 
issued "buy" recommendations on the stock, citing completion of clinical trials 
for the firm's drug to treat heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some food stocks advanced again, helped by takeover talk. CPC International 
rose 1 5/8 to 53 1/2, Archer-Daniels gained 3/4 to 25 5/8 and Hershey was up 1 
1/4 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many financial stocks rose, despite the specter of another Fed rate 
increase. Great Western Financial gained 5/8 to 20 3/4, Ahmanson added 1/4 to 
22 1/8, FirstFed Financial rose 5/8 to 16 1/4, Morgan Stanley gained 1 to 65 
1/4 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage jumped 1 1/8 to 61 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were mixed. Hewlett-Packard dropped 2 1/8 to 79 1/8 in 
profit taking, but Lotus Development surged 2 1/2 to 44 1/2 after a Dean Witter 
analyst made bullish comments about a new low-cost version of the company's 
popular Notes software program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrial issues, Varity tumbled 1 3/8 to 33 1/2. Volkswagen said it 
decided not to award a $135-million contract to Varity for anti-lock braking 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 stock index eased 0.1 point to 3,142.2, 
while Frankfurt's DAX index gained 14.16 points to 2,138.84. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei-225 index lost 37.50 points to 20,626.33. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rallied on, adding 13.74 points to close at 
2,651.50. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, coffee prices rose anew on a U.S. Agriculture 
Department report of sizable frost damage to Brazil's key coffee crop. The 
government estimated 30% to 40% of Brazil's 1995-96 crop was lost to twin 
frosts in June and July, worse than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 December coffee futures soared 13.60 cents to $1.98 a pound, the first 
substantial turnaround in the market since prices peaked in mid-July at $2.45.

 T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12.4 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.59%, up from 4.43% last 
week. Another $12.4 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.99%, up from 4.93%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 4.64% on Nov. 12, 1991. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since it averaged 5.04% on Oct. 28, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.71% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,884.00, and 5.19% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,747.70. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

 Market trends: General Electric was the volume leader in Monday's trading. 
Elsewhere, Carolco Pictures Inc. announced a second-quarter loss of $21.2 
million on $11 million in sales, compared to a year-earlier loss of $13.5 
million on $28.1 million in sales.

 Communications: Viacom Inc. received at least two bids Monday for the Madison 
Square Garden complex and its two professional sports teams: basketball's New 
York Knicks and hockey's New York Rangers. As expected, the bids were submitted 
by the Liberty Media arm of Tele-Communications Inc. and a joint venture formed 
by Cablevision Systems and ITT Corp. Despite early interest, Canadian brewer 
John Labatt Ltd. did not make an offer, and shoe manufacturer Nike Inc. said 
Friday that it had decided against bidding.None of the auction participants 
divulged terms of their proposals, and sources said more maneuvering is 
expected. Separately, Viacom reported second-quarter earnings of $221.7 
million, reflecting 50.2% ownership of Paramount Communications Inc. In the 
second quarter of 1993 -- before its bid for Paramount -- Viacom reported net 
earnings of $41.6 million. Second-quarter earnings from operations at Viacom's 
MTV Networks rose 20% over the same period in 1993, but earnings from cable 
systems decreased 35% to $21.4 million, reflecting lower revenue and 
non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of FCC rate regulations. 
Viacom said Paramount Entertainment's earnings from operations were $63 million 
on revenue of $1.2 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. KATHRYN HARRIS

ADVICE FROM ABOVE: BYO FOOD WHEN YOU FLY THE CHEAPER SKIES

 With the frills disappearing daily from airline flight service, business 
travelers and other frequent fliers might be feeling irritated over the loss of 
the personal touch.  
</P>
<P>
 But what they should do, according to one veteran flight attendant, is learn 
to help themselves, even if that means turning their briefcases into something 
resembling a brown bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The attendant writes from Aurora, Colo.: 
</P>
<P>
 "As so often occurs on the plane, many people expect the airline to provide 
them with their personal/special needs, either through special dietary needs 
with their meals or even down to not wanting peanuts, when they are served, or 
wanting pretzels when peanuts are served. 
</P>
<P>
 "My chief pet peeve," she says, "is the general public's lack of personal 
awareness for their own needs. We are all in charge of our own lives. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "So, while traveling long or short distances, is it not reasonable to think 
that if one has special dietary needs, or is lacking too little time between 
flights, that one should bring their own food, snack or water, just in case of 
emergency, or even impatience while waiting for beverage service?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cabin attendants, who are not guaranteed meals when they fly, have taken to 
packing their own sandwiches, instant soups, beverages and even frozen entrees 
when they travel, the letter adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need some chocolate, a toothpick, pretzels (instead of peanuts), 
non-carbonated beverage besides apple juice, then bring it yourself! Don't 
expect the airlines to be able to provide for every need, because they can't," 
the letter adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flight attendants are on board an aircraft to quickly execute an evacuation 
of an entire aircraft within minutes, if ever necessary. We are also skilled in 
a variety of on-board aircraft safety-related items, including emergency 
medical situations, diplomacy, public relations. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "An airplane in the '90s is a transportation vehicle designed to get you 
quickly from one destination to the next. We have come a long way from the 
family station wagon of the '60s and '70s that took us across the United 
States. However, we are not yet a soda fountain, drug store, pizza place or 
gourmet food court in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 The attendant also advises travelers to drink plenty of water since "there is 
approximately 1% moisture on board an aircraft and much of that is 
reconstituted human sweat (as unpleasant as that sounds). . . . Misting with a 
water sprayer also helps reduce moisture loss from the skin."

 Angela Perez, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is distributing a government 
questionnaire for working women among other disabled employees. So far, she has 
handed out about 200 survey forms and received 50 responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disabled women are not usually thought of as workers," said Perez, who works 
with a New York City YWCA mentor project. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, launched by the Labor Department's Women's Bureau, asks working 
women about their lives and their concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 Women's Bureau director Karen Nussbaum said she hopes the results will help 
shape future government policy on working women. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 businesses, unions, publications and organizations are 
printing and distributing questionnaires in a massive grass-roots effort. The 
survey is available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and 
Braille. 
</P>
<P>
 It asks women to describe their lives and their jobs and asks them what 
problems they face. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you feel about your job overall? 
</P>
<P>
 * If you could tell President Clinton one thing about what it's like to be a 
working woman, what would it be? 
</P>
<P>
 * (List the) changes that might provide you with a better workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aurora, Colo., at the Fantasy Hair Design salon, customers are being asked 
to fill out the questionnaire while they wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop chain of beauty product stores has printed the questionnaire in 
its catalogue and is distributing the survey to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The West 47th St. Salon and Day Spa in Kansas City, Mo., worked with the mayor 
to declare a Working Women Count week. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the questionnaire was placed in the paycheck 
envelopes of each female government worker, the Women's Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Questionnaires should be returned by Aug. 31 to: U.S. Department of Labor, 
Attn: Working Women Count!, 200 Constitution Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. 
For information about the questionnaire, call: (800) 347-3741.

AN ADVOCATE FOR WORKING WOMEN; PROFILE: KAREN NUSSBAUM HELPED FOUND THE 
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION 9TO5 AND WAS TAPPED TO CONTINUE HER ACTIVISM IN THE 
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA GENASCI, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seeds of activism were planted in Karen Nussbaum's psyche early in life. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster she saw a film about Ira Hayes, the Native American who helped 
raise the flag on Iwo Jima during World War II. When he returned home, 
discrimination and alcoholism plagued him, and he died in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that someone could contribute so much to a nation yet die so 
sorrowfully because of his ethnic background moved Nussbaum. She wanted to help 
people improve their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Nussbaum grew up, she became an advocate for others, particularly 
working women. She helped found 9to5, the national group that campaigns for 
working women's rights, and also helped establish a union for clerical and 
professional workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 44, Nussbaum is as passionate as ever. But now her activism is 
channeled through the Clinton Administration, where she is director of the 
Women's Bureau, an agency within the Labor Department concerned with women's 
employment issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life's work is to work with working women," she said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 From her corner office with a picture-perfect view of the Mall and National 
Gallery of Art, the slight woman with a steady gaze said she never had any 
particular ambition that led her to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Labor Secretary Robert Reich said that in choosing Nussbaum to lead the 
Women's Bureau, he hoped to send the message that working women count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karen for years has been perhaps America's strongest advocate on behalf of 
working women," Reich said. "She blends strong advocacy with a marvelous sense 
of balance and humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Bravo, who succeeded Nussbaum as head of 9to5, said one of Nussbaum's 
strengths is that she sets clear, achievable goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very focused and very smart," Bravo said. "She knows how to put the 
pressure on, but she knows what is winnable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the status of working women has improved significantly over the last 
20 years, when Nussbaum began her role as an advocate, she said there is still 
much work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 While 47% of workers are women, they earn only 75% of the salaries of their 
male colleagues, Labor Department data show. Nearly 80% of women earn less than 
$25,000 a year and they occupy only 2% to 3% of top management positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's Bureau was founded by Congress in 1920, the year women won the 
right to vote, with a mandate of promoting the welfare of wage-earning women in 
new industrial jobs. The first director of the bureau was Mary Anderson, a shoe 
factory worker and trade unionist who served until 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretation of the bureau's mandate, however, has changed over the 
years, and the agency was notably silent during the past decade. Nussbaum, 
however, declines to criticize her predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 As director, she hopes to promote the marriage of public policy and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we are reaching out to the public and know what working women care 
about, we won't have good public policy," Nussbaum said. "And unless you tell 
working women what their rights are it doesn't matter how good the laws are." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the thinking behind the bureau's Working Women Count! questionnaire, 
a massive undertaking launched this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of the survey is to ask the 58 million working women nationwide 
about their lives and conflicts. Nussbaum hopes the responses will form a base 
for future government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 companies, newspapers and organizations are printing and 
distributing the questionnaire, which is also being made available on Prodigy, 
CompuServe and other computer networking services. Results are scheduled for 
release in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 To promote the survey, Nussbaum has traveled the country over the past year 
talking to women in a variety of jobs, from screenwriters in New York to casino 
workers in Las Vegas, construction workers in Cleveland and day-care workers in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been surprised, she said, by the similarity of the complaints. Women 
worry particularly about time and money, that they don't have enough of either, 
and they worry about child and elder care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women say they know what's wrong, but don't think they can do anything about 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau, she hopes, will help educate women about their options and rights 
under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Family and 
Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum is a working mother of three children ages 6 to 11. Her husband is 
the political activist Ira Arlook, president of the advocacy group Citizen 
Action. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1950 in Chicago, Nussbaum was the daughter of liberal Democrat parents 
who she said taught her concern for the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum's father was a businessman, actor and director, and her mother was a 
public relations specialist and precinct committee chairwoman. Her family 
worked for civil rights and peace causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning 18 in 1968, when campuses and city streets were filled with 
demonstrations against the Vietnam War, was central to her development, 
Nussbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember feeling tremendous relief that it wasn't just a matter of doing 
good but that you actually could change the way things were," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of study at the University of Chicago, Nussbaum moved to Boston, 
where she worked in a clerical job at Harvard University. The big issue for 
working women then, she said, was what she called the little indignities, such 
as who should fetch coffee for the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum recalled a day when she was assembling a loose-leaf binder, 
surrounded by piles of papers, when a male boss walked by and asked in a 
patronizing fashion, "Why aren't you smiling, dear?" 
</P>
<P>
 Friends had worse experiences. A secretary told of pausing while typing a 
letter. Her boss asked what she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get back to work, you're not paid to think," was his response. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most succinct view of the condition of working women at the time 
came from one woman who wrote to Nussbaum's group, "We will be called girls 
until the day we retire without a pension." 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum and fellow workers called a meeting in the early 1970s to discuss 
their plight and decided to put out a newsletter for working women which they 
called 9to5. That newsletter, distributed at subway entrances before work, led 
to the formation in 1973 of Nussbaum's group of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Now based in Cleveland, 9to5 has become a powerful and respected national 
voice for clerical and office workers. It inspired the 1981 film of the same 
name starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton that told the tale of 
office workers who rebel against an abusive boss. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Nussbaum helped found and became president of District 925 of the 
Service Employees International Union, which represents office and professional 
employees across the nation. She held that post until Reich asked her to join 
the Clinton Administration.

BRITISH BOBBIES MAY TRADE BILLY CLUBS FOR BATON; POLICE: OFFICERS ARE TESTING 
AN EXPANDABLE METAL DEFENSIVE DEVICE MADE IN THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY ROBERTS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Afternoon tea and fish and chips are safe. But one American company is hoping 
to exert a little influence on another British mainstay -- the bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers in Britain, known as bobbies, traditionally carry only 14-inch 
wooden billy clubs for protection. But in reaction to increasing violence, 
bobbies are now testing an American-style expandable police baton produced by a 
small New Hampshire company. 
</P>
<P>
 The side-handled PR-24 baton made by Monadnock Lifetime Products Inc. is 
aluminum and hard plastic. Carried on an officer's belt, it expands from 14 
inches to two feet with the jerk of an arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Monadnock, which holds the patent on expandable metal batons, supplies them to 
nearly 3,000 law enforcement agencies worldwide from a small factory in the 
woods in Fitzwilliam, which has a population of about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The private company, which employs 38 people, is the world's largest producer 
of police batons and reported just under $3 million in sales last year. It 
would not release profit figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The British have been testing the batons since January, and the devices have 
won influential endorsements from the head of the British police chiefs' 
association and the country's home secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 British police -- known as bobbies since Sir Robert Peel founded the country's 
modern police force in the 1820s -- have long been unarmed except for their 
billy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 With more officers being injured in assaults, some involving knives and guns, 
some 1,880 of the country's 28,000 officers have been trained and authorized to 
carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Secretary Michael Howard has said that most bobbies will remain unarmed 
for "a long, long time to come." A 1990 survey among officers of all ranks 
found 86% favored the existing policy of limiting guns to specially trained 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet top police officials realize they need something more effective than 
wooden truncheons, says Terry Smith, Monadnock's training director. They liked 
the American baton because its primary use is to protect rather than attack. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer holding a PR-24 by the side handle can use it to block an assault 
or to vastly increase leverage for an armlock. So far, Smith says, the batons 
have gotten a "glowing endorsement" from the British constabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in awe of what you could do," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says 25,000 to 30,000 of its expandable batons are now in use 
worldwide, about one-third of which are the new PR-24s, which cost about $80 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Paul Starrett said that, if the batons win acceptance in 
Britain, 1,000 to 2,000 a month could be sold there for several years. He said 
sales to Britain could total $4 million for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The batons got some bad publicity in 1991 after baton-wielding Los Angeles 
police officers were videotaped assaulting motorist Rodney King. That incident 
postponed testing of the PR-24 in Britain for two years, Starrett said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Starrett noted that the officers who beat King were not trained in the 
program endorsed by his company, which instructs officers to use the baton to 
strike only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PR-24 is a very humane, very reasonable device," Smith said, although he 
admitted it can be misused. "It's like a pen. A pen can be used to sign your 
name or write a check, but it can also be used to write the great American 
novel."

 In the largest fatal accident in Metrolink's two years of service, a little 
girl, her mother and grandfather were killed by a train in Glendale on Monday 
as they apparently tried to take a shortcut to visit the girl's grandmother in 
a convalescent hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred shortly after 10 a.m., underneath a car and 
pedestrian-crossing bridge at 900 Western Ave., just east of the Golden State 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims -- Antonio Juan Pina, 79; his daughter, Miylem Blanca Villanueva, 
37, and 7-year-old granddaughter, Francis Villanueva -- were thrown 100 feet by 
the 60-m.p.h. train and were killed instantly, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible," said Glendale police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths brought to nine the number of fatalities caused by Metrolink trains 
so far this year, and 21 since service started in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses and others interviewed by police, the victims were on 
their way to a nearby hospital and crossed the tracks to save time, instead of 
going up and over the Western Avenue bridge. It was not known if they saw the 
train, even though the engineer was urgently sounding his horn, according to 
Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of the youngest victim sprinted to the scene from his job nearby 
after learning from co-workers that three people had been killed on the tracks. 
Once there, he was faced with the task of identifying the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew that his family members were going to visit grandma around that time 
of day, and came to the scene to get further information," Keuroghelian said, 
adding that police were not releasing the man's name. "He was shocked. In 
disbelief . . . he has lost most of his family." 
</P>
<P>
 The father has another daughter, who is about 10, Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of the Villanueva family, Catalina Nuno, said they frequently 
crossed the tracks because that was the quickest route to the nearest bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone we know does it," said Nuno. "I'm just sad. They were real good." 
</P>
<P>
 After the collision, which attracted onlookers from nearby commercial 
buildings, the 22 passengers aboard the train were transferred to an Amtrak 
train that was also headed to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Monday, Glendale police interviewed witnesses, and Metrolink 
authorities said they would be conducting their own inquiry to see if any 
safety measures were overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the accident, the train had left the Burbank station on its trip 
south from Canyon Country. When the engineer saw the victims, it was too late 
to stop or slow down, Metrolink authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people came out of nowhere," Hidalgo said. "They were trying to beat 
our train and illegally cross the tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hidalgo, the engineer -- whom authorities also declined to 
identify -- was sounding his horn even before he saw the victims on the tracks 
to warn construction crews in the area. At first sight of the three, he hit his 
emergency brakes, but it takes the 350-ton train a quarter of a mile to come to 
a stop when it is moving that fast, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo defended the actions of the engineer, whom he said was distraught over 
the deaths and would be offered psychological counseling, as are other 
engineers involved in fatal collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo also reiterated Metrolink's response to such incidents, many of which 
have been caused after people wandered onto sections of track that are off 
limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were apparently trying to take a shortcut via our tracks," Hidalgo said. 
"In their attempt to take the shortcut, it resulted in this fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important to know here is that our tracks are private property. It is 
a restricted area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident did not occur at a crossing and no warning signs were posted. 
Although part of the tracks are fenced in to prevent pedestrians from trying to 
cross, the stretch of track where the victims were hit was not fenced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said he was basing his description of the moments heading up to the 
fatal crash on statements that Glendale police took from the engineer and at 
least one witness, whom he described as "credible," at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A few witnesses said another train obstructed the family's view of the train 
that killed them, but Hidalgo disputed that account, saying the other train was 
headed north and had stopped several hundred feet away from the accident's 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way that the pedestrians could not have seen or heard our train 
coming," he said.

ANOTHER L.A. RECORD MELTS; HEAT: TEMPERATURE OF 98 AT CIVIC CENTER SETS FOURTH 
MARK IN FIVE DAYS.

<P>
 The mercury returned to its record-breaking ways at the Civic Center in 
Downtown Los Angeles on Monday, setting a new high temperature mark for the 
fourth time in five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The 98 degrees registered Downtown topped the mark of 96 set in 1885, and 
triple-digit temperatures hit several locations in Southern California.Van Nuys 
and Ontario registered 100 and Newhall reached 101, while the heat topped out 
at 102 in Riverside, 104 in Lancaster and 107 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters suggested that the best chance of any real relief would probably 
be at the ocean. Nearly 500,000 people took them at their word and headed for 
county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight cooling trend is scheduled to develop today -- if a high of 95 can be 
considered cooling. On Wednesday, the Civic Center high is expected to drop to 
92. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast, highs will range from the mid-70s to the mid-80s today and 
Wednesday, but the high in Pasadena and Canoga Park should reach 101, 
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the weekend, we could have temperatures back in the 80s Downtown," said 
Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times. "A fairly strong high-pressure system centered over California 
will gradually weaken over the next several days, allowing a shallow marine 
layer to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 A triple-digit high had been predicted at the Civic Center on Sunday, but the 
mercury peaked at 95, two degrees short of the record for the date.

WOMAN IDENTIFIES OFFICER'S ALLEGED KILLER IN LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man being held on murder charges in Oregon has been "positively identified" 
in a jailhouse lineup by a witness to the slaying of Manhattan Beach Police 
Officer Martin Ganz, Los Angeles sheriff's officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But they acknowledged that another witness, Ganz's 13-year-old nephew, was 
unable to identify the alleged killer in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, investigators said that because of the other witness's 
identification of Roger Hoan Brady, 28, a convicted bank robber and former Los 
Angeles-area resident, they soon expect to ask the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office to file murder charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely believe he is responsible for Martin Ganz's death," sheriff's 
spokesman George Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the murder of a peace officer is a "special circumstance" under 
California law, Brady could face the death penalty if he is charged and 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not entered a plea in the Oregon slaying and is being held there 
without bail. The Oregon prosecutor handling that case said officials would be 
willing to return Brady to California for a possible trial here once they are 
finished trying him for the murder of a 55-year-old woman during a Safeway 
supermarket robbery Aug. 3 in suburban Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Brady is convicted for the Oregon crime, California would have to 
return him to that state immediately after he was tried here. 
</P>
<P>
 "California could borrow the body to adjudicate their case," said Washington 
County Dist. Atty. Scott Upham. "But then the person would have to be returned 
to Oregon" to serve out his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady faces three possible sentences in the Oregon case: the death penalty, 
life without parole or life with the possibility of parole. Upham said it is 
"up in the air" which state would carry out the sentence if Brady got the death 
penalty in California but a lighter sentence in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification of Brady by the witness, an adult female whom authorities 
have not identified, is only one of several key pieces of evidence against him, 
sheriff's spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballistics experts have determined that a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol 
found in Brady's home after his arrest in Washington after the Portland robbery 
was the gun used to kill Ganz. Brady also was driving a gray 1988 Daihatsu that 
matched the description of the vehicle driven by Ganz's killer, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, the first Manhattan Beach police officer slain in the line of duty, 
was killed Dec. 27 by a man he pulled over in a routine traffic stop near 
Manhattan Village shopping mall. Ganz's nephew was in the patrol car on a 
"ride-along" but was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, the son of former NBC television network correspondent Phil Brady, was 
convicted of robbing an Agoura Hills savings and loan in 1989 and served three 
years in prison. At the time of the Ganz killing he was under "supervised 
release" -- the federal equivalent of parole -- during which he was required to 
undergo treatment and monitoring for drug abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 Acting on an anonymous tip, investigators questioned Brady at his Topanga 
Canyon home shortly after the Ganz murder, but said they had no evidence at the 
time to link him to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady moved to Vancouver, Wash., in the spring. Investigators there say he 
also is a suspect in several supermarket armed robberies in the 
Vancouver-Portland area.

TABLES TURN FOR CHAMPION OF ACCUSED; POLICE: OFFICER, USED TO DEFENDING 
COLLEAGUES AGAINST LAPD CHARGES, FACES INTERNAL HEARING OVER ALLEGATIONS OF 
RAPE AND SOLICITING MURDER. D.A.'S OFFICE EARLIER REJECTED THE CASE.

<P>
 Among many rank-and-file Los Angeles police officers, Musa T. Camara is known 
as "The Don" or "The Godfather" -- a resourceful and well-connected officer who 
has spent years going to battle for colleagues accused of wrongdoing and who 
has made his share of enemies in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 27, the Don will return to the scene of many of those confrontations, 
the Spartan board of rights room on the fifth floor of police headquarters. But 
this time, Camara will be the one facing charges, a shocking list of 
allegations including accusations that he raped a woman, tried to kidnap his 
son and tried several times to persuade a neighbor's son to kill his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Camara vigorously contests all the charges, and the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office rejected the case in November -- in part because 
prosecutors concluded that the witnesses to the alleged offenses lacked 
credibility. According to district attorney files, one witness, Robert Trejo 
Jr., had trouble remembering when Camara asked him to carry out a murder and 
struggled to recall how much Camara offered to pay for that job. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo's father also was interviewed, and told prosecutors "that his son had 
mental problems and that he fabricates on a regular basis," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Michele Gilmer said in rejecting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that decision, the LAPD has pressed ahead, accusing one of its own of 
criminal misconduct and prompting Camara to hire attorneys Paul DePasquale and 
Russell Cole and to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against his employers. 
Camara, who joined the LAPD in 1981, claims that the case against him is a 
vindictive action by his bosses and is motivated in part by the fact that he is 
black and Muslim. Camara also is an outspoken critic of the department who has 
railed against what he sees as racism within the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my contention that the investigation and adjudication of this complaint 
against me was conducted in a biased, unprofessional, vindictive and malicious 
manner," Camara states in his internal response to the charges against him, a 
copy of which was obtained by The Times. "The purpose and aim of the 
investigation . . . was to find Musa T. Camara guilty of misconduct by any 
means possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In person, Camara is no less blunt: "They've accused me -- an honest man, a 
religious man, a family man -- of committing horrible crimes, of sexual crimes, 
solicitation for murder, kidnaping people, saying that I've raped people. . . . 
I want my name cleared." 
</P>
<P>
 The department officials who have leveled the charges, Camara adds angrily, 
"are liars, all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 As they typically do in personnel matters, department officials declined to 
comment on the Camara case. But Capt. Eric Lillo, the commanding officer of the 
LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, strongly denied that the disciplinary system 
treats officers differently based on their race or religious affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has had a longstanding practice of very diligently avoiding 
any reference to an officer's race or religion," Lillo said. "During my career, 
the department has bent over backward to be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with more than a month to go before the hearing convenes, Camara's 
latest struggle with the Police Department has become a cause celebre among his 
fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see it as evidence that the LAPD will go to almost any lengths to stifle 
criticism, especially when it comes from African American officers. To them, 
Camara is a courageous critic of LAPD racism and a stalwart advocate for his 
"clients," the officers who have solicited his services when charged with 
violations of LAPD policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under LAPD rules, officers charged with administrative wrongdoing can request 
representation from a colleague free of charge. Camara was first asked to 
represent a fellow officer in 1986 and in recent years has worked as a "defense 
rep" full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Leonard Ross, president of the Oscar Joel Bryant Assn., said he is 
concerned that the department is overzealously pursuing Camara and that its 
efforts have tarnished Camara's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a high-profile case because he's a well-known guy," said Ross, whose 
association represents African American LAPD officers and is conducting a study 
to determine whether they are subjected to unfair discipline. "I have a lot of 
concerns that this has not been properly investigated or adjudicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Among some Internal Affairs authorities and other critics, Camara is 
considered an obstinate, sometimes insubordinate officer who refuses to submit 
to authority and who willingly defies department policy when it suits his 
interests to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Internal Affairs accused Camara of insubordination, a charge that can 
lead to dismissal. In that case, the charge was based on Camara's failure to 
appear at another officer's board of rights, a failure that LAPD investigators 
said was in defiance of the board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Camara was found not guilty of that charge, but he emerged from the hearing 
convinced the department was bent on getting him fired. Some officers who know 
him agree, and even those who are not his friends have their doubts about the 
department's current set of charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's crazy," said one officer with long ties to Camara. "He loves to give 
Internal Affairs hell, and it drives them nuts. But did he try to get his wife 
killed? That's a whole other story." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Ruff, the treasurer of the Los Angeles Police Protective League and a 
longtime acquaintance of Camara, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to question the credibility of these witnesses. Musa was a tenacious 
fighter who went all out for the officers he represented. . . . It would be out 
of character for the individual I know to have done the things that the 
department is suggesting." 
</P>
<P>
 The specific charges against Camara span the period from 1987 to 1992. He is 
accused of trying to get Trejo and two women to kill his ex-wife. He also is 
charged with kidnaping and raping one of those women and letting his ex-wife 
accept welfare benefits to which she was not entitled while they were still 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Camara is facing six counts. A guilty finding on almost any of them 
would surely result in his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting the case for criminal prosecution, district attorney's officials 
cited the unreliability of several witnesses and said it would be difficult to 
get a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Camara committed the 
crimes. The standard at a police disciplinary hearing is lower, however, as 
department commanders must only find that a preponderance of the evidence 
favors a finding of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Camara could be fired for criminal acts, even if prosecutors 
never charge him with those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important case for the department, not just for Musa," Ross said. 
"People will be watching."

BONES OF CONTENTION; SCIENCE: A COUNTY SUPERVISOR HAS SUGGESTED POSSIBLY 
SELLING SOME OF THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM'S WAREHOUSES OF SPECIMENS TO SAVE 
MONEY. BUT STAFFERS SAY THE COLLECTIONS ARE VALUABLE FOR RESEARCH AND USE IN 
FUTURE EXHIBITS. 
</P>

<P>
 Its name is Purussaurus and it is the largest species of crocodile that ever 
lived, a massive-jawed creature that thundered through South America's Amazon 
Basin 6 to 8 million years ago before its kind perished. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one of the Purussaurus left a legacy, a grinning 62-inch, 
half-ton fossilized skull, a cast of which occupies a large space in a storage 
area of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Purussaurus skull has been on display only once since the cast was 
completed in 1991, having then been rotated back to the relative anonymity of 
the museum's collections. It nevertheless forms an important part of the 
museum's work of research, preservation and exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a recent suggestion by a Los Angeles County supervisor that the museum 
could sell some of its collections and save warehousing costs sent the 
sober-minded scientists who work there reeling. It would be like trying to sell 
off the underwater formation that supports the tip of a spectacular iceberg, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To them, the museum functions almost like a huge theatrical production, with a 
cast of thousands in front of and behind the curtains who are equally important 
in putting on a good show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lessons to be learned by identifying and studying collections," 
said Daniel M. Cohen, the museum's deputy director of research and collections, 
sitting in his comfortably lived-in third floor office. "Our exhibits are based 
on collections, our educational programs are based on collections. What we try 
to do is be a window on the world. We're a way that people can come into this 
building and experience something different." 
</P>
<P>
 At the museum's five-story Exposition Park home, only about a quarter of the 
building is used for exhibits, with another quarter housing offices and the 
rest reserved for its vast collections of specimens. More than 45 staffers are 
involved in studying and caring for the collections, with another 20 to 30 
working on specific projects funded by grants or contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants from scientific and private foundations allow the museum to acquire 
some specimens; others are gathered by scientists in their research while some 
large collections are donated. One donated insect collection numbered about 
16,000 specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum maintains four off-site facilities that house millions of 
specimens: hundreds of toe bones of a horse that lived 100,000 years ago and 
whose fossils were found in a cave deposit in northern Mexico; collections of 
seashells and plankton from Southern California shores; shelves of whale, 
porpoise and seal skeletons, and buckets of unsorted sediments from the famed 
Rancho La Brea area bearing who knows what fossil gems. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk through the storage collections and research laboratories of the museum 
offers a glimpse of scientific artistry that the public rarely sees. Although 
few specimens will make it to the big time, like eager understudies waiting for 
their break, they all have a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one reason to have an off-site facility, we bring in specimens that 
do smell a bit," said John Heyning, leading a visitor into a spacious Vernon 
warehouse, pungent with the smell of decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The odoriferous building is where the museum houses its main collection of 
marine mammals and bones of larger terrestrial mammals such as the 
hippopotamus. One area is used for dissections and necropsies. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent among the rows of shelves is the largest specimen in the entire 
museum, the one-ton skull of an adult female blue whale that was struck and 
killed by a container ship in Los Angeles Harbor in 1986. The weeklong recovery 
of the whale's body and acquisition of the skull proved quite a media event, 
generating worldwide coverage. Of less interest to the media hordes has been 
the scientific data collected from the cetacean. 
</P>
<P>
 Study of the shape of the skull helps to discover how the animal produces 
sounds and can help determine its relationship to other types of whales. 
Scientists might also be able to glean insight into the impact of shipping on 
large whales, said Heyning, associate curator of mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 "One big misconception of the off-site facilities is that it is just dead 
storage, but many of the specimens are used in active research," he said, 
noting that a delegation from the National Marine Fisheries Service had 
recently used the facility for training. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyning offers his statement in rebuttal to suggestions that some collections 
simply gather dust. Supervisor Gloria Molina requested that the county's 
Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission study whether it is feasible to 
donate some of the collections to universities and contract out collection 
management services. Budget cutbacks have jeopardized staffing and services at 
the museum, and officials say it is wise to try to trim costs wherever possible 
in the museum's $7-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs about $1.2 million a year in warehousing costs and our concern is 
how to keep (the museums) open seven days a week," said Molina spokesman Robert 
Alaniz. "We are certainly not suggesting that the museum get rid of all its 
collections . . . but there can be a look at what the priorities should be, 
whether research, education, exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 But museum officials argue that a top-flight facility -- Los Angeles' museum 
is considered one of the best in the country -- must strive to provide all 
those functions if it aspires to be anything more than a gallery. They note 
that items in storage today may be in exhibits tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many of the Vernon facility's specimens -- porpoise, seal and sea 
lion skeletons and the like -- will be used to create a major exhibit that is 
scheduled to open in October and then tour for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people see the whole exhibit, it will be very hard to visualize how it 
got there and what the basis of it is, but it wouldn't be possible without the 
collections to draw on," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Museum curators say there are a number of reasons why some items end up on 
display and others do not, including the rarity of a specimen, its quality and 
value to society and who does the choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a curator specializes in deep sea crustaceans, like myself, then that is 
what I'll want to put on exhibit," said curator of marine invertebrates Joel W. 
(Jody) Martin, who is planning an exhibit of rare crabs and shrimps that thrive 
in hot water vents located deep under ocean surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 His collections in the Exposition Park facility number nearly 3 million 
crustaceans, housed in more than 120,000 jars. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's vast collections offer an eclectic mix of the old and historical. 
A second Vernon warehouse is home to a huge selection of historical objects 
that offer a record of how Southern Californians from eras past went about 
their daily lives. There are re-creations of old stores and drive-ins; pickle 
barrels, tables, chairs and old pictures that are preserved.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Los Angeles warehouse contains fossils of mollusks, clams, snails and 
corals, the remains of small plankton and other micro-fossils from Southern 
California and Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 The fourth off-site facility includes archeological materials from the Channel 
Islands, Native American artifacts such as stone tools, utensils, arrowheads 
and bead and shell jewelry. There are military items of historical significance 
and agricultural implements that helped establish California as the fruit and 
vegetable basket of the nation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SIMPSON 
BIOPSY SHOWS NO EVIDENCE OF CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A biopsy of swollen lymph nodes from O.J. Simpson's right armpit shows no 
evidence that he is suffering from cancer, defense attorneys said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, awaiting trail on charges of murdering his former wife and her 
friend, underwent minor diagnostic surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center last 
week because he was suffering from progressive swelling of the nodes and 
drenching night sweats, said his physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga said the biopsy was necessary "to rule out malignancy" after an 
"exhaustive" medical search for infectious causes -- including the HIV virus 
that causes AIDS -- had proved negative. The doctor said Simpson's family has a 
history of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The football great, incarcerated in the Men's Central Jail, was removed from 
his cell before dawn last Thursday for the brief surgical procedure at Cedars. 
He was returned to the cell a few hours later.  
</P>
<P>
 Detective George Ducoulombier, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, said that all expenses incurred in the closely guarded 
transfer and return were charged to Simpson.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTER HOSTS FIRST LADY 
OF ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's actively involved in reforming her country's health care system. In 
October, she is hosting an international women's conference. Her husband is the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Move over Hillary. Meet the first lady of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludmila Ter-Petrossian is the wife of Levon Ter-Petrossian, who was elected 
president in 1991 after Armenia gained its independence. Monday she visited the 
Ararat Home, a community center and retirement home in Mission Hills for 
Armenian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The president and first lady are visiting Southern California -- home to the 
largest population of Armenians outside of Armenia -- as part of a seven-day 
tour to promote economic ties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lady thanked the local organizations that helped Armenia through its 
conflict with Azerbaijan and the devastating earthquake it suffered in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of St. Petersburg, Russia, and not an ethnic Armenian, the first lady 
is known to Armenians and Armenian-Americans as Lucia, the Armenian equivalent 
of her Russian name. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who paid the $20 admission for the luncheon to meet the first lady 
was 19-year-old Tamar Ouzanian of Burbank, who said she admires Ter-Petrossian 
for her down-to-earth demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's refreshing to see," Ouzanian said, delighted to be in the midst of more 
than 600 Armenian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lady presented the Ararat Home with a candleholder of black onyx -- 
an indigenous Armenian mineral -- inscribed with the dates 1915-1995 to 
commemorate the 80th anniversary of the beginning of a genocide by Turks in 
which 1.5 million Armenians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 She also handed out plaques and pins of the intertwined Armenian and American 
flags to representatives of 30 organizations that have given aid to her country 
in recent years. One group honored was the United Armenian Fund, which for the 
last four years has sent a monthly planeload of relief supplies to Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 She also discussed her project to create boarding schools to teach thousands 
of young girls orphaned by the conflict and quake to become nurses. She said 
that although the doctors and hospitals in Armenia are excellent, nurses are 
not as well trained as those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, she met with the staff of UCLA's nursing school to try to 
arrange an exchange program in which Armenian girls would be sent to Los 
Angeles to study and American nurses would go to Armenia.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GTE SAYS 
WORKERS TRIED TO ACCESS SIMPSON FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Telephone company workers curious about the O.J. Simpson murder case have been 
disciplined for trying unsuccessfully to access confidential phone records, a 
GTE spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of action, even though it was unsuccessful, is a violation of the 
code of ethics of GTE," spokesman Larry Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the Thousands Oaks-based company has met with most of the affected 
employees and is administering some forms of discipline, which could range from 
a verbal warning to outright dismissal. He declined to disclose the number of 
workers or type of discipline meted out. Union officials could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the workers did not gain access to the confidential files, because 
the company put certain phone records off limits to all but a handful of 
security officials after the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
MORE HEALTH INSPECTORS MAY FACE REPRISALS, COUNTY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health inspectors who are refusing to drive their personal 
cars in a contract dispute will face longer suspensions and may find their 
bosses doing inspections for them, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 320 inspectors involved in the dispute will meet tonight in Alhambra to 
discuss the future of their job action against the county, including a possible 
restraining order to stop the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began Wednesday, about 50 inspectors have been suspended 
for up to a day for refusing to drive their personal vehicles to assignments. 
The union is seeking a temporary restraining order to curb the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors, who have been working without a contract for nearly two years, 
have not received a cost-of-living increase in three years or a mileage 
increase in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the dispute does not end soon, Oscar Castro, director of environmental 
planning and evaluation for the environmental health unit, said health 
officials will consider sending supervisors into the field to conduct 
inspections.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROWLAND HEIGHTS; MAN 
KILLED IN SCUFFLE WITH OFF-DUTY DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An off-duty sheriff's deputy accidentally shot and killed a possibly 
intoxicated man who challenged him to a fight at a Rowland Heights restaurant, 
a sheriff's spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Thomas Kirsch, 47, was in Whitney's Steak House, 19055 S. Colima Road, 
about 9:30 p.m. Sunday when another patron created a disturbance, said Deputy 
Rich Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The patron, a 29-year-old Rowland Heights man who apparently had been drinking 
heavily, challenged Kirsch to a fight, Erickson said. Hoping to avoid a 
confrontation inside the lounge, Kirsch agreed to walk outside with the man, 
who without provocation knocked the deputy to the ground, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A struggle ensued and Kirsch's handgun accidentally discharged, hitting the 
man once in the upper body, Erickson said. The man died at Brea Community 
Hospital. His name was not released pending notification of relatives. The 
shooting is under investigation.

WARM SPELL LEAVES VALLEY POLICE HOT ON THE TRAIL OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are hot crimes, hot cases and hot tips, but on Monday it was the cops 
who were hot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Van Nuys Division's detective unit, Los Angeles Police Department crime 
solvers were dripping on their paperwork as the inside temperatures climbed to 
more than 90 degrees. Calls to LAPD headquarters at Parker Center pleading for 
air-conditioning repair people went unanswered, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the whole building has called," said the unit's secretary, Prudy 
Young. "We expect it at this point. The hottest day of the year it will go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 It was little solace to the police that Van Nuys wasn't the hottest spot in 
the Valley, with high temperatures of 100 degrees, according to the National 
Weather Service. That honor went to Woodland Hills at 105. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank reached a cool 97 and Newhall hit 104. Lancaster, in the Antelope 
Valley, reported a high of 106. It isn't getting better any time soon. The 
National Weather Service is predicting Valley highs today between 95 and 105 
degrees with only a 15 m.p.h. wind to cool us down. Overnight lows might dip to 
62 to 72 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday should be slightly cooler. Highs Wednesday are expected to be 
between 92 and 102 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers in the Van Nuys station, which is water cooled by a "swamp cooler," 
tried to beat the heat by drinking water, running fans that recirculated the 
hot air and, eventually, adjusting their attire.  
</P>
<P>
 Regulations or no regulations, Young said, by late afternoon the sweltering 
men began removing ties and undoing top buttons. "The women can't do a whole 
heck of a lot other than complain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the detectives, field reporting is the great gender equalizer: men and 
woman are both required to wear jackets, heat or no heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not supposed to unnecessarily expose your weapons when you're working 
in public, which means you wear your coat regardless of temperature," said 
Detective Joel Price of the West Valley Division. "It's something that we know 
we have to do, and we do it. It is not pleasant, I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 But back in the Van Nuys Division, going outside was a pleasant respite. 
Grumbled one detective: "O.J. Simpson got his air conditioning fixed in jail."

A RATTLING EXPERIENCE; VICTIM DESCRIBES HIS ENCOUNTER WITH SNAKE THAT BIT HIM 
IN THE NECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rattlesnake venom was racing through Donald Mathews' veins, causing his neck, 
face and chest to swell like a balloon. His heart was pounding so fast it had 
become a nonstop roar -- he could no longer feel the individual beats. 
</P>
<P>
 As doctors at Antelope Valley Hospital hustled to save his life, the 
64-year-old Leona Valley man felt his throat closing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was gasping for air," he said in an interview Monday. "I realized that if I 
didn't let them get these tubes down my throat I was going to die. So I stopped 
breathing and tried to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he said, the tubes got through, and life-giving oxygen poured 
into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, recuperating at his house in a scenic rural area just west of 
Palmdale, Mathews talked vividly about his brush with death. His run-in with a 
rattler was especially dangerous, experts say, because the reptile bit Mathews 
in the neck as the man was poking his head into the attic of his house. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 95% of the time, snakes sink their fangs into arms, legs, feet and 
hands, snake-bite experts say, and the venom spreads more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Mathews' chest and throat are still black and blue from internal 
bleeding, and his stamina is limited. But the retired trade magazine and 
newspaper editor expects to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first interview since he was bitten, Mathews said he wanted to alert 
residents to the danger of rattlesnakes, which are common in the desert and 
foothill areas of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mathews was home alone, he was able to dial 911 and wait calmly for 
help after the snake bit him. Staying calm helped keep the venom from spreading 
even more quickly, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews attributes his survival to his good physical condition and the quick 
arrival of paramedics. He said he also is grateful to the crew of a rescue 
helicopter, which landed in a field near his house and whisked him to the 
emergency room, and to hospital physicians and nurses, who administered 
anti-venom and other treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they hadn't gotten me out so quickly, my throat would have swollen up to 
the point where I couldn't breathe," he said. "And that would have been it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' ordeal with the rattlesnake began about 1:30 p.m. July 29, a Friday 
afternoon. Mathews had just climbed a stepladder in his kitchen. He opened a 
small door near the skylight to check the mouse and rat traps in his attic. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard a rustling sound, but never saw the snake that bit him. There was no 
pain at first, but he grabbed his throat instinctively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I withdrew my hand and saw the blood in it," Mathews recalled. "That was when 
I knew I was in deep, deep trouble. I lunged off the ladder. It fell against 
the rafters. I landed on my elbow." 
</P>
<P>
 The pain in his elbow was the least of his worries. He could feel his body 
swelling up as the venom worked its way down through his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Still Mathews was able to lower himself into a dining-room chair and dial for 
help. He said he felt like he was in a scene from "Rescue 911," a television 
show he often watches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews was agitated when firefighters arrived. But he was coherent enough to 
tell them where to find the keys to his pickup, which they needed to move him 
to the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 When a sheriff's deputy in the kitchen asked where the snake was now, Mathews 
calmly replied, "It's right there above you." 
</P>
<P>
 The startled deputy jumped back, he said. An animal control officer retrieved 
and killed the reptile later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 After the breathing crisis in the emergency room, Mathews awoke that night in 
the critical care unit, unable to speak because of the swelling and tubes in 
his throat. His family was gathered around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors told my wife they didn't know if my brain would be affected," 
Mathews said. "I couldn't speak, so I started making gestures. I asked for a 
writing pad. . . . For better or worse, I was the same old Don." 
</P>
<P>
 After six days, he was released from the hospital. Since then, the swelling 
has gone down, and Mathews' strength has begun to return. On Monday, he finally 
felt up to having breakfast at a restaurant down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 As he discussed his frightening encounter with the rattler, including those 
moments when he had trouble breathing, Mathews insisted that he had never 
panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a matter of being brave," he said. "It's a matter of appreciating 
life and knowing that we're all going to die sooner or later. I don't have any 
fear of dying -- especially now."

SBA MAILING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LOAN DATA; DISASTER AID: AGENCY DENIES THE 
ACTION WAS PROMPTED BY A SURVEY INDICATING CONFUSION OVER APPLICATION 
PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On the heels of a survey that showed many quake victims did not understand 
Small Business Administration loan procedures, the federal agency announced 
Monday it will send out 313,000 letters offering additional data. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters, which will be sent out by the end of this month, will also 
include toll-free telephone information numbers and notice of the recent 
deadline extension to Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials denied there was a connection between the announcement and the 
results of the agency's own survey that showed 17% of all those who did not 
return applications said they misunderstood the loan procedures and needed more 
information. That percentage represents 51,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials also denied the new program was prompted by criticism from city 
officials and newspaper editorials that pointed out that only 42% of all SBA 
loan applications have been returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy with this return rate," said SBA spokeswoman Rebecca McKenzie. 
"We are constantly looking at ways to make this better. To say they are 
pressuring us is not accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new letter campaign was a victory for City Controller Rick Tuttle, who 
has repeatedly urged federal disaster officials to try to reach the thousands 
of victims who failed to return applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to reach those people who are reaching that point of despair," 
said Tuttle's deputy, Tim Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 10, nearly 506,000 disaster applications had been issued by the 
SBA, but only about 213,000 have been returned, leaving nearly 300,000 
applications outstanding, according to SBA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But SBA officials defended the return rate, saying it is comparable to the 
response they had after disasters such as Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta quake 
and the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA survey, conducted by telephone Aug. 5 through Aug. 8, found that the 
17% who did not return applications were mainly laboring under three 
misconceptions: they didn't know the SBA would lend money to cover the 
earthquake insurance deductibles, they didn't know the original deadline had 
been extended and they simply didn't think they qualified for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the others who did not return applications: 
</P>
<P>
 * 26% said they did not want additional debt or did not need a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 25% said they were not interested and only had minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 20% said they had money of their own or had other funding, such as insurance 
money, to pay for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6% said they had sufficient assistance from FEMA's temporary housing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6% said they could not meet the applications filing requirements, such as 
providing evidence of a positive cash flow or copies of tax returns.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MOST RESIDENTS SAY DOWNTOWN IS A BORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While 80% of Glendale residents consider life in their city "excellent," 
"good" or "very good," only a few say they find interesting things to do 
downtown in the evenings and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are some of the results of a recent survey of 2,178 Glendale residents 
conducted by the city and Glendale Partners, a group of prominent business 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several new entertainment draws downtown, including live theater, 
coffeehouses and even a trendy nightclub, many people still consider Brand 
Boulevard a big bore. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials say they are pleased with the results of the survey, which 
asked residents for their opinion on the past and future of the downtown area. 
The responses will be incorporated into a forthcoming "strategic plan" that 
will be used as a blueprint for future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things the survey showed us was that despite some significant 
negative changes in the economy, attitudes toward Glendale have remained pretty 
positive," said Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, about 41% of residents want to see the downtown 
continue to develop at its current pace, 38% want it to slow down and 21% want 
it to stop.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, 32% said there should be more parking downtown, 29% said more cinemas, 
entertainment venues and nightclubs are needed, 25% said more police are needed 
to keep the area safe, and 20% said the area needs to be kept cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Questionnaires were distributed at a series of "town hall" public meetings on 
the future of downtown Glendale, which began in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is part of a $350,000 project by the Glendale Redevelopment Agency 
and the Glendale Partners to create a communitywide consensus on the direction 
for the future building in downtown Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Partners, an elite business group, has kicked in $125,000 and 
hired Alex Cooper, a New York urban planner, to oversee the study.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; POGS ARE A HIT WITH 25 YOUNG COMPETITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Adam Holden of Chatsworth, who had just rendered a glowing description of 
his latest baseball feat, was asked which he would prefer: winning a Pogs 
tournament or hitting a home run, the 11-year-old didn't even hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Pogs tournament," he said, surprised at even the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the setting: An official Pogs tournament held Saturday at Topanga 
Plaza mall in Canoga Park -- an event that drew the appearance of Bill Hodson, 
the man who brought the Pogs game to mainland America. 
</P>
<P>
 Officiating simultaneous Pogs (or TROV) tournaments at The Broadway department 
stores throughout Southern California and in parts of Arizona, TROV USA sent 
representatives to the Topanga Plaza for an expected showing of at least 150 
players. TROVS is a brand name which refers to treasure trove. 
</P>
<P>
 While only about 25 competitors participated, it still proved to be a 
tension-filled event with one championship match going down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really nervous when we started," exclaimed 10-year-old Michael Crane of 
Chatsworth, a winner of the division for children aged 10 and over. "I've only 
been playing for four months, but I could see myself playing for a long time."  
</P>
<P>
 Faye Chacon of Northridge, a 9-year-old who walked away with the 9-and-under 
division title, beamed, saying, "I've never won anything before." 
</P>
<P>
 Adhering to company president Hodson's promotion of the game as one with "a 
positive impact on all kids who play," TROV USA tournaments feature a prize for 
every child who participates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way everybody walks away with something," explained Hodson. "It keeps 
the fun in the game and teaches the kids sportsmanship . . . how to lose 
gracefully." 
</P>
<P>
 The game -- a cross between marbles and trading cards -- involves tossing a 
plastic "slammer" at a stack of cardboard chips with the aim of getting as many 
as possible to flip over. The Pogs that flip can then be claimed as part of 
your collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 10 artists working on 250 random designs featured on the TROV discs 
and slammers," said Hodson. "The kids like to compete for the different 
designs." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Adam's mother, Michelle Holden, had her hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam did not advance to the second round of tournament play and was walking 
dejectedly back to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, honey, isn't it?" Holden said, consoling him. "It's like losing in 
baseball." ANTONIO OLIVO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; MAN HELD IN ATTACK ON ESTRANGED WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested the estranged husband of a blind, wheelchair-bound woman who 
was sexually assaulted in her home here after her attacker restrained and 
gagged her seeing-eye dog, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the incident Saturday, police arrested West Hills horseback riding 
instructor Terry Foladare, 41, who was being held at the West Valley jail in 
lieu of $300,000, said Detective Harry Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, the 26-year-old victim contacted officers 
Saturday night after first calling a friend for help. Police took her to an 
unidentified hospital to confirm her account, then arrested Foladare at his 
home after she identified him as her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a forced entry at her Reseda Boulevard apartment, and her 
dog's snout had been taped shut while it was restrained in the kitchen, said 
Hollywood and Detective Nancy Severns. 
</P>
<P>
 Severns said the victim, who works with horses, has a broken leg, apparently 
from a work-related injury. The detective said it was unclear whether the 
victim was temporarily wheelchair-bound as a result of her leg injury, or had 
other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Foladare were married three years ago, but had been living apart for 
several months, said Severns. Detectives plan to continue their investigation 
today, she added. LESLIE BERGER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS, CALABASAS; LAND FOR REGIONAL GYM TO BE 
APPRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county is expected to postpone a decision on whether to donate land for a 
regional gymnasium for Agoura Hills and Calabasas until the land is appraised. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors was scheduled to vote today on the 
matter, but is likely instead to grant a continuance until Sept. 13, said Joel 
Bellman, press deputy to Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman wants the county to give the cities 3.7 acres near the Los Angeles 
County sheriff's station at Lost Hills for a gymnasium that would be shared by 
residents of both cities. Free land would make the project more affordable to 
both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a win-win deal for everybody," said Bellman. "This is basically a 
leftover parcel of county land that we really don't need anymore, and there is 
not enough value to make it worth selling." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Gloria Molina has been hesitant to support the idea, fearing 
the county might be giving away valuable real estate in a time of budget cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't necessarily think (the land donation) is a bad idea, but we would 
like to see what the land is worth," said Robert Alaniz, Molina's press deputy. 
"At this point in time we're just asking the question." 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel, along with a parcel on which the sheriff's station now sits -- 
about 12 acres in all -- was appraised at about $9 million in 1989, said Joan 
Ouderkirk, chief deputy director of the county's Internal Services Department, 
which is doing the appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that some of the land in the 3.7-acre parcel, which is next to the 
sheriff's heliport, is steep and has been deemed unsuitable for building. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Brown, Agoura Hills' community services director, said both cities are 
awaiting the supervisors' decision on the land before moving ahead. She said 
there are no formal plans for the project. FRANK MANNING

<P>
 Two men were injured in a drive-by shooting in a west Glendale neighborhood, 
but officers had to track down the victims before they could be sent to 
hospitals for treatment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the men, ages 19 and 24, parked their car in the 1600 
block of Lake Street at about 12:15 a.m. Sunday.Two other men in a 
light-colored Buick Monte Carlo pulled up alongside them. One got out and began 
yelling, waving his arms and brandishing a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses reported hearing three or four shots and seeing the body of 
one of the victims in the street. But officers arriving at the scene found only 
a pool of blood in the street in front of Franklin Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the downed man had been pulled back into his car and was driven 
away, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness jotted down the victims' license plate number and police were able 
to trace the car to a nearby apartment building. The 19-year-old man suffered 
multiple gunshot wounds and was taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center 
for treatment. The 24-year-old man suffered a gunshot wound to his right 
shoulder and was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VALLEY VILLAGE; RESIDENT WANTS TO SAVE 2 WALNUT TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judd Bernard is angry that the city plans to cut down two old walnut trees on 
his Valley Village property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Public Works says the trees are a safety hazard 
and should be cut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received a complaint, we responded to the complaint, we felt it was 
justified," said Tom Essington, who runs the department's street tree division. 
Both trees, one of them 45 feet tall with limbs that hang over the street, are 
starting to rot and could topple, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard, who was notified Wednesday of the city's plans to remove the trees, 
will have a hearing before the Board of Public Works on the matter before the 
trees are cut down, Essington said.  
</P>
<P>
 Essington said the city will repeat an offer it made earlier, which Bernard 
and his wife, Patricia Casey, refused: The two can agree to bear the 
responsibility should the trees topple over and cause injuries or damage. The 
city also wants Bernard and Casey to have the trees bonded, at a cost of about 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard, who lives at the corner of Agnes Avenue and Addison Street, argues 
that a tree expert he consulted believes the trees can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The expert, Robert Wallace of Tree Life Concern Inc. in Canoga Park, could not 
be reached for comment. But in a recent letter to Casey, Wallace wrote that one 
tree, on the Agnes Avenue side, is in "good health and vigor." 
</P>
<P>
 He found the second tree, on the Addison Street side, to be in "fair 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
 The trees could be made safe by trimming deadwood and reinforcing them with 
cables, according to Wallace, who once worked for the city's tree division. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 24 other large old walnut trees within a block and a half of his 
house, Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he offered to have his trees reinforced to make them safe, but 
the city refused. 
</P>
<P>
 But Essington says he's not swayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the trees, you can reach your whole arm inside" the trunk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Robert Wallace, and I have a lot of respect for his knowledge, but no, 
I'm not convinced," Essington said. "I've been in this business 27 years . . . 
and I don't feel safe with it." FRANK MANNING

COMMISSIONER CALLS FOR STUDY OF LAPD SHOOTINGS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: REQUEST 
FOLLOWS REPORT THAT OFFICERS WERE CITED FOR MISTAKES IN THREE-FOURTHS OF CASES 
SINCE 1989. BUT COMMISSION MEMBERS GENERALLY SUPPORT DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Facing criticism over the frequency of mistakes in officer-involved shootings, 
Los Angeles Police Commission officials generally defended the department's 
record Monday but ordered an immediate review of records to determine whether a 
problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of training has been recommended (after shootings)? What kind of 
repeated problems are we seeing?" asked Police Commissioner Gary Greenebaum. 
"Those are the kinds of things I want to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, Greenebaum asked Police Commission staff members to begin a 
computer review of statistical patterns in Los Angeles Police Department 
shooting records, addressing issues that were raised in an article Sunday in 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal LAPD records showed officers were cited for potentially 
life-threatening mistakes in three of every four shootings since 1989, with 
training ordered after more than half the 694 shootings and formal discipline 
ordered in another quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer, for instance, had to undergo training after firing at a fleeing 
burglar from nearly a football field away on a Downtown street. An undercover 
detective, unable to unfasten his seat belt, was cited for shooting out his 
windshield to try to stop a suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty officer accidentally shot a friend through the thigh in trying to 
give her a bullet from his .38-caliber pistol as a goodby memento. And another 
officer shot a colleague in the back as they converged on a suspect in the dark 
without turning on their flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said the findings "generated a lot of 
interest" among city officials and that he plans to introduce a motion in the 
Public Safety Committee requesting a formal explanation from the Police 
Department. "We want to make sure this isn't just shunted aside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But LAPD Cmdr. David J. Gascon, who fielded press calls on the issue Monday, 
defended the department's record and said he believed it was misleading to 
suggest that most officer shootings are problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Out of "perhaps millions or at least hundreds of thousands of contacts" that 
occur each year between police and the public, only a small fraction lead to 
armed confrontations and officers should be commended for that, Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr., head of the five-member 
civilian body that oversees the department, was on vacation Monday and 
unavailable for comment. But Commissioner Art Mattox echoed Gascon's remarks, 
saying that retraining for an officer should not be interpreted to mean a 
mistake necessarily was made during a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Greenebaum agreed, saying that the department has acted 
responsibly in pointing up problem areas among its officers and ordering 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easy thing to do, and what used to happen at the department from 
everything I know, is that when mistakes were made, you covered it up," he 
said. That no longer happens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum added, however, that he is anxious to see the findings of the 
commission's review . "If we see the same problems keep happening over and over 
again with no change in policy, then I'm deeply concerned," he said.

TAINTED SOIL TO BE SHIPPED TO TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After inciting a fracas in two states, hundreds of tons of DDT-tainted soil 
dug from a South Bay neighborhood will travel by truck to Texas to be 
incinerated, officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision comes after Arizona residents raised vociferous objections to 
having the soil stored in Phoenix, with some insisting that it be shipped back 
to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, EPA officials are clearly hoping that an incinerator near Port Arthur, 
Tex., will prove to be the final resting place for the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put this issue to bed," said EPA assistant regional counsel John 
Lyons, who has spent weeks negotiating the disposal of the 1,000 tons of dirt 
contaminated with the banned pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of local pressures, the federal government faces an Aug. 29 deadline 
to have the 65 sealed bins of soil removed from storage facilities in Phoenix 
and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Some soil is stored in Long Beach under an emergency state permit that expired 
Monday and that the state has extended by two weeks. Meanwhile, the EPA says it 
has promised Arizona officials that the remaining soil will be out of their 
state by Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The contaminated soil has touched off concern since the spring day it was 
unearthed behind two homes in an unincorporated area east of Torrance during an 
EPA cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Because chunks of pure DDT were mixed in with the soil, the EPA concluded that 
the banned pesticide came from the former DDT-manufacturing Montrose Chemical 
Corp., once located three-tenths of a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montrose maintains that the federal government's claim is based on 
circumstantial evidence. So lawyers for the two sides struck a compromise last 
month, agreeing that the soil would be moved from Long Beach to a Phoenix 
storage facility for up to three months so that it could be tested by Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 When opposition flared in Arizona, the EPA halted the soil shipments, leaving 
38 bins in Phoenix and 27 in Long Beach. The agency notified Montrose on Monday 
that it has arranged to have the soil burned at a hazardous waste facility 
operated by Chemical Waste Management Inc. near Port Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unclear is whether Montrose will get a chance to sample the dirt as it 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of direct evidence of what's in the soil, the soils are it. Once 
they are destroyed, there will be no further ability to sample them," said 
attorney Karl Lytz of Latham & Watkins, the law firm representing Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 But the EPA's Lyons countered: "Frankly, our primary commitment is to see that 
the material leaves the temporary storage sites and gets to Port Arthur and 
gets treated as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA plans to charge Montrose for the expected $850,000 cost of 
incineration, although Montrose has not said it will pay.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; FIRST LADY OF ARMENIA VISITS ETHNIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's actively involved in reforming her country's health care system. In 
October, she is hosting an international women's conference. Her husband is the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Move over Hillary. Meet the first lady of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludmila Ter-Petrossian, the wife of Armenia's second freely elected president 
in 600 years, on Monday visited Ararat Home, a community center and retirement 
home for Armenian Americans in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, and first lady are visiting Southern 
California -- home to the largest population of Armenians outside of Armenia -- 
as part of a seven-day tour to promote economic ties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She thanked the local organizations that have helped Armenia through its 
conflict with Azerbaijan and the devastating earthquake it suffered in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of St. Petersburg, Russia, and not an ethnic Armenian, Ter-Petrossian 
is known to Armenians and Armenian Americans as Lucia, the Armenian equivalent 
of her Russian name. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who paid the $20 admission fee for the luncheon to meet 
Ter-Petrossian was 19-year-old Tamar Ouzanian of Burbank, who said she admires 
Ter-Petrossian for her down-to-earth demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's refreshing to see," Ouzanian said, delighted to be in the midst of more 
than 600 Armenian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor for us to have her here," said Alice Bilezikijian, who drove 
from Laguna Hills to see the first lady, whose actions she has been following 
in Armenian-American newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian presented to Ararat Home a candleholder made from black onyx -- 
an indigenous Armenian mineral -- inscribed with the dates 1915 to 1995 to 
commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide by the Turks, in 
which 1.5 million people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 She also handed out plaques and pins of the Armenian and U. S. flags 
intertwined to representatives of 30 organizations that have aided her country 
through the tumultuous events. One group honored was the United Armenian Fund, 
which for the last four years has sent a monthly plane full of relief supplies 
to Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian also discussed her project to create boarding schools to teach 
thousands of young girls orphaned by the conflict and quake to become nurses. 
She said that although the doctors and hospitals in Armenia are of excellent 
quality, the nurses are not as well-trained as those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she arrived at Ararat Home, Ter-Petrossian met with the staff of UCLA's 
nursing school to try to arrange an exchange program through which Armenian 
girls would be sent to Los Angeles to study and trained U. S. nurses would be 
sent to Armenian hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Armenia, girls don't want to go to nursing school," said Hermine Janoyan, 
one of the five members of the Ladies Auxiliary to Ararat Home. "Nurses are 
looked down on," she said, illustrating the problems she has faced in her 
two-year effort to develop the nursing schools. 
</P>
<P>
 While the first lady is committed to advancing women's rights in Armenia 
through such events as the international women's conference -- the first of its 
kind to be held in Armenia -- she said she does not want to present herself as 
a role model. "I want to learn from the young women," Ter-Petrossian said. "All 
Armenian women endure many hardships, and we have to establish and enforce our 
independent government." MAKI BECKER

 Los Angeles County health inspectors who are refusing to drive their personal 
cars during a contract dispute will face longer suspensions and may find their 
bosses doing inspections for them, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 320 inspectors involved in the dispute will meet tonight in Alhambra to 
discuss the future of their job action against the county, including a possible 
restraining order to stop the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began Wednesday, about 50 inspectors have been suspended 
for up to a day for refusing to drive their personal vehicles to assignments. 
The union is seeking a temporary restraining order to curb the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors, who have been working without a contract with the Department 
of Health Services for nearly two years, have not received a cost of living 
increase in three years or a mileage increase in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These suspensions are arbitrary and capricious," said Jim Somers, a 
negotiator for the Los Angeles County Assn. of Environmental Health 
Specialists, the union representing the inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Somers said. "They're simply trying to stonewall us with these phony 
suspensions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oscar Castro, director of environmental planning and evaluation for the 
Environmental Health unit, said the suspensions are legitimate and are going to 
increase. For each day that an inspector doesn't drive his or her car to 
assignments, he said, a day's suspension will result.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will be progressive," Castro said. "They are refusing a direct order to 
drive their vehicles to their assignments." 
</P>
<P>
 If the dispute does not end soon, Castro said health officials will also 
consider sending supervisors out into the field to conduct inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be problems getting supervisors to cooperate. At least one 
supervisor, who refused to be identified, said he would not comply with an 
order to suspend a worker, saying that he did not believe he had the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the suspensions, about 320 inspectors have continued to investigate 
health complaints at eateries, supermarkets and other locations by walking, 
bicycling or riding public transportation throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, only about 5% of inspections are being done, something which 
worries officials such as Castro. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CAAN WON'T FACE GUN CHARGE, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles prosecutors disclosed Monday that actor James Caan will not face a 
misdemeanor charge for allegedly brandishing a gun during an argument with a 
rap musician in North Hollywood earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really can't go into the facts of the matter.There is simply insufficient 
evidence to support a conviction," said Richard A. Schmidt, supervising deputy 
at the city attorney's Van Nuys branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan's attorney, Howard L. Weitzman, said he was pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is the appropriate decision, given the facts as they learned," 
Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan was booked March 10 after musician Doc Rapper, whose real name is Derek 
Lee, accused the actor of bringing out a gun during an argument in an apartment 
building parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan, who was at the complex to visit his brother, was questioned by a city 
attorney hearing officer at a closed meeting on July 27. The city attorney's 
decision not to file charges was based in part on the hearing officer's 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor, however, still faces a lawsuit filed last month by Leesa Anne 
Roland, who says she began dating Caan last year. Roland alleges that Caan beat 
and choked her at a Century City hotel earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Weitzman has confirmed that Caan voluntarily entered a 
drug-rehabilitation center last month, although he would not name the facility 
nor say when the actor would be released. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be inappropriate to say where, but I can say that the treatment is 
going at such a pace that he will be out sooner than we expected," Weitzman 
said. JULIO MORAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: INITIAL SAFETY STUDY OF BUILDINGS FUNDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Governor's Office of Emergency Services has announced that it has funded 
the first phase of an $18-million study to develop guidelines for the 
inspection and repair of steel frame buildings for earthquake damage and to set 
standards for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year study will be underwritten by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and conducted by three technical groups: the Structural Engineers Assn. 
of California, the Applied Technology Council and the California Universities 
for Research in Earthquake Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Mullins, spokesman for the OES, said the first phase, at a cost of $1.8 
million, is expected to last about four months and will set guidelines for 
inspection and repair of steel frame buildings damaged in the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of the OES study will include physical testing of mock-ups to 
come up with design standards for new construction. DOUG SMITH

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; POWER SHIFT FEARED WITH PROPOSED ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Close, the president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., says his 
main concern about a proposal to make Sherman Oaks a redevelopment area is the 
potential loss of local control. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sherman Oaks has been declared a disaster area rather than a blighted 
area, the city Community Redevelopment Agency may not be subject to state laws 
that would otherwise require it to submit its plan to a citizens advisory 
committee, according to state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens advisory committee known as a Project Area Committee could help the 
CRA identify which construction and reconstruction projects should be done, and 
help set priorities among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and CRA officials will discuss the benefits and potential problems of 
the proposed redevelopment zone at a community meeting at 8 p.m. Wednesday, at 
Union Federal Savings Bank, 13300 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. KAY HWANGBO

FATHER CHARGED WITH CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who left his 20-month-old son unattended in a closed car in Reseda 
during the weekend heat wave was charged Monday with one count of felony child 
abuse, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Fischer, 34, of Paramount was arrested about 4:30 p.m. Sunday after he 
allegedly left the boy in the car while he went into a record store, said Sandi 
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby, Gibbons said, saw the child in the car and called police. The boy 
has been released into his mother's custody, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer is being held on $50,000 bail in Van Nuys Jail, Gibbons said. If 
convicted, he would face a maximum of six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer is a Los Angeles Unified School District teacher in South Los Angeles, 
according the the district attorney's office.

MAN JAILED IN RAPE OF WOMAN, 76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old North Hollywood man was arrested Monday on suspicion of raping 
and robbing a 76-year-old woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Fullard was arrested at his house in the 6400 block of Denny Street after 
clues left at the scene of the crime led police to him, said Detective Gary 
Barthelmess of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Barthelmess would not disclose what evidence police recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was sleeping at 5:15 a.m. on Friday when an intruder climbed through 
the open window of her first-floor apartment and attacked her, police said. The 
intruder also made off with some cash and jewelry totaling about $200 dollars, 
Barthelmess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullard is expected to be charged today with sexual assault, burglary and 
robbery, Barthelmess said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly victim is staying with relatives and told police she will not 
return to her former home, Barthelmess said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically she's OK," Barthelmess said. "Emotionally, she's highly 
traumatized by the incident."

22 YOUTH AGENCIES GIVEN $130,000 BY L.A. TIMES FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In response to the Northridge earthquake, more than $130,000 from the Los 
Angeles Times Fund was given to 22 youth agencies in the San Fernando Valley 
and other quake-affected areas on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will go toward earthquake repairs at the various facilities, 
including an indoor swimming pool and dance studio, in addition to replacing 
damaged equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The award in the greatest amount -- $15,000 -- was given to My Friend's Place, 
a Hollywood organization providing homeless youth with a drop-in center and 
several outreach efforts, including substance abuse, legal assistance and 
educational programs and a medical clinic. The funds will be used to help 
repair the front and back walls of the center located on North Cherokee Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1944, the Times Fund has granted more than $15 million to nonprofit 
agencies in Southern California that serve underprivileged youth. Due to a 
successful fund-raising year, special one-time grants for earthquake damage 
were possible, said Jeffrey S. Klein, president of The Times Valley and Ventura 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't have a building to work out of that's safe or computers that 
don't work or your food panty is empty because of the earthquake, your program 
can't go on," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club of the Santa Clarita Valley was given $12,000. The 
Pacific Lodge Boys' Home, San Fernando Valley Child Guidance Clinic and the 
YWCA of Greater Los Angeles each received $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In other awards, the Boys and Girls Club of San Fernando Valley received 
$7,000, and the Volunteer League of the San Fernando Valley and Five Acres, a 
treatment center in Altadena for abused and neglected children, each were 
granted $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley Branch of the YWCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles received $5,600 
and the Human Services Network was given $5,365. Grants of $5,000 were awarded 
the Children's Hunger Fund, Mid San Fernando Valley Branch of the YMCA of 
Metropolitan Los Angeles, Weingart East LA YMCA, San Fernando Valley Girl Scout 
Council, Boy Scouts of America Western LA County Council and the Lula 
Washington Contemporary Dance Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Inter-Agency Drug Abuse Recovery Programs were given $3,600, 
Optimist Youth Homes were awarded $3,467 and El Proyecto Del Barrio received 
$3,000. The North Valley Family YMCA and the Assistance League of Whittier were 
each given $2,000 and the Angeles Girl Scout Council received $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times also anticipates giving Southern California nonprofit organizations 
more than $250,000 in profits from its "4:31" earthquake book within a month, 
Klein said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOY, 4, WHO WAS PULLED FROM BOTTOM OF HOT TUB 
DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 4-year-old boy who fell into an elevated hot tub and was under water for 
several minutes before he was noticed by his siblings who were swimming in a 
nearby pool has died, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Nyerges died between 6 and 7 p.m. Saturday at Kaiser Foundation 
Hospital, where he had been in a coma since the accident Aug. 4, said hospital 
spokeswoman Linda Quon. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was being taught to swim by his five older brothers and sisters when 
the accident occurred at the family's Placerita Canyon home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason apparently fell into the four-feet-deep water when he reached for a toy 
gun at the bottom of the spa. Because the hot tub was above the pool, Jason's 
siblings couldn't see that he had fallen into the water even though they were 
only a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler was in the hot tub between five and 15 minutes before he was 
discovered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held sometime later this week at Our Lady of 
Perpetual Help Church in Newhall, said Gil Nyerges, Jason's father. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 50 Southland children die each year in accidental drownings, 
according to Dr. Stephen Johnson, director of Kaiser's pediatric intensive care 
units. Most of the deaths result from stepping into back-yard pools and hot 
tubs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem in Southern California," said Johnson. "It's the No. 1 
preventable cause of death for children under 5 years of age." 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents usually occur when parents are distracted or away from a pool area, 
sometimes for only the few seconds it takes to answer a phone call, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although locked gates and pool covers are helpful, they can sometimes give 
parents a false sense of security. Swim lessons for small children are also of 
minimal help, because a youngster won't usually remember them, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to prevent drownings is constant adult supervision," Johnson 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CHP OFFICER SAYS SHE TRIED TO SHOOT ATTACKER; 
HEARING: AMY BONILLA TESTIFIES THAT HER GUN JAMMED AFTER PALMDALE MAN LUNGED AT 
HER DURING TRAFFIC STOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Amy Bonilla tried to shoot the man who 
attacked her after she stopped him for speeding on the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
but her gun jammed two of the three times she pulled the trigger, the officer 
testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feared for my life," Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing at Newhall Municipal Court, Bonilla said she drew 
her baton, then her gun, a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson semiautomatic, because 
her attacker "was so big." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Arnett Coleman, 33, of Palmdale, is accused of beating Bonilla, 28, 
during an Aug. 1 traffic stop, punching her repeatedly in the head and face and 
trying to grab her gun until passersby restrained him. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman is about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs more than 200 pounds. 
Bonilla is about 5 feet, 4 inches tall and 135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge H. Keith Byram ruled after the hearing that enough evidence was 
presented to try Coleman for attempting to murder a law enforcement officer. A 
trial date was set for Aug. 29 in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Bonilla, her eyes still bruised from the incident two 
weeks earlier, calmly told prosecuting attorney Craig Richman that Coleman's 
size and refusal to follow her instructions made her afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, a five-year veteran of the CHP's Newhall office, said she pulled 
Coleman over after timing his green 1977 Cadillac northbound at more than 80 
m.p.h. Coleman stopped along the right shoulder of the road and quickly got out 
of the the car, then got back in the vehicle when she instructed him to do so, 
Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time someone jumps out of their vehicle like that -- I don't know how to 
explain it -- you're alert to that," Bonilla testified. "It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla said she spoke through the open passenger-side window, asking Coleman 
repeatedly for his license and registration. The Palmdale man twice leaned over 
and reached under the passenger seat of the green Cadillac during the traffic 
stop, Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators later found a loaded .22-caliber revolver under the passenger 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman took the car's pink slip out of the glove compartment, crumpled it and 
threw in on the floor of the car. Then she asked him for the car keys, and he 
got out and started walking around the vehicle, Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer said she pulled out her baton after Coleman ignored repeated 
commands to turn around, and continued to walk "aggressively" toward her. "Put 
your hands on me. Put your hands on me," Coleman reportedly said to Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla held the baton in a combat position, similar to a baseball bat, but 
dropped it to draw her gun when Coleman lunged from about three feet away, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two grappled over the gun with Bonilla firing and missing Coleman with a 
single shot. Coleman tried to twist the weapon toward her, but she was able to 
get it pointed back at him, Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to fire again when it was pointed at his stomach and nothing 
happened," Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman kept struggling for the gun with his left hand as he punched her in 
the forehead with his right hand, Bonilla said. She was knocked to the ground 
on the third blow, and tried to release the gun's magazine so it would have no 
bullets if the suspect pulled it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla said she had tucked herself into a fetal position, wrapping her hands 
and knees around the gun to keep her grip on it. But Coleman continued to hit 
her, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 At that point Jim Clark, a passing limousine driver, appeared and pulled 
Coleman off of her, Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla managed to stand and tried a third time to fire the gun, but it would 
not shoot. Other motorists, including two off-duty Burbank police officers, 
subdued Coleman, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the altercation, Bonilla was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital, where she received 16 stitches and was treated by a plastic surgeon 
for three cuts to her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman did not testify Monday, which is typical during a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Public defender John Ponist, Coleman's attorney, noted some discrepancies 
between Bonilla's statements at the hearing and in the initial police report 
taken after the incident. Most notably, he said, the report didn't mention any 
attempt by Coleman to reach under the passenger seat where the loaded handgun 
was later found. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla has not yet returned to work. She said she has suffered from headaches 
several times a day.

<P>
 Six people who rescued a California Highway Patrol officer from an attacker 
she had stopped for speeding on the Antelope Valley Freeway were hailed as 
heroes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Commissioner Maurice Hannigan also applauded Officer Amy Bonilla for 
remembering her training and holding onto her gun even as she was overpowered 
and repeatedly struck by a man who was allegedly high on PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald A. Coleman, 33, of Palmdale has been charged with the attempted murder 
of a law enforcement officer as a result of the 8 a.m. Aug. 1 attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they found a loaded revolver and an open bottle of wine in 
Coleman's car. Coleman is a parolee with several convictions for drug, theft 
and weapons offenses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had her rescuers arrived a few seconds later, Bonilla might have been killed, 
witnesses said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a press conference Monday at the CHP's Newhall station, Bonilla told 
the four motorists and two Burbank police officers who came to her aid, "Thank 
you for saving my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer suffered cuts to her face that required stitches and plastic 
surgery and has not reported back to duty since the attack. "I'm feeling much 
better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ceremony, the CHP presented commendations to the six men who came 
to Bonilla's aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, who at 205 pounds outweighs Bonilla by nearly 75 pounds, allegedly 
attacked her after she pulled him over for speeding. The first to come to her 
aid was motorist James A. Clark, a 41-year-old former bouncer and security 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who was driving a limousine for a friend, stopped 80 feet from the 
scuffle and ran to help Bonilla. "He's always doing this sort of thing," said 
Clark's wife, Elisa. She said she worries about his tendency to step into 
fights. 
</P>

 "My thought was just to get him off of her," said Clark, who is 6 feet, 5 
inches tall and weighs 220 pounds. Clark, of Lancaster, broke his wrist after 
he pulled Coleman off Bonilla and slipped. Fortunately, other motorists had 
also come to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even look to see if there was any traffic coming," said Mark Wright, 
24, of Lancaster, who stopped on the other side of the highway, grabbed a 
flashlight and ran to the scene. Joining Wright were Dan and Tom White, two 
brothers from Agua Dulce on their way to work in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The two off-duty Burbank police officers were driving by in separate cars. 
Burbank Officer Brent Ambrose was southbound on the freeway when he saw Bonilla 
struggling with Coleman. He had to make a U-turn 100 yards away. "It seemed to 
take forever to get to her," Ambrose said.  
</P>
<P>
 As the White brothers grabbed one of Coleman's arms, Ambrose put handcuffs on 
the other wrist. By that time, nearly all traffic had stopped and more people 
ran over to help Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really surprised at the number of civilians who got involved," said 
Ambrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something to see, that so many people came to her aid," said Jeffrey 
Campbell, the other Burbank police officer. He got to the scene just after 
Coleman was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan White said Bonilla never let go of her gun as she endured blow after blow 
to her face. "She just concentrated on holding onto the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Had she let go of the gun, Dan White said he was sure Bonilla would have been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thankfully, nobody got killed," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; 
QUAKE-TORN HOSPITAL GETS $10-MILLION GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The W. M. Keck Foundation has donated $10 million in grant money to help 
redesign St. Johns Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, where inpatient 
services have been halted since the facility was severely damaged in the 
January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past seven months, the 501-bed facility offered outpatient care while 
the hospital's Main and South wings are being repaired.Those wings are 
scheduled to reopen Oct. 3, with 233 beds. The North Wing, the hospital's most 
severely damaged, was razed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keck Foundation gift, the largest ever recommended by the Foundation's 
Southern California Grant Program Committee, is earmarked for architectural 
engineering and strategic planning studies needed to build a "modern health 
campus of the 21st Century," according to Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka, 
hospital president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 What that new health care facility will look like -- and what functions it 
will serve -- are still undefined, according to Robert O. Klein, executive 
director of St. Johns Hospital and Health Center Foundation, the fund-raising 
arm of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, which cannot be used for repairs to the old facility, also will 
help preserve existing research and technological development at the hospital.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOLS 
MAY ACQUIRE ENERGY-SAVING BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District hopes to receive up to 10 
energy-efficient school buses by participating in a statewide program that is 
demonstrating the new environmentally-friendly vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have recommended that the school board pay a consultant 
$3,300 to write a grant proposal to the California Energy Commission to get the 
new buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will vote on the expenditure at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The new buses would be a major boost for the school district's transportation 
fleet, which has deteriorated in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the school board approved spending $259,000 to purchase several 
badly needed vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, four school buses, seven maintenance vehicles and a delivery 
truck have been taken out of the fleet because they are beyond repair, a 
district report said.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: SEEKING THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION FOR HEALTH CARE; POLICY: 
LOCAL RESIDENTS UNFORTUNATELY RARELY HEAR OR DEBATE THE ALTERNATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAUNCEY A. ALEXANDER, Chauncey A. Alexander is professor/lecturer at Cal 
State Long Beach and founder of the Health Care Council of United Way. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health care arguments have become the "Theater of the Absurd" as the contest 
for the minds of the public nears congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton health plan, with its "managed competition" approach, puts a bold 
face on moderate administrative changes, while congressional legislative 
siblings foster media battles over lesser Band-Aid measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, California's frustrated consumers are trying to deal with the 
system, not the symptoms, via the State Single-Payer Initiative, Proposition 
186. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Orange County residents rarely hear or debate genuine system 
alternatives. Take, for example, the "employer-mandate" controversy. Arguments 
range from opposition to required participation. Local residents do not realize 
they pay anyway since business costs are normally transferred to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where the eventual compromises lead, employer participation will be 
required because it's the system we have. It was World War II, with its wage 
and price controls, that stimulated employer health plans as alternative salary 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, 17 million Americans experienced a universal health care 
system in the military, creating advocates for universal health services. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, universal health care proposals by President Harry Truman were 
defeated by a vitriolic campaign of the American Medical Assn. Later, wage and 
price controls by President Richard Nixon in the early '70s cemented this 
deferred wages pattern into place. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County this meant that large employers with employee health plans 
inherited the cost-shifting of the '80s, the triple play from federal to state 
to county to hospitals and physicians. Most local small businesses with no 
health plans, in effect, transferred the health care costs of their "working 
poor" via increased provider fees to insured employees. 
</P>
<P>
 This cost-shifting effect was exacerbated by elimination of Orange County's 
public hospital by the Board of Supervisors through sale to UCI Medical Center 
in the '70s.  
</P>
<P>
 This government and small business cost-shifting, along with increased 
privatization of health services, made Fluor, Rockwell International, TRW and 
other major Orange County employers the local "health philanthropists." Their 
costs went to more than $4,200 per employee, among the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many large employers sought relief through tightly restricted contracts with 
HMOs, physician groups, or by direct self-insurance negotiation with hospitals 
and physicians. This brought some temporary relief but did not alter the basic 
system of fragmented services, crowding of hospital emergency rooms, escalating 
costs and unserved thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 So "employer mandates" was born out of the partial system we built for 
ourselves. Orange County residents have not realized the burden health care 
administration and its consequent distractions puts on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of a system where businesses are relieved of this burden. Costly 
administration does not contribute to the widget production of a company. 
Millions of hours and billions of dollars expended in the employer-based system 
could be released to increase the productive capacity of Orange County 
businesses for competition in today's international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, employer health administration would have to be phased out by a new 
system. The Clinton health proposal is a very modest start. California's 
single-payer initiative is a more cost-effective step, though not the final 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, direct payments to health providers from a designated Health 
Security Fund financed by a progressive tax, from 4% to 7%, will allow the U.S. 
to achieve its claim of "the world's best health system." And, at less cost and 
with no need for in-between paper pushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday there will be no one between Americans and their health services when 
the human right for good health is adopted.

PLO CRACKS DOWN, ARRESTS ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS IN GAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization struck back Monday at Hamas, the Islamic 
extremist group that has endangered the PLO's self-government agreement with 
Israel by carrying out bold shooting attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ordered Palestinian police to arrest Hamas 
activists after the group claimed responsibility for killing an 18-year-old 
Israeli and wounding six others in attacks Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police made overnight sweeps through the Gazan communities of Deir al Balah 
and Khan Yunis; they arrested more than a dozen suspected Hamas members Monday, 
Palestinian sources said. Mahmoud Azar, leader of Hamas in Gaza, and his 
spokesman, Muhsan abu Tahaha, were called in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Cabinet met all last night to take up measures that will take the 
perpetrators to justice and will prevent and preempt operations like this from 
happening in the future," Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian Authority planning 
minister, said in an interview with Israeli army radio. "We recognize very much 
that security here is our responsibility, and we are taking it very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown won immediate praise from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who 
warned before the arrests were announced that Hamas' attacks jeopardized 
Israel's negotiations with the PLO on extending self-government throughout the 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable we will continue the process without seeing on the part 
of the Palestinian Authority a serious effort to deal with those terrorist 
elements who are known for claiming responsibility for carrying out terror," 
Rabin told reporters after touring the area at the Kissufim junction in Gaza 
where Hamas gunmen opened fire twice Sunday on Israeli cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks underscored a fundamental dilemma facing Arafat as he seeks to 
consolidate his administration's authority in Gaza and Jericho and to persuade 
Israel that the PLO can keep the peace throughout the West Bank, one Israeli 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult for the Palestinians to arrest their own people, and I can 
understand that," said Health Minister Ephraim Sneh, a confidant of Rabin, in 
an interview with The Times. "It is difficult for our own soldiers to arrest 
our own people -- such as settlers in the territories -- when they have to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has handled Hamas gingerly since returning to Gaza last month to 
personally supervise the Palestinian administration's establishment there and 
in Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaza is a stronghold of extremist Islamic movements, and many Gazans are 
quietly sympathetic with their attacks on Israeli settlers, soldiers and 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 There have not been definitive estimates of Hamas' membership, though it may 
run into the hundreds; Israeli officials, however, said Monday that not more 
than 50 Hamas members are actively engaged in attacks on Israelis. But the PLO 
agreement with Israel to pursue and apprehend anyone who carries out such 
attacks is widely unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath, in an interview Sunday night on Israeli television, acknowledged that 
the Palestinian Authority has found it difficult to disarm extremist elements. 
"It must be done in the proper political atmosphere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin, under pressure himself from rightist political parties who on 
Monday declared the agreement with the PLO a failure that is endangering 
Israeli security, insisted that Arafat act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not see a serious effort on the side of the Palestinian Authority to 
deal with those who not only politically oppose the agreement (but) who try to 
destroy it, sabotage it through terror activities against Israelis," he said at 
his news conference. "We are demanding from the political and the security 
forces of the Palestinian Authority to carry out their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 To increase pressure on Arafat, Israel postponed the planned opening Monday of 
safe passages that will enable PLO officials to travel on certain Israeli roads 
from Gaza to Jericho without being stopped and searched by Israeli security 
forces. Rabin also said the pace of negotiations to quickly transfer five areas 
of authority to the Palestinians in the territories -- health, taxation, 
education and culture, social welfare and tourism -- would slow unless Arafat 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath and Maj. Gen. Danny Rothschild, coordinator of activities in the 
territories for Israel, met at the Erez checkpoint Monday, on the border 
between Gaza and Israel, to resume talks on transfer of more authority to the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is to meet Wednesday in Egypt with 
Shaath for further talks. Shaath has expressed hope that Israel will transfer 
the five areas of authority under discussion by the month's end, but Israeli 
officials said Monday that they doubt negotiations will be completed so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel sent more troops to guard roads linking Jewish settlements in northern 
Gaza with Israel and discussed with the Palestinian police better ways to 
jointly patrol the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli who died Sunday, Ron Soval, 18, of Beersheba, was the first 
Israeli civilian to be killed in Gaza since Israel withdrew its troops in May 
from most of Gaza. But Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, commander of Israeli forces for 
Gaza, said there have been 39 shooting incidents since the agreement took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Three soldiers have been killed in Gaza; 25 have been wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamas attacks Sunday were unusually bold, even for a group that has made 
its mark by carrying out risky assaults on Israeli soldiers and civilians. In 
the morning, a gunman reportedly stood beside the road and opened fire on a 
delivery truck and a car that was following. Two Israelis were wounded in that 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than eight hours later, another daylight attack occurred nearby: A car 
reportedly pulled alongside a van carrying five passengers and opened fire. 
Soval was killed. Three other passengers were wounded, one seriously. In both 
cases, the attackers escaped, reportedly to Deir al Balah. Israeli soldiers 
pursued to the outskirts of the community, then waited for the Palestinian 
police to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was expected. Depending on the Palestinian police for our 
security is a big mistake," said former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, speaking 
Monday to Israeli army radio. Sharon, who opposes the PLO accord, has said he 
will run for prime minister in Israel's next elections. "It is inconceivable 
that the government will continue with the negotiations while the Palestinians 
continue to attack us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas issued a statement Sunday saying it attacked the Israelis in revenge for 
the killing on Friday of two of its members in Jerusalem by Israeli security 
forces. Israeli police said they had thwarted a Hamas plan to attack border 
police guarding Sharon's house in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City; 
they also said they had uncovered and broken up what was described as one of 
Hamas' deadliest cells.

 CU'S JD? Three years ago, officials of Chapman College decided its growth 
merited it becoming a university. So what's next for Chapman U.? It's 
considering opening a law school. . . . A university committee, including local 
lawyers and judges, has discussed it for almost a year and a decision could 
come within 30 days. Says local Bar Assn. President Steve McCracken: "Orange 
County is big enough and growing fast enough that it could easily use another 
law school; perhaps more than one." 
</P>
<P>
 POLITICAL RACE? South County Democrats know their candidate in the 73rd 
Assembly race, Lee Walker, is a long shot to unseat incumbent Republican Bill 
Morrow. Walker's backers could be betting on other long shots -- with an Aug. 
25 fund-raiser at the Del Mar Race Track. . . . "We'll share racing tips and 
talk politics," says organizer Kathleen Calzada. And maybe study the odds: 
Morrow trounced Walker with ease two years ago.

 REAL DREAMS: The colorful, cigar-smoking former general manager of the 
Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point, Henry Schielein, is back -- he's the new 
chief executive of the exclusive Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach. Schielein, 
credited with bringing top hotel awards to the Ritz, left last year to run the 
giant Grand Wailea Resort in Hawaii. . . . "It got a bit too dreamy," he says. 
"You can only watch the sun set so many times." Now he is charged with 
transforming the members-only club into a posh resort (B1).

 REVIVAL TIME: With Woodstock '94 over, you want to see a tape of the 1969 
original? You might have to wait in line. Most local video stores report that 
the two tapes of the 1969 Woodstock -- the original tape and new version, 
called the director's cut -- are getting checked out as fast as they're 
returned. . . . Jim Satler, who works at Blockbuster Video in Westminster, has 
a special interest in it: "My mom (Linda) was a hippie. She took me to see the 
Woodstock movie when I was just 2; it's just about my earliest memory."

FOR CITY, ONE MORE KILLING; FOR FAMILY, DEEPENING PAIN; CRIME: 14-YEAR-OLD 
WILLIE NAVA OF WATTS JOINS HIS SISTER ON THE GRIM LIST OF TEENS SLAIN ON L.A. 
STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The murder of 14-year-old Willie Nava barely registered a blip. 
</P>
<P>
 An innocent victim of gang warfare, he died alone on a Watts street corner, a 
single gunshot to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 30 killing drew almost no news coverage and no cries of outrage from 
city officials or community activists, even though Willie was an intelligent, 
outgoing boy whose only apparent transgression was growing up in the wrong 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Los Angeles teen-agers, ages 15 and 16, were killed in gang-related 
drive-bys within three hours of Willie's death that Saturday night. The 
reaction was the same: a shrug in a city that has grown numb. These days, a 
victim's youth no longer seems sufficient to stir sympathy or interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad fact is that . . . their deaths fail to get attention because they 
are not anything novel," said Kevin Reed, western regional counsel for the 
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "It just does not register in 
people's psyche." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially poignant are the deaths of children barely halfway through their 
teens. Every year in Los Angeles County, about 130 youths between 13 and 16 are 
killed -- more than 450 since 1991. Most of them become nameless, faceless 
statistics. But behind each slaying is a human tale. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Willie Nava's. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point in Willie's life occurred last year when his 16-year-old 
sister, Lupe, was killed in a drive-by shooting, just a block from where he 
would die. Of his 10 brothers and sisters, Willie was closest to Lupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say she was hanging out on a street corner with friends, some of them 
gang members, when a carload of youths from a rival neighborhood drove by on 
the night of Feb. 27, 1993. As Lupe spoke on a pay phone, several shots were 
fired. She was hit once in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie was never the same. Normally outgoing and talkative, he would lock 
himself in his room for days, leaving only to use the bathroom. Off and on, for 
periods of up to two days straight, he would refuse to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He changed a lot. He wasn't interested in anything," said his 28-year-old 
sister, Maria Chavez, the mother of two children. "He had a lot of anger 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Willie, the son of factory workers, had earned A's and Bs while attending San 
Miguel Catholic School in Watts. But now he lost interest in studying. He 
refused to go to nearby Jordan High School, where he had transferred in the 
ninth grade, saying he was afraid of being beaten up by gang members. Never 
very athletic, the stocky boy with thick brown hair spent most of his time at 
home, baby-sitting his niece and two nephews and baking cakes and cinnamon 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to be around the cholos . He wanted to stay away from that," 
said Sister Maria Luz Hernandez, one of Willie's Catholic school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, as the pain subsided, Willie began to hang out with his friends 
and take part in one of his favorite hobbies: drawing. The week he died, he 
sketched and painted the landmark Watts Towers as part of a mural at his old 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:15 p.m. on July 30, Willie left his house to attend a party near his 
East 108th Street home. The occasion was a friend's quinceanera , or 15th 
birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Guadalupe, had a strange feeling. " Mi hijo (my son), don't go. 
Something's going to happen," she recalled saying. 
</P>
<P>
 But she decided that her son deserved to enjoy the evening. It was a good sign 
that he was finally beginning to have fun again. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie was unusually quiet that day. His radio, which normally blared out 
oldies and banda music, was silent. He didn't eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before Willie left the house, his mother recalled, he handed her his 
two favorite dress shirts. "I'm not going to wear them anymore," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the last words he said to her. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later she heard the shots. "They're going to hit somebody," she 
told herself. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first patrol car arrived at East 107th and Juniper streets, a block 
from the Nava home, Willie was face up on a grass strip next to the sidewalk. 
He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend ran to Willie's house. Willie might have been shot, the friend told 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The first family member at the scene was Willie's 25-year-old brother, who 
identified the body. The mother arrived to find yellow crime tape, flashing red 
lights and investigators hunched over the scene with flashlights. An ambulance 
crew had taken her son's body away. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gangs from Willie's neighborhood and a nearby barrio were waging a war 
that had heated up several weeks before. He was apparently killed because gang 
members from the rival neighborhood wanted to shoot someone from Willie's 
neighborhood, whether he was a gang member or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a target," Sgt. Larry Kallestad said. "Whoever did it, wanted to 
finish him." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether Willie was killed walking to the party or after he 
arrived. Police have not determined whether the attacker walked by or fired 
from a passing car. Witnesses have not come forward and others have refused to 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem is that we aren't even hearing rumors," Detective Dan 
Myers said. "There is a kind of mystery silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, 464 youths between 13 and 16 have been killed in Los Angeles 
County, according to the coroner's office. Reflecting a gradual decrease in the 
county's overall murder rate, those homicides dropped from 146 in 1991, the 
first year the department began computerizing the figures, to 143 in 1992 and 
126 in 1993. During the first six months of 1994, 49 such homicides were 
reported countywide. About 80% of the victims were Latinos or African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, although overall serious crime reported to police dropped 3% last 
year, the killing of teen-agers has increased 55% since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 2,500 juvenile homicides reported in the United States in 1992, the 
last year for which FBI figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts attribute the rise in such killings to a mix of factors: the 
availability of high-powered firearms, a breakdown of social values and a 
growing tendency among many youths to settle disputes with violence -- more 
often than not, against other teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 14-year-old is much more willing these days to pull the trigger over a 
leather jacket or nothing at all," said James Fox, a noted Northeastern 
University criminologist whose computer databank includes every homicide 
reported nationwide since 1976. "These are kids who face death every day. They 
don't think about the consequences of their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the front lines of the violence are neighborhoods such as Willie's, 
where poverty, broken homes and high school-dropout rates are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't know where to begin," said Watts activist Ava Chavez. "They 
feel like there is no hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Nava never imagined that she would bury one of her children, much 
less two. The 50-year-old mother fought back tears as she sat in the beige 
wood-frame home that she and her husband, Rosalio, have owned for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even explain how I feel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 friends and family members attended the Aug. 5 funeral at San Miguel 
Catholic Church in La Colonia, the neighborhood where Willie grew up and where 
Latinos first moved to Watts at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Young children wore T-shirts with a drawing of a headstone and the words "In 
Loving Memory of My Friend Willie." The priest spoke of love and redemption, 
and of too many youths who have lost their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even neighborhood gang members, hardened by their ruthless lifestyle, were 
shocked by Willie's slaying. "He wasn't from anywhere," said one homeboy as he 
stood outside the church, meaning that Willie was not part of any gang. "He was 
a good kid." 
</P>
<P>
 When the service was over, Willie's pale blue casket was loaded onto a waiting 
hearse for the short ride to Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City. He was buried 
next to his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were so close," said Chavez, the family's oldest child. "They're going 
to be together again."

ELUSIVE TERRORIST CARLOS IS CAUGHT; MIDEAST: ARREST ENDS MORE THAN 20 YEARS ON 
THE RUN. SUDAN EXTRADITES NOTORIOUS 'JACKAL' TO FRANCE. HE IS LINKED TO 
SHOOTINGS, BOMBINGS THAT KILLED SCORES WORLDWIDE.

<P>
 Carlos the Jackal, one of the world's most notorious and elusive terrorists, 
was arrested in Sudan and extradited on Monday to France, where he faces two 
murder convictions and more than a dozen other charges stemming from a 20-year 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos is in the hands of French justice, to be tried for his crimes," French 
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua declared Monday, hours after the 44-year-old 
prisoner arrived at a military airport near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasqua said Carlos is responsible for 83 deaths worldwide, including at least 
15 in France. 
</P>
<P>
 The capture of Carlos, a Venezuelan whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, 
raised fears of terrorist reprisals in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence agents blame him for some of the most audacious terrorist acts of 
the 1970s, including the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich 
Olympics, the 1975 kidnaping of 11 ministers attending an OPEC meeting in 
Vienna and the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was skepticism Monday about Carlos and the significance of his 
arrest, some analysts saw the decision by Sudan to give him up as a positive 
sign, reflecting the new peace process in the Middle East, and, perhaps more 
important, a desire by the Sudanese to end their economic isolation and prove 
to potential aid donors that they no longer harbor terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important moment," Pasqua told a news conference. "It is not 
in the tradition of Islamic believers to give up one of their members, even if 
he is a terrorist. But here is a pure Islamic country that, in striking 
fashion, is breaking off with terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan said its agents seized Carlos in a rented house Sunday and handed him to 
Interpol, the international police agency, for extradition. He was taken into 
custody by French agents upon arrival near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 French intelligence officials learned at the beginning of the year that Carlos 
might be in Sudan, traveling on a fake diplomatic passport. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until Sunday that Sudan arrested him for "suspicious activities" 
and planning attacks against "foreign installations" in the country. Sudan did 
not specify those targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several times we got our hopes up that he was going to be extradited, but 
several times we were disappointed," Pasqua said. "(Sunday) morning, though, 
Sudan informed us that they had evidence this person was Carlos and that they 
were ready to extradite him." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasqua said Carlos was questioned by Jean-Claude Bruyere, the French 
prosecutor specializing in terrorist crimes, and a French radio station said he 
was later taken to a prison in eastern Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts in France said that even though Carlos was convicted in 1992 of 
killing two French counterintelligence agents, he would probably have to be 
retried in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little doubt, though, that France will attempt to put Carlos on 
trial. "Up until now, France has given the impression that we have no memory," 
Pasqua said Monday. "But we have shown today that one cannot kill a Frenchman 
with impunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest ended a long hunt for Carlos that had turned him into an almost 
mythical figure -- reportedly a cunning master of disguise who committed daring 
and bloody acts of terrorism while always eluding capture. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that notoriety stemmed from Carlos' image as a flamboyant gunman with 
a taste for the good life and his catchy nickname, which he earned from British 
tabloids after the novel, "Day of the Jackal," reportedly was found in one of 
his hide-outs. The Frederick Forsyth book is about an assassin, "the Jackal," 
sent to kill French President Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos had not been heard from in several years, and some intelligence agents 
thought he might be dead. Still, his name continued to surface whenever 
terrorist attacks were investigated. And, in the 1990s, he was reported to be 
living in Damascus as a guest of the Syrian government. 
</P>
<P>
 David Yallop, author of a 1993 book on Carlos called "To the Ends of the 
Earth," said he interviewed Carlos in Syria, where he was posing as a Mexican 
businessman and living with his wife, German extremist Magdalena Kopp, and 
their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Yallop is among those who have questioned the Carlos myth, suggesting that, in 
reality, the terrorist was "a would-be revolutionary of gross incompetence" who 
often killed in panic. The author said the myth of Carlos was created by 
American, French and British intelligence agents who wrongly identified him as 
a KGB agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Alain Maraud, a former head of the French intelligence service, said the 
arrest "is either going to show that Carlos was a myth or a criminal. We never 
really knew the answer. But now this is a new page in the fight against 
terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandre de Marenches, another former French secret service chief who led an 
unsuccessful mission to find Carlos in 1986, told French television: "It was a 
long chase and it's very good news." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a wealthy Communist lawyer in Venezuela, Carlos joined the 
Communist students' movement in the streets of Caracas and later received 
guerrilla training in Cuba. The Venezuelan Communist Party sponsored him at 
Lumumba University in Moscow, where many Third World nationals were selected by 
the KGB for training as Soviet agents. 
</P>
<P>
 While there, Carlos came in contact with the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine, which he joined in 1970. Since then, he has been linked with 
various terrorist groups, including Germany's Baader-Meinhof gang, the Turkish 
Popular Liberation Front, the Japanese Red Army, the Basque separatist movement 
in Spain and various other Palestinian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations against Carlos range from organizing the Japanese Red Army 
occupation of the French Embassy in The Hague in December, 1974, a rocket 
attack on an Israeli plane at Paris' Orly airport and plots to assassinate 
business and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials have said they do not believe he had a role in the 1972 
Munich Olympics hostage drama, though other intelligence officials still 
consider Carlos a suspect in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no question that, on Dec. 21, 1975, Carlos and his squad of 
Palestinian and West German extremists shot their way into the offices of the 
Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries in the Austrian capital during a 
ministerial meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people, including an Austrian police officer, were killed and, after a 
fierce gun battle, the terrorists secured control of the office, kidnaped the 
ministers and demanded a $1-billion ransom. Calling themselves "The Arm of the 
Arab Revolution," they demanded a bus to take them with their hostages to a 
plane at the airport, a demand the Austrians agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
 They flew first to Algiers where most of the hostages were released, then to 
the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and eventually to Algiers, where they gave 
themselves up. They were allowed to go free within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostage drama ended a six-month saga that had begun in Paris, where Carlos 
killed two French counterintelligence agents and an accomplice who had turned 
informer. The agents had been investigating attacks on the Israeli planes in 
Paris. (Carlos was sentenced in absentia in 1992 to life in prison for killing 
the French agents.) 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1982, Carlos threatened to strike against the French government 
unless it freed two of his agents, Bruno Breguet, a Swiss, and Kopp, the German 
who later became Carlos' wife. The threat was contained in a letter bearing his 
fingerprints, verified by French police. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, a bomb exploded aboard the Paris-Toulouse express, killing 
six people and wounding 15. The French blamed Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, a bomb exploded in a rush-hour crowd just off the Champs 
Elysees, killing a pregnant woman and wounding 63 other people. And, on New 
Year's Eve, 1983, bombs exploded in Marseilles' main railroad terminal and on 
the Paris-Marseilles express, killing five people and wounding 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp and Breguet were released in May, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say Carlos was in Sudan with a woman using a Jordanian passport 
whom he said was his wife. But she appeared not to be Kopp. The woman's 
identity was unclear.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEBATABLE ARITHMETIC, SAME BOTTOM LINE IN CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Buchanan says it. On the floor of the House, Republican congressmen say 
it. Empower America, a conservative think tank, says it. But is it true? 
</P>
<P>
 Those critics of the $33.2-billion crime bill try to paint it as soft on 
criminals by making a mantra of the claim that the legislation would fund two 
social workers for every police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of the facts, however, shows that their calculation rests on a 
pyramid of questionable or flatly improbable assumptions. To reach that 
conclusion, critics appear to underestimate the number of police the bill could 
produce and wildly overestimate the number of social workers it would fund. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, even some allies admit President Clinton's signature claim 
that the bill would fund 100,000 police officers probably overstates its impact 
on local law enforcement. At best, that is a cumulative total: the bill aims to 
increase the nation's police force by 100,000 not immediately, but over six 
years. Meeting even that goal would require local governments to accept 
substantial financial commitments to supplement the federal assistance from the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress moves toward reconsidering the crime legislation as soon as this 
week, "facts" are flying like arrows between both sides in the bitter debate. 
But, as in the case of the disputed police officers, the facts are often more 
complex than the sharp sound bites that slice the airwaves. The pitched 
struggle over the crime bill shows again that, in Washington, as in war, truth 
is often the first casualty of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument that the bill would generate more social workers than police 
officers appears to have its roots in an Aug. 2 "issue bulletin" put out by the 
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 In the paper, Scott A. Hodge, a fellow on federal budgetary affairs at the 
foundation, argues that the bill would only fund 20,000 police annually -- and 
40,000 social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the figure of 40,000 social workers, Hodge simply divides all the 
so-called crime prevention money in the bill -- some $1.23 billion per year or 
$7.4 billion over the six years covered by the legislation -- by the average 
annual salary and benefits of social workers, which he estimates at $36,000. 
"If all this social welfare money goes toward hiring new social workers," he 
writes, "the bill will add . . . at least two social workers . . . for every 
cop the bill puts on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 But the legislation makes clear that not all of that money could possibly go 
to hiring social workers. For instance, $1 billion of the prevention money is 
designated for strengthening law enforcement, including hiring police and 
prosecutors, in cases involving violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $900 million goes to establish after-school programs in troubled 
neighborhoods. Much of that money would go for the cost of keeping schools open 
and paying teachers, notes one House Judiciary Committee aide. Another $40 
million would go to operate midnight sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some programs in the bill, such as drug treatment for prisoners and grants to 
discourage young people from participating in gangs, clearly would produce 
employment for social workers. It is impossible to estimate in advance how 
many, said the Judiciary Committee aide, but the assumption that all the bill's 
prevention funds would go toward hiring social workers "just doesn't make any 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodge did not return a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodge's conclusion that the bill only funds 20,000 officers annually, which 
Republicans have widely echoed, also rests on a series of questionable 
assumptions. He estimates the cost of putting "one new cop on the street for 
one year in a high-crime area at between $70,000 to $80,000 per year." Based on 
that, he says the cost of adding 100,000 officers would be "at least" $7 
billion per year, or $42 billion over the bill's six-year life. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the bill only provides $8.845 billion in federal funds for police 
programs, he concludes, it will only fully fund "at most just 20,000 permanent 
cops on the street over the next six years." 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Department officials said that the estimated annual cost for 
adding a police officer is wildly inflated. An International City/County 
Management Assn. survey last year found the median salary for entry-level 
police officers was $23,546. Fringe benefits might add another third to that 
cost, bringing the total closer to around $31,000, a department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures vary substantially from region to region, but even for high 
police-cost cities -- such as Beverly Hills, Detroit, San Diego and Washington, 
D.C. -- the total of first-year benefits and salary for a new police officer is 
more in the range of $50,000, according to Justice Department surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Hodge's methodology, that would reduce the annual cost of 100,000 
officers to about $3.1 billion, which means the federal government could fully 
fund more than 40,000 new officers annually by his calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, those calculations are somewhat beside the point because the 
legislation generally requires cities to pay for at least one-fourth of the 
cost of the new hires. That local contribution multiplies the federal dollars 
to produce more officers on the streets, proponents note. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, to reach the 100,000 officers depends on another series of debatable 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration reaches that total this way: of the $8.8 billion in the 
bill allocated to police programs, $7.34 billion is designated specifically for 
hiring new officers. The rest goes to training and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation authorizes the government to provide cities up to $75,000 
toward the salary and benefits of each new officer hired. Divided into $7.34 
billion, that provides enough money to help hire 97,920 officers, the 
department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipalities have already hired another 2,080 officers with funds from a 
pilot program approved as part of the budget deal last summer. Taken together, 
that raises the total to Clinton's 100,000 figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But that neat calculation omits important qualifications. For one, if 
localities could not afford to put up their matching share, that would reduce 
the number of police hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton hardly stresses the point, the bill would not mean that 
cities could put 100,000 more officers on the streets for each of the next six 
years. The process is cumulative, the federal government in effect providing 
cities seed money to cover most of the initial costs of adding about 20,000 new 
officers per year through the year 2000. Once the program has been in place for 
three years, the Justice Department calculates, the federal government will be 
subsidizing about 60,000 police officers per year. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the math gets tricky. The federal grants will generally last for 
three years. To reach the figure of 100,000 officers, the Administration 
assumes that, after the three-year subsidies expire, local governments will 
keep on their payrolls all the officers they hired with Washington's help. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for instance, in the program's fourth year, when the government is 
subsidizing about 60,000 officers, another 15,000 originally hired with bill 
funds are supposed to move into permanent positions with local money. 
</P>
<P>
 Will cities absorb all these officers when the federal grants run out? That is 
the greatest uncertainty in the debate over how many police the bill would add 
to the nation's streets. Cities could adjust their budgets to maintain the 
higher staffing levels. But they may also lay off the new officers as soon as 
the federal money runs out.

CLINTON APPEARS WILLING TO DEAL ON CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three days of attacking congressional Republicans for scuttling his 
$33.2-billion anti-crime package, President Clinton on Monday abruptly shifted 
course, signaling a willingness to deal with GOP leaders to secure passage of 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key points of contention in the bill -- the ban on assault weapons 
-- could be modified and still be acceptable to the Administration, officials 
indicated, although Clinton has publicly insisted that the ban must remain in 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said the Administration is more likely to win Republican votes than to 
convert many of the 58 Democrats who voted against the bill last week. Clinton, 
thus, is softening the harsh partisan tone of his remarks since the measure's 
startling defeat in a House procedural vote last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be no more excuses, no more tricks, no more delays and no more 
discussion about whether this bill is a Democratic bill or a Republican bill or 
a Clinton bill," the President said in a Rose Garden event intended to drum up 
support for the crime package. "I don't know when I will ever be able to get it 
across to people here that what we do here is not about us, it is about the 
rest of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton, borrowing a pen once used by President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, signed into law a measure establishing the Social Security 
Administration as an independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The $325-billion program, established under Roosevelt 59 years ago, has until 
now been housed within the Department of Health and Human Services. With 64,000 
employees and 1,300 field offices, the newly autonomous agency will be one of 
the largest in the federal government. More than 40 million elderly and 
disabled Americans receive Social Security benefits and 135 million pay into 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's defeat of the crime bill on a 225-210 procedural vote is generally 
credited to the National Rifle Assn.'s furious lobbying against the assault 
weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said on the NBC-TV's "Today" 
program Monday that the Administration was ready to deal. "Look, again, we are 
willing to work with both sides to try to find the compromises necessary to 
bring this crime bill back. There's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Other aides said the bill's $7.4 billion in spending on social programs 
designed to reduce crime almost certainly will be pared back. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior White House official said Clinton is looking to pick up the eight 
votes he needs one at a time, using his powers of persuasion and accepting the 
compromises he needs to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get a bill," the official said. "The President is very clear 
on this. He wants a bill." 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) acknowledged that programs offering 
youths an alternative to crime and gang membership -- such as midnight 
basketball -- are negotiable. "If we have to pay the price to take out some 
good programs to satisfy the critics, I'm not opposed to doing that," the 
Speaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its continuing campaign to build public pressure for the crime measure, the 
White House on Monday flew relatives of three homicide victims to Washington 
for an emotional Rose Garden plea for the bill's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear of crime is the most important issue facing the American people today," 
said Marc Klaas, father of 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma who was abducted 
and killed last year. "This issue is not about money. It's about life and 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Sposato, whose wife Jody was killed in a San Francisco law office 
massacre last July, picked up the partisan cudgel on Clinton's behalf, scoring 
Republican leaders for helping engineer the defeat of the crime measure last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a Republican for 19 years and, frankly, I am totally disappointed 
in my party, especially the leadership of my party," Sposato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, noting that the weapons the gunman in the law office shootings used 
would be banned under the defeated legislation, Sposato turned his ire on the 
NRA. "The fact is, the NRA doesn't give a damn that my wife, Jody, is dead. The 
fact is, the NRA doesn't give a damn that my daughter, Meghan, will grow up 
never knowing her mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Payne of New Orleans, mother of 9-year-old James Darby who was killed 
in a drive-by shooting last Mother's Day, noted that her son had written a 
letter to Clinton just nine days before his slaying, pleading with the 
President to do what he could to stop the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking you nicely to stop it," James wrote. "I know you can do it. Do it. 
I know you could." 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Clinton paid homage to the slain boy and said: "Well, my 
fellow Americans, we have asked the Congress nicely long enough. . . . So let 
Congress hear this: Pass the Darby-Klaas-Sposato crime bill and do it now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders were still hoping to bring the crime bill 
back to the floor Thursday or Friday. But in another sign that the 
Administration is having difficulty rounding up the eight votes it needs, 
sources close to the Democratic leadership indicated that the bill could be 
held over until the following week, delaying for a second time the summer 
recess that lawmakers running for reelection in November are eager to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're sure of only two things -- this bill needs to be passed 
before the recess and we can't go back to the floor until we're sure we have 
the votes, however long that takes," one leadership source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen echoed that assessment in a meeting with 
reporters, saying the Administration is making "an all-out effort to turn eight 
votes" and expects Congress to stay in session until it can pass the crime 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a reasonable shot at doing it but it's going to be tough," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 With the leadership having all but given up trying to win back the votes of 48 
conservative Democrats opposed to the assault weapons ban, the brunt of the 
Administration's efforts is focused on two groups: liberal Democrats from urban 
areas, including 10 Congressional Black Caucus members who opposed the bill's 
death penalty provisions, and 19 moderate Republicans who voted for both the 
crime bill and the assault weapons ban earlier this year, but against the 
procedural motion that would have cleared the way for final passage last week. 
</P>
<P>
 This latter group includes two Republicans, Reps. Stephen Horn of Long Beach 
and Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Paring back at least some of the money for crime prevention programs and other 
initiatives that the Republicans have derided as pork may be enough to attract 
a few more GOP votes, but the Administration also runs the risk of losing 
liberal Democratic votes if it cuts too deeply into programs that affect 
crime-prone urban areas, Bentsen and others conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any changes are made (in this bill) it will be on the prevention side . . 
. but it will be a question of shaving," not deep cutting, Bentsen said.

COLUMN ONE; ROUGH RIDE FOR EASTERN GERMANY'S COMMUTERS; EACH DAY, MANY DRIVE 
HUNDREDS OF MILES TO THE WEST, WHERE THE JOBS ARE. THEY SAY THEY ARE TRAPPED IN 
THE BRUTAL REGIMEN BY A TWO-TIERED SOCIETY. 
</P>

<P>
 When the alarm clock explodes at 6 a.m., Karsten Brunschkewitz hasn't a moment 
to spare. The single father of two works on the docks in Hamburg, in what used 
to be West Germany -- normally a two-hour drive from Suckow, in what used to be 
East Germany. The slightest delay, the least foul-up on the autobahn, and his 
12-hour workday, door to door, can stretch to 13 hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunschkewitz won't risk it. He jumps out of bed, washes, boils some coffee, 
throws on shorts and a tank top, eats a breakfast of boiled eggs and last 
night's salad, and goes downstairs to his maroon Volkswagen Golf in the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his 34 years, Brunschkewitz could only dream about crossing to the 
West. The border, marked with watchtowers, barbed wire and anti-vehicle 
trenches, cut rudely across the lush cropland 50 miles west of his village. 
Getting a passport was all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, not only can Brunschkewitz drive from east to west any time he wants -- 
he has to do it, five mornings a week, if he wants a job. He is a pendler , one 
of hundreds of thousands of eastern German commuters who travel tremendous 
distances each day to the old West, just to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My minimum daily driving time is three hours," says Brunschkewitz, who 
typically crosses the old Death Strip at 100 m.p.h., trying to cut the 100-mile 
trip to a life-risking hour and a half. "Once, it took me five hours just to 
get home." (Eastern German highways are two lanes each way, so a single 
accident or construction project -- and there are plenty of each -- can bring 
one side to a standstill.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of all of the changes to beset eastern Germany since the collapse of the old 
order in 1989, one of the most poignant has been the rise of the long-haul 
commuter. Many, like Brunschkewitz, see their children for as little as half an 
hour a day. Many chance grievous harm in tinny eastern cars on the hair-raising 
autobahns, which have no speed limits and where 9,000 accidents occur each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an American, this must be unbelievable," says Karin Bredemeyer, a 
Deutsche Bank economist. "You would just move to where the jobs are, wouldn't 
you? But it's a different mentality in Germany. People like to keep to the same 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1992, the most recent period for which official statistics 
are available, 370,000 former East Germans were venturing -- exhausted -- back 
and forth to jobs in the former West. Some traveled aboard company-supplied 
buses; others, like Brunschkewitz, in car pools. Here in the northern state of 
Mecklenburg Vorpommern, about 37,000 people commute to the former West each day 
-- one of every 23 working adults in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible strain," says Anke Thiesler, a onetime secretary in the 
eastern city of Schwerin who became a long-haul commuter in 1990. Her workday 
ran from 10 a.m. until after midnight; she finally quit, badly worn down. Now 
Thiesler works in a Schwerin dress shop by day and moonlights as a cleaning 
woman, just to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least now I'm home by 8 or 9 p.m.," she says. "If someone had told me 
before the Wende -- the 'Great Change' -- that I'd one day have to commute such 
a long way, I'd never have believed them. It was a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 All over the world, people from impoverished countries have long traveled 
great cross-border distances to improve their circumstances. And in Southern 
California, some commuters log two hours a day or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Former East Germans submit to brutal commuting regimens because they must -- 
even though the notion of free evenings and weekends with one's family is 
nothing short of sacred. Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised easterners in 1990 
that after unification, "nobody will be worse off and for many, life will be 
better." But instead, many easterners believe that they are caught in a 
two-tiered society in which westerners get all the breaks and easterners are 
second-class citizens. Long-haul commuting, for them, is just one example. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an appalling lack of jobs in the onetime German Democratic Republic. 
The official unemployment rate in the six states that used to make up East 
Germany is about 15%, and economists say that if those in make-work programs or 
those who have given up looking for a job are added in, the effective rate is 
about 30%. The comparable figure in the former West is 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is a general reluctance to pull up stakes and move on when 
opportunities look better elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two reasons the Germans don't move much," says Detlef Guertler, a 
journalist with the Berlin newspaper Wochenpost. "One is that it's terribly 
hard to find a new apartment in Germany. And the other is something called 
heimat . It means home, but it also means more than that -- it's a kind of 
atmosphere, the place where your friends live, where your parents live. A lot 
of people don't want to leave their heimat ." 
</P>
<P>
 A final motivating force is the gap between wages in the east and the west, 
even now, nearly five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. According to a 
study in the eastern state of Brandenburg, 44% of long-haul commuters there 
make about $1,600 per month, while 16% of the non-commuting work force earns as 
much. Across Germany, in many sectors of the economy, unions have negotiated 
two-tiered pay structures, with one rate for easterners and another for 
westerners doing the same jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern wages have lagged, in general, because easterners are still perceived 
as less productive than westerners, and because eastern living costs, while 
rising sharply, are still thought to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can get away with paying us less because their economic models show that 
eastern prices are lower," Brunschkewitz says. "But forget it -- it's not true. 
The only thing that's cheaper in the east, at the moment, is the gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brandenburg study also found that long-haul commuters are, from a 
managerial point of view, the cream of the labor crop -- the people who could 
most effectively rebuild the former East if they could stay home and do so. 
Long-haul commuters tend to be young -- 35 on average -- and single or, if 
married, with at most one or two children. They are well educated, and they 
tend to take a long view, willing to accept lower wages for a chance at 
long-term economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the biggest problems in the reunification process," Guertler 
says. "The better salaries in the west attract the best workers from the east, 
and that leaves the people who are less able and less successful in the east." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes Brunschkewitz a textbook example. At 34, the divorced 
father of sons who are 10 and 12, he is a seasoned heavy-equipment operator and 
mechanic. Before the East German state came undone, he worked in road 
construction, earning what he calls "an above-average wage." After 
reunification, the government paid him $3.60 an hour for road work. Western 
road workers, he says, made $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when he heard that Barthels & Lueders, a subsidiary of the giant 
Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where the Elbe River flows into the North 
Sea, had a truck-repair department. A fellow easterner had recently gone to 
work there, and he was looking for car-pool partners. Brunschkewitz rushed to 
apply for a job and has been car-pooling ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 At exactly 7 a.m., Brunschkewitz pulls out of the driveway of his small family 
farm. It's quiet except for a few storks in the trees; Suckow is a village of 
just two houses, and no one at the neighboring farm is awake yet. 
</P>
<P>
 He heads up a low hill to a poured-concrete apartment building, where 
27-year-old Thoralf Richert is waiting. Richert is also a father of two and a 
mechanic. He once repaired farm equipment. Today he also fixes trucks. He has 
come equipped for the long drive with newspapers and a computer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get used to commuting, but it's better to do it with three people, 
and not alone," Brunschkewitz says. "It's less boring and you can save money on 
gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 He crosses an overpass, pulls onto the highway and accelerates to a neat 95 
m.p.h., standard commuting speed on the autobahn. The tires thud alarmingly on 
the rough pavement. The speed limit in the former East is 80 m.p.h., but many 
easterners drive as if they were on the better western highways. Commuting by 
autobahn can be a breathtaking experience -- at least when the traffic is 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it isn't. After a half-hour, Brunschkewitz slams on the brakes. Traffic 
has stopped, and a line of trucks and cars stretches up a hill out of sight. 
People have turned off their engines and are pacing the hot asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunschkewitz curses. He and Richert are supposed to work a nine-hour shift; 
if they come late, the company will dock their pay. He walks up the road and 
comes back to report a big accident up ahead. Accidents in the former East can 
block highways for hours. There is no choice but to sit until the tow trucks 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we'll have to work overtime," Richert says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already so late when we get home in the evenings," Brunschkewitz says. 
"It used to be better, because there was an early shift. We worked only seven 
hours, and we could still be home by 5. Now we come in a little later, we work 
a longer shift, and we don't get home until at least 8." His children go to bed 
at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercifully, the tow trucks come quickly. The accident is cleared, and at 
precisely 9 Brunschkewitz is peeling into the Barthels & Lueders parking lot. 
He and Richert hurry inside, change into long pants and blue work aprons and 
punch in. They are right on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Three floors above, in sunny executive offices, Barthels & Lueders CEO Rainer 
Volckmann reflects on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they commute?" he asks jovially. "That's easy -- they need the money. 
They are a lot luckier than the people who don't have the chance to drive these 
great distances. A lot of people are out of work in the former East." 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, when he started hiring easterners, Volckmann says, he sensed 
a cultural gap between them and the western mechanics. "They spoke the same 
language, but there were different ideas in their minds," he says. "Work hours, 
for instance. In the German Democratic Republic, it wasn't really necessary to 
work all day. They got paid no matter what. Here, they have to worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But all that is behind them, Volckmann says. "Today, you can see no difference 
between them. And there is no difference in pay." The Barthels & Lueders 
bargaining group, which mediates between management and the work force, forbids 
that, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Germany, economists are at a loss to estimate how long it may be before 
the eastern unemployment rate approaches the western one -- if ever. The 
eastern economy, which hit bottom in 1992 and 1993, is showing signs of growth. 
Privatization of the old eastern industrial stock is supposed to be finished by 
year's end, and the government is extending its programs of subsidies and tax 
breaks for investors willing to take a plunge into the old East. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these signs spell much relief for the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are high labor costs in eastern Germany, and it's hard to lay people 
off," says Bredemeyer, the Deutsche Bank economist. "So investors think about 
capital investment, and not about employment. They try to hire the least number 
of people possible. I don't think we'll ever see complete equalization of 
unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 It's 10 before 6. Brunschkewitz leaves the shop floor, changes into his 
shorts, punches the clock, heads to the car. He and Richert ride the stoplights 
east through a charmless landscape of rail yards, cranes, fuel tanks and power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunschkewitz will have dinner to cook when he gets home, he says. Then he 
will drive to a friend's house to help plaster walls. At 7:45, he drops off 
Richert, then heads to his farm. His sons and his mother are waiting. It hasn't 
been a bad day: just 12 hours and 45 minutes, door to door. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys follow Brunschkewitz upstairs to the kitchen and wait while he boils 
coffee. His mother, Vera, an unemployed biology teacher, offers her thoughts on 
the plight of the east: "There's not going to be any jobs for anybody around 
here for the next generation," she predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 A firm socialist even now, she says unhesitatingly that she thinks the family 
was better off in the old days. Her husband used to work on a farming 
collective; now he is jobless. Her lathe-operator daughter may never work 
again. She sees her grandsons' schoolmates running wild, their parents turning 
to alcohol, marriages failing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have more solidarity," she says. "We have to treat each other 
better. And we need reindustrialization, to provide jobs and rebuild some pride 
for the people around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son sees things differently: He has a job, no matter how stressful it may 
be, and so he feels better off than before. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's just a job," he adds. "If I could find anything else, I'd take it. 
I've applied to other places right here near Suckow, and they liked me, but no 
one around here is hiring right now." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows, he adds, that Barthels & Lueders wants to get out of the 
truck-repair business and may close his department this year. Then he too will 
join the ranks of the eastern unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that happens, then I'll look for a new job," he says. "Maybe something in 
agriculture. But whatever I find, it will definitely be here in the area. I 
never want to drive so far again." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Westerners move east.

FAR FEWER CASUALTIES EXPECTED IN BIG QUAKE; RESEARCH: STUDY PROJECTS TWICE THE 
ECONOMIC DAMAGE. LESSONS FROM LOMA PRIETA, NORTHRIDGE TEMBLORS INCLUDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most serious earthquake expected during the next 50 years should cause 
half the casualties but almost twice the economic damage in Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and Tokyo than had been predicted, according to new projections 
released by Stanford University earthquake experts today. 
</P>
<P>
 The new damage estimates are the most detailed in nearly a decade, experts 
said. The figures significantly recast the risks posed by a major temblor to 
people and businesses in the three areas as well as to the banks and insurance 
companies that will partially cover their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimates are the first to incorporate the lessons of the magnitude 7.1 
Loma Prieta earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989 and the 
magnitude 6.8 Northridge quake that shook the Los Angeles Basin on Jan. 17. The 
Northridge earthquake killed at least 61 people and caused more than $20 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 People living and working in the Los Angeles area, according to the new 
estimates, can expect a magnitude 7 earthquake along the Newport-Inglewood 
Fault to cause 2,000 to 5,000 deaths and an economic loss ranging from $125 
billion to $145 billion. The fault, the largest in the area, runs along the 
coast from Newport Beach through Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 15,000 people could be hospitalized with injuries, the scientists 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The projections are the result of worst-case scenarios that assume that the 
earthquakes in the three metropolitan areas -- the largest considered likely in 
the next 30 to 50 years -- would strike as closely as possible to highly 
developed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study also showed that a repeat of the famous 1906 8.3-magnitude 
temblor on the San Andreas Fault near San Francisco could kill between 2,000 
and 6,000 people and cause an economic loss in excess of $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A recurrence of the Great Kanto earthquake that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, 
killing 140,000 people, would today cause between 40,000 and 60,000 deaths, the 
scientists said. Property damage and economic losses, however, could run from 
$800 billion to $1.2 trillion, large enough that world financial markets, stock 
prices and interest rates would be affected as the Japanese withdrew overseas 
investments in order to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said they were not trying to predict the likelihood of such an 
earthquake, but were attempting to develop a more reliable yardstick for 
measuring potential damage from a major natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For all three scenarios, "the casualty numbers have gone down considerably and 
the estimate of property damage has increased by a factor of two," said Haresh 
Shah, chairman of the Stanford civil engineering department, who helped prepare 
the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The casualty estimates vary depending on what time the hypothetical earthquake 
occurs. Injuries in the Northridge quake were low in part because it occurred 
before dawn when office buildings and freeways were deserted. Increasingly 
stringent building codes also are helping to reduce the overall risk. The 
researchers' lower estimates of death and injury "reflect the fact that we have 
been pretty successful in engineering our structures to protect lives," Shah 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the magnitude of the potential economic damage is a different matter. "We 
have used newer knowledge and the numbers come out much bigger," he said. "We 
have seen that the damage is always a little higher than the old data 
indicated." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the economic consequences of a major earthquake were found to be 
higher than earlier studies because the researchers placed greater weight on 
the cost of interrupted business and lost time from employees unable to report 
for work because of injuries or transportation difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage estimates were prepared by a team of Stanford researchers led by 
Shah, and a private group called Risk Management Solutions, which evaluates 
earthquake risks for industry, insurance companies and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the insurance and the banking communities are taking natural 
disasters much more seriously these days," said Tom Hutton, president of Risk 
Management Solutions. "There would certainly be (insurance) companies that 
would not withstand the events that we have projected." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge quake, which damaged more than 86,000 structures and 
caused about $6 billion in insured losses, two large California insurers have 
announced that they will no longer write earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known federal damage projections for Los Angeles earthquakes have 
attempted to gauge the potential havoc wreaked by a hypothetical "Big One" -- a 
magnitude 8.3 temblor along the southern end of the infamous San Andreas Fault. 
A landmark federal study prepared in 1981 at the request of the National 
Security Council estimated that such a quake would kill between 3,000 and 
14,000 people, depending on the time of day it occurred, hospitalize up to 
55,000 people and cause about $20 billion in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent research has led earthquake experts to believe that a less powerful 
quake along the Newport-Inglewood Fault would cause greater damage to the 
heavily populated portions of the metropolitan area than an 8.3 temblor on the 
San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers prepared their estimates with a relatively new 
computer-mapping system that allowed them to combine information about 
individual structures with local geological conditions, such as soil type, 
fault lines and slope, which influence the severity of the ground shaking in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer database contains information about every one of the 6 million 
homes in California, the soil type on which they sit and all known fault lines.

HUNDREDS FLEE ARSON FIRE IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AREA; BLAZE: ABOUT 950 
FIREFIGHTERS BATTLE FLAMES RACING TOWARD ATASCADERO. U.S. 101 IS CLOSED IN

<P>
 A racing arson fire roared toward this Central California city Monday night, 
prompting several hundred people to flee and raining ash on nearby communities, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Help was called in from around the state as firefighters fought to keep the 
blaze from destroying homes. About 950 firefighters were on the line, 
accompanied by water-dropping helicopters, said Glenda Powell, a spokeswoman 
for the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty firefighters from the Los Angeles Fire Department were dispatched to the 
scene with 10 pieces of equipment to assist in battling the blaze, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department sent 70 firefighters and 15 engines 
late Monday, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have unconfirmed reports of structure loss," said Forestry Department 
spokesman John Madden. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire nearly tripled in size in four hours to about 22,000 acres, said the 
Forestry Department's Val Houdyshell. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. 101, one of the state's main north-south routes, was closed between San 
Luis Obispo and Atascadero, a town of about 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-mile stretch that includes the southern end of Atascadero, the small 
community of Garden Farms and the ranching town of Santa Margarita were 
evacuated after the flames began racing toward them from neighboring Los Padres 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been evacuations throughout the afternoon," said Lt. Pat Hedges of 
the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Department. He estimated that several 
hundred people had left by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're evacuating an area of probably 500 or 600 families," said Betty Van 
Gorder, program coordinator for the San Luis Obispo County chapter of the Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke and ash enveloped San Luis Obispo, about 16 miles south of Atascadero, 
covering cars with a blackish layer, Hedges said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 110,000 of 125,000 customers were without power because the fire had 
burned the main transmission lines, said Arlene Morris-Versaw, a spokeswoman 
for Pacific Gas & Electric. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no power here. The whole south county has no power" and phone 
communications are "nearly impossible," Van Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, firefighters -- some of them arriving after battling other 
wildfires in the state -- used shovels and bulldozers to hack firebreaks out of 
80-year-old brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is zero containment," said Bob Bergstrom, a California Department of 
Forestry spokesman. "We are working on saving lives and property in the day and 
hope it lays down at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hot, inaccessible and very thick, old brush. This is in a real nasty 
brush area." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures rose to 108 degrees during the day, humidity was low and fickle 
15 m.p.h. winds changed directions hourly. There were five injuries to 
firefighters -- three from heat exhaustion and two from ankle sprains. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was deliberately set about 4 p.m. Sunday at the 2,600-foot level off 
California 41 near the Cerro Alto Campground, fire officials said. The area 
includes part of Los Padres National Forest and is about 150 miles northwest of 
Los Angeles.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; NEW BROWN ADS PUSH SOME THEMES REAGAN USED IN 
1966; DEMOCRAT APPROACHES THE MIDDLE CLASS MUCH LIKE REAGAN DID IN SUCCESSFUL 
BID TO OUST HER FATHER FROM GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown opened a new advertising campaign Monday that promotes 
some of the same broad themes used by Republican Ronald Reagan 28 years ago to 
oust her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., from the California governorship 
she now seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as Reagan did in 1966, Kathleen Brown sought to appeal to the California 
middle class on issues of government waste, bureaucracy, welfare spending and a 
get-tough approach on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of two new 30-second television commercials, Brown says "middle-class 
families are not getting their fair share." She proposes to cut the state 
bureaucracy if elected governor on Nov. 8 over Republican incumbent Pete Wilson 
and is critical of a "misguided" welfare system and wasted tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 "As governor, I'll manage California's budget for the middle class -- guard 
the money, cut bureaucrats and reduce welfare," Brown says. "I'll use the 
savings for better schools and colleges, job creation and police -- the fair 
share middle-class families deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial did not include specific proposals, although Brown has drafted 
detailed issues papers on many of those subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Reagan sought to deny Pat Brown a third term by running against what 
Reagan decried as a spendthrift government and a bloated bureaucracy that 
served an overly generous welfare system and coddled criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this came at the expense of middle-class Californians who obeyed the 
rules and paid their taxes without complaint, Reagan said. He portrayed Pat 
Brown as a political bumbler who made a mess of managing state government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a retrospective of the campaign, Brown wrote: "In 1966 a majority of 
Californians wanted to hear a new articulation of their changed political and 
social attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, that articulation has come full circle, as state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown seeks to unseat Wilson, first elected to public office in the Reagan-led 
GOP sweep of 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Brown ads, which began airing statewide Monday, marked a shift from a 
long succession of commercials this summer that attacked Wilson on a variety of 
issues with the common theme of mismanagement in government. She does not name 
Wilson in the new ads and they were viewed by campaign experts as a beginning 
of the Brown effort to acquaint voters with Brown and her own proposals for 
making life better in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign manager George Gorton said the new ads are part of a Brown 
attempt "to prove that the campaign is not about ideology." A goal of the 
Wilson campaign has been to portray Brown as a liberal, much as her brother was 
during his governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 In one ad, Brown is shown with 13 members of her family, although her father, 
Pat Brown, is not present because of a prolonged illness. Nor is her brother, 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., who was governor of California from 1975 to 1983. 
Brown campaign aides were not certain why Jerry Brown was not included. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad opens with the candidate introducing herself and her mother, Bernice 
Brown; her husband, Van Gordon Sauter; her children, and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was born in the beginning of the century and my grandchildren at 
the end," Brown says. "Each generation of California families has built a 
better life for the next. But today, middle-class families question whether 
their future will be as good as their past." 
</P>
<P>
 "Only with good jobs, good schools and affordable colleges and homes will 
California families believe in our future again." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Wilson campaign focused on Brown's proposed welfare cuts. 
Acknowledging that she recently proposed a 5% cut in benefits, they said she 
has a meager record on welfare reform and faulted her for failing to endorse 
specific proposals backed by Wilson.

FACE LIFT BY THE BAY; LANDMARKS: THE VENERABLE BALBOA BAY CLUB IS PREPARING TO 
REMODEL ITS FACILITIES INTO A GARDEN OASIS. THERE IS TALK OF OPENING DINING, 
HOTEL ROOMS TO THE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, the Balboa Bay Club was the place to be, an elite fun spot where 
the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Greta Garbo and Richard Nixon sought sunny 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 45-year-old yacht club retains a certain aura. But the stargazing 
isn't what it used to be. Club officials say that business has been down in 
recent years and that the club needs renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of wrangling with the city, scaled-back plans to remodel the 
club into a garden oasis are finally inching forward. And there is talk of, 
once the remodeling is complete in a few years, opening up the members-only 
club for the first time, allowing the public to dine in restaurants and stay in 
the club's hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, it was filled with movie stars. John Wayne was on the board 
of governors, and very well-known industrialists looked at the bay club as a 
getaway place," said owner Beverly Ray. "What we want to preserve is the 
feeling about this place and the memories and the lifestyle. It is very simple, 
where people come to lay back." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, just before the recession took hold of Southern California, 
club officials had proposed a lavish renovation. But residents protested, 
complaining that the additions would block views and bring more traffic and 
noise to their neighborhood on the bluffs overlooking Newport Bay. The City 
Council eventually rejected those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials returned to the council this year with a scaled-back, 
$30-million renovation plan that won quick approval last month, as well as 
praise from residents who opposed it the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal is still ambitious. It calls for the demolition and 
rebuilding of much of the aging club's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters say the plan is pragmatic -- designed to coexist with the 
surrounding community and the economic realities of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed dramatically in the past (four) years," said club 
President Dave Wooten, noting that the 1990 plan did not anticipate the 
statewide recession. "I would not want to be sitting here with 300 hotel rooms 
to fill." 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion plan would significantly alter the appearance of the club by 
adding gardens, palm trees, new buildings, patios and a breezy bay-front 
promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 The club would increase from about 155,000 square feet to about 189,000. New 
athletic facilities, a public restaurant, coffee shop, two bars and a ballroom 
would be built along with four conference rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray said she envisions the new club as "buildings set into a garden by the 
bay." The architecture will be "very simple, classical lines. Nothing extreme. 
Something that will look good and elegant forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans for glass-covered walkways, expansive ocean-side patios, a 
large central courtyard and a swimming pool perched alongside the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, as new hotels and condo complexes have sprung up nearby, the 
club has found itself scrambling to fill its 144-room terrace apartments, which 
overlook the bay and "battleship row," a line of boat slips that are home to 
some of California's largest yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when (the apartments) were always full and there was a 
waiting list to get in," Ray said. "We have a lot more competition these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray and other club leaders are betting that the new project will give the club 
a contemporary look while maintaining the mystique the hideaway has enjoyed 
since its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1948 amid the mud flats of a then-deserted Coast Highway, the club 
had always been synonymous with fame, wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Its membership rosters have included William Holden, Lauren Bacall and Joey 
Bishop. They and dozens of other Hollywood stars regularly made the one-hour 
trek from Beverly Hills and the Hollywood Hills south to Newport Beach, where 
many docked yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Yankees slugger Mickey Mantle, test pilot Chuck Yeager and crooner 
Frank Sinatra were once regular visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's photo archives are filled with pictures of famous figures enjoying 
the sunny outdoor patios and bars, including Ronald and Nancy Reagan. After his 
resignation from office, Richard Nixon briefly lived on the compound before 
taking up residence in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fewer celebrities rub elbows at the club today, the landmark retains 
a certain mystique. In recent years, the club was the setting for writer Joseph 
Wambaugh's novel "The Golden Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal still must pass muster with the California Coastal Commission and 
the club also must negotiate a new lease with the city. Construction is not 
expected to begin for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The scaled-back project has received support from nearby residents of the 
Cliff Haven and Newport Heights areas who were among the most vocal critics of 
the 1990 plan. Residents said the new project blocks fewer views and does a 
better job of addressing traffic and noise concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sturgess, president of the Cliff Haven Homeowners Assn., said the club 
solicited comments from neighbors and kept them updated on the status of the 
project. Sturgess and other residents said they plan to keep meeting with club 
officials through the design and construction process. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really did a good job helping us understand the plan," Sturgess said. 
"We worked together to make it compatible with the community."

IMMIGRATION QUERIES TO MEDI-CAL USERS OKD; LAW: COURT SAYS STATE MAY ASK AID 
RECIPIENTS IF THEY ARE LEGAL RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appellate court ruled Monday that California officials have the right 
to question Medi-Cal recipients about their immigration status, a decision that 
advocates for the poor predicted would discourage illegal immigrants from 
seeking emergency medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1st District Court of Appeal, overturning a lower court decision, said 
state government officials have the authority under a 1992 state law to ask 
Medi-Cal applicants to disclose their Social Security number and whether they 
have a "satisfactory immigration status." 
</P>
<P>
 A lower court had held that the disclosure conflicted with federal law, which 
gives illegal immigrants access to certain medical services without requiring 
that they provide a Social Security number or reveal their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Medi-Cal, a state and federally financed program that provides medical 
care for the poor, illegal immigrants cannot receive the full range of medical 
services available to other poor people. But a 1986 federal law entitles them 
to emergency care and labor and delivery services. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision released Monday is a victory for the Wilson Administration, which 
has sought to require more disclosure of immigration status for a wide range of 
government services. In March, a new state law went into effect requiring 
first-time driver's license applicants to prove they are legal U.S. residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Bowman, a spokeswoman for the state's Health and Welfare Agency, said 
she expected Medi-Cal offices to begin asking the questions "as soon as 
possible" as a result of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the exponential growth in the number of undocumented immigrants 
receiving government services," she said, "this decision provides state and 
local governments with a tool to ensure that only those truly eligible for 
services receive them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Melinda Bird, an attorney for the Western Center on Law & Poverty, which 
filed the lawsuit against the state, said she feared the questions would only 
deter illegal immigrants -- and especially those who are pregnant -- from 
seeking needed medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being asked these questions is frightening to people. There is a climate of 
fear both in our community and our state. This will have a terrible, chilling 
effect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird said she expects to either appeal the court's decision or challenge the 
state law on constitutional grounds, contending that it violates immigrants' 
privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Most immigrants are unaware, she said, that Medi-Cal officials are prohibited 
from revealing clients' immigration status to the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. They assume, she said, that if their immigration status 
is disclosed, they will eventually be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 The state appellate court disputed that argument, noting in its decision that 
illegal immigrants could not be denied services even if they refused to answer 
questions about their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird said that if illegal immigrants avoid seeking prenatal care, the results 
to society in the long run could be costly, because children born to such women 
here are American citizens and entitled to a full range of government services.

PANEL TO PROBE ACTIONS OF FEDERAL CIRCUIT JUDGE; COURTS: IN UNUSUAL MOVE, 
COMMITTEE WILL LOOK INTO COMPLAINT AGAINST A. ANDREW HAUK. HE HAS BEEN 
CRITICIZED BY NUMEROUS ATTORNEYS AND WOMEN'S AND MINORITY ORGANIZATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a highly unusual move, the chief judge of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court has 
appointed a special committee to investigate charges that Los Angeles federal 
Judge A. Andrew Hauk is unable to discharge his duties because of "a mental 
disability," according to documents obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge J. Clifford Wallace of San Diego formed the committee on July 27 
in response to a March, 1993, complaint from Julian Ayrs, a Los Angeles 
literary agent. Ayrs contended that Hauk severely abused him during a hearing 
and tried to "coerce him into silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wallace would not discuss the case specifically, he said in a 
telephone interview that it would be rare for the court to publicly discipline 
one of its judges. He also said that most complaints he receives about judges 
are frivolous and dismissed before this stage. Other cases are resolved 
privately by the chief judge without the need to form a committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe was launched under a section of the U.S. Penal Code that allows any 
person to file a complaint against a federal judge who the individual believes 
"has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious 
administration of the business of the courts," or "is unable to discharge all 
the duties of office by reason of mental or physical disability." 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk has long been criticized by numerous attorneys as well as representatives 
of women's and minority organizations for what they have claimed is intemperate 
and unpredictable courtroom behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk's secretary said the judge never responds to press inquiries about 
anything that occurs in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayrs, 42, alleged in his complaint that Hauk was prejudiced against him merely 
because he was representing himself and that the judge "threatened to falsely 
imprison" him for simply expressing his legal opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 A transcript of the December, 1992, hearing reveals that Hauk, in fact, 
threatened to jail Ayrs twice and told him that "anybody who represents 
themself has a fool for a client." 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk, 81, also told Ayrs he was wasting his time by attempting to have action 
taken against him. "If you want to be sort of an American-Spanish conquistador 
known as Don Quixote, you do it, but . . . you are spinning your wheels for 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Hauk told Ayrs that he was about to issue an order that Ayrs was 
"not to file any more cases in this court, but that might be a little heavy, 
because you might have a chance to ride in an Army airplane or Air Force 
airplane and be injured and have some sort of a claim and suit against the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Hauk ordered Ayrs not to file any more papers in the case. The court 
clerk immediately admonished the judge: "Your law clerk should put that in a 
formal order, your honor. That is a very significant order. That should be 
formal." 
</P>
<P>
 This incident is the latest of many involving Hauk, who has been a federal 
judge since 1966 and was named the worst district judge in the 9th Circuit by 
American Lawyer magazine in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the 2,000-member California Women Lawyers group unsuccessfully asked 
the 9th Circuit for an investigation into the judge's "repeated public display 
of biased attitudes" after Hauk's declaration that women are "soft touches . . 
. particularly when sex is involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1979 antitrust case against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, he frequently referred to the defendants as "the Opeckers." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Gulf War, Hauk delivered a rambling dissertation on military 
strategy, the virtues of nuclear weapons and the vices of Saddam Hussein as he 
expunged a criminal conviction of any Army reservist who claimed that he needed 
a clean record so he could accompany his unit to the Persian Gulf. In response 
to an appeal from the U.S. attorney's office, the 9th Circuit reversed that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in recent years, Hauk has jailed lawyers representing people suing 
policemen on brutality charges. In 1993, a panel of 9th Circuit judges removed 
Hauk from the retrial of another police brutality case, saying the record of 
the first trial left the judges "with the distinct belief that Judge Hauk's 
remarks exhibit a pro-police bias." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Wallace formed the special investigative committee means he has 
conducted a preliminary probe and found "no grounds which dismiss or conclude 
the proceeding," according to the court order appointing the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member governing council of the 9th Circuit has several options in 
judicial discipline cases, including certifying a judge as disabled, requesting 
a judge to voluntarily retire on full salary, ordering no further cases 
assigned to the judge, or public or private censure. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge James R. Browning of San Francisco, who preceded Wallace as 
chief judge and has been a 9th Circuit judge since 1961, said he could remember 
no instance in his tenure when a judge in the nine-state circuit was publicly 
disciplined, with the exception of Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne, who 
was impeached by the U.S. Senate in 1986 after being convicted on income tax 
evasion charges in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Wallace named Circuit Judge Procter Hug Jr. of Reno and U.S. District 
Judge Robert E. Coyle of Fresno to serve with him on the special committee. It 
is not clear how long it will take the trio to complete their probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk has the right to receive written notice of the charges, to present 
evidence, to attend any hearing held by the special committee, to be 
represented by an attorney and to be compensated for the costs of such 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayrs also has the right to be represented by an attorney, but must pay those 
costs himself. He may submit written arguments to the committee, but it is left 
to the committee's discretion whether he will be called as a witness at a 
hearing. He also does not have the right to attend any hearing other than when 
he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayrs said Monday that he was pleased the 9th Circuit seemed to be taking his 
complaint -- which had its genesis in a 1989 case -- seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Ayrs won a $29,500 judgment stemming from a dispute over his 
purchase of a used car. The defendant in that case later filed a bankruptcy 
petition that Ayrs asserted was invalid, but federal bankruptcy judge Arthur M. 
Greenwald disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals are pending on that matter. As part of his attempt to get relief from 
Greenwald's rulings, Ayrs filed a complaint in U.S. District Court that was 
randomly assigned to Hauk. During the December, 1992, hearing that is at issue 
now, Hauk referred to Greenwald as "an excellent and fine judge." 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript reveals that the hearing was quite rancorous, with Hauk and 
Ayrs, who had represented himself in the prior cases, arguing about numerous 
issues. At one point Hauk asked Ayrs if he was a lawyer and Ayrs responded that 
he had studied law on his own -- including using the law library of the 
television show "L.A. Law," where he had worked temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayrs said he was particularly disturbed that Hauk's comments reflected the 
sentiment that Ayrs had no business representing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the Constitution we're supposed to have access to state and federal 
courts," Ayrs said. "Not everyone can afford an attorney. The way he acted 
toward me showed that unless you're an attorney, you don't have proper access 
to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be told you're going to be thrown into jail for disagreeing with him, this 
was like a police state, un-American," he added. "That's terribly wrong."

RWANDA'S NEW LEADERS ACCUSED OF HARASSING REFUGEES; AFRICA: AID OFFICIAL SAYS 
ACTIONS DON'T MATCH WORDS OF CONCILIATION. NEW EXODUS TO ZAIRE IS FEARED.

<P>
 A senior international relief agency leader Monday blamed the new Rwandan 
government for harassing refugees and pushing them toward another mass stampede 
out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The official spoke out after weeks of what he described as frustration and 
double-speak in dealing with the new Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government. 
But he insisted that he and his organization not be identified for fear its 
relief efforts would be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 His blunt assessment comes at a crucial time in the lives of 1.2 million to 2 
million Rwandans crowded into the southwest corner of their country, 
temporarily held by the French as a "safe zone." More than half are refugees 
from other parts of their country. 
</P>
<P>
 The French, the United Nations and relief workers are struggling to persuade 
these Rwandans, virtually all of them Hutus, that they will be better off 
staying put or going home than flooding into Bukavu, Zaire -- creating a 
potential rerun of the humanitarian disaster that is occurring farther north in 
Goma, Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 In this region, a rising mood of anxiety is apparent among Hutus. Just four 
days ago, thousands of them could be seen building refugee huts, bartering in 
markets, gathering firewood and engaging in other everyday pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, these same thousands had moved to the edge of the single highway 
to Zaire, their meager goods packed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them, I'm afraid, will leave. It has not happened yet. But people are 
streaming toward the main road, looking for transport," said spokesman Fery 
Aalam of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily migration on the road to Zaire has steadily increased in the last 
few days. From just scattered hundreds counted at one U.N. checkpoint last 
week, 1,400 passed by Saturday on their way to Zaire. By Sunday, 4,500 were 
counted and officials said the number appeared to be growing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, these numbers are only a trickle compared with the tens of thousands 
who could bolt. A healthy refugee can walk from Gikongoro to Zaire in three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The RPF has said repeatedly that refugees will be safe, if they stay here or 
return home -- except those guilty of massacres of rival Tutsis. The new 
government, dominated by Tutsis, dispatched three civilian ministers to the 
French zone to urge refugees not to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the veteran relief agency leader said that public posturing by the new 
government has not been matched by the actions of its military administrators 
across the border from the French safe zone. "Lots of people are being 
harassed. . . . The conditions for a return to normalcy are not in place," the 
relief leader said. 
</P>
<P>
 In just one week, the French are scheduled to pull out. Many of the Hutu 
refugees believe that replacement U.N. troops will not be able to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military leaders have negotiated a vague agreement with the RPF to permit 
civilian administrators to enter the zone for two months. Armed soldiers are 
not permitted to enter the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, when it comes to the kinds of subtle signals the refugees look 
for, the relief agency leader said the RPF army "has never shown any interest 
in keeping this population. Rwanda was overpopulated. Now they have an 
abundance of fields." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear spreading among the refugees is that when the French leave, they will 
be attacked to avenge the killing of up to 500,000 Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 Administering justice may be one of the most difficult cornerstones in 
rebuilding Rwanda. The RPF has agreed to allow the International Court of 
Justice to conduct the investigation into genocide. But in 
government-controlled areas that ring the French zone, military commanders 
retain control and they appear less conciliatory.

POLITICS; DEMOCRATS NEED A LITTLE HELP FROM GOP ON HEALTH CARE BILL; A 
BIPARTISAN VICTORY COULD GO A LONG WAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. TROUBLE IS, 
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woody Hayes, Ohio State University's legendary football coach, used to 
complain that throwing a forward pass could have only three possible outcomes 
and that two of them -- an interception or an incompletion -- were bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, analysts assessing the health care debate raging on Capitol Hill 
see three plausible outcomes, but only one would provide an unqualified boost 
for Democratic incumbents this November: the adoption of reform legislation 
with some measure of Republican support. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, developments in the House last week suggest that unless the Democrats 
can fashion a health care reform bill that wins the votes of GOP lawmakers, 
along with the backing of conservatives in their own party, they may not be 
able to pass any bill at all. 
</P>
<P>
 This bipartisan approach, some Democrats said, could turn out not only to be a 
necessity on Capitol Hill but a virtue on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 With bipartisan backing, "everybody will be able to say: 'We accomplished 
something,' " contended Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, whose clients this 
fall include House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny H. Hoyer 
(D-Md.). "That takes it out of the realm of partisan politics and gives it a 
sort of Good Housekeeping seal of approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as most analysts agree, a second possible outcome -- health care 
reform muscled into the statute books solely by Democratic votes -- probably 
would be better for President Clinton and his party than the third outcome: no 
bill at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The last result would represent a dramatic setback for Clinton and other 
Democrats. It would mean that the President had failed to keep his promise to 
reform the health care system. It also would call into question his ability to 
redeem his broader pledge to break the gridlock between Congress and the White 
House that prevailed during the term of President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid such a debacle, some Democrats have talked of pushing health care 
legislation through with or without Republican votes -- and even without the 
support of some of the more conservative members of their own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, even after the $33.2-billion crime bill was defeated on a 
procedural vote Thursday, some Democrats optimistically recalled that last fall 
they were able to pass Clinton's economic plan without any Republican help at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have them (the Republicans) on the budget," pointed out the top 
aide to one of the Democratic House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be able to go to the voters in the fall and say: 'The economy 
is going better, and we didn't have any help from the Republicans. And we 
passed health care reform, and we didn't get any help from the Republicans on 
that either.' And I think we'll have a very strong message for the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 But the concerns over health care reform differ markedly from those involved 
in the federal budget. The various approaches to reform now under consideration 
would more directly touch the lives of millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular issue impacts everybody," said David Keene, chairman of the 
American Conservative Union and an adviser to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). "And while voters may not have a sense of the intricacies, everybody 
has a sense of what they want and don't want. And I think that gives 
Republicans an advantage because as the debate has gone on, voters have soured 
on the Democratic approach that the government can take care of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, if Democrats enact health care legislation without at least the 
appearance of bipartisan support, political professionals say they will face a 
prolonged and sustained debate over the merits of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans would certainly attack controversial aspects of the legislation, 
forecasting either damage to the economy or disruption of the traditional ways 
that Americans have become accustomed to receiving health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats worry that their difficulties in defending health care legislation 
would be compounded if enactment is accompanied by the deal-making and 
horse-trading that marked adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people think politicians are trading votes on health care for bridges in 
their districts, they're not going to think very well of the institution and 
the people who make it up," Mellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Republicans already are gearing up to campaign against what 
they brand as Democratic strong-arm tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public will be watching the debate," warned New York Rep. Bill Paxon, 
chairman of the Republican Campaign Committee in the House. "If the Democrats 
simply ram through their own bill without bothering to reach out to 
Republicans, it will result in massive public resentment, and we will elect a 
Republican speaker of the House next January." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are mindful of that danger. "It is always better to have a major 
reform with bipartisan backing," said Ed Lazarus, strategy adviser to the 
Democratic National Committee. "I think the most important thing is to get 
something that works and get it passed. But it would be better if Republicans 
join us in that effort." 
</P>
<P>
 But how do Democrats get Republicans to support them in an endeavor most 
likely to benefit Democrats? One answer is to threaten them with charges of 
obstructionism if they reject health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republican strategists dismiss that threat. Their reasoning is summed up 
by two oft-repeated slogans: "A bad bill is worse than no bill at all," and 
"Wait till next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the case for delay, Republicans cite a recent Newsweek magazine poll 
showing that two-thirds of all Americans think Congress should wait until 1995 
and begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 An advantage of putting off action on health care reform for the GOP is that, 
if their expectations of significant gains in the House and Senate are borne 
out by November's election returns, Republican lawmakers will be well 
positioned to get health care reform more to their liking in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blocking a Democratic health care scheme that threatens the quality of 
American medicine is in the national interest," Republican strategist William 
Kristol argued last week in a memorandum to GOP lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), sponsor of 
the principal Democratic health proposal in the Senate, "is walking a 
tightrope," Kristol urged: "Republicans should push him off." 
</P>
<P>
 That would open the way, Kristol argued, for enactment next year of a health 
care reform measure along the lines of one drafted by Dole, one that is far 
more modest in its approach than the Democratic proposals. "At which point we 
will welcome Mr. Clinton to pick up his veto pen -- if he dares," Kristol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such tough rhetoric from Kristol and other party professionals, 
however, some evidence suggests that at least a fair number of GOP lawmakers 
are interested in finding a health care bill they can vote for this year, even 
if it means lining up with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House last week, moderate Republicans joined with conservative 
Democrats in introducing an alternative to the bill put forward by Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition bill does not include a requirement for employers to provide 
insurance for their workers, which Clinton has argued is necessary for 
effective reform. And it would only cover 90% of the population, compared with 
the 95% claimed for the bill authored by Mitchell. But it offers a package of 
insurance reforms, subsidies for low-income people and some long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to pass the kind of reforms that will be supported by responsible 
Democrats," Paxon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan House plan may turn out to be just a token demonstration of GOP 
interest. But hard political realities underlie such gestures. Even though 
passing no health care reform at all might be best for the Republican Party, it 
might not be the best thing for individual GOP incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party itself probably does not have anything to lose if no 
health care bill is passed," said political analyst Cliff Zukin of the Eagleton 
Institute of Politics. "But individual Republican incumbents may feel pressured 
to come back to their constituents with something they have passed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Ross Baker, a Rutgers University specialist on Congress, predicted 
that the lawmakers will fashion a "mild, moderate reform of health care 
practices" that will include coverage for pre-existing conditions, some 
subsidies for the poor and job-to-job portability. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides will then claim victory, Baker said. The final legislation, he 
predicted, will include enough language about promising universal coverage at 
some future date to allow Clinton to declare that a major step toward health 
care reform has been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Republicans, "they will say: 'We had to deal with this radical 
proposal by the President and his zealot wife and we managed to hold them down 
to a modest incremental change,' " Baker said. The net result, he said, will be 
remindful of a quote from "Alice in Wonderland": 'Everybody has won and all 
must have prizes."

INDIA, PAKISTAN EXCHANGE HARSH WORDS ON KASHMIR; ASIA: AT SEPARATE INDEPENDENCE 
CEREMONIES, LEADERS GIVE LITTLE SIGN OF COMPROMISE ON TERRITORIAL DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 India and Pakistan entered their 48th year of independence this week by 
exchanging harsh, in-your-face remarks over Kashmir, showing yet again how 
acrimonious their relations remain after nearly half a century as unhappy 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "With you, without you, in spite of you, Kashmir will remain an integral part 
of India," Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, vowed Monday in a no-nonsense 
message directed at Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Independence Day address, which will be scrutinized for clues about 
India's foreign and domestic policy agenda, Rao insisted that Pakistan quit the 
one-third of the disputed former Himalayan princely state that it has seized 
and held. "The one unfinished task is that Pakistan vacate its occupation of 
those areas of Kashmir which are under its control and should form part of 
India," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian leader mischievously borrowed terms used by Pakistani Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, who on Sunday termed the territorial dispute over 
Kashmir "the unfinished agenda of the 1947 partition plan" that dismembered 
British-ruled India into two new states, mostly Hindu India and predominantly 
Muslim Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it clear to the government of India," Bhutto said, "that 
Pakistan would not come under any Indian pressure and continue to apprise the 
international community of ongoing human rights violations and atrocities being 
committed by Indian forces against the innocent people of Kashmir." 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto, speaking at a flag-raising ceremony in Islamabad marking the 
anniversary of Pakistan's creation, said her country would always support 
Kashmiris fighting Indian rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Since independence and the blood bath of partition, in which an estimated 15 
million people were uprooted and 200,000 died, India and Pakistan have fought 
three wars, two over possession of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 The territory had been the realm of a Hindu maharajah and playboy who opted at 
the last minute to join India, although most of his subjects were Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim 
majority, is home to the most widespread separatist struggle faced by the New 
Delhi government. Pakistan wants the Kashmiris to be allowed to choose between 
India and Pakistan in an internationally organized plebiscite. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao has ruled that out, though on Monday, apparently for the first time, he 
said "we are progressing towards elections" in Kashmir. He gave no dates. The 
tenor of his speech left no doubt that the elections will be a purely Indian 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing Bhutto's remarks the previous day, Rao said it was crystal clear, 
despite Islamabad's official denials, that Pakistan is arming and aiding 
"terrorists" battling Indian rule in Kashmir. By some estimates, 17,000 people 
have died in the uprising that began four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrest continued right through the Independence Day holiday. As Jammu and 
Kashmir Gov. K. V. Krishna Rao unfurled the Indian tricolor and made a speech 
Monday morning, Muslim militants fired a rocket aimed at the Srinagar stadium 
where the ceremonies were taking place, a report quoting official sources said. 
The rocket fell about 400 yards short and exploded in a residential compound, 
killing one man and seriously wounding another. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic and international human rights groups accuse the Indian army and 
police of waging a brutal campaign of repression to snuff out the Kashmiri 
rebellion. Despite Bhutto's tough talk the previous day, Rao said Monday, "we 
want to tell Pakistan that we will continue to take steps to stop terrorist 
activities in Kashmir." 
</P>
<P>
 But by talking of elections, Rao was tacitly extending an invitation to more 
moderate Kashmiri groups to forsake armed struggle and get involved in the 
electoral process.

 Two judges under fire over a ruling that appeared to show understanding for a

handed down a suspended sentence to Guenter Deckert, head of the right-wing 
National Democratic Party, will be replaced immediately. A three-judge panel 
chaired by Mueller provoked outrage last week by saying Deckert was a man of

OFFICIALS HOPE ARREST OF CARLOS SENDS MESSAGE; MIDEAST: CAPTURE MAY HAVE LITTLE 
EFFECT ON TERRORIST ACTS. BUT IT COULD PRESSURE NATIONS HARBORING EXTREMISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although the arrest of Carlos the Jackal is unlikely to affect international 
terrorism directly, American counterterrorism officials said Monday that they 
hope the capture of the infamous terrorist will send a message to extremists 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope they understand that the international community does not forget," a 
senior U.S. official said. "However long it takes, they will be brought to 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the wave of anti-U.S. terrorist attacks in the 1980s, both Republican 
and Democratic administrations have more actively promoted law-and-order 
responses to terrorism, including new laws giving American agencies power to go 
beyond the nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 But few foreign extremists actually have been caught or extradited for trial 
in the United States or other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan's decision to turn Carlos over to France could be a boost to Western 
efforts to squeeze countries that harbor terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely, however, to remove a major player from the terrorism scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's been out of business since the early 1980s. He's a terrorist 
emeritus," a counterterrorism expert said. "Despite his notoriety, he was 
probably credited with three times the number of operations he ever really 
undertook. There are contemporary terrorists who are of much more concern to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Israeli officials denied that Carlos played a role in several of the 
most notorious acts with which he is associated. The officials also refused to 
comment on speculation that Israel might ask France to extradite Carlos for 
trial in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Shlomo Gazit, former head of Israeli military intelligence, said Monday that 
Carlos was not involved in either the 1972 Munich massacre of 11 Israeli 
athletes or the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane to Entebbe, Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Egyptian officials speculated Monday that Sudan, which has been 
on the State Department's terrorism list since August, 1993, decided to hand 
Carlos over to France because the terrorist is now expendable and because of 
potential good publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan has been an international outcast since shortly after the 1989 coup that 
brought to power the hard-line Islamic government of Omar Bashir, primarily 
because of allegations that it supported international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have offices in Khartoum. 
Agents of Palestinian renegade Abu Nidal are said to have operated in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has also repeatedly been accused, with little concrete 
evidence, of operating terrorist training camps, primarily for Sunni 
fundamentalist groups challenging governments in neighboring Algeria, Tunisia 
and especially Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan, cut off almost entirely from international aid and going bankrupt in 
the process, has been eager to make amends with the West and get money flowing 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 As a figure of the past, Carlos does not have strong ties with active 
movements, eliminating the danger of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a winner for the Sudanese," the U.S. official said. "Carlos is not 
someone with ties. He's out of the old sectarian school that isn't terribly 
active now so no one is likely to complain that he's been turned over. And 
they'll get good publicity which they can desperately use. So there's no down 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 But while welcoming Sudan's decision, sources in Washington said the Khartoum 
government knew the action was not sufficient to win its removal from the 
American terrorist list. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterterrorism officials said it is unclear whether Syria, which had played 
host to Carlos since he was expelled from Hungary in the late 1980s, had 
decided to kick him out. He was in Sudan for about six months, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Syria has also been anxious to get off the terrorist list, U.S. 
officials said they believe Damascus would have wanted credit for expelling 
Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the context of revived U.S.-led peace efforts, the sources speculated, 
Syria may have made life difficult for Carlos to force him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time he left the country. Carlos reportedly went to Yemen 
in the early 1990s. Libya is also believed to have turned him away in 1991 
after a purported eviction from Damascus. He also reportedly obtained a 
passport for his second daughter from the Venezuelan Embassy in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said they considered Syria his primary residence until 
recently. He probably went to Sudan because there was nowhere else to go.

GOVERNING BOARD IS TO MEET SATURDAY TO DISCUSS CHAVIS' STATUS. HE HAS LOST 
MEMBERS' SUPPORT SINCE SECRETLY SETTLING A LAWSUIT.

 NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. has lost the support of board 
members representing Southern branches of the civil rights organization -- a 
development that virtually assures he will be ousted when the board meets 
Saturday, sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The special session was called to discuss criticism of Chavis for secretly 
settling a sexual discrimination lawsuit against him with the organization's 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no actual head count has been taken, one NAACP director from the 
powerful Southern region observed that "there has been a lot of erosion" among 
Chavis' supporters in the region, proof enough to convince him that the 
executive director cannot survive the board vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members from the Southern states tend to vote together and had been 
expected to support Chavis, who is from North Carolina and has been allied with 
board Chairman William F. Gibson of South Carolina. Gibson has also been hurt 
in the uproar over the issue. But the Southern board members are now likely to 
join members from other parts of the country, who have been more aggressive in 
their demands for Chavis' resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a done deal that he's going to lose this one," one director said. 
"He could, in theory, still pull this out. But he would have to climb such a 
steep hill that I don't think that's a realistic possibility at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source close to the board and from the Southern region was more blunt: 
"He needs a Hail Mary pass, a grand-slam home run and a slam dunk to keep his 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
 If Chavis -- widely criticized from within and outside the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People -- is ousted, it would come as the 
organization faces one of the most critical junctures in its 85-year history. 
The group is in financial turmoil with more than $3 million in debts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the charges of sexual discrimination, Chavis has angered 
longtime members with his controversial attempt to revitalize the civil rights 
organization by redirecting it to attract younger members with overtures to 
such polarizing figures as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, gang members 
and hard-core rap artists. 
</P>
<P>
 However, his departure, if it occurs, would stem directly from his committing 
$332,000 of the organization's money to secretly settle a threatened sex 
discrimination and wrongful discharge suit by Mary E. Stansel, his former aide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement -- which he did not tell the board about -- he agreed to pay 
Stansel two installments of $25,000 each, pay her an average $5,400 a month for 
six months and find her an $80,000-a-year job in the Washington area. He also 
promised to pay her an additional $250,000 if she did not obtain such a job. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chavis failed to make good on the $250,000 payment, Stansel sued for 
breach of contract, which is how the issue became public. Stansel has declined 
to comment on the matter and the details of the threatened suit are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members representing the Southern states said members in the region 
have had a hard time forgiving the secretive nature of the settlement. Others 
said they decided to call for Chavis' removal after becoming alarmed by 
discussions within the NAACP that other women are expected to file similar 
charges against Chavis and the organization, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole issue is not about repudiating the direction Ben is taking the 
organization, which many of us support," said a source close to the board. 
"It's about his judgment. He was not being straight with the people who 
supported him and that's harder for some of us to accept than anything he's 
alleged to have done. We never know what to expect next." 
</P>
<P>
 What is less clear is Gibson's fate. The NAACP chairman has been Chavis' most 
visible and ardent supporter. Last month, as news reports revealed Chavis' 
secret settlement with Stansel, Gibson rushed to stand by Chavis at a news 
conference and declared that "Dr. Chavis had complete executive authority to 
address the administrative complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Associated Press, however, Gibson is backing away from his 
uncritical support of Chavis, saying he did not know the amount of the 
settlement at the time he expressed his support and that Chavis should not have 
had the authority to make such a settlement without the board's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight, maybe that should be there," Gibson said in an interview with 
the Associated Press. "We have authority over the executive director. We hire, 
employ and compensate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the NAACP headquarters did not return calls Monday and neither 
Chavis nor Gibson could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members, especially those critical of Chavis and Gibson, 
interpreted Gibson's AP interview as his attempt to distance himself from the 
rising tide of anger washing over Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
 Several NAACP members said Gibson controls at least 33 votes on the 64-member 
board. Gibson, a South Carolina dentist, wields considerable influence on the 
board because of his longtime civil rights activism and his political influence 
among Southern board members, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gibson) is trying to cut a deal with the board, especially those members in 
his region, to let Chavis go and to save his hide," said Greg Evans, who, as 
president of the NAACP's Washington-Oregon State Conference of Branches, was 
among the first to call on Chavis and Gibson to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gibson is the ultimate NAACP politician and I don't know whether that 
strategy will work or not because you only get rid of half the problem if the 
board only cuts Chavis loose." 
</P>
<P>
 But one Gibson supporter, who has close ties to the board, predicted the 
chairman "will come out OK. All he's tried to do is protect the NAACP's 
process. He hasn't been all that protective of Ben."

CRITICS OF HEALTH REFORM RAISE BUGBEAR OF BUREAUCRACY; DEBATE: OPPONENTS ARE 
DRAWING ORWELLIAN IMAGES OF RED TAPE AND FACELESS FEDERAL WORKERS. THE FEAR 
TACTIC COULD KILL ANY BILL, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The naked shoulder belongs to a vulnerable-looking patient. It is framed by 
the reassuring hands of a physician. There's nothing subtle about the ad. 
Intimacy was what the American Medical Assn. sought to convey. 
</P>
<P>
 And its message is clear: Would you rather trust your life to a doctor or to 
some government bureaucrat or insurance adjuster? 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate over health care reform nears a climax in Congress, opponents of 
comprehensive reform, including many Senate Republicans, are increasingly 
exploiting the public fear of a proliferating bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. Americans have always been leery of burgeoning red tape 
and bloated government. And their concerns have risen sharply as the debate has 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's now-discarded plan would have created a vast array of 
government agencies with broad new powers, such as allowing the Treasury 
secretary to impose a payroll tax on all employers in any state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even most of the less ambitious reform plans, including the one being debated 
in the Senate, would necessitate the creation of numerous state and federal 
agencies -- to enforce new rules designed to extend coverage to the estimated 
39 million uninsured Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a bureaucratic cost to doing these things," said Drew Altman, 
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, Calif., health care 
philanthropy and think-tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed new government bureaucracies will be an inevitable byproduct of any 
successful effort to seriously reconfigure what is one-seventh of the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the nation's health care system is already burdened by the administrative 
imperatives of the 1,500 private insurance companies now doing business, with 
clerks minutely examining reimbursement claims and sometimes determining in 
advance whether a particular medical procedure is permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Any reform of the U.S. health care system probably will substitute public 
bureaucrats for private ones. That leaves a particularly knotty question: Can 
government agencies carry out their duties -- such as ensuring that subsidies 
reach the needy -- without becoming the intrusive force that the AMA and the 
public fear? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless such concerns can be allayed, the public's deeply ingrained fear of an 
uncaring bureaucracy could kill health care reform, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge issue because 'bureaucracy' and accusations that a plan is a 'big 
government' plan have become almost nuclear weapons," Altman said. "And critics 
have been tremendously successful in instilling fear and skepticism about the 
government's ability to reform the health care system." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a day goes by now in the Senate without a member producing a 
multicolored chart to demonstrate the complexities of the plan crafted by 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell himself went on the Senate floor Monday to rebut his critics, saying: 
"My bill does not provide for a government-run health insurance system. It is a 
voluntary system, which builds on the private insurance market." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetoric aside, those with alternatives to the President's agenda are 
discovering -- as Clinton already has learned -- that any significant overhaul 
of the health care system will require a certain amount of new government 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest challenge is that of providing subsidies to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had proposed requiring employers to pay at least 80% of a worker's 
premiums, with the individual paying the rest. His plan called for subsidies 
for small firms with low average payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of a firestorm of opposition to the 80% employer mandate, Mitchell 
would delay the mandate until 2002 -- and require only a 50% premium 
contribution from employers with 26 or more workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The scaled-back mandate would be triggered only if voluntary measures based on 
market incentives do not achieve 95% coverage -- and only in states that fall 
below the 95% level. Nationally, about 85% of the public is now insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that Mitchell's approach would lead to a more effective subsidy 
program, allowing the targeting of individuals instead of companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But there would be a trade-off. In potentially defusing opposition to the 
employer mandate, Mitchell created grist for foes on another front: A greater 
bureaucracy would be needed to administer a subsidy program that targets 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's bill would subsidize not only low-income people but also children 
and pregnant women as well as those temporarily unemployed. Some of them would 
be eligible for more than one type of subsidy at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the Congressional Budget Office recently noted, "determining 
eligibility for subsidies would be an enormous task for states, made more 
complicated by the three different subsidy programs." 
</P>
<P>
 States also would be responsible for the annual reconciliation process in 
which a subsidized family's income is checked to ensure that it had received 
the appropriate funds. "Tracking people who moved from one state to another 
during the year would also be difficult and would require extensive cooperation 
among the states," the CBO added. 
</P>
<P>
 Administering subsidies would be just one of many new responsibilities 
required of the states by Mitchell's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, his proposal would create dozens of new federal and state agencies, 
empowered with new authority over how insurance is purchased and how medical 
services are delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell would create, to name a few, a seven-member National Health Care Cost 
and Coverage Commission to monitor trends on insurance coverage and costs, a 
seven-member National Health Benefits Board to define the scope of a standard 
benefits package, a 15-member National Quality Council to establish regional 
and state organizations to implement certain goals and standards, a National 
Council on Graduate Medical Education to set requirements to attain something 
of a balance between specialists and general practitioners and 50 state 
Consumer Information and Advocacy Centers to gather and disseminate "report 
cards" on health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 States also would be required to enforce new laws that prohibit insurers from 
discriminating against the sick or the aged. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, according to Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), who released a half-inch-thick 
"primer" on Mitchell's bill, it proposes 50 new bureaucracies and would impose 
177 new responsibilities on states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is . . . probably the largest expansion of government ever proposed," 
fumed Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.). "It's very complicated and very bureaucratic 
-- definitely a step in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO, a highly regarded, nonpartisan research arm of Congress, said in more 
neutral language that, for the system proposed by Mitchell to work effectively, 
"new data would have to be collected, new procedures and administrative 
mechanisms developed and new institutions and administrative capabilities 
created." 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly a vote of confidence in Mitchell's plan. And the Maine senator 
conceded that point when he unveiled his plan earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It requires a lot of administrative work," he said, "and we don't know 
whether that can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 But Theodore R. Marmor, a Yale professor of public policy and management, 
offered a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of either interference with professional practice or the amount of 
both form-filling and administrative expense, the American health care system 
is by far the most administratively complex and costly in the advanced world, 
while our government role is weakest." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Edward F. Howard, executive vice president of the Alliance for Health 
Reform, a nonpartisan educational group: "You have to remember the burden that 
current programs face and what they will look like five years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Altman also noted that government-run health care systems are much more 
efficient than those run by the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Medicare's administrative expenses are about 3% and Medicaid about 5%, 
they said, the comparable cost for private plans is 15% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government programs are dramatically more efficient than private programs," 
said Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area," Altman added, "where facts and perception are at total 
loggerheads."

ASSEMBLY PASSES CAMPAIGN REFORM MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reminded of the "black eye" given the Legislature by the conviction of five of 
its members on corruption charges, the Assembly on Monday narrowly approved a 
bill to ask voters to impose contribution and spending limits and authorize 
partial public financing of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-30 vote, the bare minimum needed for approval, sent the measure sponsored 
by Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) back to the Senate for 
concurrence in Assembly amendments. It had passed the Senate by a 27-12 vote, 
but will undergo changes in a two-house conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation also would ban the transfer of campaign contributions from one 
candidate to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the five former lawmakers convicted as a result of an FBI sting, 
Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) urged a yes vote on the bill. "We 
should not forget those convictions and the black eye they have given us," 
Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) said: "It is time to put 
the b.s. aside. Money poisons politics and corrupts this place. Public 
financing is the key to reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment on the bill's passage, a spokeswoman for Common Cause, Ruth 
Holton, said: "I think it is essential to have campaign finance reform if we 
are going to prevent the kind of political corruption that was uncovered by the 
FBI. The question is, will the Legislature put out a bill that is tough enough 
to do the job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though most legislators say they want campaign finance reform, the Legislature 
has repeatedly deadlocked over the issue. One political party always fears that 
the other party will gain an advantage. Governors have vetoed bills sent to 
their desks. The courts have struck down large portions of voter-approved 
campaign finance reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 California legislators collected a record $33.4 million in contributions to 
line their campaign war chests during a non-election year in 1993. The old 
record was $27.4 million raised in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of campaigning is outrageous," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), who carried Lockyer's bill on the lower house floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican opponents attacked the proposed use of public funds to help 
finance campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill asks the people of California to foot the bill for politicians 
campaigning for the state Legislature," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La 
Habra). "The cost to the people could run into millions upon millions of 
dollars. This money otherwise could be used for police protection, fire 
protection, emergency medical services, all of the services that the people are 
demanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty Democrats and one Republican voted for the Lockyer campaign reform bill. 
All 30 no votes were cast by GOP members. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone GOP defector was Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run).

IDAHO FOREST FIRES FORCE RESIDENTS TO FLEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents fled two small vacation communities Monday as wind-driven forest 
fires in central Idaho menaced their homes and their routes to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corral Fire was fewer than six miles west of the resort of Burgdorf Hot 
Springs and the Blackwell Complex of fires was only seven miles southwest of 
the summer homes in Secesh Meadows. The two communities are about 130 miles 
north of Boise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corral Fire had covered 32,000 acres and the Blackwell Complex 25,000 
acres before both made big runs Monday in what fire bosses called "blowup 
conditions." The fires were so erratic that more than 1,000 square miles of 
forest were closed to public access.

DOCTORS' GROUP REJECTS SETTLEMENT IN SUIT OVER HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A doctors' group has rejected a proposed settlement in a lawsuit over whether 
the Clinton Administration's 1993 federal health care task force must make its 
records public. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles McDowell Jr., president of the doctors' group, said in a letter filed 
Monday with U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth that its board of directors 
voted, 13 to 4, Sunday to reject a settlement proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the settlement talks have not been disclosed under orders from 
Lamberth, and McDowell did not give any details. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors' group is one of three organizations that challenged the health 
care group's secrecy. Brown had said that if the case went to trial he might 
call as witnesses First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and White House adviser Ira 
Magaziner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton and Magaziner led the 500-plus member working group's 
deliberations that led to the President's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. of American Physicians and Surgeons, the American Council for Health 
Care Reform and the National Legal Policy Center are seeking hundreds of 
thousands of transcripts, drafts, minutes and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Masterson Brown, attorney for the doctors' group, has asked to withdraw 
from the case, the Assn. of American Physicians and Surgeons said in the 
letter. Brown notified the group Thursday that he would seek to withdraw from 
the case, McDowell said.

SUSPECT IN CLINIC KILLINGS ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anti-abortion extremist Paul Hill pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he 
violated federal clinic-protection law in the killing of an abortion doctor and 
a volunteer escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's court-appointed lawyer said after the arraignment that he planned to 
challenge the constitutionality of the federal law, which took effect in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old former Presbyterian minister, who has advocated killing 
abortion providers as "justifiable homicide," is charged with three counts of 
violating the federal law, one each for the deaths of Dr. John Bayard Britton, 
69, and James H. Barrett, 74, and the wounding of Barrett's wife, June. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill also is charged with violating a federal firearms law by using a shotgun 
in the commission of a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barretts were volunteer clinic escorts who were taking Britton to the 
Ladies Center clinic in Pensacola when they were shot July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In state court, Hill faces two counts of first-degree murder and one each of 
attempted murder and shooting into an occupied vehicle.

STORM RAKES FLORIDA COAST; REGION FACES NEW FLOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beryl, the second tropical storm of the hurricane season, raked Florida's Gulf 
Coast with rain and wind up to 50 m.p.h. Monday as it followed the same path 
taken by deadly Alberto last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm raised fears of flooding in Georgia, which is still wringing out 
from Alberto. 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, heavy rain blew sideways along the beach, with steady 
downpours inland, and palm trees bent in the wind. People in low-lying coastal 
areas of Taylor, Dixie and Wakulla counties were urged to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't take too much more rain," said Alan Pierce, emergency management 
director for Franklin County, where last month's floodwaters ruined the oyster 
harvest in Apalachicola Bay. "We've been having bad weather ever since Alberto. 
It's getting real old." 
</P>
<P>
 A tropical storm warning was posted for about 300 miles of Florida's Gulf 
Coast from Ft. Walton Beach to Yankeetown, and Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a 
state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Beryl did not pack the same wind punch as Alberto, which came ashore blowing 
about 70 m.p.h., nearly hurricane strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain was expected to be the greater problem. Beryl was expected to dump 3 to 5 
inches of rain on Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia and northern Florida. Some spots 
could get as much as 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto hit the coast around Destin, near Ft. Walton, and unloaded as much as 
21 inches of rain in 24 hours after stalling over Georgia, where it killed 31 
people, damaged thousands of homes and forced 40,000 people to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Beryl developed into a tropical storm around midday Monday after its winds had 
reached the threshold of 39 m.p.h. By late Monday, Beryl was just east of 
Panama City, with maximum winds of 50 to 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm had stalled but was expected to move northeast at 3 m.p.h. until 
midday today, a course that would take it into southern Georgia.

 "Who knows what's next?" said Melodie Holton, wife of Mitchell County, Ga., 
cattleman Lane Holton. They lost about $500,000 when their fields and pastures 
flooded in July. "A lot of the floodwater is still here," she said. "It 
wouldn't take much to bring it up again."

RTC PUTS 3 TOP INVESTIGATORS LINKED TO WHITEWATER ON LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp. placed three senior criminal investigators who 
worked on the Whitewater investigation on administrative leave Monday while the 
agency investigates unspecified activities related to job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency declined to give a reason for the action, but one agency source 
suggested it was intended, at least in part, to determine whether one of the 
investigators improperly tape-recorded an RTC lawyer's comments about the 
Whitewater probe.All three investigators were involved in preparing formal 
requests to the Justice Department for criminal investigation into Whitewater 
and Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC lawyer, April Breslaw, said on the tape that officials in Washington 
wanted to be able to say that the activities of President and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton had not caused any losses to Madison Guaranty, according to a copy of 
the conversation obtained by Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa). Madison, which failed at 
an estimated taxpayer cost of $60 million, was owned by the Clintons' partner 
in Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior investigator handling the RTC's request to the Justice Department 
for further investigation into Madison, L. Jean Lewis, tape-recorded Breslaw on 
Feb. 2 during a meeting in Lewis' Kansas City office. 
</P>
<P>
 Breslaw told Lewis that the "head people" wanted to provide an "honest answer" 
about the Clintons' role in Madison but that there were certain answers they 
would be "happier about, because it would get them off the hook." In recent 
hearings, Breslaw said she did not know she was being taped. 
</P>
<P>
 An RTC spokesman said only that Lewis and two others had been placed on 
administrative leave with pay while the agency investigates whether any 
procedures were violated.

6-MONTH PROBE FAILS TO SOLVE MYSTERY OF HOSPITAL FUMES; INVESTIGATION: STATE'S 
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS CANNOT FIND SOURCE OF DISABLING ODOR. SOME IN EMERGENCY 
ROOM MAY HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO MASS HYSTERIA, REPORT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding a six-month investigation, the state's occupational safety office 
said Monday it found nothing at Riverside General Hospital which could account 
for the notorious "mystery fumes" that hospitalized six people and led to the 
evacuation of the emergency room in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial hygienists with the state's Department of Industrial Relations 
concluded that some of the 12 emergency room attendants who complained of 
nausea, headaches, dizziness and other symptoms during the incident may have 
fallen victim to mass hysteria after the first emergency room workers 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least three of the most seriously injured were definitely affected by 
something, a Cal/OSHA investigator concluded -- but a source of the toxic fumes 
could not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three people who are believed by Cal/OSHA to have fallen ill from 
the mystery agent -- a doctor, a nurse and a respiratory therapist -- 
complained of smelling an ammonia-like odor in blood drawn from cancer patient 
Gloria Ramirez. The 31-year-old mother of two was brought to the hospital with 
breathing and heart distress and died within minutes of her arrival there. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the ongoing mystery was a finding by a Cal/OSHA consulting 
laboratory that an unidentified chemical compound derived from ammonia was 
detected in the bag containing Ramirez's body, and in air samples taken during 
the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal/OSHA officials said they could not determine if the unidentified 
compound could be related to the Feb. 19 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence was found that the mystery fumes were generated by the hospital's 
use or storage of chemicals, drugs or cleaning supplies, or were generated by 
the hospital's ventilation or sewage disposal systems, Cal/OSHA concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam Smalstig, a state industrial hygienist, reported that in the case of three 
of the emergency room workers, "the type, severity and duration of the most 
severe symptoms . . . support that this was an involuntary physiologic reaction 
to some agent and event." 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms exhibited by the other affected hospital personnel "may have been the 
result of unintentional exaggeration by the stress or anxiety" of the moment, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside County coroner's office concluded that Ramirez died of cardiac 
dysrhythmia and acute renal (kidney) failure brought on by cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's spokesman could not be reached for comment on the Cal/OSHA 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 The most seriously injured person, Dr. Julie Gorchynski, filed a $6-million 
claim against the county last week, claiming that her injuries, including loss 
of blood to her knees, are linked to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's family has filed a wrongful death claim against Riverside County, 
claiming the hospital was responsible for the fumes that, the family contends, 
contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services is expected to issue its own report 
this week, but spokeswoman Lynda Frost said she doubted any additional light 
would be shed on the cause.

GRANT TO HELP UCI PULL MINORITY KIDS INTO CANCER STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Cancer Institute has awarded UCI Medical Center a grant intended 
to increase the number of minority children in cancer studies and to develop 
better relations between their families and physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year, $330,000 award to the Department of Pediatrics and the 
Clinical Cancer Center, announced by UCI on Monday, aims to offer Latino, 
African American and Asian children the benefits of the latest research and 
newest therapies not usually available outside major university cancer centers. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI qualified for the grant because its pediatric patient population is more 
than 50% minority. The proportion actually is 68%, roughly equivalent to the 
percentage of minority children in Orange County. The only other medical center 
that won a grant this year was the University of Texas at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the UCI center, which sees about 30 to 35 new pediatric oncology 
patients a year, has been able to enroll only a handful of minorities in 
clinical trials, said Dr. Paul Zeltzer, the principal investigator involved in 
the grant. The hospital hopes to increase the enrollment of minorities to a 
minimum of 17 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grant is about more than "accruing numbers," Zeltzer said. It will 
help make physicians and families aware of how cutting-edge therapy can improve 
the outcome for the young patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Children treated as part of a clinical trial have a 20% to 40% better chance 
of survival than those who are not so enrolled, Zeltzer said. He stressed that 
the youngsters will not be "guinea pigs" subject to great risk; they will 
receive the best available treatments and will be offered the best chances for 
a cure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The standard of care for children with cancer is experimental therapy," he 
said, in part because the field of research is changing so rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Otis Brawley, program director of the community oncology and 
rehabilitation branch at the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Md., 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We firmly believe that when a disease is not 100% curable" the best treatment 
is to be in a study designed to "increase the number of cures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley said the grant will offer low-income people a chance they normally 
would not have to participate in state-of-the-art treatment. The care and 
medications provided during clinical trials generally are free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than eight of 10 child cancer patients nationwide are enrolled in some 
form of clinical trial. But minority children risk being excluded if their 
families are not aware of the opportunities available or if they face language 
or cultural barriers, Zeltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeltzer believes the language barrier in particular has inhibited minority 
enrollment at UCI. The grant money will allow the medical center to translate 
the study procedures and information about supportive care into various 
languages so family members know what they are getting into and can learn how 
to provide the best environment for children under treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 Social workers and others sensitive to different ethnic communities' beliefs 
about health care, cancer and death will help the center reach out to 
minorities, Zeltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community physicians will be involved in the treatment process as well, he 
said. The grant project will hook them up with the Children's Research Group, a 
consortium of 30 centers nationwide with more than 60 studies in progress on 
pediatric cancer. The group can provide the latest information to doctors on 
advances in cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 With family physicians part of the team, "there is a familiar face," Zeltzer 
said. "Families feel more comfortable."  
</P>
<P>
 Some physicians already are expressing interest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fulfilling a need and a void," said Dr. Quynh Kieu, a Fountain Valley 
pediatrician who treats Asian patients primarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieu said her patients' families commonly feel left out of the health care 
system. And the alienation becomes particularly pronounced when they are faced 
with cancer -- a difficult diagnosis to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to be able to offer them culturally appropriate help, to 
soften the impact so they feel more in control and can help the child," she 
said. "It's very hard for them to give support to the patient unless they have 
some understanding of where the process is at." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the goals of the grant project, Zeltzer said, is for UCI to compile 
enough information about children's cancer among ethnic minorities to become a 
national clearinghouse. The study may help answer such questions about the 
prevalence of certain cancers among minority children and whether certain 
groups are more or less vulnerable than the general population, Zeltzer said.

FACE LIFT BY THE BAY; BALBOA BAY CLUB, ONCE HAVEN FOR TOP STARS, HOPES TO 
SPARKLE ANEW AFTER $30-MILLION RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD and BOB ELSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, the Balboa Bay Club was the place to be, an elite fun spot where 
the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Greta Garbo and Richard Nixon sought sunny 
refuge. Today, the 45-year-old yacht club retains a certain aura. But the 
stargazing isn't what it used to be. Club officials say business has been down 
in recent years and that the club is in need of renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of wrangling with the city, scaled-back plans to remodel the club 
into a garden oasis are finally inching forward. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is talk, once the remodeling is complete in a few years, of opening 
up portions of the member-only Balboa Bay Club for the first time, allowing the 
public to dine in some restaurants and stay in the club's new hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, it was filled with movie stars. John Wayne was on the board 
of governors, and very well-known industrialists looked at the bay club as a 
getaway place," club owner Beverly Ray said. "What we want to preserve is the 
feeling about this place and the memories and the lifestyle. It is very simple, 
where people come to lay back." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, just before the recession took hold of Southern California, 
club officials had proposed a lavish renovation. But residents protested, 
complaining that the additions would block views and bring more traffic and 
noise to their neighborhood on the bluffs overlooking Newport Bay. The City 
Council eventually rejected those plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Club officials returned to the council this year with a scaled-back, 
$30-million renovation plan that won quick approval last month, as well as 
praise from residents who opposed it the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal is still ambitious. It calls for the demolition and 
rebuilding of much of the aging club's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters said the new plan also is pragmatic -- designed to coexist with 
the surrounding community and the economic realities of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed dramatically in the past (four) years," said club 
president Dave Wooten, noting that the 1990 plan did not anticipate the 
statewide recession. "I would not want to be sitting here with 300 hotel rooms 
to fill." 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion plan would significantly alter the appearance of the club by 
adding gardens, palm trees, new buildings, patios and a breezy bay-front 
promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 The club would increase from about 155,000 square feet to about 189,000 square 
feet. New athletic facilities, a public restaurant, coffee shop, two bars and a 
ballroom would be built along with four conference rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray said she envisions the new club as "buildings set into a garden by the 
bay." The architecture will be "very simple, classical lines. Nothing extreme. 
Something that will look good and elegant forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also call for construction of glass-covered walkways, expansive 
ocean-side patios, a grand central courtyard and a swimming pool perched 
alongside the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, as new hotels and condo complexes have sprung up nearby, the 
Balboa Bay Club has found itself scrambling to fill its 144 terrace apartments, 
which overlook the bay, and "battleship row," a line of boat slips that are 
home to some of California's largest yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when (the apartments) were always full and there was a 
waiting list to get in," Ray said. "We have a lot more competition these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray and other club leaders are betting that the new project will give the club 
a contemporary look while maintaining the mystique the hideaway has enjoyed 
since its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1948 amid the mud flats of a then-deserted Coast Highway, the Balboa 
Bay Club had always been synonymous with fame, wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Its membership rosters and guest lists have included William Holden, Lauren 
Bacall and Joey Bishop. They and dozens of other Hollywood stars regularly made 
the hourlong trek from Beverly Hills south to Newport Beach, where many docked 
yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Yankees slugger Mickey Mantle, astronaut Chuck Yeager and crooner 
Frank Sinatra also were once regular visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's photo archives are filled with pictures of famous figures enjoying 
the sunny outdoor patios and bars, including Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Following 
his resignation, Richard Nixon briefly lived on the compound before taking up 
residence in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Though fewer celebrities rub elbows at the club today, the landmark retains a 
certain mystique. In recent years, the Balboa Bay Club was the setting for 
Joseph Wambaugh's novel, "The Golden Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction work on the club's make-over is not expected to begin for at 
least three years. The proposal still must pass muster with the California 
Coastal Commission and the club also must negotiate a new lease with the city, 
which owns the land. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new scaled-back project has received support from nearby residents of 
the Cliff Haven and Newport Heights areas who were among the most vocal critics 
of the 1990 plan. Residents said the new project blocks fewer views and does a 
better job of addressing traffic and noise concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sturgess, president of the Cliff Haven Homeowners Assn., said the club 
solicited comments from neighbors and kept them updated on the status of the 
project. Sturgess and other residents said they plan to keep meeting with club 
officials through the design and construction process. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really did a good job helping us understand the plan," Sturgess said. 
"We worked together to make it compatible with the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good relationship," he said.

HE CAN'T CATCH A BREAK, BUT HE CAN CATCH BALL; RAMS: ROOKIE RECEIVER CHRIS 
BRANTLEY'S BAD LUCK HASN'T KEPT HIM FROM MAKING AN IMPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't blame Ram rookie wide receiver Chris Brantley for being a little 
paranoid, wondering if an anvil is dropping from a fourth-story window above 
him or a runaway truck was coming his way. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of accident-prone Deral Boykin or the injured Fred Stokes, 
nobody has had a tougher, or at times more painful, training camp than 
Brantley, a fourth-round draft pick from Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
 His rude welcome to the NFL has included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Getting knocked goofy while running a pass route in pre-camp workouts and 
having to be helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Suffering a hamstring pull early in training camp, limiting his workouts 
until the first exhibition game two weeks ago at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally getting in the Green Bay game, and getting knocked senseless again 
trying to make a catch on a sideline route. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the hit at Green Bay was my rudest awakening," Brantley said, 
shaking his head. "The ball was a little high, and the safety came through and 
caught me right in the ear. It knocked my earring off." 
</P>
<P>
 But a week later, Brantley ran that same route twice against New England -- 
with different results. 
</P>
<P>
 One led to a 39-yard reception from Chris Chandler on a key third-down play 
that set up Tony Zendejas' 41-yard field goal at the end of the first half. 
Another resulted in a 28-yard catch that was called back on an illegal 
formation penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 By game's end, he had two catches for 51 yards and had returned a punt 11 
yards. Suddenly, he finds his stock rising on a team in desperate need of 
big-play wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams failed to trade for Dallas' Alvin Harper or sign free-agent Haywood 
Jeffires in the off-season, leaving them with a rag-tag group of veterans and 
two promising rookies -- Brantley and second-round pick Isaac Bruce of Memphis 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Brantley appears to have edged ahead of Bruce, who has caught 
one pass for 23 yards in the two games. Brantley has three catches for 60 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and Isaac are two completely different players," receivers coach Steve 
Moore said. "He does more things than Isaac, but I wouldn't say Chris is 
further along than Isaac."  
</P>
<P>
 Moore likes Brantley's quickness and ability to get open -- skills he 
developed at Rutgers, where he led the team in receiving last season with 56 
catches for 589 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've improved that since I got here," Brantley said, "but I ran pretty good 
routes in college, too. I had a really good receivers coach in Mose Rison, 
(cousin of all-Pro receiver Andre Rison of Atlanta), and Steve Moore has worked 
with the best, guys like Steve Largent, so I can learn a lot from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Brantley knows he was drafted into the perfect scenario, joining a team with a 
high-percentage passer in Chris Miller and a receiver corps with depth, but not 
breakaway speed. It's a land of opportunity, and Brantley knows he will get his 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I keep playing well, the coaches will put me where I should be," 
he said. "There's not really a spot for me to jump into right now, but if I 
keep progressing, there will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wide open, but we have some pretty good receivers, so there's some 
competition there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie mistakes kept Brantley, 5 feet 10 and 180 pounds, out of the running 
early. He said he pulled his hamstring chasing down a ball in practice because 
he didn't warm up properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little tight," he said. "Since then, I've learned from Flipper 
Anderson and Jessie Hester to gauge myself in practice. That's not to say 
they're not going 110% in practice, but they know how to gauge themselves in 
practice so they don't hurt themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said Brantley tried to come back too early from the hamstring injury, 
re-injuring it in practice and forcing him out of the lineup again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is customary of achievers," Moore said. "That put him a little further 
behind. He's back now, but he's still not 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he was out of the lineup, Brantley was still active in practice -- 
asking questions, watching routes and . . . helping coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he was helping out," Moore said. "He knew all of our adjustments and 
audibles, even though he wasn't taking a snap. He caught things other players 
missed when I was coaching on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was after my job for a while."

TVERDOVSKY SIGNS BY DUCKS' DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Mighty Ducks, still mired in a contract stalemate with 1993 draft choice 
Paul Kariya, signed this year's first-round pick Oleg Tverdovsky on Monday -- 
and quickly admitted they're trying to send Kariya a message. 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, an offensively talented defenseman who was the second pick in 
June's NHL draft, became the first of this year's top picks to sign, agreeing 
to a three-year deal worth $4.2 million, including $2.5 million in signing 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we're happy about is (Tverdovsky) showed that he really wants to 
play and wants to come here," General Manager Jack Ferreira said from Boston, 
where he is attending NHL meetings. "We're excited because we think he was the 
best player in the draft, and he's going to be a Mighty Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully now (Kariya) sees we're extremely serious about getting guys into 
our lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, a strikingly creative playmaker who starred for Canada in the 
Olympics and World Championships after being drafted fourth overall last year, 
is reportedly seeking at least $2 million a year -- more than a million a year 
more than the Ducks initially offered and considerably more than the $1.4 
million average Tverdovsky will earn. 
</P>
<P>
 But both sides had considerable motivation in Tverdovsky's case. The Ducks 
beat a Monday deadline related to Tverdovsky's release from his Moscow team -- 
perhaps saving several hundred thousand dollars by not having to try to 
negotiate a buyout of the final two years on his Russian contract. And 
Tverdovsky, 18, can achieve his dream of playing in the NHL -- and secure a 
quick departure from Russia, where many players fear for their safety because 
of recent extortion attempts by the so-called Russian mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to become a Mighty Duck," Tverdovsky said through an 
interpreter from his agent's Toronto office. "This is the best arrangement that 
could possibly happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's agent, Don Baizley, will argue that Tverdovsky's contract isn't 
relevant to his client's even though Tverdovsky was a higher pick -- saying 
that since the draft Kariya has proven himself against NHL talent in the World 
Championships. Even Ferreira doesn't expect to be able sign Kariya for less 
than he did Tverdovsky. Asked if he would be willing to sign Kariya to the same 
deal, Ferreira replied quickly: "Done." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira and other general managers have insisted the contracts signed by last 
year's top picks, Ottawa's Alexandre Daigle ($12.25 million for five years) and 
Hartford's Chris Pronger ($7 million for four years) were "aberrations." 
</P>
<P>
 There was speculation at this year's draft that the Ducks, despite their 
profitable first season, might have passed over the top-rated prospect, Radek 
Bonk, because of reluctance to meet his anticipated contract demands. Ferreira 
denies that and says he rated Tverdovsky first. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Tverdovsky's total package is worth less than the contract of last 
year's second pick (Pronger), Tverdovsky's agent, Don Meehan, says the first 
two years are comparable to Pronger's first two years -- and, more important, 
that Tverdovsky will be able to renegotiate when he reaches his option year 
after only two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract terms haven't meant much in the Kariya talks lately. With the opening 
of training camp Sept. 4 fast approaching, Baizley has put negotiations on hold 
while he seeks a clarification from the NHL about Kariya's free-agent status if 
he isn't signed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Baizley has said it is a matter of leverage, that knowing whether the Ducks 
stand to lose Kariya entirely or would have the right to match any offers is a 
determining factor in his value. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kariya has never said he is reluctant to play for the Ducks, Baizley 
responded to a question recently by saying, "I would think any talented young 
player would rather have 26 teams to choose from than one." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ferreira: "I don't know if he's looking for a way out. I think he just 
wants to know his options. That's what they keep saying." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks consider Kariya a cornerstone of their franchise, but trading him 
could become an option, though not a pleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't get equal quality for a guy you're having trouble signing. No 
one's going to take your headaches and give you equal value," Ferreira said. 
"It can be frustrating, but you can't get too aggravated with it, or you'll 
lose perspective for what you're trying to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, at least, is in the fold. He is seen as the point man of the 
future for the Ducks' struggling power play, and Coach Ron Wilson is planning 
to pair him with a strong defensive veteran such as Randy Ladouceur, Bobby 
Dollas or Robert Dirk. The idea is for him to be brought along slowly and 
"spoon-fed" this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The language barrier, Wilson said, is of little concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he's got to understand is my tone of voice. He'll know when I'm upset or 
when I'm happy."

THE OWNERS ARE UNITED -- ON PAPER; BASEBALL: BUT AS STRIKE CONTINUES, THERE 
MIGHT BE PRESSURE ON RIFT BETWEEN MONEY MAKERS AND MONEY LOSERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball fans have often bemoaned the quick-change rosters in the era of free 
agency, but a scorecard also is required to identify the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 owners remain from the 50-day players' strike of 1981. Ten clubs have 
changed ownership since 1990 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The business might be troubled economically, as owners insist in their pursuit 
of a new compensation system that has prompted the players to strike again, but 
there never seems to be a shortage of buyers -- for even the most fragile 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the strike has delayed the sale of the San Diego Padres, for instance, 
and a group headed by former Baltimore Oriole president Larry Lucchino is 
trying to buy the allegedly destitute Pittsburgh Pirates for a reported $85 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Orioles, a cash cow since moving into Camden Yards, went for a 
record $173 million at auction last year, and groups in Phoenix and St. 
Petersburg can't seem to wait for 1998 expansion, although the entry fee 
probably will be $30-$40 million more than the $95 million paid by the Colorado 
Rockies and Florida Marlins in joining the billionaires' club last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Colangelo of the NBA's Suns heads the Phoenix group. He has said that 
baseball is currently experiencing its Armaggedon and should have a better 
system in place by '98. 
</P>
<P>
 Armaggedon? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, how do the troops line up? Who are the generals among the owners? 
</P>
<P>
 The 28 clubs generally fall into the categories of bigger, smaller and middle 
markets -- although market size is not the sole measurement. Nor is the 
categorization based entirely on the revenue-sharing formula that serves as the 
foundation of the owners' salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 There are believed to be nine bigger-market or high-revenue clubs that would 
prefer playing under the current or slightly modified system if the choice is 
that or a prolonged stoppage. They are the Orioles, Rockies, Dodgers, Atlanta 
Braves, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, NewYork Yankees and Mets and Texas 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are seven smaller-market or low-revenue teams unlikely to waver in their 
support of the salary cap. They are the Padres, Pirates, Seattle Mariners, 
Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are 12 teams in the middle, strongly supportive of the salary cap 
but vulnerable, perhaps, to arm twisting by the bigger-market clubs if that 
group begins to push for settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the Angels, Chicago Cubs and White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, San 
Francisco Giants, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics, 
Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds, Florida Marlins and Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one of the 28 clubs must approve a bargaining agreement. Negotiator 
Richard Ravitch and acting commissioner Bud Selig orchestrated the change from 
the previous majority rule. Only eight smaller-market teams can now hold up any 
settlement that does not include a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was approved unanimously by the owners, which some might regret, 
because there are only so many arms for the bigger markets to twist in an 
attempt to get 21 votes and a quick settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Has that process begun? Not in a formal sense, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early for the kind of capitulation that has undermined the owners in 
previous negotiations. In fact, a management source said, it is surprisingly 
tranquil. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a couple of loose cannons, but otherwise I don't see any unrest or 
unease at all," said the source, who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an agent familiar with the situation disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners are so fractionalized that it's difficult to know what's going on 
or how this will end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig has tried to mask the big-market discontent with the hard-line approach, 
refusing to let owners join Ravitch at the bargaining table and 
re-implementing, for the most part, a gag rule against criticism of Ravitch and 
the direction of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners know, however, the union will never accept a cap, and it's doubtful 
Selig can continue to silence George Steinbrenner, who has a $45-million-plus 
cable deal and his New York Yankees on the verge of their first postseason 
appearance since 1981, and/or Peter Angelos, a spitfire attorney who was the 
big money in the purchase of the sold out Orioles? 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos built a fortune winning claims on behalf of asbestos victims. He 
already has turned the Orioles' front office inside out, hopes to lure General 
Manager John Schuerholz from the Braves, gave Manager John Oates a two-year 
extension and then made the 1994 season a living hell for Oates with demands 
and second-guessing. He is said to be privately disenchanted with the 
Selig-Ravitch-Jerry Reinsdorf leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos compared revenue sharing to welfare last week and said the owners 
should open their books and turn them over to an independent economist to 
determine if a salary cap is necessary. He also said the owners should pledge 
not to unilaterally implement their salary cap if the players pledge to return 
to work and not strike through 1995, getting the game back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf, the White Sox owner and a close friend of Selig, responded that 
Angelos is new to baseball and doesn't know much about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirm that there is no love lost between Angelos and Reinsdorf, an 
architect of Fay Vincent's ouster, which left owners in position to conduct 
these negotiations without interference from a commissioner. Angelos, however, 
is a man who doesn't easily accept limitations or gag rules, and more than 
Steinbrenner, who does not have a large constituency among the other owners, 
Angelos might emerge as a big-market ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's possible to build a coalition, but I don't know how effective 
that would be in the near term," Angelos said Monday. "The most important thing 
is that we need other owners involved in the high council and at the bargaining 
table. Then, maybe, there would be some different opinions and approaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Four other big-market owners might become more involved if there is a push for 
21 votes and a compromised settlement, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Fred Wilpon of the Mets, John Harrington of the Red Sox, Peter 
O'Malley of the Dodgers and Jerry McMorris of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking magnate McMorris, whose Rockies were on a pace to break their 
all-time attendance record of last year, is an advocate of moving troubled 
franchises and said last week that the salary-cap issue should be negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington previously worked with the players union on realignment and the new 
playoff format, and might become a conciliatory voice between Ravitch and Don 
Fehr, executive director of the union. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley insists that he supports Ravitch and the need for a new system, but 
consistently stood with the big markets during the 12 bitter months required to 
negotiate a revenue-sharing formula and has questioned the wisdom of sharing 
with poorly operated franchises if there are no safeguards to ensure proper 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Which of the middle-market owners might be tempted to join a big-market 
coalition in pushing for an end to the strike? 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Schott of the Reds and Drayton McLane of the Astros are said to be 
firmly behind the salary cap proposal, but wouldn't they like to see their 
teams renew their division dogfight? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jacobs is also said to be in the salary cap camp, but wouldn't he like 
to see his Indians extend Cleveland's renaissance by reaching the playoffs? 
Mike Illitch of the Tigers insists the compensation system needs to be changed 
but has the resources of his pizza chain to call on if the system doesn't 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tribune Co., which owns the Cubs, has cable rights to seven major league 
teams and could be vulnerable to pressure either way, as could the Cardinals. 
St. Louis' Anheuser-Busch has advertising ties to 27 of the 28 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Autry claims the Angels have lost $16 million over the last five years 
and her club falls into the small - market category primarily because of one of 
the worst stadium leases in baseball. However, even other owners have 
questioned the small - market status of a team playing in Southern California, 
and the players union holds up the Angels as a classic example of their 
contention that many of the game's alleged economic problems stem from bad 
management. In any case, it's unlikely that the Angels can be influenced to 
join a big-market coalition, although Autry has said the game can survive under 
the current system. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also uncertain where the influential Reinsdorf stands. He had said, in 
what may have been a self-serving statement, that he could live with the status 
quo, but once the strike started he became a hawk. It is almost certain he 
would not break with Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 And Selig, despite scattered comments by Steinbrenner, Angelos, Schott and 
McMorris last week, said the owners worked too hard putting their proposal 
together over a two-year period to suddenly throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the players are united as they have always been united," Selig said. 
"This time the owners are equally united, and it would be a tragic 
miscalculation for anyone on either side to think differently. We have to get 
past all that and make a deal. I can assure you that not one owner questions 
the need for change in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Selig was asked, why do so many keep buying into an allegedly troubled 
industry? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a matter of due diligence or anyone failing to do their 
homework," he said. "You're talking about people who have been wonderfully 
successful in almost everything they do and thinking they can bring a different 
approach to baseball and make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hope springs eternal, but they come in with all that hope and expectation and 
are quickly stunned and dismayed by what they find. Drayton McLane would tell 
you that unless the system changes, he can't make it. And it's not just the 
small or middle markets, it's the big markets as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the despair is not confined to a few local areas, it's everywhere, 
and you couldn't move all the clubs because there'd be no place to move them. 
If that's the answer, it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve to 14 teams will lose money this year, according to management 
projections. Still, any "For Sale" signs won't be up long.

AMERICANS HEADING ABROAD; SOCCER: U.S. WORLD CUP PLAYERS ARE HAVING MIXED LUCK 
FINDING JOBS WITH FOREIGN CLUB TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. soccer players are accustomed to being regarded as the final markdowns on 
the sales floor of the sport. They travel the world wearing figurative red 
tags, eager to be sold to someone, anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be different this year. This summer's World Cup had dual 
goals: Sell the sport to a skeptical American public and sell American players 
to equally skeptical European club teams. The first item has, perhaps, been 
accomplished, for however brief a duration. The second is still in 
mid-transaction. With American soccer, no sale is ever final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect 10 players off the World Cup team to sign first-division 
contracts in the top countries," said Sunil Gulati, chairman of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation National Teams committee and the 1994 World Cup's chief 
international officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of players on the field were already under contract, so you can't 
expect the same kind of movement. In 1990, we had one player sign a contract 
without some kind of trial -- Tab (Ramos). The other players had long tryouts 
and a long time on reserve teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the United States lacks a professional soccer league of first-division 
caliber, U.S. players have little chance to showcase their talents. The 
situation puts enormous importance on the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a showcase for yourself, but it's more important to help the team," 
defensive midfielder Mike Sorber said. "If you think individually, and think, 
'I'm going to help myself get noticed by a team,' then you are going to bring 
the team down." 
</P>
<P>
 A few German clubs showed an interest in Sorber before and during the World 
Cup, but that interest waned. Like many U.S. players, Sorber was left without a 
job afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was vague," he said from his home in St. Louis. "People like to 
talk -- there's German teams interested, English clubs. But until there's a 
contract or they contact me or my agent, it's all just talk. I don't know what 
happened. I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a familiar pattern of hopes raised then dashed. Only Ramos, who plays in 
Spain, and John Harkes, who plays in England, got jobs immediately after the 
1990 World Cup in Italy. Eric Wynalda followed soon after with teams in 
Germany, but the U.S. team's poor performance and ignoble exit after the first 
round was not conducive to serious offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Was 1994 any better? From the 22-man World Cup roster, five players have 
signed contracts with European clubs. However, three of them -- goalkeeper Brad 
Friedel and midfielders Joe-Max Moore and Claudio Reyna, did not play. A 
fourth, Cobi Jones, was used sparingly. Starting defender Alexi Lalas is the 
only American player who can say the World Cup exposure got him a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Tony Meola might argue that contention. The veteran did finally 
sign a professional contract -- as a kicker with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketability of American players might have increased because of the 
World Cup, but they are still viewed in bargain basement terms -- 
ultra-competitive, not highly skilled, and still relatively inexpensive in a 
world of $20-million transfer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That view (of the clumsy American player) is changed," Gulati said. "Tab 
helped change that. The fact that we tried to play in the World Cup and didn't 
sit back on defense helped change that. But there's still a let's-look-and-see 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still an issue from the club perspective. Our players have not proven 
themselves in a domestic league. If a club is going to make a 
multimillion-dollar investment, and that is based on only four (World Cup) 
games, they are going to be leery." 
</P>
<P>
 What teams hope to find is value. They can spend little for a U.S. player, say 
a $200,000 transfer fee and a salary of $100,000, and hope to press coal into a 
diamond. The contracts of Americans still tend to be light on salary and heavy 
with incentive bonuses. The duration of the contracts, too, is noticeably 
shorter. Most newly signed players have clauses allowing them to return to the 
United States should the proposed Major League Soccer enterprise get off the 
ground next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. team general manager Bill Nuttall said that, while American 
players are not expensive, the team's good showing in this summer's World Cup 
enhanced their value. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave a legitimacy to our players," he said. "Lalas was a pleasant surprise 
(in terms of team interest), but Joe-Max Moore didn't play a minute. We had 
that deal done July 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many of the U.S. players were under contract to the USSF, the 
federation negotiated most of the deals and kept 90% of the transfer fees. The 
federation's approach to placing players, officials say, is to find the right 
match. Interest from teams in Colombia, for example, was quickly quashed, but 
overtures from most European teams have been greeted cordially. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, officials say, Lalas generated the most interest. Teams in three 
countries vied for his services before Lalas chose Padove in the highly 
competitive Italian first division. 
</P>
<P>
 His case illustrates the importance of the U.S. players who had gone before. 
If American players do well, they often put in a good word for their 
countrymen. The other teams courting Lalas had American connections. Coventry 
City in the English Premier League already had American forward Roy Wegerle, 
and VfL Bochum in the German Bundesliga signed Wynalda before the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither team got Lalas, Coventry did sign his teammate, Jones. Moore 
went to Wynalda's former Bundesliga team, Saarbrucken. Reyna was signed by 
Bayer Leverkusen, Thomas Dooley's new German team. Friedel was signed by 
Newcastle United, which has no other American players but was no doubt 
encouraged by the success of two other American goalkeepers in England -- Kasey 
Keller at Millwall and Jurgen Sommer at Luton Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the success of these Americans abroad, American soccer officials and 
players are no longer traveling hat in hand, Nuttall said, especially after 
this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had more people soliciting us than us soliciting them," he said. "You can 
thank Harkes, Ramos and Wynalda for the efforts they put in as pioneers to give 
credibility for American players. They stuck it out and showed that Americans 
can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, an American on a European soccer team is still a rarity. And, if 
American players are seen as inexpensive raw talent, so are Africans, who are 
flocking to European teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, there were three or four (Americans at top-level clubs abroad) and 
now there are six or eight," Sorber said. "Slowly but surely we are chiseling 
our way in. The more successful these guys are, the easier it will be for the 
younger guys. There are so many players in the world and so few jobs." The Next

BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT; SHAH RETURNS AS UCLA'S RUSHING HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharmon Shah did a disappearing act worthy of Houdini or a one-song rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you see him on stage, living up to his nickname, Hollywood Shah carrying 
40 times for 187 yards against Stanford. Now you don't see him again until the 
1993 season has ended and someone else has the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the back who was going to make UCLA's running game go. Then he was 
going to a hospital, his season over. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shah's misfortune came the opportunity for Skip Hicks to become the 
first freshman to lead UCLA in rushing since freshmen became eligible for 
varsity play in 1972. Out of Hicks' misfortune comes an opportunity for Shah to 
reclaim what was his: No. 1 status and everything that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys seize the day," says Wayne Moses, the coach in charge of the Bruin 
running backs. "Certainly, Sharmon has a golden opportunity. If (Hicks) is 
healthy, he would be the starter. He isn't, so Sharmon has a chance to make 
people say, 'Skip who?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sharmon who? 
</P>
<P>
 He was the back who was confused and so confused others last season as a 
sophomore. He still can't tell you how he suffered torn knee cartilage the 
first time, before preseason practice began. After an arthroscopic operation, 
he rehabilitated enough to carry 10 times for 58 yards in the season's second 
game, against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, only three months out of high school, gained 148 yards against the 
Cornhuskers. But he also suffered an ankle injury and couldn't play against 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah was ready. Or was he? 
</P>
<P>
 From a meeting of Shah, his father, Naim, and Coach Terry Donahue came word 
that recovery was being inhibited by a congenital knee problem. A medical 
redshirt season was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, after only one practice, Shah carried a school-record 40 
times for 187 yards in UCLA's first victory, at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how it happened," he says. "They just kept giving the ball to 
me. It's happened to me before, in the (high school) Shrine game when I set a 
record for carries. Coaches just tend to do that with me." 
</P>
<P>
 That record was 29 carries for 163 yards in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "After (the Nebraska and Stanford) games, I wasn't thinking about redshirting 
anymore," Shah says now. Five days later, it didn't matter. He was carrying for 
the fourth time against San Diego State and when he planted his right foot to 
cut, the knee gave out. 
</P>
<P>
 So did his season. 
</P>
<P>
 He disappeared. Rehabilitation was done quietly. He showed up at practice 
infrequently. What was the point? 
</P>
<P>
 "It ate me up inside, not to be involved, because I'm a ballplayer," he said. 
"But it wasn't that bad later for me. I wanted to see us win, and after a 
couple of games I was OK, and I realized that I had gotten a lot of experience 
for a redshirt year." 
</P>
<P>
 He had 54 carries for 280 yards in a season that didn't count against his 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season wore on, word that his rehabilitation was progressing produced a 
rumor that he could come back, if needed. He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gotten better (in late October and early November), but I wouldn't have 
been helping myself or the team," he says. "It would have just been for ego, 
and you've got to suppress that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Rose Bowl, I got chills. They asked me if I wanted to suit up, but I 
was afraid I'd try to get out there and blow my whole year away, so I said let 
me stay in regular clothes and tell Ricky (Davis) and Skip about the holes I 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was destined not to play last year, like maybe I'm destined to rip 
it up this year." 
</P>
<P>
 He might have to for UCLA to get the offensive balance Donahue says the Bruins 
need for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah is a sophomore again, courtesy of the Pacific 10, and Hicks is on the 
outside, looking in, after being injured while competing in the long jump with 
the UCLA track team in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks is six months into a rehabilitation program that usually lasts up to a 
year, and says he is ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 90% ready and the other 10% is mental," Hicks says. 
</P>
<P>
 He has even convinced Donahue, with his sprints up and down the sideline at 
Spalding Field in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team doctor, Gerald Finerman, says Hicks isn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donahue: "We have hope, but the football team and the coaching staff are 
going to go under the idea that he won't be able to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Hicks wears a uniform all season, he will be a specter over the 
performance of all other Bruin backs. With only 100 college carries for 563 
yards, he has become a gauge against which others are measured. 
</P>
<P>
 If Shah gains five yards on a play, would Hicks have gained six or 10 or more? 
If Shah fumbles, would Hicks have? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of pressure Donahue will not tolerate, at least among those he 
can influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may look at it like that," he says. "But on a team, when somebody 
goes down, it's up to everyone else to rally around those who are left. Hicks 
is a difference-maker, but Sharmon Shah carried 40 times against Stanford. He's 
shown he can be durable and take a pounding." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah prefers to deflect the situation as best he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Skip can come back, I really do," he says. "And if anyone can come 
back that quickly, it's him. He's a tough kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can't worry about what anybody says, because people are going to say 
things anyway. That's life. I'm not trying to be Skip. I'm not trying to be 
Darren Washington (a senior tailback who has moved to fullback). I'm just 
trying to do the best I can at being Sharmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my attitude, I don't think that sort of thing will get to me. As long as 
I'm doing my job and we're getting (victories), I really don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, while Hicks runs along the sidelines, Shah runs more freely 
and with more abandon than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he works too hard," Moses says. "I've told him there's only so much 
tread on a tire, and if you've worn it out in the summer before you get to me 
in the fall, there's nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah simply wants to see if knowledge gleaned from a summer working with 
former Washington back Beno Bryant, a teammate at Dorsey High, and others will 
take him back to the No. 1 spot to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eager because I get to see if what I have been practicing all summer will 
work on the field," he says. "I have some new knowledge of the game and I want 
to test it. I've worked hard, and it's time."

JIM MURRAY: HE KNEW SECRET OF SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know why I knew Nick Price was going to win the PGA, his second major 
tournament in a row? 
</P>
<P>
 Easy. Murray's first law of tournament golf was at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's first law: "In every tournament, every player, including the eventual 
winner, especially the winner, will have one cold round, 18 holes in which the 
ball goes off the club erratically, takes unfortunate bounces, disobeys orders. 
Confidence ebbs, anxiety increases and the golfer feels he has been temporarily 
deserted by his talents. It is inevitable, inescapable." 
</P>
<P>
 It works this way: The golfer might have a pattern of a hot round, another hot 
round, then a cold round, then a hot round. Or his rounds might be 
cold-hot-hot-hot. Or hot-cold-hot-hot. In any event, one round will be cold. 
Below par, maybe, but cold. You can take it to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to keep your cold round from being catastrophic. The good, 
veteran players find a way to do this. They recognize the cold front 
approaching and set about to defang it. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters on the tour usually cannot find a way to do this. They do not 
understand what's happening to them. They get badly rattled. They fight back. 
The more they struggle, the worse it gets for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans know how to recognize the early signals of a cold round. They learn 
to live with it. They don't fight it. They learn to head it off at the pass, so 
to speak. They humor it, romance it, soothe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch them some time. They see what is happening and stop trying to shoot 63s. 
They know that the trick is to turn a potential 80 into a 74. Or a 78 into a 
73. Cut their losses. Defend themselves against the course, not attack it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a high art. Inexperienced players don't catch on. They misread the 
signals. They don't know they're bucking a pat hand with treys. They are like 
gamblers who double their bets to get even. Instead, they get deeper in the 
hole.  
</P>
<P>
 The great players know better. When the course starts to fight back, you need 
enormous patience. You have to resist chance-taking.  
</P>
<P>
 Young players disdain this. In 1956, when he was still an amateur, though a 
brilliant one, Ken Venturi had an eight-stroke lead over Jackie Burke going 
into the final round of the Masters. He couldn't find a way to stave off a 
final-round 80. He fed it trying to counter it. Like a fighter throwing crazy 
rights, he left himself wide open to the course's counterpunching. Burke made 
up nine shots and beat him by one.  
</P>
<P>
 When the dreaded cold-round 80 is beginning to descend on you, what you have 
to do is man your defenses. Don't panic. Don't throw good money after bad. 
Don't try for miracle shots. Don't call and raise when you don't have the 
cards. As the song says, know when to fold 'em. Don't say "Hit me!" when you've 
got 18. Or maybe even 16.  
</P>
<P>
 You can't have a cold last round. You can have a cold first round. Ben Hogan 
won a U.S. Open in 1951 after opening with a 76. But Hogan never had a cold 
last round. Hale Irwin won an Open in 1979 with a final-round 75, but that was 
the highest final round in 30 years. And nobody has had one that high since.  
</P>
<P>
 I knew on Saturday that Nick Price was going to win the PGA when he turned his 
cold round into a par round. It was a lesson in the art of steering a potential 
wreck, say, a truck with the brakes gone safely into the garage.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a classic of cold-war golf. It was the third round and Price started 
the day with a five-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But he missed eight fairways. You can't do that in a major. Price knew it was 
his cold round. 
</P>
<P>
 But he kept the wheels on. He didn't ask more of the course than it was 
willing to give. He didn't shoot the moon. He played the cards he was dealt 
that day.  
</P>
<P>
 Even when the opposition was chipping away steadily at his lead, Price didn't 
get hysterical. He knows golf for the old strumpet she is. When she gets in one 
of her moods, she responds better to flattery than aggression. Price, in a 
sense, brought her flowers.  
</P>
<P>
 He managed to protect his score. It is the notion here that he turned a 75 or 
76 into a respectable 70.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, what this did was change Sunday's final round. Instead of Price going 
into that final round with no cushion, having to charge to catch his 
opposition, it was the opposition who had to play catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had posted his 75 -- as he probably should have -- it would have allowed 
his competitors to play safe, sure golf, confident golf. Instead, they had to 
go for broke. Take all the chances. They had to catch the leader. They had to 
fire at the pins, go boldly for the holes on the green, no lag putts. They had 
to risk three-putting. They were like guys playing with the rent money. And 
like all guys playing with the rent money, they lost.  
</P>
<P>
 Price had put his cold round behind him. Gotten it out of the way with his 70. 
He knew he was due for another hot round. He was. He shot 66 Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was not his 66 -- or his opening rounds of 65-67 -- that won Nick his 
second PGA. It was the 70 he salvaged on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like crawling through enemy territory with your powder wet, your gun 
jammed, your sword rusty and one hand tied behind your back. Sometimes, to 
survive is to win. Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. That's why 
golf has a Price on its head today.

DUCKS SIGN FIRST-ROUND PICK TVERDOVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks, still mired in a contract stalemate with 1993 first-round 
draft choice Paul Kariya, signed this year's first-round pick, Oleg Tverdovsky, 
on Monday -- and quickly admitted they're trying to send Kariya a message. 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, an offensively skilled defenseman who was the second pick in 
June's draft, became the first of this year's top picks to sign, agreeing to a 
three-year deal worth $4.2 million, including $2.5 million in signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully now (Kariya) sees we're extremely serious about getting guys into 
our lineup." General Manager Jack Ferreira said by telephone from Boston, where 
he is attending NHL meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, who starred for Canada in the Olympics and World Championships 
after being drafted fourth overall last year, reportedly is seeking at least $2 
million a year -- more than a million a year more than the Ducks initially 
offered and considerably more than the $1.4 million average -- including 
signing bonuses -- that Tverdovsky will earn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ferreira does not expect to sign Kariya for less than he did Tverdovsky. 
In fact, asked if he would be willing to sign Kariya to the same deal, Ferreira 
replied quickly, "Done." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tverdovsky's case, both sides had considerable motivation. The Ducks beat a 
Monday deadline related to Tverdovsky's release from his Moscow team -- perhaps 
saving several hundred thousand dollars by not having to negotiate a buyout of 
the two years remaining on his contract. And Tverdovsky, 18, is ensured a quick 
departure from Russia, where many players fear for their safety because of 
recent extortion attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of training camp Sept. 4 fast approaching, Don Baizley, 
Kariya's agent, has put negotiations on hold while he seeks a clarification 
from the NHL about Kariya's free-agent status if he isn't signed this year.

SWIMMING / U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS; HENDERSON SETS YEAR'S BEST IN THE 100-METER 
BUTTERFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<P>
 Mark Henderson swam a 1994 world best of 53.60 seconds in beating Brian 
Alderman in the men's 100-meter butterfly final Monday in the U.S. National 
Swimming Championships at the Natatorium here. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson's bettered the previous 1994 best of 53.80 set by China's Chenji 
Jiang.Alderman finished in 53.88. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson quit swimming after failing to make the 1992 Olympic team, but 
returned to the sport in the fall of 1992 while attending California and began 
intense training last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's 200-meter freestyle, Cristina Teuscher, 16, upset 1992 Olympic 
champion Nicole Haislett with a time of 1:59.71. 
</P>
<P>
 In two other finals on Monday, Eric Namesnik won the 400-meter individual 
medley in 4:14.41. Tom Dolan, who surpassed Namesnik's American record during 
the spring nationals, was second in 4:17.43. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Wagner won the women's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:28.86. Kristine 
Quance was second in 2:29.91. 
</P>
<P>
 The championships continue through Saturday.

AMERICAN INFLUX ALARMS HEAD OF ENGLISH SOCCER PLAYERS' UNION

<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the soccer players' union in England doesn't like Americans 
playing on his home turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not so long ago we were teaching the Americans how to play," Gordon Taylor 
said Monday. "Now I've got work permits for them piling up on my desk. It could 
be disastrous for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry City pursued U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, who signed last month with 
Padova of Italy's first division. Coventry then signed Cobi Jones, Lalas' World 
Cup teammate, to join forward Roy Wegerle, a South African who gained American 
citizenship two years ago. Wegerle has played in England since the 1986-87 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want people coming in who are no better than the people here, just 
cheaper," Taylor said.

ITALIAN GRAND PRIX PUT BACK ON SCHEDULE -- TREES AND ALL

<P>
 The Italian Grand Prix is back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after canceling the race, Formula One's governing body on Monday 
said it was reinstating the Sept. 11 event following agreement on new safety 
measures at the Monza circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation International de L'Automobile (FIA) said it had approved a 
proposal for changes to the second Lesmo Corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This solution, which changes the shape of the second Lesmo and reduces its 
speed, is acceptable to the FIA on the basis that it is for 1994 only," FIA 
said in a statement. "As a result, the 1994 Italian Grand Prix has been 
reinstated on the calendar of the 1994 FIA Formula One Championship."

<P>
 The grandstand at the second corner will be removed and replaced with a gravel 
run-off area and new crash barriers, FIA spokesman Martin Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The angle of the corner will be made more acute, cutting speeds from 
approximately 161 m.p.h. to 105 m.p.h., Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIA had scrapped the race last Friday after local officials refused to make 
changes that would have required cutting down 123 trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, no trees will be cut down.

BASEBALL STRIKE REPORT; HEAD OF MEDIATION SERVICE FORESEES LITTLE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR JOINT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While baseball's negotiations remained in limbo on the fourth day of the 
strike by the major league players, the director of the mediation service 
hoping to aid a settlement said he couldn't be sure when the players and owners 
would hold another joint session. 
</P>
<P>
 John Calhoun Wells, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, 
said Monday that "given the history and deeply held positions," it would be 
unrealistic to think a quick or easy settlement can be achieved in baseball's 
eighth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll continue to be in touch with both sides this week, and I'm hopeful the 
timing will be right to hold a joint session," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators for the players and owners have not spoken since Friday. The 
four-day strike has wiped out 46 games and become the third-longest in-season 
strike in baseball history, exceeded only by the 50-day strike in 1981, which 
forced cancellation of 712 games, and the nine-day strike of 1972 that wiped 
out 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the players union, spent Monday in Washington, 
pursuing antitrust matters, according to a source. He and owners negotiator 
Richard Ravitch met separately with four mediators Saturday -- John Martin, 
Brian Flores and Wilma Liebman of the FMCS, and Steve Rosenthal, associate 
deputy secretary of the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Washington, Rosenthal said it would be up to the FMCS to decide 
"when mediation should take place and in what form." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Associated Press, the Boston-based Martin has been in touch 
with both sides since the owners voted in December of 1992 to reopen collective 
bargaining a year before the agreement expired. Martin, who mediated the 11-day 
NHL strike in 1992, said his team would maintain daily communication but didn't 
know if it would attend bargaining sessions immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no sessions scheduled the rest of the week. ROSS NEWHAN

BETZSOLD BOLTS TO FINE START AS PRO; BASEBALL: EX-TITAN DRAFTED IN THE 20TH 
ROUND BY CLEVELAND IS LEADING NEW YORK-PENN LEAGUE IN HOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Betzsold's final college baseball season was bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold was happy to be part of Cal State Fullerton's highly successful 
season: a share of the Big West championship, an NCAA regional title and a 
semifinal berth in the College World Series in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 His disappointment was in not being a bigger part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold started in 36 of the team's 63 games, platooning with two promising 
freshmen, Jeremy Giambi and Mark Kotsay. Betzsold started chiefly against 
left-handed pitchers and pinch hit on other occasions. But Betzsold wanted to 
be in the lineup every game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accepted it from a team standpoint because the coaches felt it was best," 
Betzsold said, "but I didn't accept it from a personal standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold finished the season with a .266 average, 31 runs batted in and four 
home runs. "I was extremely happy when I got drafted," Betzsold said. He was 
concerned he might not be, based on his senior season. The Cleveland Indians 
didn't pick him until the 20th round, but as far as Betzsold was concerned, the 
big thing was having a chance to move ahead in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was a new start for me, and I made up my mind to do everything I 
could with it," Betzsold said. "I know I have the ability, and it's a matter of 
me putting things together." 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold, who starred at Mater Dei High, appears to have done that playing for 
Watertown, N.Y., in the New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first professional game, Betzsold was two for three with a home run. 
Then he had a game-winning home run the next night. He's been going strong 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, he leads the league in home runs with 12, slugging percentage 
(.660) and on-base percentage (.488). Betzsold's .333 batting average is fifth 
best in the league and his 40 runs batted in rank third. He's played in 50 
games.  
</P>
<P>
 "We really like what we've seen from him so far, especially his power," 
Watertown Manager Jeff Datz said. "He's definitely got some juice in his bat. 
He's done a heck of a job for us, and has hit well in the clutch." 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold, 6 feet 3 and 210 pounds, has been most pleased by his home run 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt I had the home run potential," he said. "In college, though, 
it seemed like I was fouling off pitches I thought I could hit with power, but 
it just seems to be clicking right now. I'm not fouling that pitch off anymore. 
. . . I've been connecting with it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the knocks on Betzsold at Fullerton was his inconsistent defense, but 
Datz said Betzsold has improved this season. "He was a little shaky early in 
the season in right field," Datz said, "but he's doing much better lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold said the Indians' coaches have been working with him on getting 
better jumps on line drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim was never a liability in the outfield for us, but we thought we had 
better defensive outfielders in the program," said George Horton, the Titans' 
associate head coach. "In his senior year, it was a matter of him getting 
caught up in the depth we had in the outfield, too, with Giambi and Kotsay also 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay wound up as the team's leading hitter with a .372 average and Giambi 
hit .294. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, Jim never showed the kind of consistency we were looking 
for to allow him to be in the lineup day after day," Horton said. "He had some 
real good hitting spurts, though, and in retrospect, if we'd have left him in 
the lineup for the whole season his numbers for the year might have been 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said Betzsold, who bats right-handed, had most of his problems on 
breaking pitches. That's the reason he played primarily against left-handers. 
"He's probably seeing more fastballs on that level, too, which should be in his 
favor," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Horton said he and the other Titan coaches are delighted Betzsold 
is off to such a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy we always rooted for because he works so hard," Horton said. "I 
think he'll probably continue to improve, too, because of that work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold said the Fullerton program has helped him in professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from a program like that, it's not such a big jump," Betzsold said. 
"At Fullerton, we really worked a lot on fundamentals, and I know that's 
helping me now. The coaches there taught me that you really have to prepare 
yourself for every game. That's real important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been seeing a lot of the pitchers here I saw in college, guys from LSU, 
Pepperdine and Long Beach State. I went against (former teammate) Mike Parisi 
the other night and had a two-run double against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold thinks returning to the wooden bat also has been in his favor. "I've 
always liked the wood bat because it's a little heavier than the aluminum," he 
said. "I used to take batting practice with it at Fullerton and used it in the 
Cape Cod league last summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie league season will end Sept. 2, and Betzsold said he is undecided 
on going immediately to a fall instructional league. More likely, he said, he 
will return to Fullerton to work on his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have one more semester of work to finish, and I'd really like to take 
care of that," he said. "Then I'll devote all my time to my baseball career for 
the years after that. At this point, too, I feel really good about my future in 
the game."

SPARKS FEELS IT'S HIS TURN TO SHINE AT WASHINGTON STATE; FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK 
WHOSE CONTROVERSIAL CAREER TOOK HIM TO FOUR HIGH SCHOOLS HAS OVERCOME THREE 
SHOULDER SURGERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Derek Sparks was issued a red Washington State practice jersey last week. You 
would have thought he'd been handed the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of hard work in getting that jersey," Sparks said. "When they 
gave it to me, I started getting excited. I was ready to get in there and hit. 
I felt strong again." 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like a small step for one who danced so brazenly through a four-year 
odyssey of a high school career. But for Sparks, a junior running back, it was 
a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer would he carry the stigma of that yellow shirt, the one injured 
players are required to wear. No longer would he be damaged goods. No more 
would he be a bundle of unfulfilled promises. 
</P>
<P>
 That red jersey was big man, big . 
</P>
<P>
 With it, returned the old Derek Sparks. After two years, three shoulder 
surgeries and a number of unanswered questions, he was back, talking tough and 
playing rough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hesitant at all about getting hit," Sparks said. "I'm looking forward 
to that first contact. I'm ready to go. I just want to get two-a-days over with 
and then I'll set some goals for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Time passes quickly, even in Pullman, Wash. A mere four years ago, Sparks was 
the most controversial high school football player in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hot property long before college recruiters began circling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks attended four high schools in as many years, one in Texas, and nearly 
reduced one football program to rubble. He finished at Mater Dei, where he 
helped the Monarchs reach the Southern Section Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sparks then vanished at Washington State. He had a solid freshman season; 
he was being groomed to be the Cougars' workhorse. But the shoulder injury 
changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to carry a load when you're a burden yourself. Sparks underwent two 
surgeries last year and missed the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst time in my life," Sparks said. "I had to wonder if the man 
upstairs was saying, 'Kid you got to find something else.' But I kept my faith 
and here I am today." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he's at the top of the chart. Sparks is currently the Cougars' starting 
tailback, and that's written in stone, barring further injury. Cougar coaches 
already know his value. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks' size, now 5 feet 11, 228 pounds, and speed have always been an 
attractive package and he delivered as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen very few freshmen who were as ready to play college football as 
Derek," Cougar Coach Mike Price said. "He was mature and he was strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter was the reason Sparks gained 269 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per 
carry his first season. He spent the year as a caddie to Shaumbe Wright-Fair, 
the Cougars' junior running back, but when asked to take the leading role, 
Sparks shined. 
</P>
<P>
 In a junior varsity game, he gained 267 yards in 18 carries and scored five 
touchdowns. That may seem less impressive, being a JV game, but Sparks also 
produced with the big club as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wright-Fair injured, Sparks started in a 40-27 victory over Arizona and 
gained 97 yards in 16 carries. He had a 45-yard touchdown nullified because of 
a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to get the ball 16 to 20 times a game," Sparks said. "I'm not 
effective if I only get the ball five or six times. The more carries I get, the 
stronger I get." 
</P>
<P>
 Price plans to accommodate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derek is a load when he carries the ball," Price said. "He has speed, but 
he'll also plow over people. I knew he was special the first day he was here. I 
remember thinking, 'Notre Dame gets 25 of these guys each year.' If I had 25 
Derek Sparks, coaching would be a little easier." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, there did seem to be a number of Derek Sparks running around. Almost 
every school seemed to have one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks' high school career was a movable feast. He started in Wharton, Tex., 
as a freshman, then transferred to Wilmington Banning. He gained nearly 1,394 
yards for Pilots, but left after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his junior season at Montclair Prep, where he gained 1,944 yards and 
scored 35 touchdowns. But Mountie coaches were no better at holding onto Sparks 
than opponents. One game into the 1990 season, he broke free and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in Montclair Prep's opener, Sparks and his cousin, Leland, 
transferred to Mater Dei. The move sparked plenty of finger pointing on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sparkses were declared eligible by the Southern Section after two 
meetings, during which Montclair Prep coaches were accused of grade tampering 
and recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland Sparks also went to Washington State to play football, but is now 
academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep was placed on probation. Its football program was not allowed 
to compete in the 1991 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of bad blood," Sparks said. "There were things that happened 
that shouldn't have happened. All the chaos made it hard to focus on football." 
</P>
<P>
 Even distracted, Sparks gained 1,745 yards for the Monarchs. But not all was 
rosy. After a 3-0 victory over Loyola, Sparks and one of his uncles -- angered 
by comments made by Loyola officials about the transfer -- taunted Loyola 
coaches, dancing in front of them, and nearly started a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Sparks apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 His notoriety, he said, scared off some recruiters. But not Price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the circumstances and we found no character flaw," Price said. 
"It was an unusual situation, but Derek didn't do anything improper." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sparks: "You know, I wouldn't change a thing. It prepared me to face 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems came. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks isn't sure how or when he first injured his shoulder. He just knew it 
hurt throughout his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he had arthroscopic surgery on it, and five days later, gained 
40 yards against Arizona in relief of Wright-Fair. He finished with 244 yards, 
but something wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried only once for 11 yards in the Cougars' 31-28 victory over Utah in 
the Copper Bowl. A week later, he visited the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks had reconstructive surgery on the front of his shoulder in January 
1993. If it was successful, they would do a similar operation on the back of 
his shoulder in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 His was going to miss the following season. Worse yet, his grades dropped. 
Sparks had to wear a special brace to keep his shoulder in place. It made 
school work difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "In class, I couldn't find a seat I could fit into," Sparks said. "It made it 
tough taking notes. I was on pain killers, which made me drowsy. It was a rough 
semester." 
</P>
<P>
 But he held on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hell for six weeks," he said. "It wore me down. I've learned there are 
walls you have to climb. I could have given up. But there were things left to 
prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Price: "I think Derek is hungrier now. I think football has become more 
important to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks had surgery to reconstruct the front of his shoulder and came back 
healthy this spring. But Price, fearing another injury, chose to hold him out 
of contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Sparks lifted weights -- he bench presses 340 pounds -- worked on 
blocking bags and went through conditioning drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, he was itching to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did everything I had to do," Sparks said. "People here believed in me and I 
believed in myself. Once I get a little contact in, it's going to be smooth 
sailing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Price: "Yeah, we expect Derek to be in a red jersey all season. 
Especially on Saturdays."

UNDER PRESSURE, O.C. OFFERS 2 SCALED-DOWN BOLSA PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to vehement criticism, the county has taken the unusual step of 
suggesting two plans that would dramatically downsize the proposed development 
of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Koll Real Estate Group proposes to build 4,286 homes, a county 
document described Monday proffers alternatives of either 3,200 or 2,500 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Koll company called the last alternative "totally, 
unequivocally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to deal with what's real, and our plan for Bolsa Chica is real," 
Senior Vice President Lucy Dunn said, adding that she did not have enough 
information to comment on the proposal for 3,200 units but that she considered 
it inferior to her company's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll plan is still on the table; the county's environmental impact report 
merely offers the company some alternatives. It also sends a message that the 
company's own plan might not be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is be responsive to the comments we've received," 
said Tom Mathews, director of planning for the county's Environmental 
Management Agency, which prepared both reports. The developers, he said, "are 
going to have to lower their expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the county released a bulky environmental impact report analyzing 
the Koll plan which, in addition to the homes, calls for construction of a road 
transecting the area and a $20-million tidal inlet connecting the wetlands to 
the ocean as the centerpiece of an ambitious restoration effort. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 60-day period for public comments, the report was soundly lambasted 
by environmentalists, residents and Huntington Beach officials on grounds 
ranging from environmental concerns to the prohibitive costs of providing city 
services for so many new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got more than 350 letters," Mathews said. "We analyzed the critical 
concerns and determined that in order to develop a viable plan, we would have 
to substantially revise the document, so we decided to write a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the Koll plan "wishful thinking," Mathews on Monday described the new 
environmental impact report -- at a press conference and then before a planning 
session of the Huntington Beach City Council. He said it would be released next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Koll plan would include 4,286 homes on 400 acres of both bluff areas 
and protected lowland marshes, it also would commit the company to restore 
1,100 acres of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 3,200-home plan calls for some development on protected lowland 
marshes and requires the company to restore the rest of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest-density plan would allow no homes on protected areas, relieving the 
Koll company of any responsibility for restoring the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither county alternative includes a transecting road or tidal inlet, Mathews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists were critical of the new report. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Nelson, president of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, which has long lobbied for 
wetlands restoration, said he applauded the new plans' lower densities but 
would be skeptical of any proposal that didn't include a tidal inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we've studied this," he said, "the more convinced we've become that 
the tidal inlet provides the absolute best biodiverse restoration of the 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel strongly that this is the type of restoration we should have at Bolsa 
Chica, and we hope there will be a chance for everybody to look at this again." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon LaBedz, a spokesman for the North Orange County chapter of the 
Surfrider Foundation, said that while he welcomes any downsizing of the project 
his group opposes any development of the wetlands at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this says is that the good guys are winning," he said. "Koll is 
continuously having to back down. The Surfrider Foundation will fight for every 
acre." 
</P>
<P>
 And Connie Boardman, president of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, expressed dismay 
that any development is proposed for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 2,000 homes or 3,000 homes, it's not going to make any difference than 
with 4,000 homes," she said. "It's still going to be detrimental to the 
ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction could begin in mid-1996, with completion in 12 to 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A 45-day comment period on the new environmental impact report will begin Aug. 
23, Mathews said, after which the Board of Supervisors will consider the 
project. And during this round of discussions, the county official said, he 
plans to hold at least one public hearing in Huntington Beach, an omission for 
which he was roundly criticized last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That news, at least, brought a smile to Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton 
Patterson, who has been critical of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city wants to be as actively involved as it can be," she said of the 
upcoming discussions the new report is sure to kick off. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said he would formally request that the 
comment period on the new document be extended from 45 to 90 days. And the 
Huntington Beach City Council Monday night, in an emergency action, unanimously 
voted to request the same. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mathews said he hoped that the county's action would help break the logjam 
that seems to have dogged the project for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time," he said. "This is a reality check for everybody; I want to get on 
to other projects."

O.C. LAWYER CREATES OWN ORDER IN COURT; PROFILE: JACK EARLEY'S METHODS ARE 
DIFFERENT, BUT COLLEAGUES SAY HE KNOWS WHAT MATTERS -- AND WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the middle of a hushed courtroom, Irvine attorney Jack Earley held up a 
picture of what appeared to be the All-American family: A beaming father and 
mother with their two young daughters and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 With the jury looking on attentively, Earley suddenly raised the framed 
photograph above his head and slammed it on the lectern, shattering the glass 
and drawing gasps and looks of horror from spectators and even the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the family that Dan Broderick destroyed," Earley exclaimed, failing 
to mention that medical malpractice lawyer Daniel T. Broderick III was the dead 
victim, while Betty, his ex-wife, was the one on trial for first-degree murder 
in a case that made Court TV a staple of the nation's cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
 All in a day's work for Earley, 46, who is one of the top criminal defense 
attorneys in Orange County, his home for 16 years. He also has a long-running 
track record in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego, where onetime La Jolla 
socialite Betty Broderick was tried twice for fatally shooting her former 
husband and his new wife as they lay in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's clients have included not only Broderick -- convicted of 
second-degree murder in a retrial after a hung jury the first time -- but also 
civil plaintiff Kim Springer, the Dana Point postal worker who police say was 
stalked by accused killer Mark Richard Hilbun; Janet Greene, a former Teacher 
of the Year in Fullerton accused of murdering her lesbian lover; and Linda 
Ricchio, San Diego's "fatal attraction" killer who slew her ex-boyfriend but 
eluded the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In 48 homicide cases in a career spanning two decades, most of Earley's 
clients have been women, which is how he prefers it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone gave me a test and didn't know my gender beforehand, it would 
probably come up 'feminist,' " said Earley, who lives in Laguna Beach with his 
wife, Gail, a Native American with a Cherokee bloodline, and sons Bryan, 10, 
and Kyle, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, colleagues say Earley works well with women, whether they 
are paying him to represent them or listening from the jury box. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an extraordinarily fine-tuned sense for what matters in a case," said 
Elisabeth Semel, past president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, 
the state's criminal defense bar. "He always sees what's important, what the 
jury's going to care about. He's not the most cerebral, intellectual kind of 
lawyer, but has a way of speaking that helps jurors really understand. He's 
also very persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's friends and even his adversaries marvel at his unorthodox style, 
which comes across as a curious mix of Mr. Magoo and Peter Falk's Columbo. 
However unconventional, it seems to work, especially with juries, who appear to 
share an Everyman's rapport with Earley, who grew up a transient. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved with his Jewish mother and Irish Catholic father from Virginia, where 
he was born, to Connecticut to Arizona, then back to Connecticut and back to 
Arizona, where he attended three high schools before graduating in California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, he dreamed of being a writer, never a lawyer. The fetish common to 
both crafts: He was always drawn to eccentrics. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Cal State Long Beach, Earley obtained a degree from Loyola Law 
School more out of need for something to do for three years, he said, than to 
pursue a lifetime of arguing cases in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "At job interviews back then, everyone was wearing white shirts, skinny ties 
and black shoes, while I had long hair and wasn't about to do that ," said 
Earley, who today favors conservatively tailored suits, loafers, button-down 
collars and print ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Semel said that Earley, while defending numerous clients who could have 
received the death penalty, has managed to keep them all off Death Row, 
including the first person tried for capital murder after California reopened 
the door to the gas chamber in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before then that Earley's career got its start. While he was 
visiting friends in Riverside, a drunk driver careened into his car, rolling it 
over three times and putting him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid up with no idea of what the future held in store -- he had a law degree 
but only a vague idea of the path he wanted to follow -- he took a friend's 
suggestion that he work with the public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has been a full-time lawyer without interruption, one whose 
cases are nothing if not compelling: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Broderick trials brought about three books and two made-for-television 
movies, in addition to gavel-to-gavel coverage on Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a trial scheduled for Sept. 20 in West Covina, Earley is representing 
Janet Greene, 51, who Glendora police say killed her former lover, Loretta 
(Ret) Coller, 62, and wounded the woman Greene considered her rival in a love 
triangle, Martha Pereida, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Coller and Greene once taught together at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton, where Greene was Teacher of the Year in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * In "Until the Twelfth of Never," her book about the Broderick case, author 
Bella Stumbo describes Earley's other clients as ranging from "a frightened old 
lady who shot wildly into the darkness of her home, killing a teen-age burglar, 
to some of the most depraved examples of humanity imaginable, such as the 
rejected boyfriend who threw acid on his former girlfriend before dismembering 
her; another spurned lover who took murderous revenge not on the girlfriend but 
on her 7-year-old son instead, beating him to death; and the daughter who hired 
a couple of teen-agers to kill her aging father for his insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 The common thread running through the repertoire, Earley said, is his attempt 
to win empathy from a jury by crafting a story, much in the way a novelist 
would. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, doing a trial is very A-B-C-D-E," he said. "Jurors don't 
know what's important or what they should consider. So it's more like painting 
a picture or writing a book. A book should leave you with an impression. A 
picture should. A trial should." 
</P>
<P>
 Earley said he shattered the glass in the picture frame at the start of the 
Broderick trial to make a lasting impression, one that would haunt jurors for 
weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to let them know there's going to be major issues they have to deal 
with. Unless they let go of the reserve, they're not going to connect to it," 
he said. "It's like the gun at the start of a race. It lets them know they're 
not going to get off easy. . . . They can't just daydream through a trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, prosecutors would often have them do that, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For D.A.s to be successful, they want jurors to be unemotional and detached 
and very matter of fact. But my view is more humanistic. Life is not robotic, 
and people are not predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors (are) dragged kicking and screaming into courtrooms, so why would they 
want to go through an emotional, gut-wrenching decision if they can avoid it 
with a dry, matter-of-fact experience?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earley said some of his clients have been legally insane and others plainly 
guilty -- sad, sick creatures unable to function in a world without bars. But 
most, he said, are mere victims of life itself, otherwise well-meaning souls 
whose despair and desperation led them to commit the unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees many, if not most, criminal defendants as good people often led astray 
by a simple twist of fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's colleagues say his talent for making a juror understand such factors 
is complemented by a Columbo-like quality of appearing confused, mixed with a 
dry sense of humor that even some of his closest friends say borders on the 
macabre. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Kerry Wells, Earley's adversary in the Broderick trials, with whom 
he often clashed in open court, suggested to jurors in closing arguments that 
Earley's seeming incoherence was calculated to blur the horrors of his client's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say it's no act. John Cotsirilos, a fellow criminal defense attorney 
who calls Earley his best friend, said one of Earley's most riveting closing 
arguments once came in a moment of panic -- after he left his notes at home, in 
the drawer by his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsirilos also remembers a time when Earley's humor accomplished something no 
other lawyer could -- persuading a guilty defendant who foolishly insisted on 
going to trial to accept a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried for three weeks to get this guy to take the deal," Cotsirilos said. 
"Our supervisor (in the Riverside County public defender's office) said, 'Give 
it to Jack. He'll have him take it in 10 minutes.' So Jack walks to the jury 
box, and suddenly the (defendant) starts talking to these other inmates 
standing near him in the jury box. And they burst out laughing! 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack walked back and said, 'He's taking the deal.' I said, 'How'd you do 
that?' He said, 'I had him tell his defense to the other inmates, and you saw 
what happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even Earley's adversaries say his wry humor and unflappable nature work as 
assets in a profession where both are increasingly rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Burakoff, the deputy district attorney in San Diego who helped Wells 
prosecute Broderick, characterizes Earley as having an "endearing 
disheveledness." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only guy I know who could have hung in there with Betty (Broderick), 
but Jack would have never characterized it that way," Semel said. "She was out 
of control. She did things that drove him nuts, but he had the ability to deal 
with it and keep going, and he can do that with men too." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsirilos said Earley's biggest achievement in the Broderick trial was 
averting a first-degree murder conviction. Broderick stole into her 
ex-husband's mansion in the pre-dawn darkness of Nov. 5, 1989, and killed him 
and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick -- the younger woman he had left her 
for -- with five shots from a .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't have drawn a clearer map of premeditation," Cotsirilos said. "It 
made Menendez look like a simple case." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of two women -- Broderick and schoolteacher Greene -- he blames 
California divorce laws for driving them to violence. In Broderick's case, he 
said, it was a husband who knew how to manipulate the legal system in a way 
that left her powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 He blames Greene's predicament on a discriminatory system that leaves gay men 
and women with few options other than physical confrontation when it comes to 
settling disputes that should be reserved for courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene's former lover kicked her out, he said, but not before siphoning off 
her financial assets, which Greene -- only because she is gay -- had little 
chance of reclaiming under existing law, which only applies to conventional 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it's crazy when a society has a system where it says, 'You must settle 
your disputes in court,' then takes a large segment of the population -- 
homosexuals -- and says, 'Yes, but we're going to deny you access to settle 
your disputes.' All you're doing is saying, 'You've got two choices: You can 
leave and go screw yourself, or you can go back and take it by force.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Earley is often asked how he can represent anyone, male or female, who has 
ended another person's life by violence -- for whatever the reason. But, often, 
he said, the whys are both compelling and understandable, as is a client's need 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were a country looking at annihilation and permanent enslavement, 
wouldn't you put every resource into fighting that off?" he asked. "That's what 
a (murder) conviction means -- total enslavement for the rest of your life. 
It's a war for your life." Profile: Jack Earley

607 RECORDS ILLEGALLY ALTERED AT BREA OLINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An independent auditor told the Brea Olinda Unified School Board on Monday 
that she had found 607 instances of illegal transcript tampering, including 136 
failing grades that were not counted in grade-point averages, and more than 30 
transcripts that still contain credits or grades never earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachael Alcorn, who was hired to audit Brea Olinda High School's student 
transcripts because of a massive grade-changing scandal revealed this spring, 
reported Monday night that while some failing grades were computed into 
students' grade-point averages, 136 were not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some students were really penalized" and others weren't, trustee Lynn Doucher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 155 traditional grades were changed to simple pass notations last 
fall, Alcorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top administrators have insisted for months that all errors were corrected as 
soon as they were discovered. But Alcorn told the board Monday that transcripts 
of 10 members of the class of 1994, 18 members of the class of 1995 and four 
students in the class of 1996 still contain grades and course titles changed 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a registrar at the high school began changing those 32 
transcripts on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn, who is the registrar at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, said she 
did not find any instance where eligibility to play on athletic teams was 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that the district continue investigating student transcripts as 
far back as the 1988-89 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they would consider it, but Doucher said she was concerned 
that students could suffer from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students did nothing wrong here," she said. "There should be no shadow cast 
on any student." 
</P>
<P>
 Another investigator, attorney Ronald D. Wenkart of the Orange County 
Department of Education, is interviewing current and former district employees 
to find out who changed the grades and why. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the board he has interviewed eight former and current employees and 
will interview 17 more before he issues a report to the board by Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials previously blamed former counselors for altering student 
transcripts by changing grades and course titles hundreds of times in an effort 
to boost grade-point averages and help students get into college. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn confirmed that 287 of last year's students were affected by transcript 
tampering. They included 168 seniors, 77 juniors, 40 sophomores and two 
first-year students. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board unanimously voted Monday night for a new policy that will 
prohibit the use of pass notations in any classes except photography, 
performing arts, journalism, yearbook, English as a Second Language, student 
government and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy also will prohibit students from dropping courses after the fourth 
week of class without a "WF" notation, meaning withdraw-fail, entered in their 
transcripts.

STRIKE INTRUDES ON FANTASY BASEBALL FOLLOWERS' REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Rose lives in a world in which he can trade speedy second baseman Chuck 
Knoblauch for veteran pitcher Roger Clemens. He can send faxes to his fellow 
owners dictating the terms of free agency. He can bench Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Rose was powerless. His world -- the fantasy world of 
rotisserie baseball -- was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 As Major League Baseball's strike moved into its fourth day, Rose and millions 
of other "roto-geeks" faced another bleak morning with no box scores -- and 
thus no new statistics to drive their simulated baseball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotisserie "owners" create teams by drafting players from big league rosters. 
Some hard-core rotisserie teams actually bid for the various players using real 
money, just like real owners. Of course, in rotisserie there are salary caps. 
It is, after all, fantasy baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each league may have slight differences, the object is to pick 
players who can rack up the best statistics, whether in home runs or 
strikeouts. Whatever team achieves the best statistical performance wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently compared to a narcotic, rotisserie has claimed between 2 and 4 
million followers since its popularity swelled in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 That means a lot of people are now going through serious withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a lot of agony. I just can't get any more stimulus from the morning 
paper," said Kevin Klein of Encino, whose team is mere points out of first. 
</P>
<P>
 The work stoppage is depriving rotisserie owners of their reason for living. 
Many, such as Rose, a Burbank finance manager, say they haven't even spoken to 
fellow owners since the strike and fear losing touch. Others are trying to keep 
the flame alive, but it's tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Little had dinner at a fellow fantasy owner's home this weekend. "We 
ended up talking about his sister-in-law's wedding," said the Fresno engineer. 
"That's how bad it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners report disturbing trends in their lives. "I've become more 
productive," Rose realized Monday, his first day in the office after the 
strike. "It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotisserie owners usually spend their spare time religiously watching baseball 
shows on the cable sports network ESPN, or talking trades with one another on 
the phone. Now "the ritual is definitely gone," Rose said. "The ritual is box 
scores in the morning, 'SportsCenter' (an ESPN show) at 11, and now there's no 
point to either." 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of rotisserie deprivation could be wide-ranging, considering that 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake is a rotisserie buff. When asked how the 
end of rotisserie would affect Lake and other White House fantasy owners, a 
press officer would say only: "I'm sorry, we can't speculate on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Named after the New York City restaurant where it was cooked up by some 
friends -- referred to as "The Founders" -- rotisserie has spawned a cottage 
industry of publications offering advice on how much to spend on players both 
famous and obscure. What's more, there are stat services that crunch the 
numbers and tell owners where their teams stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Those businesses will also suffer from the work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were going to lose money this year," said Mark Ferguson, co-owner 
of the Midwest Stat Bureau in Dayton, Ohio, which, like many other services, 
plans to offer a partial refund to subscribers if the strike drags on. "We were 
hoping it wouldn't be this bad. We'll be OK as long as they play baseball next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the strike lingers into next season, Ferguson fears that he and his 
partner "will have to go get real jobs again." 
</P>
<P>
 Other, larger statistics corporations are forging onward, strike or no strike. 
Stats Incorporated, in conjunction with the makers of a baseball video game, is 
running a simulated season, playing out the remainder of the major league 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Schaufelberger, Stats Inc. director of marketing, said the simulated 
season may offer some solace to the strike-afflicted masses of roto-junkies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of fantasy fantasy," Schaufelberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not good enough for Steve Rose, even though he's sure that his team 
would move to the top in a simulated season. "In real life," he said, "anything 
can happen," which is the charm of rotisserie. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Stavisky, a doctoral student at the University of Maryland, has been 
studying the sociology of rotisserie baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical rotisserie players, he said, are males in their 20s or 30s. "It's 
definitely a guy thing," Stavisky said, adding that rotisserie leagues provide 
an illusion of control over reality in a depersonalized, "McDonaldized" world. 
</P>
<P>
 He speculated that those players will now be forced to explore other facets of 
their lives. "Maybe they'll spend more time with their families," he said. 
"Maybe they'll find something new on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hunt, who writes a fantasy baseball column for USA Today's supplement 
Baseball Weekly, isn't worried about the societal impact of millions of 
rotisserie-less owners. "Roto-geeks are human too," he said. "We can adapt." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, not all rotisserie owners are grieving. Some accept their fate. Mike 
Comins, a New York City advertising executive, is stuck in second place, just a 
few wins short of the $1,000 pot. He'll just have to cope if there's no more 
baseball this year and he remains an also-ran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have never traded Pedro Martinez," he said glumly of the Montreal 
Expos pitcher. "I deserve second." 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Troxel, 22, a door host at Legends sports bar in Costa Mesa, wishes that 
if the strike had to come, it would have happened just a tad earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fourth place the first month and a half," he said, explaining that in 
his league, only the top five teams win cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm in eighth place out of 18 teams." The strike, he said, "probably 
means that's where I'm going to stand" -- out his 50 bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of another sports bar, Lookers in Westminster, said baseball 
rotisserie is passe. His customers have moved on -- to football rotisserie. 
</P>
<P>
 The "attitude of my customers is, 'Who cares, football's here anyway,' " David 
Connelly said. "I don't know of anybody doing rotisserie baseball this year. I 
think the bloom's gone off of that. With my customers it has." 
</P>
<P>
 The "problem is you really have to stay on top of it," he said. "Rotisserie 
football is easier because you only have to look at the paper once a week." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some confirmed rotisserie baseball players just seemed to be glad for 
a respite from what had become a very dismal season.

3 KILLED IN METROLINK'S WORST ACCIDENT 
</P>

<P>
 In the worst fatal accident in Metrolink's two years of service, a little 
girl, her mother and her grandfather were killed in Glendale on Monday as they 
apparently sought a shortcut to visit the girl's ailing grandmother, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred shortly after 10 a.m., underneath a car and pedestrian 
bridge at 900 Western Ave., just east of the Golden State Freeway. The victims 
-- Antonio Juan Pina, 79, his daughter Miylem Blanca Villanueva, 37, and 
7-year-old granddaughter Francis Villanueva of Glendale -- were thrown 100 feet 
through the air by the 60-m.p.h. train, and died instantly, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible," said Glendale Police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths brought to nine the fatalities caused by Metrolink trains so far 
this year, and 21 since the service started in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses and others interviewed by police, the victims were 
walking to a nearby convalescent hospital and crossed the tracks to save time, 
rather than going up and over the Western Avenue bridge. It was not known if 
they saw the train coming at them, even though the engineer was urgently 
sounding his horn, according to Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of the youngest victim sprinted to the scene from his job nearby 
after learning from co-workers that three people had been killed on the tracks. 
Once there, he was faced with the task of identifying the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew that his family members were going to visit grandma around that time 
of day and came to the scene to get further information," Keuroghelian said, 
adding that police would not release the man's name. "He was shocked. In 
disbelief . . . he has lost most of his family." 
</P>
<P>
 The father has another daughter, who is about 10 years old, Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of the Villanueva family, Catalina Nuno, said they frequently 
crossed the tracks because that was the quickest route to the nearest bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone we know does it," said Nuno. "I'm just sad. They were real good." 
After the accident, which attracted onlookers from nearby commercial buildings, 
the 22 passengers were transferred to an Amtrak train that was also headed to 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police interviewed witnesses throughout the day Monday, and Metrolink 
authorities said they would be conducting their own inquiry to see if any 
safety measures were overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the fatal accident, the train had left the Burbank station on its 
trip south from Santa Clarita. When the engineer saw the victims, it was too 
late to stop or even slow down, Metrolink authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people came out of nowhere," Hidalgo said. "They were trying to beat 
our train and illegally cross the tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hidalgo, the engineer -- whom authorities also declined to 
identify -- was sounding his horn even before he saw the victims on the tracks 
as a warning to construction crews working in the area. At the first sight of 
the three, he hit his emergency brakes, but Hidalgo said it takes the 350-ton 
trains a quarter of a mile to come to a complete stop when they are moving that 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo defended the engineer, who he said was distraught over the deaths and 
would be offered psychological counseling, as are all engineers involved in 
fatal collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo also reiterated a Metrolink response to such incidents, many of which 
have occurred after people wandered onto sections of track that are off-limits 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were apparently trying to take a shortcut via our tracks, instead of 
going up and over the bridge," Hidalgo said. "In their attempt to take the 
shortcut, it resulted in this fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important to know here is that our tracks are private property. It is 
a restricted area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident did not occur at a crossing, and there were no warning signs 
posted. Although sections of the Metrolink tracks are fenced in to prevent 
pedestrians from trying to cross, the stretch where the deaths occurred was not 
fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said he based his description of the moments leading up to the fatal 
crash on statements taken by Glendale police from the engineer and at least one 
"credible witness" at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses said another train obstructed the family's view of the train 
that killed them, but Hidalgo disputed those accounts, saying the other train 
was headed north and had stopped several hundred feet from the site of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way that the pedestrians could not have seen or heard our train 
coming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of what the victims were doing when they were hit also differed. Some 
speculated that the family had been trying to race across the tracks. One said 
they might have been lying down when they were struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, said witness Edward Fayton, "must have been laying down 'cause I 
didn't see anything. (The train engineer) was laying on his horn and kept 
hitting his horn and hit 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo replied: "We cannot speculate. We do not know their motivation. There 
were rumors flying. We have not acknowledged those rumors. We are going by our 
engineer's testimony and credible witnesses, based on what the Glendale police 
told us."

PALMDALE LOSES BID TO DRAW PACKARD BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Packard Bell executive said Monday that the computer giant, now temporarily 
quartered in Westlake Village, has ruled out the possibility of relocating to 
Palmdale, in part because of the earthquake risk in the Antelope Valley city, 
and will leave Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure puts an end to Palmdale's yearlong courtship of Packard Bell. 
"It was kind of a huge shock to us," said an aide to state Assemblyman R. J. 
(Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale). Knight has been part of the team boosting 
Palmdale's bid with a $40-million incentive package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Packard Bell Vice Chairman Jeff Scheinrock told an Assembly panel that if 
the state passed legislation creating an enterprise zone in Sacramento, his 
firm would move to that city and end its consideration of relocating to Salt 
Lake City or Portland, Ore. Such enterprise zones offer tax breaks to companies 
that hire local residents and make major investments in equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, which had been hearing 
testimony on the creation of additional enterprise zones, subsequently voted 10 
to 0 to recommend the creation of such an area in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal-computer manufacturer announced in late 1993 that it had outgrown 
its six Chatsworth facilities and in January announced it was moving more than 
a quarter of its 1,500-member work force to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, damage caused by the Northridge earthquake forced the firm to 
shift its operations to Westlake Village and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, Palmdale, with help from Los Angeles County officials, 
put together an elaborate array of incentives worth tens of millions of dollars 
to lure Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 But in testimony Monday before the Utilities and Commerce Committee, 
Scheinrock disclosed publicly that Palmdale has been eliminated from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 A Packard Bell memo to Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) said Palmdale 
posed an "unacceptable earthquake risk for (a) sole U. S. manufacturing 
location." The memo also claimed Palmdale could not provide Packard Bell with 
the 400,000-square-foot interim facility it would need. The document identified 
a former U. S. Army depot in Sacramento as the site Packard Bell is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's disclosure hit Palmdale leaders hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "With good old Packard Bell, the dance is over," sighed Al McCord, Palmdale's 
director of economic development. "We lost, and that's part of the 
competitiveness in economic development. We're glad Packard Bell is staying in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 But McCord said the fact that Palmdale learned of Packard Bell's decision from 
the news media hurt. "I thought they'd show us more courtesy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the powerful incentives Palmdale was prepared to offer Packard Bell were 
a gift of 50 acres of land, valued at $7.5 million; $4 million in housing 
assistance to help its employees move to Palmdale; $10 million in tax-exempt 
bonds to help build its facilities, and low-cost financing to help its 
subcontractors construct plants in Palmdale. Even local businesses agreed to 
offer furniture and other discounts to Packard Bell employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it was Palmdale's proximity to seismologically active areas 
that was its downfall. That rationale was disturbing to McCord. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do us any good" to have the earthquake issue publicly aired, he 
said, "but it is overblown as a problem. In the January quake, we had no 
damage. Our earthquake insurance also is lower than it is in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight aide Matt Rexroad said the Packard Bell news, while disappointing, 
would not stop Palmdale's aggressive efforts to lure new business. "We're going 
to keep throwing our best pitches with what we've got," Rexroad said. "There 
are a lot of Fortune 500 companies that are in the Los Angeles region, despite 
earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rexroad said Knight will continue to press for state legislation to create an 
enterprise zone in Palmdale to improve the city's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Knight is pinning his hopes on a bill authored by state Sen. Henry 
J. Mello (D-Gilroy) to create two new enterprise zones in California, with 
Palmdale reportedly all but guaranteed to be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the news that Packard Bell was ready to go to Sacramento was 
greeted warmly by Gov. Pete Wilson's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep Packard Bell in California, and if Sacramento is the only 
place here under consideration, then we'll do everything in our power to 
support that," said Wilson press aide Paul Kranhold. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has been criticized by his Democratic gubernatorial challenger, 
Kathleen Brown, for his lack of response to California's economic decline in 
recent years.

BIEHL RELATIVES ATTEND CRUCIAL COURT SESSION; JUSTICE: ARGUMENTS ARE HEARD ON 
WHETHER MURDER DEFENDANTS' STATEMENTS TO POLICE CAN BE USED AS EVIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The mother and sister of slain American student Amy Biehl on Monday attended a 
crucial phase in the trial of three black youths charged with murdering her 
almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl, 26, a Fulbright scholar from Newport Beach, was beaten and stabbed to 
death by a mob of black youths in the Guguletu township last Aug. 25, days 
before she was to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven youths were arrested after police received tips from outraged residents 
of the black neighborhood where Biehl was attacked while driving black friends 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 While in South Africa, Linda Biehl and her eldest daughter Kim, 28, will also 
visit the community projects where Amy Biehl worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thought a lot about this month being the anniversary month of Amy's 
death and how to handle it in a positive way as a family," Linda Biehl said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biehls entered the courthouse quietly Monday. In February, the defendants' 
supporters hurled racist abuse at the family, yelling, "Kill Americans" and the 
anti-white slogan "One Settler, One Bullet," used by backers of the militant 
black Pan Africanist Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses have testified that Biehl's attackers shouted that slogan, which the 
PAC recently officially abandoned in favor of "One Child, One Education." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the prosecution and defense concluded arguments on whether 
statements the four defendants made to police could be used as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Justice Poswa called police witnesses "liars" and said it was 
"reasonably possible" that the defendants were assaulted and coerced into 
making the statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Several key witnesses have not testified because of alleged intimidation, and 
the prosecution could find it difficult to get a conviction if Judge Gerald 
Friedman does not agree that the defendants' statements were voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Three defendants were released on the first day of the Supreme Court hearing 
last November when a witness refused to testify against them. A friend who was 
in the car with Biehl when she was attacked testified against the defendants 
but then recanted after she was threatened. Two other young witnesses have 
failed to testify because of alleged intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 The three defendants, PAC members Mongezi Manquina, 21, Mzikhona Nofemela, 22, 
and Vusumzi Ntamo, 22, are free on bail. A 16-year-old youth will be tried 
separately.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The notions of academic freedom and the beauty of pure research are slippery 
ones, as those who study controversial topics can tell you. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't teach this in graduate school. Nor, apparently, do they teach you 
about having your work translated for the public by a headline-hungry, 
sound-bite-driven media whose mantra is "simplify, simplify, simplify," often 
to the point of absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
 These things, you learn the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Halpern, an award-winning professor of psychology at Cal State San 
Bernardino, discovered the perils of unpopular research in 1991, when she and 
Stanley Coren, of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, published a 
study suggesting that left-handed people don't live as long as right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 Massive amounts of media coverage followed. The fallout was intense. Some 
researchers pooh-poohed their results. Newspaper and magazine headlines gave 
apocalyptic impressions of the research. (Samples: "Have fun leftie, you're 
gone," "So long southpaw.") 
</P>
<P>
 Then came death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "My left hand will hold the knife," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey professor," went another, "we want to find out if a right-hander's house 
burns faster than a left-hander's house. And we want to use your house in our 
experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired (and singed) by the heated reaction to that research, Halpern 
organized a panel for the annual convention of the American Psychological 
Assn., which met here over the weekend. She called it, "Death Threats and Hate 
Mail -- the Perils and Politics of Researching Unpopular Topics," a title 
guaranteed to catch the eye of any columnist who has staked a position on 
abortion or immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Halpern and Coren, the panel included psychology professors Douglas 
Peters of the University of North Dakota, who studied the peer review process 
used by scientific journals, and J. Philippe Rushton of the University of 
Western Ontario, who studies race differences. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Peters and a colleague theorized that well-known names at prestigious 
institutions were more likely to get published, so they substituted made-up 
places such as Northern Plains Research Station for Harvard. They submitted 12 
previously published manuscripts to the scientific journals in which they had 
appeared. Nine of the 12 were not detected by the editors as having already 
been published, and eight of the nine were rejected, faulted for shortcomings 
such as poor designs or statistical flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the deception of subjects is a convention of behavioral science 
research, most of the duped editors were furious. One accused Peters of 
"sociopathic diddling with the peer review process." Another suggested that the 
study was "juvenalia, and should be consigned to your personal archives." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not prepared for the hostility and personal attacks that came our 
way," said Peters, who said he was nearly denied tenure over the study. He did 
note, however, that since his study, "blind reviews" -- in which author and 
institution are not made known to peer reviewers -- are not unheard of among 
the journals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Rushton, who is white, became the object of an intense public 
controversy, demonstrations and even a legal investigation in Canada after 
delivering a paper on his race studies at a professional meeting that was well 
attended by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot begin to explain the nature of the work after viewing one simple 
transparency about his findings -- in which he ranks "Orientals," "Whites" and 
"Blacks" (his words) across a spectrum of 60 variables such as IQ test scores, 
cultural achievements, cautiousness, impulsiveness, marital stability and size 
of genitalia. But it seems, at first glance, revolting, and you can surely 
imagine how any such work is likely to stir up passion. 
</P>
<P>
 A small but perfect irony: Two others had been invited to participate in the 
panel, Halpern said, but withdrew when they learned they were to share a stage 
with Rushton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the panelists had paid personally for their professional pursuits. 
They spoke of broken friendships, wasted time and terror felt by family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 For everyone but Rushton, though, the controversies have blown over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ontario attorney general declined to prosecute him for violating 
federal "anti-hate" laws (calling his work "loony, but not criminal"), a 
complaint lodged by 18 students with the Ontario Human Rights Commission is 
still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to defend the rights of researchers such as Halpern, Coren and 
Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the ones like Rushton who present us with our thorniest tests of 
academic freedom and the value of pure research. 
</P>
<P>
 My instinct, however, is that censorship should not be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who engage in unpopular research should not face the darkness of death 
threats and censorship, but the illuminating sunshine of vigorous public 
debate.

EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SWEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Zoo sweat: The gorilla cage at the L.A. Zoo smells just like a boys' locker 
room, says mammal curator Michael Dee. And when the apes are rattled by 
earthquakes, the odor gets worse. Overheated hippos have red perspiration, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cinema sweat: The most memorable movie sweat scenes, according to a 1990 
poll for Mitchum Antiperspirants, are in "Rocky," "Body Heat," "Fatal 
Attraction," "Sea of Love," "Broadcast News" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." The 
survey also found that Americans believe that George Bush sweats more than 
Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robot sweat: In 1989, the Army paid $3 million for a 6-foot, 187-pound 
mechanical man with simulated sweat glands, rubber skin and pores to test the 
effects of nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antiperspirants and Alzheimer's: Although controversial research suggests a 
link between aluminum ingestion and Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Richard L. Dobson, 
who edits the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, says the aluminum 
salts in antiperspirants are harmless: "Aluminum is the most abundant chemical 
in the earth's crust. The amount in (food alone) is absolutely staggering in 
comparison to the amount you could possibly absorb through antiperspirants. 
It's like the proverbial drop in the bucket. Even if Alzheimer's is linked to 
aluminum . . . it would be impossible to implicate antiperspirants." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sweat ingredients: Sweat is made up of water and minuscule traces of salt, 
urea, ammonia, sugars, proteins, potassium, iron and other chemicals. It's 
odorless until bacteria on the skin break it down and release awful smells.  
</P>
<P>
 * Foods and fevers: Spicy foods and alcohol can affect perspiration amounts 
and odor, says UC Irvine anatomy professor Roland Giolli. So can illnesses. "I 
can recall vividly when I had measles in 1935," says dermatologist Dobson, "and 
my mother called the general practitioner, and he came to the house, took one 
sniff and knew exactly what I had."  
</P>
<P>
 * Perspiration output: In general, men sweat twice as much as women. But 
perspiration rates may vary by tenfold in any given group of individuals. When 
overheated, humans can drip as much as two quarts an hour, up to three gallons 
a day. Someone who sweats excessively under normal conditions, usually in the 
palms and feet, has hyperhidrosis, which affects about 10% of the populace. 
Treatments include prescription antiperspirants, electrical shocks or 
endoscopic surgery to sever nerves leading to the guilty sweat glands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antiperspirants versus deodorants: Antiperspirants reduce sweating by 
plugging perspiration ducts; deodorants combat only the smell, attacking the 
skin bacteria that mix with sweat and cause odor. In the United States, where 
an estimated 95% of adults spray, roll and rub on $1.6 billion in underarm 
products a year, women use antiperspirants almost exclusively, whereas about 
half of men prefer deodorants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fake sweat: When Cecil B. DeMille filmed a silent version of "The Ten 
Commandments" in 40-degree weather but needed his loincloth-clad actors to look 
as if they were toiling in desert heat, 500 gallons of glycerin were rubbed 
onto their bodies to simulate glistening perspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weirdest antiperspirant: Eyedrops. A Kentucky woman whose sweat glands 
stopped working found out that the disorder was caused by anti-glaucoma 
eyedrops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Postpartum sweat: After giving birth, some women experience drenching sweats 
for several weeks, probably caused by estrogen depletion -- the same culprit in 
menopausal hot flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aerosol's demise: At its peak in the 1970s, with 80% of the market, aerosol 
deodorants were considered "the perfect product," says Ginny Dotzauer of 
Mennen. "One can could fit the whole family" and it didn't cause the stickiness 
or staining that some current products do. Since the fluorocarbon/ozone 
controversy, however, aerosol's share has sunk to about 20%. The accompanying 
rise of solids and sticks has revolutionized the market, opening the door to 
niche products for men, women, even teens, and creating an explosion of new 
fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cold sweat: This can occur in terrifying situations or ailments such as 
heart attacks, when sweating is stirred by adrenaline instead of the normal 
biochemical, acetylcholine. The perspiration isn't literally cooler, but 
constriction of the blood vessels gives skin a clammy feel. Also the name of a 
James Brown song. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sweatproof socks: Nautilus now sells socks made from Transpor, a fabric that 
claims to have odor-squelching, antibacterial properties. Coming soon: Transpor 
gym bags. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fatal sweat: In 1990, a Louisiana man building a back-yard swing set was 
electrocuted when sweat dripped into the electric drill he was using.

 Salty and stinky, sweat is one of the world's least-loved excretions. But it 
serves as an occasional collector's item, keeps the nation's $1.6-billion 
deodorant industry afloat and inspires such artistic milestones as a "Married . 
. . With Children" episode in which Al Bundy's overheated body produces a sweat 
stain that resembles Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is a sexual turn-on to dead French dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 The evil drip has baffled and bedeviled humans for eons, says sweat scientist 
Richard L. Dobson, whose four decades of perspiration inquiry include military 
research, odd medical cases and a study of gorilla underarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the riddles that he and others have looked into: why some people's sweat 
is blue, yellow or red -- and why riding a Tokyo subway at rush hour is far 
less odorous than, say, being aboard a crowded New York train. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaded perspiration, it turns out, is caused by chromidrosis, a rare 
condition in which iron or other colored materials get into sweat glands (and 
which could explain biblical reports that Jesus' sweat took on the appearance 
of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane). 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Tokyo subway phenomenon, Dobson blames a quirk of genetics. Most 
people, he says, have two types of sweat glands -- eccrine, which react to 
heat, and apocrine, which respond to stress or sexual arousal and are 
responsible for that decaying goat smell known to scholars by the scientific 
name, B.O. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Japanese, however, apocrine glands are few in number. "I have no 
idea what Darwinian forces led to that," Dobson says, "but it probably wouldn't 
be a good idea to start a deodorant company there." 
</P>
<P>
 In most other places, of course, it's another story.  
</P>
<P>
 In America, on any given day, residents shed enough perspiration to supply the 
city of Pittsburgh with 24 hours' worth of water (although nobody would want to 
drink the stuff). 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists are looking for ways to tame the nation's sweat glands. At the 
Gillette Odor Clinic in Boston, 100-degree human incubation chambers and 
trained underarm sniffers are used to test the effectiveness of new 
antiperspirants and deodorants.  
</P>
<P>
 When all goes well, wetness is slashed by 60% and stink is virtually 
eliminated, says Toiletries Technology Lab wizard Brian Rogers.  
</P>
<P>
 But not all armpits are created equal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might hear an occasional 'Whoa!' " Rogers says. "We try to let the odor 
judges take a few breaths in between, but if the product isn't effective or 
there's a lot of odor, they may need longer to clear their sinuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Most employees, however, grow immune to the stench. "They can do (the tests) 
and go eat a doughnut afterward," he says. And the job is definitely preferable 
to odor-judging mouthwash or diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also experiment with deodorant fragrances. Some companies try to 
imitate popular colognes and perfumes, but others cook up new scents in 
laboratories, then poll consumers on whether the formulas remind them of 
"youngness," "conservatism" or "classical music." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling images, not fragrances," Rogers explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty or 40 years ago, those images were limited to Regular, Scented and 
Unscented. The back-to-nature movement added Herbal and Lime. Today, products 
tilt toward such concepts as Sport, Surf Spray, Wild Rain and Caribbean Cool. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sweat has always had a PR problem. Adam -- the first recorded perspirer -- was 
booted from the Garden of Eden with the warning that toil and sweat would be 
his lot in life. Ancient Egyptians were so appalled by perspiration's odor that 
they slathered themselves with tree resins to cover it up. And sweat-related 
foot infections and heat disorders incapacitated thousands of soldiers during 
World War II, Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Richard Nixon supposedly lost his 1960 presidential bid partly because he 
dripped profusely during a televised debate with John F. Kennedy (rumor had it 
that Nixon applied antiperspirants to his face for subsequent appearances).  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, sweat does have its adherents. When it falls off celebrities or 
rock stars -- as in "authentic" vials of Elvis sweat and towels that mopped 
Beatle brows -- collectors will pay considerable sums for the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat lodges and saunas are said to purify both body and soul (although 
medical experts deride such theories). 
</P>
<P>
 And Napoleon regarded the smell of perspiration as an aphrodisiac. After the 
battle of Marengo, he reportedly sent word to Josephine: "Will be home in three 
days . . . don't wash." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like to sweat," says Henry Allen, writing in the Washington 
Post, "imagine what life would be like if you couldn't. Imagine those 
high-tension occasions when you dread sweating, and think of the alternatives 
-- giving a speech, say, and having to periodically pick up the pitcher of ice 
water and pour it over your head, like an elephant. Or doing a job interview 
while slavering like a Saint Bernard."  
</P>
<P>
 Or worse: Ostriches and emus cool off by urinating on their own legs and 
letting the liquid evaporate. Jack rabbits have to flush blood through their 
ears to lower body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Only horses, a few types of cows and some apes perspire for temperature 
control, say animal experts. Everything else pants. "You've heard the old adage 
about 'sweating like a pig'?" asks Steve Wickler, an animal and veterinary 
sciences professor at Cal Poly Pomona. "Well, pigs don't sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 Perspiration authority Dobson says gorillas have the same kind of eccrine 
sweat glands in their underarms that people do, except the ape glands don't 
work -- unless the animals are injected with a human neurotransmitter, 
acetylcholine, the secret sauce that causes people to perspire when blood 
temperature rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why gorillas will never play at Wimbledon.  
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to eccrine sweat . . . we can do things that animals can't," says 
Dobson, a professor of dermatology at the Medical University of South Carolina 
in Charleston and editor of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. 
"At Wimbledon, with court temperatures at 100 degrees, players (competed) for 5 
1/2 hours," he says. "No African animal can run for five hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the odoriferous apocrine sweat gland -- long considered the appendix of 
the human perspiration system -- might have some usefulness. Women with 
Fox-Fordyce disease, a rare condition that blocks apocrine sweat during 
romantic arousal, complain of extraordinary itching while having sex, Dobson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have pondered perspiration include generals, poets, astronauts and 
auto workers.  
</P>
<P>
 In World War II, Gen. George S. Patton Jr. wrote that "a pint of sweat will 
save a gallon of blood." Henry Wadsworth Longfellow rhapsodized that "one half 
of the world must sweat and groan that the other half may dream." 
</P>
<P>
 And, more recently, NASA engineers ruminated over how to deal with sweat in 
space. "Perspiration and sensitive electronic equipment don't mix," one space 
spokesman said. So tiny dehumidifiers were installed in space suits and 
capsules.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Toledo, Ohio, in 1991, Chrysler employees were asked to stop 
using antiperspirants because the ingredients damage paint jobs on Jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat has also been the subject of considerable scientific speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Galen, a 2nd-Century Greek physician whose chief contribution to medicine was 
the startling announcement that arteries carry blood, not air, was among the 
earliest sweat theorists. He believed that respiration occurred through the 
skin as "insensible perspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1600s, Italy's Santorio Santorio erected a monolithic scale -- on which 
he worked and slept for hours at a time -- to document how much weight he lost 
as this "insensible perspiration" evaporated from the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until a few decades later that Dutch physician Hermann Boerhaave 
became the first to describe sweat glands. And nobody counted them until the 
mid-19th Century, when a German corpse was put under microscope and anatomists 
found some 2,381,248 of the tiny coiled organs (later studies determined the 
number varies from 2 million to 4 million, covering every square inch of the 
body save the lips). 
</P>
<P>
 The next great strides in sweat science occurred in 1888 with Mum (the first 
trademarked deodorant), the early 1900s with Everdry and Odo-ro-no (the first 
antiperspirant and first nationally advertised deodorant, respectively) and 
during the Eisenhower era, with the invention of roll-ons and aerosols. 
</P>
<P>
 Air conditioning, pioneered in 1902, was also a big breakthrough in anti-sweat 
technology.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you cannot install air conditioning," writes Miami humor columnist Dave 
Barry, "I suggest you perspire. Perspiring is Mother Nature's own natural 
cooling system. When you're in a situation involving great warmth or stress, 
such as summer or an audience with the Queen, your sweat glands, located in 
your armpits, rouse themselves and start pumping out perspiration, which makes 
your garments smell like a dead rodent, which is Mother Nature's way of telling 
you she wants you to take them off and get naked. Of course the average person 
cannot always get naked, let alone when with the Queen, so many people put 
anti-perspirant chemicals on their armpits; this forces Mother Nature to 
reroute the perspiration to the mouth, where it forms bad breath, which is 
Mother Nature's way of telling you she is basically a vicious irresponsible 
slut."

friskings, pat downs and people going through his pockets looking for money, 
says Jay Leno: "He finally told his lawyers, 'Look, I don't have any more

HEALTH WATCH: IT'S TIME TO TURN THE BABY OVER

 Singing lullabies is safe. But tucking your baby in on its tummy could prove 
fatal. Federal and private agencies have launched a campaign for parents to 
place infants supine in the crib at bedtime to reduce incidents of sudden 
infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, American parents have placed their babies on their stomachs to 
sleep," writes Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development. "It is a goal of this campaign to reverse this 
practice and to have nearly all babies sleeping on their back or side." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 6,000 infants -- one out of every 1,000 newborns -- die of SIDS every 
year in the United States. SIDS has been reduced by 50% in countries where the 
practice of placing infants on their backs has been advocated since the 1980s. 
The new sleep position is recommended only for healthy babies. Those with 
excessive vomiting or breathing problems may be better off sleeping on their 
tummies, says John Kattwinkel of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Call (800) 
505-CRIB for free materials. The Doctor Is In -- in the Computer

 Ten Southern California health-care coalitions will share a $3.6-million grant 
in telecommunications services from Pacific Bell's California Research and 
Education Network trust to develop high-speed medical networks. Health 
facilities, via the information superhighway, will employ filmless X-rays, 
video-conference examinations, electronic diagnoses, and mechanized bed 
availability and patient records over a large geographic area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project will have a significant impact on the delivery of patient care 
for those people who don't have convenient access to an academic medical 
center," said Dr. Fred George, director of USC Advanced Biotechnical 
Consortium.

YOUR BODY: THE TRUTH IS NOT AS HAIRY AS YOU THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

 Every day, New York dermatologist Robert Auerbach hears the same question: 
</P>
<P>
 Is this normal? patients ask while pointing to a hair that has sprouted or a 
hair that has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time it is, Auerbach tells them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once patients know they are normal -- or as normal as the next hairy or 
unhairy person -- doctors say patients are more receptive to the facts of hair: 
</P>
<P>
 * Excess hair -- whether it's on a man's back or a woman's chest -- is usually 
not a health concern, only a cosmetic problem. Ditto for too little hair in 
places where it's valued, such as the head. 
</P>
<P>
 * In rare cases, excess hair is a medical problem. Known as hirsutism or 
hypertrichosis, the condition can spring from abnormalities in the ovaries or 
the adrenal or pituitary glands. If your doctor suspects this, Auerbach says, a 
work-up will be ordered. Treatment options include medication and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 99% of hair patterns are genetically driven, says Auerbach, who is 
also a professor of clinical dermatology at the New York University School of 
Medicine. If your mom has dark forearm hair, don't be surprised if your arms 
are a match. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hair follicles have built-in time clocks that govern when they will stop and 
start producing. Baldness is thought to occur when particular follicles turn 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forget about treatments to help your hair grow more quickly than normal. 
Hair is on its own timetable. "Hair may grow faster (on its own) in the 
summer," Auerbach says, "but the data is not hard and fast." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bad-perm victims, take note: Hair on the scalp grows for about three years 
before falling out. The hair follicle then rests for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biology is kinder to eyebrow-dying fans: Like most other body hair, eyebrows 
have a six-month life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women tend to get more facial hair with age. Common sites are the chin and 
the upper lip. Chin hairs can be especially bothersome if they grow inward and 
pimples develop around them, says Dr. Rhonda Rand, a Beverly Hills 
dermatologist and UCLA assistant clinical professor of medicine.  
</P>
<P>
 * To get rid of excess hair? "There's no harm in plucking, bleaching, shaving, 
waxing or (undergoing) electrolysis," Auerbach says. Shaving, contrary to folk 
wisdom, won't make hair grow in coarser. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although minoxidil (Rogaine) is viewed as an effective baldness treatment, 
there are other options, such as transplants and toupees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hair Angst is ancient. But thankfully the treatments have improved greatly 
since 420 BC, when Hippocrates fended off further balding by applying potions 
of opium, pigeon droppings and spices.

FIXATIONS: JUDGE ALSO DOES A LITTLE PUBLISHING; O.C. JURIST ADMITS HIS OUTPUT 
OF TINY BOOKS IS SMALL-TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Calling a contact number for Judge Leonard Goldstein, folks might think they 
have reached a 900 number by mistake. There is a female voice on the other end, 
one speaking in a whisper so that soft words aren't coming through, only a 
tickling sibilance on the hairs of the ear. Finally, the words "Department 25" 
register, along with the realization that the phone on the other end is in a 
courtroom , and court is in session. You find yourself whispering back, not 
wanting to disturb the decorum.  
</P>
<P>
 It must be a strange gig -- right up there with convent life -- to don the 
robe and have people always whispering around you, to be enclosed in an aura of 
deference, civility and order; to be seated above the fray and have book-lined 
chambers to which to repair; to be just . 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges are human," maintains Orange Superior Court Judge Goldstein, whose 
specialty is complex civil law. "You don't step through some magic mirror and 
become a judge. It's not euphoria. It's not celestial well-being. You don't 
hear horns and go up to heaven. Judges are not gods. Judges are just human 
beings with a very responsible job. They get tired. Sometimes they lose their 
temper. They do everything all people do in the usual circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Including having hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's hobby is decidedly more refined than, say, monster-truck racing, 
but it gets points for having such a high pun potential it is a true effort to 
not resort to any in this story. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge collects and publishes miniature books. He has amassed some 500 tiny 
editions; a modest collection, he says, contrasted with one woman he knows with 
more than 12,000. His publishing output is similarly small. With only six 
volumes issued in the past 13 years, it may be with no false modesty that he 
claims, "I'm probably one of the least-known publishers there is." 
</P>
<P>
 But, though they are easily palmed, his small books are far from toys. He says 
it can take at least nine months and as much as $10,000 to see one into 
production, and to look at them, you'd believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We talked last Thursday in Goldstein's indeed very book-lined chambers 
adjoining his courtroom on the seventh floor of the 700 building in the Civic 
Center. The walls and shelves were adorned with likenesses of Abraham Lincoln 
and the Founding Fathers, while a computer screen behind the judge flashed the 
message, "Welcome to CHAOS," which Goldstein explained is the apt acronym for 
the courts' intercommunications system. 
</P>
<P>
 At 63, Goldstein looks a bit like a more-civilized Allen Ginsberg. In his 18 
years on the bench -- 17 of those as a Superior Court judge -- he has gained a 
reputation for seeing his way through grindingly complex civil cases with a 
thoroughness and evenness that has earned praise even from litigants who come 
out on the losing side. 
</P>
<P>
 He was first attracted to miniature books in the early 1960s, when, looking 
for a gift for a friend in government service, he found a volume containing 
John F. Kennedy's inaugural address published by one Achille St. Onge, who had 
been making miniatures since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 "And because I was taken by the quality of the work, and because of the 
attraction of the miniature, which may have some unconscious appeal to one's 
youth, I wrote to Mr. St. Onge and asked if he had other titles in print, and 
he kindly sent me a catalogue, and I promptly started collecting," Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to correspond with the Massachusetts-based publisher for 20 
years, and after St. Onge died, Goldstein was moved to first publish his own 
books. Though his premiere 1981 volume, "Duke Ellington Remembered," was a 
tribute to the great composer and pianist penned by the jazz critic of the New 
Yorker, in style and materials (including the type style, gilt page-edges and 
crushed calf-skin cover with a rounded spine) it was a tribute to St. Onge. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the output of the Gold Stein publishing house has been limited thus far 
to six volumes, the titles are impossible to pigeonhole. Along with the book on 
Ellington, there are works on Halley's comet, the Statue of Liberty, early 
female race-car drivers and two poems by Ray Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How does he pick his titles? 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary consideration is that it lends itself to miniaturization, which 
means that it cannot be overly long. But it's surprising how much material and 
information you can get into a small book. The Duke Ellington book, when it 
originally ran in the New Yorker, ran for 2 1/2 pages, about 3,000 words, and 
that's about right. I don't print anything you can't read without magnifying 
glasses." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein does own a copy of what is regarded as the world's smallest book, 
but he got it only because he knows its author and publisher, Scottish writer 
Ian MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 "His is a quarter of an inch square, and it's almost impossible to read. I 
like to be able to read books. I think a book ceases to be a book when it 
doesn't lend itself to being read," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than size, Goldstein said, the main determinant in what he publishes is 
"vanity. If it appeals to me , I think in terms of publishing it. And I guess 
my taste is eclectic." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his preference in reading runs more to histories than novels, he is a 
fan of Ray Bradbury's and wrote to him to see if he had any original poems he 
would be willing to let Goldstein publish. 
</P>
<P>
 "He responded almost immediately and sent a couple of his poems. He's a 
wonderful chap. I'd love to get a poem from Ray Bradbury every second or third 
year, because he's such a marvelous guy to work with and his material is so 
well received and it's so much fun putting together an appropriate medium to 
convey his good work in," Goldstein said.  
</P>
<P>
 For that first volume, he and Bradbury settled on doing the spiritual poem 
"Long After Ecclesiastes." Goldstein's concern for conveying it in an 
"appropriate medium" is evident: The book comes in a marbled sleeve; the cover 
has a cutout shaped like a Roman arch, revealing a silvered panel with a 
portion of Ecclesiastes rendered in Hebrew text; inside, Bradbury's poem is 
accompanied by intaglio, embossed and serigraph designs by artist and book 
designer Joseph D'Ambrosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited to a print run of 75 copies, the book originally sold for $100 and now 
commands $450 in dealers' catalogues. (All of Goldstein's editions are limited; 
his largest run of any book was 650 copies.) 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein assisted in the design of that book and has done all the design work 
on others, which he says is his greatest pleasure in doing the books.  
</P>

<P>
 While the small books he makes and collects may seem a novelty today, he says 
they have a history as long as their larger brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 "These books are a natural follow-on from pre-printing tomes which were 
carried by very wealthy and powerful people in the early 15th Century. It was 
very difficult and costly to produce books, so they tended to be small, the 
stepchildren of missals. When printing came into its own it was also a very 
costly trade. So many books were small because they were economically produced 
and they were more portable.  
</P>
<P>
 "It became fashionable then for rich and powerful people to have libraries in 
miniature so they could take them with them in their carriages when they moved 
about from one residence to another. It was really a sport of royalty. Of 
course when you go back that far, literacy was probably limited to fewer than 
15% of the population." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks that, five centuries on, we may have become a post-literate society, 
and he has grave concerns about that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be moving now toward entertainment as the most sought-after 
quantity in our society. We pay people who entertain us much too much money. We 
mimic them. We use the toothpaste they use. We vote for the people they vote 
for. We either cut down trees or make protective rings around them depending on 
who our favorite entertainer is and what they're doing.  
</P>
<P>
 "And that's an abandonment of individual thinking, and a dilution, maybe even 
an eradication, of the philosophical, political and ethical principals that are 
at least some of the threads that go to make up the fabric of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to be fond of the Founding Fathers. I find wisdom there that is 
pertinent today. But we no longer seem to teach civics. I'm not sure what we're 
teaching at all, because you find a lot of young people who never heard of 
these things." * 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said much of his sense of justice was derived from reading.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the wisdom writings -- the Bible, Old and New Testament and the 
wisdom writings of a number of cultures -- have helped me formulate my sense of 
justice. I think you should accept wisdom from whatever source it comes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laotzu, the Chinese philosopher, said something that has stuck with me for a 
very long time. He said you can know the world without leaving your home if you 
have books. That's a very significant saying, and true also." 
</P>
<P>
 When growing up, most kids are more likely to fantasize about leading the sort 
of action-packed lives that wind them up on charges before a judge than they 
ever dream of being a judge. Goldstein was different. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young I wanted to become involved in government -- though not 
necessarily the judiciary -- because government seemed to be such an honorable, 
decent pursuit and so much good seemed to flow from it. I'd like to think, too, 
that was not a bad evaluation at the time, though I'm not sure it's true today. 
It has become professional and politicians seem to want to confuse the source 
of power with the seat of power." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't view the pleasure he takes in his tiny books as an escape from his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look for things to take my mind off my work because I enjoy my work 
too much," he said, adding that the months of endless particulars and 
repetition that can accompany a complex civil case never become tedious to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never feel that, because I know that however mundane a problem may seem, to 
the people pursuing it it's the most important thing in the world. . . . The 
more complex the issue the better I like it, though I treat less complex issues 
with the same care. In a sense it's like being a doctor. If you're going to 
take a scalpel to somebody, it doesn't really make any difference whether 
you're doing a heart transplant or taking out an ingrown toenail: You can still 
cut and hurt. So you have to be equally careful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most satisfying thing about being a judge, he said, is when he's able to 
feel he's done his job well. And the downside? "The worst aspect is that it's 
hard to put your kids through college on what you get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 His publishing hobby doesn't help much in that regard either. Though he 
accounts himself a success in small-book publishing, that is clearly a matter 
of definition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't make a living off this. Success is breaking even. I haven't lost 
any money. I've enjoyed it immensely, and I'm really fond of the books. And the 
few that I have copies left of, I find make marvelous gifts, especially for 
little people, 10- and 11-year-olds who are just getting into literature. You 
give them a little book and they don't feel so intimidated by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Say, these little books would be just the thing to sneak into a courtroom, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask people not to read in the courtroom out of respect for the proceedings, 
and if you don't have the restriction, they sometimes do things that are really 
distracting like folding newspaper pages," Goldstein said. "But I suppose you 
could get away with reading a miniature because they are quiet and hard to see 
and not offensive."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; SUMMER CLASSIC LEAVES PAST CONTESTS IN THE DUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A picturesque park setting, a gourmet sit-down luncheon and women in hats and 
flowing dresses all combined to make the Summer Classic V equestrian event at 
the Huntington Central Park Equestrian Center an elegant affair for the horsey 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellout crowds of 600 guests each day attended the luncheons Saturday and 
Sunday as part of the five-day equestrian competition to benefit the Huntington 
Beach Art Center. The competition, staged by the art center foundation and GTE 
Directories Corp. in cooperation with the city of Huntington Beach and the 
equestrian center, was expected to net about $75,000 for the art center, which 
is scheduled for completion in December. Guests paid $125 or $75 for front or 
second row seats to attend the luncheons. Grass Is Greener 
</P>
<P>
 In past years the luncheons were held at the equestrian center, leaving guests 
to trample through dirt to get to the tent. This year's event was held "on the 
green," just north of the center in the adjacent central park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a sign of dirt," said Diana Casey, event co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers set up huge white tents on the grass and even borrowed the same 
wood fencing used at the Oaks, Joan Irvine Smith's ranch in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to make it look like an equestrian event should -- very elegant, 
very appealing to the eye," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tables decorated with green linens and yellow marigolds lined the course. For 
the first time in the event's history guests were served a sit-down meal that 
included fresh fruit, a salad of wild field greens with candied pecans, beef 
tenderloin and jumbo shrimp, cold marinated asparagus and old-fashioned ice 
cream sundaes. Horsing Around 
</P>
<P>
 During the meal, guests watched riders coax their horses over the imposing 
obstacles in the riding arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's saying it's one of the better courses. The horses love it," said 
Mary Harris, event co-chairwoman and owner of the equestrian center who on 
Saturday was named champion of the adult amateur jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to the capital campaign for the community art center, an 
11,000-square-foot building in downtown Huntington Beach formerly occupied by 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past people in this town have gone elsewhere for their cultural 
opportunities," said Michael Mudd, event co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will include three galleries, a bookstore, a studio and a 
multipurpose room for films, lectures and performance art. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hot," says Naida Osline, center director. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the luncheons were: Dan Jankowiak, event co-chairman; 
Gerald Chapman, chairman of committees; Enrique Loaeza, consul general of 
Mexico; Gayle Anderson, Orange County chief of protocol; Mario and Diane 
Antoci; Lloyd Baron; Jerry Dominguez; Bob Goodrich; Bill and Harriet Harris; 
William and Lorraine McCune; Eunice Nicholson; Pam Patterson; Kay Waldhauser, 
and Alice Zamboni. KATHRYN BOLD

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM'S LOSS WIDENS IN SECOND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp., an Agoura Hills energy concern, reported wider losses 
for its second quarter and first half that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the loss mostly to onetime charges totaling $540,000 in 
the second quarter.One charge of $225,000 was recorded to pay for a severance 
package for former president Dan Pasquini, who resigned in June. The remaining 
$315,000 was for costs related to an exploratory project. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune's loss in the second quarter was $529,000, in contrast with a 
year-earlier loss of $49,000. Its revenue more than doubled, to $931,000 from 
$420,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, Fortune lost $664,000, despite an 81% jump in revenue to 
$1.74 million. A year before, it lost $119,000 on $965,000 in revenue.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PAC RIM HOLDING POSTS $108,000 2ND-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pac Rim Holding Corp., a Woodland Hills workers' compensation insurer, 
reported a net loss of $108,000 for the second quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, the company earned $902,000. Its revenue in the recent quarter 
fell 8%, to $23.8 million from $25.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The decrease in revenue in the second quarter of 1994 was due to reduced 
premium volume because of capital constraints, and premium rate reductions 
based on various regulatory actions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended June 30, Pac Rim lost $1.19 million, in contrast with 
a profit a year before of $960,000. Its first-half revenue declined 3%, to 
$47.4 million from $49.1 million.

LAWYER MAKES IT HIS BUSINESS TO FIGHT HMOS; ATTORNEYS: MARK HIEPLER, WHO FOUGHT 
HEALTH NET FOR HIS LATE SISTER AND WON $89-MILLION VERDICT, HAS HIS OWN FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last December, Mark Hiepler got the kind of free publicity most lawyers could 
never hope to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a David vs. Goliath legal battle that caught national media attention, 
Hiepler won an $89-million verdict from a Riverside County jury against Health 
Net, the Woodland Hills-based health maintenance organization that is the 
second-largest HMO in the state. Hiepler argued that Health Net wrongfully 
denied a bone marrow transplant to his sister, Nelene Fox, a breast cancer 
victim who died at age 40 in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net filed a motion for a new trial before reaching a settlement in 
April with the Fox family for an unstated, but presumably hefty, sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hiepler, taking advantage of his sudden celebrity and his share of the 
Health Net settlement, has set up his own law firm to do battle full time with 
health insurance companies that refuse to pay for certain medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is kind of a tribute to my sister," Hiepler said of his new firm. "And 
we have a good running start thanks to the Health Net case." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler & Hiepler -- a partnership between Mark and his wife, Michelle -- 
opened last month in a cramped office on the 15th floor of an Oxnard high-rise. 
The walls of the new office were still bare last week, and the doors had not 
been hung, but Hiepler said the firm's docket had already swelled to 240 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are 160 involving patients denied procedures ranging from kidney 
transplants to tonsillectomies, as well as two new cases against Health Net. 
The heavy caseload is not surprising given the surge in patients signing up 
with HMOs, and the inevitable disputes that arise when patients think their 
medical needs conflict with the interests of a large medical bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of Heipler's new law firm has drawn some sniping from the enemy 
camp. "He's not the first one out there, won't be the last one out there, and 
he's not the best one out there," said Lyle Swallow, vice president of legal 
services with Health Net. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Southam, chief executive of CareAmerica Health Plans, an HMO in 
Woodland Hills, said Hiepler "is just another attorney who happened to be 
involved in a case that got a lot of publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Hiepler, 32, is committed to a crusade he started last year when 
he took on the case of his sister. Health Net denied Fox a $150,000 bone marrow 
transplant, saying the procedure was experimental and unproven. On her own, Fox 
obtained a transplant, but she died eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler continued the legal fight with Health Net after his sister's death, 
and the enormity of the initial award -- $12 million in compensatory damages 
and $77 million in punitive damages -- garnered him national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler was invited last January to the White House, where he says he had a 
brief discussion with President Clinton about health care issues. He was among 
10 finalists for the 1994 Trial Lawyer of the Year Award, presented annually by 
the Washington, D.C.-based Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. Currently, he and 
his sister's family are mulling over 13 offers for a TV movie on the Health Net 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great buzz that you get," said Hiepler, who often defended insurance 
companies at an Oxnard law firm where he previously worked. "But it's so 
closely related to the worst thing that I've ever been through that I don't get 
too excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler's practice, and others like it, could see growing demand as HMOs 
continue to expand. Health Net, for example, has enrolled 108,350 new members 
since Jan. 1, bringing its total enrollment to 1.38 million. Such rapid growth 
is likely to test HMOs' ability to keep costs in check, and that could trigger 
more complaints from members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect for another $89-million verdict is slim, Hiepler conceded. 
When a case does end in a jury award or settlement, he gets a percentage. But 
most cases, he said, are resolved with a letter to the insurance company, and 
Hiepler collects the $150 hourly rate he charges his clients. Many of his 
clients are already so financially strapped that he reduces his hourly fee, he 
said, and in some cases he has waived it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the health insurance area of the practice may never be 
financially self-sustaining, Hiepler said, and will depend on revenues from 
other cases it handles, including personal injury suits and construction-defect 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Hiepler's clients were among the hundreds of people who called or 
wrote him after the Health Net case. Some cases are strikingly similar to that 
of his sister, including one of his two current cases against Health Net. 
</P>
<P>
 Viviana Vander Stoep, 51, a college English instructor in San Diego and a 
Health Net patient, was diagnosed with breast cancer in July, 1993. Health Net 
refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant, she said, so she and her husband 
hired Hiepler, then arranged to pay for the $150,000 operation themselves. She 
underwent transplant operations in November and January. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler and the Vander Stoeps said Health Net finally agreed to pay for the 
operations in January, after the Fox verdict had been rendered. But the dispute 
has left the Vander Stoeps so angry, they said, that they filed a lawsuit in 
San Diego County Superior Court on July 14 against the HMO, seeking 
compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had not had the transplant, I may have been dead by now," Vander Stoep 
said. "Health Net paid for it, but only after a great deal of turmoil, 
frustration and emotional disgust." 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net spokesman Don Prial said the HMO agreed to pay for the procedure 
last November, and has not been served with the Vander Stoep lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugs-of-war between patients and insurers often stem from HMOs' efforts to 
control costs by rationing care, Hiepler said. Many HMOs, he said, have set up 
incentive programs that encourage doctors to refrain from referring patients to 
specialists, often leading to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of serious 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers bristle at such accusations. Prial acknowledged that HMOs must 
control costs, but said moral and legal obligations ensure that HMOs offer 
top-notch care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark, in his infinite capacity to build up this bogyman, fails to understand 
that any doctor, any HMO, has a legal and moral responsibility to do things 
right the first time," Prial said. "Mark feels there's this conspiracy going 
on, and nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 In another recent case, Hiepler represented the family of Danielle 
Whelan-Smith, a 5-year-old Oxnard girl who needed her tonsils removed. Hiepler 
said a simple $800 tonsillectomy was delayed for eight months because the 
paperwork was mishandled by Foundation Health, an HMO based near Sacramento 
that serves 200,000 Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation finally approved the girl's tonsillectomy in May, shortly after 
Hiepler began working on the case, he said, but by then Danielle had already 
suffered fevers, throat infections and other problems for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The HMO just kind of lost it among their hundreds of thousands of people," 
Hiepler said. "In the meantime, the kid was being tortured." 
</P>
<P>
 A Foundation spokesman said he was unfamiliar with the case and declined to 
comment.

REALTY WOES, HEALTH CARE CUTS HURT FRAWLEY; HOSPITALS: TROUBLED TIMES MAY HAVE 
HIT TOO HARD FOR THE COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZED IN RUNNING SCHICK ADDICTION 
TREATMENT CENTERS TO RECOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frawley Corp., which claims its Schick tobacco, alcohol and drug addiction 
treatment centers have restored thousands of patients to productive lives, is 
itself suffering such a severe financial hangover that its own recovery is 
dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been forced into a tailspin by the push for cost containment 
among health care insurers combined with the collapse of the market for 
Southern California real estate -- another of Frawley's principal holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Frawley's last profitable year, its total losses have piled up to 
$12.8 million -- including a $689,000 loss on revenue of $1.82 million in the 
quarter that ended March 31. Meanwhile, its annual revenue has tumbled from 
$35.4 million six years ago to $9.83 million last year. Frawley's stock, which 
traded at $8.50 a share in the late 1980s, was down to 6 a share before it was 
delisted by the Pacific Stock Exchange in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And the company's auditors, Deloitte & Touche of Los Angeles, raised a classic 
red flag by saying they have "doubt about (Frawley's) ability to continue as a 
going concern" in documents filed in April with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick J. Frawley Jr., the eccentric chief executive, says he will pull his 
company out of its hole by selling off real estate, jettisoning two of Schick's 
three addiction treatment hospitals, and putting smaller Schick units in acute 
care hospitals across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A millionaire who once chaired the Schick Safety Razor Co., Frawley, 71, may 
have the wherewithal to succeed, but the odds against him are long. As of March 
31, the company owed $4 million in current liabilities -- due within 12 months 
-- while its current assets had shrunk to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're trying as hard as they possibly can to turn things around," 
said Frank Hawrylak, an analyst with Tweedy, Browne Company, a New York 
investment firm that held about 7% of Frawley's stock before unloading it 
earlier this year. "Frawley believes he's got a good product," Hawrylak said. 
"I don't know if he does or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's core business has always been its Schick Laboratories unit, 
which has a handful of small addiction treatment centers and, until recently, 
large addiction treatment hospitals in Santa Barbara, Seattle and Fort Worth, 
Tex. Schick treats addictions by administering small electric shocks or drugs 
that induce nausea while patients are confronted with the substances they are 
addicted to. Frawley says Schick has a 70% success rate in treating alcohol and 
tobacco addictions, and a 50% success rate treating addictions to cocaine and 
other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schick thrived in the 1980s as Americans were becoming more health conscious, 
and celebrities and athletes seemed to be tripping over themselves to check 
into addiction treatment facilities such as the Betty Ford Center in Rancho 
Mirage. At the same time, Nancy Reagan was fervently pushing her "just say no" 
to drugs campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 through 1988, Frawley was dependably profitable. But by the late 
1980s, insurance companies became increasingly reluctant to pay for expensive 
treatments. The expansion of cost-conscious health maintenance organizations 
accelerated the trend. In the past decade, the money HMOs budget for mental 
health coverage, including addiction treatment, has dwindled from $2 per 
patient per month to about 50 cents, said John Edelston, president of HealthPro 
Associates, a consulting firm in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cost savings has been achieved by curtailing inpatient care in 
favor of cheaper outpatient treatment. Schick has bucked this trend, and it 
still requires patients to check in for a 10-day stay, followed by a pair of 
two-day treatment sessions. Patrick Frawley insists that altering the Schick 
method would reduce its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Schick's price of about $12,000 for treatment is more than twice 
the cost for typical outpatient treatments at other detox centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schick's high prices have made it difficult for the company to land contracts 
with HMOs, which provide an ever-growing share of the nation's medical care. 
Once able to attract patients by advertising on late-night TV, Schick now finds 
that it isn't even an option on "preferred providers" lists of most HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly dependent on patients who pay out of pocket for treatment, and 
facing more competition from nicotine patch treatments and other alternative 
products, Schick's business has shrunk. The company treated about 2,000 addicts 
in 1988, and Patrick Frawley acknowledged the number "has gone down steadily" 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley Corp. has managed to stay afloat largely because it has sold off 
Southern California real estate that it had purchased with 1980s profits from 
the Schick division. By 1989, the company owned 713 acres of largely 
undeveloped land in the Santa Monica Mountains near Agoura that cost about 
$12.9 million, according to SEC documents. But just when Frawley needed to 
start selling the land to raise cash, the local real estate market began to 
slow. Over the past three years Patrick Frawley said the company sold 450 acres 
in the Santa Monica mountains and suffered a $3-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley and his son -- Michael P. Frawley, vice president of the corporation 
-- have also lent the company $416,000, according to SEC documents. 
</P>
<P>
 That Frawley has dipped into his own pockets reflects his obsessive commitment 
to the business. For Frawley, who admits he is a former alcoholic, curing the 
nation's addicts has become a personal crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1940s Patrick Frawley started to make a business name for himself by 
taking over a failing ballpoint pen parts maker and turning it into the 
Papermate Pen Co. He later chaired the Schick Safety Razor Co., and 
Technicolor, a North Hollywood maker of film prints and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley also made millions in real estate deals, including the sale in 1987 of 
a 4.5-acre Holmby Hills property -- once owned by Bing Crosby -- to television 
producer Aaron Spelling for $10.25 million. Spelling subsequently demolished 
the Crosby mansion and built a 56,000-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley's life took a new turn in the early 1970s, when he was treated for 
alcoholism at the Shadel Hospital in Seattle. He was so impressed with the 
hospital that he bought it and launched Schick treatment centers in 1972. 
Fighting addictions became his life's mission, and often he seems able to talk 
about little else. 
</P>
<P>
 During a series of lengthy telephone interviews, Frawley expounded on the 
personal and social costs of addictions. Asked to discuss the condition of his 
business, Frawley repeatedly resisted. "You're not interested in the guts of it 
-- saving people's lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sketching out his plan to save the company, Frawley said the first step is to 
"get rid of the bricks and mortar." So the company shut down its 50-bed detox 
hospital in Fort Worth in May, and Frawley said the building was expected to be 
sold this month for $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-bed Santa Barbara hospital was closed in June, and Frawley hopes to 
sell it for about $2.5 million, he said. The proceeds from the hospital sales 
will be used to pay off debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals will be replaced by a network of smaller treatment centers 
within acute care hospitals across the country. One such unit, a 13-bed 
facility at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach, opened in November. Four 
others could be in place by the end of the year, Frawley said, though he 
declined to give more details. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley, whose family owns about 70% of the company's stock, said he hopes the 
Schick unit can cut its costs by sharing administrative, clerical and 
maintenance costs with hospitals. And hospitals, Frawley hopes, will welcome 
the business because the trend to outpatient care has left many hospitals with 
empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to lower costs as much as we can," said Frawley. "I think we're 
going to be successful eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 But with revenues on a steep five-year slide, the escape hatch for Frawley 
Corp. grows narrower by the minute. That is a problem even Patrick Frawley 
acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we can't do it much longer," Frawley said. "We've got to come up 
with some solutions."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LIVE ENTERTAINMENT TO MERGE WITH CAROLCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live Entertainment Inc., a Van Nuys videocassette distributor, has agreed to 
merge with its former 49.9% owner, Carolco Pictures Inc., in a tax-free 
exchange of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for each Carolco stockholder to receive one share of newly 
issued Live common stock for each 5.5 Carolco shares held.The exchange ratio 
will depend on the market price for Carolco stock, but would go no lower than 
4.5 Carolco shares and no higher than 6.5 for each share of Live. After the 
exchange, current Live stockholders will own between 21% and 28% of the 
combined company, to be called Carolco Entertainment Inc., with the remainder 
to be owned by current Carolco shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, is 
subject to approval by regulators and shareholders of both companies. The deal 
is also contingent on Live's buyback of its Series B preferred stock and other 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco, a Los Angeles movie production company whose films include 
"Terminator 2" and "Basic Instinct," formerly owned slightly less than half of 
Live's stock, but financial troubles at the two companies forced it to cede 
control to a group of foreign investors led by Pioneer LDCA of Japan. Pioneer 
now owns 41.2% of Carolco's voting stock and 53.5% of Live's voting stock.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MARTIN LAWRENCE REPORTS NARROWER 2ND-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., a Van Nuys-based retailer of artworks 
for collectors, said it narrowed its second-quarter loss to $1.73 million from 
a loss of $2.26 million in the same period last year. Revenues for the second 
quarter, which ended June 30, were $3.83 million, compared with $3.82 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, the company reported a loss of $2.32 million in contrast 
to a $4.03-million loss a year earlier. Revenues for the six months were down 
slightly to $8.51 million compared with $8.56 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed its second-quarter results to cuts in framing and other 
sales costs, and to higher prices at retail galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence's chief financial officer, Allen E. Baron, also said the 
company has ended discussions over a proposal for Norton Herrick to provide it 
with $3.5 million in financing. Baron said it terminated the talks because of 
delays and changes in the terms of the proposed financing. He said Martin 
Lawrence would begin seeking other sources of capital to finance ongoing 
operations.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: WATERWAY PLASTICS PLANS WAREHOUSE IN OXNARD

 Oxnard is on the verge of getting its first major industrial construction 
project of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterway Plastics Inc., a producer of valves and other parts used in swimming 
pools and spas, hopes to build an 82,000-square-foot warehouse next to its 
plant on East Sturgis Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has already been given an official green light, says Alex Herrera 
of the city's Planning Department. Unless someone objects during a 15-day 
waiting period, the structure is on the way, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterway, which has about 400 employees, benefited from Oxnard's speeded-up 
system for processing building permits.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: FACTORY OUTLET BRINGS IN NEW PARTNER TO SIGN UP TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's factory outlet war is heating up. Within six months, 
developers expect to have two such centers in operation, with about 150 
manufacturers offering name-brand clothing and other merchandise at deep 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of the county's first center, Oxnard Factory Outlet, which opened in 
June, have brought in a new partner to help sign up tenants for the mall's 
planned second phase. And an eager rival, Camarillo Factory Stores, is expected 
to open in early 1995, having finally cleared the legal hurdles that plagued it 
for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Retail Inc., a Baltimore developer with interests in nine outlet centers 
nationwide, has agreed to purchase a 30% interest in Oxnard Factory Outlet from 
its owners, U. S. Outlets of California Inc. and St. Louis-based Fru-Con 
Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Factory Outlet, just off the Ventura Freeway between Rice and Rose 
avenues, is doing "very well," according to Keith Kennon, a partner in U. S. 
Outlets. Construction of a second phase is due to start within two months, with 
completion expected during the first quarter of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennon says the center has 48 tenants, including Benetton, Fila, Geoffrey 
Beene, and Leon Max. When the second phase opens, he expects to have 90 to 100 
stores. The entire project will cover 300,000 square feet of retail space and 
will cost $32 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime's financial investment is welcome, Kennon notes, "but the main reason 
we're happy to have them as partners is their leasing know-how. There are about 
400 manufacturers now marketing products through outlet centers, and Prime 
Retail has relationships with most of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Kennon said he wouldn't be surprised to see Prime buy out the 
original developers. U. S. Outlets is involved in a variety of other commercial 
developments, while Fru-Con's role in the Oxnard center is strictly as a 
financial backer, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Five miles to the south, work is under way on Camarillo Factory Stores, a 
50-outlet development that was the target of several lawsuits and threatened 
suits concerning its potential impact on the area. With the legal problems 
finally overcome, completion is scheduled for early February. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the developer, Chelsea GCA Realty Inc., won't name any 
tenants that have signed up, but says, "I can assure you that we already have 
several well-known manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman adds that Chelsea is confident that there are enough 
bargain-hunters in the area to support both centers, even though they'll be 
only a few minutes' drive apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Chelsea is a real-estate investment trust with offices in Newport Beach and 
Roseland, N. J. The trust owns 13 outlet centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The REIT's spokeswoman wouldn't say how much is being spent on the 
165,000-square-foot Camarillo center.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: NO RISE EXPECTED IN COTTON GARMENT PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the price of raw cotton is up sharply this year, George Hagopian, 
president of Cotton USA, a Moorpark manufacturer of women's clothing, doesn't 
expect a corresponding increase in retail costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the mill and the retail store, a garment goes through so many hands 
that the cost of the cotton isn't that important," he said."I think supply and 
demand have much more impact on the final price." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagopian won't disclose dollar figures, but says his sales have tripled over 
the past two years. He credits a revamped nationwide marketing operation and 
wide acceptance of Cotton USA's latest leisure wear. The line, designed by 
Hagopian and his wife, Lydia, emphasizes lace trim and lots of embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton USA has 200 employees, up from 110 a year ago. The firm's garments are 
made entirely of domestically grown cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Those spiraling cotton prices, incidentally, are blamed on a disappointing 
harvest in China and other parts of Asia.

PROPERTY VALUES: WILL STEEL BE THE BUILDING MATERIAL OF HOMES OF THE FUTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to building a new home, a few builders are starting to think of 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 While most commercial buildings are framed with steel, homes have 
traditionally been framed with wood. But lumber prices have nearly doubled over 
the past two years, so a handful of local home builders are starting to 
experiment with light-gauge steel framing. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, steel-framed homes account for just 1% of new U. S. 
housing starts according to the National Assn. of Home Builders. And there is 
not one major new home development under construction in the San Fernando or 
Santa Clarita valleys, or Ventura County, that utilized steel framing, 
according to The Meyers Group, a home-building research firm. But a few local 
custom home builders and remodelers are starting to use steel framing in some 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steel is easier and more stable to work with," said Tim Gurule, owner of 
Integrated Environmental Systems, a Las Vegas-based company that is building a 
steel-framed home in Pacoima. The house is being built on the foundation of an 
old home that has been demolished. Thanks in part to the cost-effectiveness of 
steel framing, Gurule said, the 1,360-square-foot home will be built for just 
$55 a square foot -- versus an average in the area of $100 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel homes are more fire-, termite- and earthquake-resistant than wood, 
argued Bill Justus, co-owner of Long Beach-based Silverwood Structures Co., 
which has built several steel-framed homes in Ventura County. Unlike wood, 
steel won't warp, split, crack or twist, Justus said, and "you build our homes 
like an erector set. All the parts are pre-cut, marked and labeled. Using 
recycled steel to frame a home is also much better for the environment than 
cutting down trees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the Northridge earthquake, there has been a lot of concern about the 
safety of steel-framed buildings. The Los Angeles Building and Safety 
Department reported recently that at least 90 steel-framed commercial 
structures in the San Fernando Valley were damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
Another 900 steel-framed buildings could be in jeopardy if another earthquake 
occurs in the Los Angeles area. And this month, the California Seismic Safety 
Commission urged government officials to force builders of new high-rise 
buildings to show proof that their steel-frame buildings can withstand a big 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But steel advocates point out that office buildings have steel frames that are 
welded together, while the steel-framed homes are screwed together. This gives 
the steel-framed homes more flexibility in a quake, Justus contends. Most of 
the earthquake damage in commercial steel buildings happened when horizontal 
beams and vertical columns welded together were unable to withstand the force 
of the quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are actually two types of steel studs used by residential steel-frame 
builders. Load-bearing steel studs are generally more expensive than wood. 
Non-load-bearing steel studs are now considered comparable in price, and 
sometimes cheaper, than wood. The cost of framing a home can vary widely, 
depending on the square footage of the structure, number of doors and windows, 
and the complexity of the roof and floor plan. The cost of labor is another 
variable because there aren't too many workers who are trained to put up 
steel-framed housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a large enough steel-skilled labor pool," conceded Dave Busk, 
owner of Busk Homes, a general contractor in Monarch Beach. Because of this, he 
said, steel framing often takes about 25% more time to put up than wood 
framing. With an experienced crew, however, steel and wood framing times are 
comparable, Busk said. Steel also costs less to transport than wood, he added, 
because light-gauge steel is 60% lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found that there is widespread acceptance of steel framing from home 
buyers," said Busk, who has erected a steel-framed home at the Anaheim 
Convention Center for the Southern California Home and Garden Show now under 
way. Most of that acceptance has come not in Southern California, but in 
Southern states, where buyers are more often looking for homes that are 
tornado- and hurricane-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not economically and logistically feasible for us to go with steel 
framing now," said Mark Beisswanger, president of Kaufman & Broad's Coastal 
Valleys Division in Woodland Hills. Currently, the cost of lumber framing is 
slightly less than steel framing, Beisswanger said. Two other reasons to stick 
with wood now are that K & B's labor pool is unfamiliar with steel framing, and 
all of the company's architectural and structural plans are designed for wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to make the move to steel framing would require a lot of changes, so 
any change is going to be gradual," Beisswanger said. "We're continuing to 
evaluate steel framing and it may become the preferred alternative in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are reluctant to be the first to jump into something new," said Jerry 
Hughes, owner of Anaco Building Systems, a steel packager in the city of 
Ventura. Anaco, which has been a commercial steel supplier for a number of 
years, has only supplied steel for framing two homes in Ventura, Hughes said. 
The company bid on supplying steel to several home builders, Hughes recalled, 
but the orders were either stymied by the economy or builders who were jittery 
about using a relatively new framing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel advocates say it's better to build an 1,800-square-foot home with six 
recycled cars than with 41 mature trees, but lumber advocates question the 
validity of such a comparison. "There are a lot of half-truths being promoted 
about the practical and environmental benefits of steel framing," said Butch 
Bernhardt, director of communications for the Western Wood Products Assn. in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhardt maintained that the recycled content of steel framing is lower than 
its promoters claim and said the manufacture of steel framing uses a massive 
amount of energy that may actually be more harmful to the environment than 
cutting down trees for building lumber. Bernhardt added that wood-framed houses 
increasingly feature the use of so-called oriented strand board, which is made 
out of wood strips and recycled wood products. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other potential drawbacks to a steel-framed house. Building a home 
with steel framing requires the services of a licensed structural engineer who 
is familiar with light-gauge steel homes. Another problem is "if you don't have 
a trained steel crew, it will take forever to build," Justus admitted.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: BENTON OIL REPORTS 2ND QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil & Gas Co., an Oxnard-based oil and natural gas exploration and 
production company, reported a second quarter profit after a year-earlier loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has operations in Louisiana, Venezuela and Russia, reported 
net income of $1.15 million, compared to a loss of $733,860 during the same 
three-month period a year earlier.Revenue in the latest quarter quadrupled to 
$8.48 million from $2 million in the June quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months of 1994, the company reported earnings of $2,000 on 
revenue of $12.2 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $1.48 million on 
revenue of $3.81 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton attributed the second quarter results to stronger performances from its 
domestic and Venezuelan operations. Domestic natural gas sales for the June 
quarter were 478 million cubic feet, which represented a tenfold increase over 
sales a year earlier. Oil sales from the Venezuelan project totaled 614,000 
barrels in the latest quarter, up from 40,000 barrels a year earlier.

SMALL BUSINESS; SOLO AD VENTURER; HIGH-TECH ONE-MAN AGENCY REPRESENTS NEXT WAVE 
AS INDUSTRY SHRINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Frankel, president of Frankel & Anderson advertising agency, works in a 
tiny office in his Encino home, where he dreams up ads on his Apple Macintosh 
computer. He also has an IBM PC-clone, a phone and a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no employees, just occasional visits from his two dogs and his 
2-year-old son. His closets are stuffed with floppy disks, his walls cluttered 
with movie posters and a photo of one of the actors who played Darrin Stephens, 
the advertising agency executive from the '60s TV show "Bewitched." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frankel, 37, claims to represent the future of the advertising business, 
and he may just be right. 
</P>
<P>
 While many big ad agencies have been slow to incorporate computer technology 
into their businesses, Frankel said he's been all-digital for about five years. 
Frankel composes ads on a computer -- whether drawings, rearranging photos, or 
tinkering with copy, headlines and colors -- then pushes a button to fax the ad 
to the client for approval. Better yet, if a client is on the Internet computer 
network, Frankel zaps a color, electronic version of the ad in a matter of 
seconds. He can even transmit TV commercials electronically, if the client is 
capable of receiving in that format. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most ad agencies these days use computers to compose and typeset 
ads the way that Frankel does. But even some of the largest agencies still 
haven't integrated their computer systems among various departments, and rarely 
do they send ads to clients electronically. Some even still make presentations 
to prospective clients the old-fashioned way -- on hand-drawn art boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Frankel charge less than big agencies, but he claims that 
technology has narrowed the quality gap, allowing him to produce ads comparable 
to those that big agencies spend months on -- and in a fraction of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 This, at a time when the ad industry is trying to recover from its longest and 
bleakest drought in memory, with tens of thousands of layoffs. Critics contend 
that many large agencies remain bloated and inefficient, and their once-loyal 
advertisers are increasingly breaking ad accounts into pieces that are doled 
out to various firms. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, observers say, more and more work is going to smaller, 
entrepreneurial agencies and non-traditional firms such as Hollywood talent 
agencies -- who are seen as swifter, hipper and more responsive. Coca-Cola, for 
example, has defected from Madison Avenue to small ad agencies and high-powered 
Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency. IBM, Burger King, MasterCard 
and Volkswagen also switched from large to small agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information highway? They don't get it," Frankel said of big ad agencies. 
Most are "still structured like 1950s agencies. They're still doing the Doris 
Day-Rock Hudson thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel is not alone in his view of big ad agencies. "There are some large 
agencies that are probably in a state of decline and are not going to make it 
because they've bureaucratized the whole advertising process," said New York 
management consultant James Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 In his days working for big agencies, Frankel recalled, he would produce about 
one television spot and three print ads a year. He now completes a couple 
hundred jobs a year without breaking a sweat, claiming to take in gross 
revenues equivalent to an agency billing between $3.5 million and $6 million 
annually. (Advertising agencies typically keep from 7% to 15% of billings.) 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, that's puny compared to billion-dollar agencies. And Frankel's 
clients -- from computer software firms and retailers to the California Lottery 
and Sea World -- usually spend $500,000 or less on an ad campaign with him. But 
many major ad agencies that wouldn't accept jobs that small in the 1980s now 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel said he gets most of his business through referrals from clients who 
like his "funny" style. For a Honda Sabre motorcycle ad, he created a glossy 
image of the bike imposed over photos of road signs with text that reads, "It 
was born under three different signs." Another ad for a health club has a 
100-pound bag of flour dressed in a bikini, with a reminder, "Just because 
you're 100 lbs. doesn't mean you look great in a bikini." 
</P>
<P>
 Major ad agencies have also used Frankel anonymously to perform "ghost work" 
on some of their biggest accounts because his computer expertise allows him to 
turn assignments around so quickly, he claimed -- although Frankel won't reveal 
the names of these agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger ad agencies generally have been slow to embrace computer technology 
because the main reason to do so was to cut costs, said Ron Lockhart, chief 
executive of Publications Directions, a New York consulting firm for graphics 
companies. "In the ad industry, all the charges are thrown right back to the 
client and marked up at the industry standard. There was no motivation for 
advertisers to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's only now that larger agencies are under pressure from smaller ones that 
they've begun to catch up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that big ad agencies are dinosaurs. BBDO Worldwide was 
"forced into (technology) early" because a major client is Apple Computer, 
which expects a certain degree of technological competence, said Patty Buss, 
vice president at BBDO in Los Angeles. "I think everyone is pretty much up to 
speed now." 
</P>
<P>
 The view of big ad agencies as inefficient is "wishful thinking on the part of 
a lot of smaller agencies," said Abbott C. Jones, managing director of AdMedia 
Corporate Advisors, a New York investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 After their cutbacks and reorganizations, many big agencies are now leaner and 
more responsive to clients, Jones said. He noted that ad giants such as 
Interpublic Group, Omnicon Group and Foote Cone & Belding have growing revenues 
and earnings, and higher stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Frankel argued that many large agencies remain bloated with middle 
management and archaic chains of command: A client will communicate with an 
account executive, who types a memo and sends it to his supervisor, who passes 
it on to the senior creative person, who dispatches the information to group 
heads. All the while, ideas bounce to and fro, from agency to advertiser, in 
meeting after meeting. Delivery service bills pile up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge Ping-Pong game between the ad agency and the client, which 
actually becomes adversarial," Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence that some agencies are technologically deficient, Frankel noted a 
recent agency review he conducted for a division of the Dutch consumer 
electronics giant Philips. Frankel, hired to advise Philips on which agency to 
select, heard presentations by several major agencies. He was astonished when 
two presented art boards that were drawn and pasted up by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel said he knows big ad agencies well because he's worked for eight of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh out of UC Berkeley, Frankel joined Foote, Cone & Belding as a writer. 
Over the next seven years he jumped from one agency to another, ending up at 
D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. In 1986, he was asked to leave the agency over 
"style differences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Frankel and art director Don Anderson started their own firm with a 
leased office and a few workers. Frankel later bought Anderson out, keeping the 
firm's name. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1990, Frankel saw that technology had advanced so far that he could earn 
more by working alone. He set up his home office with $35,000 in equipment, and 
developed a network of photographers, illustrators, media buyers and other 
on-line service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Frankel has accepted stock or options in some of his clients in 
exchange for lower fees. Among the companies Frankel has equity in are Right 
Start Inc., a Westlake Village mail-order firm; GeoWorks, an Alameda software 
developer that recently raised more than $10 million in its initial public 
stock offering, and Adaptive Software Inc., a fast-growing Newport Beach 
developer of employee scheduling software. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Fridstein, Right Start's president, said Frankel started doing ad work 
for his company around 1985 when it couldn't afford a big agency. He kept going 
back to Frankel even after Right Start grew into a much larger and profitable 
company because, Fridstein said, Frankel is "a streamed-down version of the 
sloth-like agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 And soon, Frankel believes, the difference between cutting-edge ad agencies 
and others will be even more evident with the coming of interactive television. 
Some big ad agencies have formed divisions to study the matter. Frankel said 
he's ready now to produce interactive ads, he's just waiting for the market to 
develop.

'TALKING HOUSE' IS LAST WORD IN SHOPPING EASE; REAL ESTATE: O.C. BROKERS ARE 
TURNING TO A SYSTEM THAT LETS POTENTIAL BUYERS HEAR ALL ABOUT HOMES WITHOUT 
LEAVING THEIR CARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Now you can let your home sell itself -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of houses on the market in Southern California sport 
signs that read, "Talking House. Tune Your Car Radio to 1610 AM for 
Information."  
</P>
<P>
 A transmitter inside the home broadcasts 90 seconds of information, including 
the number of bedrooms, square footage and, most important, asking price. The 
system benefits prospective buyers, who can tune in to a house they like and 
learn the basics without even leaving their cars. It also suits real estate 
brokers, who see it as a way of easing their workload. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for home buyers to get information on a property 
without calling an agent, 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said Bill 
Schonlau, a Newport Beach broker who has the broadcast devices on two 
beachfront homes he has listed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, there are now about 25,000 talking homes, with about 2,500 of 
those in Southern California, said Scott C. Matthew, president of Realty 
Electronics Inc. in Fond du Lac, Wis., one company that makes the devices. His 
company's transmitters, on the market since 1991, are in use across the United 
States, he said, though they face a challenge in urban areas where the airwaves 
are already crowded with signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, talking houses in California will be as common as yard signs," he 
predicted. "And there is no reason why nearly all of the homes for sale at any 
given time in this country can't be talking houses."  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, a company called Business Broadcast Systems distributes the 
talking house transmitters for Realty Electronics. No special license is needed 
for the federally approved transmitters, which cost real estate agents about 
$200 and can be rented for about $20 a month, Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
 One expert who predicts a stronger market for such selling tools is Pat Neal, 
president of the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will see more talking houses and other types of devices as the home sales 
market comes back and the customer demands more information," said Neal, who 
heads a trade group with 104,000 members. "We are aware of these technological 
breakthroughs and want to keep our members informed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Archbold, a broker for Richard Thomas Realty in Laguna Niguel, sees the 
transmitters as a welcome sales tool because they weed out looky-loos. Buyers 
who call him already know the basics and are interested in the property, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbold bought his first talking house transmitter a month ago and now has 
five in operation. The response has been so fantastic, he said, that he wants 
to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have done it sooner," he said last week, "but I hadn't seen any 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers such as Joanne Worobec, a Riverside County resident 
considering a move to Orange County, says she generally doesn't enjoy house 
shopping through real estate agents, so the transmitter system works well for 
her. In fact, as she was exploring neighborhoods in San Clemente, one 
particular house seemed to be calling her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this pink house that talked to us," Worobec said. "It's a great idea 
for people like us who are looking but don't want to get involved with a 
realtor yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gave me enough information on the house that we wanted to call." 
Straight From the House's Mouth 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello! Thank you for tuning in to our talking house. One twenty-three Gaviota 
is a two-bedroom, one-bath, typical San Clemente cottage. The owner has put in 
new wall-to-wall carpet and tile less than a year ago. It's a great beach 
cottage with a Caribbean flavor. We have listed 123 Gaviota for $236,000."

THE BIZ / JOHN LIPPMAN: KEEPING FAITH & VALUES A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Far from Hollywood's world of million-dollar producers, Armani-clad executives 
and $100 lunches of pasta and mineral water is one of the country's 
fastest-growing cable TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Faith & Values Channel offers viewers, in its words, an "oasis of clean, 
uplifting entertainment" and a place to find "answers (they) may not find 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it prides itself on eschewing crass teen-age sitcoms and 
violence-laden dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 That formula has helped New York-based F&V win over some 20 million 
subscribers in just a few short years -- a remarkable achievement in the 
crowded cable programming world, where many of its competitors are better 
financed. Much of the success appears to be owed to Faith & Values' savvy 
programming strategy. More people, for instance, tuned into its coverage of the 
Pope's visit to America last year than watched the O.J. Simpson hearings on 
Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Faith & Values has religious roots. The network is jointly 
operated by the National Interfaith Cable Coalition and the Southern Baptist 
Convention. But unlike televangelist channels, it is run like a conventional 
cable channel -- receiving its support from advertisers such as Arm & Hammer 
and AT&T and from subscription fees charged local cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest challenge is overcoming the perception of religious TV in this 
country," says Jeff Weber, executive vice president at VISN, the interfaith 
group responsible for programming 16 hours of the channel's 24-hour day. "It's 
gotten a black eye from televangelists who claim they have all the answers and 
then ask for money." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to programming, Faith & Values adheres to a strictly ecumenical 
approach. Many of the programs are supplied by NICC's 64-member faith groups, 
spanning the Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jewish and Eastern Orthodox religions. 
It also acquires faith-oriented programming from Britain's BBC and Canada's CBS 
and from U.S. public television. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, Faith & Values is producing more of its own 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next month begins a weekly series with Jim Hartz, the former co-anchor of the 
"Today" show, titled "Issues and Ethics," which will analyze news events in a 
religious context. An upcoming half-hour comedy titled "Have Faith" concerns a 
monsignor overseeing an unruly parish and features guest appearances by John 
Ritter. Best-selling author Thomas Moore will host a series focusing on how 
people can discover spirituality in their everyday lives, and he will be 
assisted by "Frugal Gourmet" star Jeff Smith, himself an ordained minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith & Values is also able to call on a stable of heavy hitters in network 
news, such as Judy Woodruff, Carole Simpson and Meredith Viera, to anchor 
various specials. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the big Hollywood studios and local telephone companies are 
talking about investing billions of dollars to supply the 500-channel pipeline, 
the Faith & Values Channel has found a growing niche that has been all but 
ignored by traditional programmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to give the TV viewer some programming which will stimulate and 
entertain them as well as feed the soul and spirit, motivate them to consider 
their own faith and what role it plays in their lives," said Nelson Price, VISN 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other so-called religious channels, however, Faith & Values was founded 
on three basic tenets: The channel will not proselytize viewers, does not 
malign other people's religions and will not engage in on-air money-raising 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Price says the budget for the cable network is a modest $9 million, and he 
predicts it will begin to turn a profit later this year or early next. Since 
Faith & Values is a not-for-profit corporation, all earnings are plowed back 
into operations rather than collected by its owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it lacks the marketing muscle of many other networks, Faith & Values 
works through faith groups at the local level to get the word out about its 
programming. It also transmits discussion group literature via the Ecunet 
computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith & Values was created out of a channel-sharing agreement two years ago 
between VISN and ACTS, the cable network owned and operated by the Ft. 
Worth-based Southern Baptist Radio & TV Commission. The merged channel is now 
marketed by Vision Group Inc., a subsidiary of cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. VGI, whose sole client has been VISN, now plans to 
market other niche cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI, in fact, helped launch VISN six years ago by providing some operational 
dollars for VISN. The intent of VISN, explains Weber -- a graduate of Union 
Theological Seminary in New York and former executive at Nickelodeon -- was to 
give viewers broader exposure to religion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked why are we only seeing one kind of religion on TV and none of it 
reflects mainline religion in this country," Weber says. "From the beginning we 
wanted VISN programming to represent the broad spectrum of faith in this 
country and build bridges of understanding between faith groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith & Values executives think they have struck a chord with viewers, 
especially those in the 30-to-50 age bracket who are returning to or 
discovering a particular religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they hope, Faith & Values may do for religion what the Discovery 
Channel did for nature programming: provide an untapped audience with a 
programming alternative the traditional broadcast networks and cable channels 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering the image that many people have of religious broadcasters, Weber 
says Faith & Values will never become a tool for any particular faith. It also 
won't stray, he promises, from its television flock. "We're not going to build 
any theme parks."

COMPUTER PIONEER SEEKS PROTECTION; TECHNOLOGY: THINKING MACHINES FALTERS JUST 
AS ITS 'PARALLEL PROCESSING' IS FINALLY GAINING ACCEPTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thinking Machines Corp., the company that revolutionized the esoteric science 
of supercomputers, said Monday that it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection -- just as the "parallel processing" technology it pioneered is 
finally being accepted by the mainstream computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambridge, Mass.-based company, which has sought investors for months to 
ease a cash crunch, said it will now lay off one-third of its 425 employees in 
an effort to return to profitability. The company will shrink its business to 
core operations such as government systems and seek to sell or license its 
patents and networking technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking Machines' troubles renewed concerns about the ability of small U.S. 
technology companies to survive over the long haul and reap the benefits of 
their technological breakthroughs. Such concerns could hamper efforts by other 
pioneering companies to sell in tough overseas markets, especially Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems at other small supercomputing companies, coupled with rumors that 
Thinking Machines was in trouble, became self-fulfilling prophecies as sales of 
the company's multimillion-dollar machines dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I would meet with customers and I would have to distinguish 
ourselves from Kendall Square," said Chief Executive Richard P. Fishman, 
referring to sharp sales declines and an accounting scandal at rival Kendall 
Square Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking Machines' problems come just as it was finally declaring victory in 
its long, uphill battle to persuade the computer world that so-called massively 
parallel processing is the wave of the future in high-performance computing. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional supercomputers use extremely elaborate, custom-built central 
processing units that can execute computer instructions very rapidly. But such 
processors are very expensive to design and build, and they often need 
elaborate cooling systems and other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Massively parallel machines, by contrast, use hundreds or even thousands of 
low-cost microprocessors similar to those used in personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The computing task is divided up, with different pieces solved simultaneously 
by different processors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Danny Hillis, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, founded Thinking Machines in 1983, his concept was disparaged as 
conceptually interesting but hopelessly impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 Many computer designers believed the software complications inherent in 
massively parallel processing -- figuring out a way to break up the problem and 
then reassemble it when the pieces had been solved -- would be virtually 
impossible to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company gained recognition when it sold two systems to Dow Jones Co. 
for speeding through database searches. It also won a high-profile sale to 
American Express, which used the machines to predict buying habits of credit 
card users. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, other computer companies were convinced. Sales of parallel 
computers are expected to rocket from about $650 million last year to $5 
billion in five years, according to Howard Richmond, director of 
high-performance computing at the Gartner Group, a consulting company in 
Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking Machines was the market leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But all along, the company's largest sales went to government agencies, which 
were interested in the technology for use in such high-tech defense initiatives 
as the "Star Wars" project. 
</P>
<P>
 "From its inception, it was the U.S. taxpayer that supported the company," 
Richmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Large government contracts helped create a company that was oriented toward 
pushing the envelope technologically without developing the commercial 
applications necessary to sustain sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, computer makers such as IBM, Digital Equipment and Convex entered 
the market with cheaper systems. And Intel, eager to gain a foothold in an 
industry that promised to consume lots of microprocessors, also dove in 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking Machines was mismanaged, too, concedes Fishman, who succeeded 
co-founder Sheryl L. Handler as chief executive in October. "We have this 
panoramic view of the Boston skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 There was this attitude that the sky is the limit -- we pay twice what Lotus 
pays across the street and they are profitable," Fishman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking Machines also recently lost a key government contract and a big 
expected sale in Japan, leading to a loss of $20.5 million on just $82.3 
million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fall could end up leaving mud on the face of the U.S. government 
-- and eventually hurt other American companies trying to sell in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese government institutions and corporations bowed to U.S. pressure and 
became major buyers of U.S.-made supercomputers, despite their worries about 
being able to sustain a long-term relationship with small, potentially unstable 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishman, who plans to resign when the company files for bankruptcy, tried to 
look at the bright side of the company's plight. "The good news is that this 
technology that used to be disparaged as something from the lunatic fringe has 
proven itself," he said. Big Losses

COMPANY TOWN; AT WARNER BROS. RECORDS, MO OSTIN LOYAL TO THE END 
</P>

 News of Warner Bros. Records Chairman Mo Ostin's planned departure after 31 
years brought some of his employees to the verge of tears Monday. But the 
66-year-old music industry titan said has no qualms about ending his career 
when his contract expires in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fantastic," Ostin said in a rare interview from his Burbank office. 
"This is exactly the right time to make this choice, and I look forward to 
finishing up my work here on a high note. I'm real proud of this company, and 
my intention is to go out in a blaze." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin's resignation ends a long power struggle with Warner Music Group 
Chairman Robert Morgado, who recently reorganized the corporate management 
structure. The media conglomerate said Ostin will be succeeded by his protege, 
Warner Records President Lenny Waronker. 
</P>
<P>
 Waronker, 52, on Monday characterized the transition as "emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 "Change is good -- and there will be changes," Waronker said. "But in terms of 
the important stuff -- the philosophical stuff -- this company will remain an 
artist-driven company." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources on Sunday confirmed Ostin's plans to resign. In a formal statement on 
Monday, Morgado praised the achievements of Ostin, who will remain as a 
consultant to Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin. But industry sources widely 
believe that it was Morgado who pushed Ostin out. The two have been at odds 
since 1990, when Morgado was brought in to oversee Time Warner's music group 
and insisted on direct oversight of Warner Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Ostin -- whose savvy business skills and commitment to artist 
development have been revered in entertainment circles for decades -- operated 
with autonomy, reporting only to Time Warner top brass. He dealt directly with 
Time Warner Chairman Steven Ross until Ross died. He then began reporting to 
Ross' successor, Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions reached the boiling point last month, when Morgado promoted former 
Atlantic chief Doug Morris to run Time Warner's new domestic music division -- 
a move insiders say was orchestrated in part to hasten the departure of Ostin 
and former Elektra Entertainment chief Bob Krasnow, who resigned immediately. 
Under the new chain of command, all American label heads -- including Ostin -- 
were required to report to Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin denied music industry rumors that he harbors personal animosity toward 
Morgado. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only differences I have with Bob Morgado are philosophical differences," 
Ostin said. "He has one point of view about how a company should be run and I 
have another, but it certainly is in no way on a personal level. And the 
suggestion that Doug and I have problems, well, that's simply not true at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is that Warner Bros. Records has never been run from the 
perspective of financial people or legal people or promotion people. We've 
always been a label solely about artists and music, and that's the way it will 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin has been criticized for being "too loyal" to longtime employees and too 
resistant to institute staff and artist roster cuts at the bloated label, which 
even his most ardent admirers believe is in need of streamlining. On Monday, he 
acknowledged that the firm could lose some fat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's partially true -- but it's all a matter of perspective," Ostin 
said. "I have my way of how I would go through the streamlining process; 
somebody else may have another way of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin disagreed with recent reports in the media that his label has performed 
poorly compared to other music units in Warner Music Group's $5-billion global 
enterprise. Despite recent hits from such rock acts as Green Day and Candlebox, 
Warner Bros. Records continues to be blasted by some industry newcomers as an 
"old folks' home for aging superstars." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just a bad rap created by our competitors to create misperceptions 
about how vital this company is," Ostin said. "I think it's really unfair. 
Everyone knows we are their prime competitor anytime it comes time to sign new 
acts. Some companies try to make themselves look good by trashing us. But if 
you look at the charts and study our profit performance over the years, we are 
by far the most consistent and stable company on the block." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Warner Bros. Records has been the envy of its competitors for decades, 
a virtual museum of priceless catalogues from cutting-edge artists. Ostin is 
highly regarded not only for bringing a philosophy to the firm that the artist 
is king, but also for instituting a competitive management system that remains 
a model for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner employees weren't the only ones upset about Ostin's resignation. 
Reaction among his competitors was also somber. 
</P>
<P>
 "This truly signals the end of an era," said former Capitol Records CEO Joe 
Smith. "Mo is one of the last of the founding fathers of the '60s, one of the 
bedrock individuals who invented the ground rules for the music business as we 
know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arista Records chief Clive Davis concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is a giant among executives, and his rich and diverse legacy will 
live on for many years to come," he said.

PACKARD BELL WILL LEAVE SOUTHLAND, EXECUTIVE SAYS; COMPUTERS: PALMDALE, WHICH 
HAD SOUGHT TO LURE THE FIRM WITH INCENTIVES, HAS BEEN RULED OUT IN FAVOR OF 
SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Packard Bell, the computer giant temporarily quartered in Westlake Village, 
has ruled out relocating to Palmdale and thus will leave Southern California, a 
company executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the company is likely to move its 1,500-member work force to Northern 
California. Packard Bell Vice Chairman Jeff Scheinrock told an Assembly panel 
that if the state passes legislation creating an enterprise zone in Sacramento, 
his firm will move to that city and end its further consideration of relocating 
to Salt Lake City or Portland, Ore. Such enterprise zones offer tax breaks to 
companies that hire local residents and invest heavily in equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly's Utilities and Commerce Committee, which had been hearing 
testimony on the creation of additional enterprise zones, subsequently voted 10 
to 0 to recommend creation of such an area in Sacramento. Passage by the full 
Legislature is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer firm said it eliminated Palmdale in part because of the 
earthquake risk in that Antelope Valley city. The disclosure puts an end to 
Palmdale's year-long courtship of Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal computer manufacturer announced in late 1993 that it had outgrown 
its six Chatsworth facilities and in early January announced that it would move 
more than a quarter of its work force to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, damage caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge quake forced the firm to 
shift its operations to Westlake Village and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, Palmdale, with help from Los Angeles County officials, 
had put together an elaborate array of incentives worth tens of millions of 
dollars to lure Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his testimony Monday, Packard Bell's Scheinrock disclosed publicly for 
the first time that Palmdale has been eliminated from consideration as a site. 
</P>
<P>
 A Packard Bell memo to Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), who chairs 
the committee that voted to establish the Sacramento enterprise zone, said 
Palmdale posed an "unacceptable earthquake risk for (a) sole U.S. manufacturing 
location." The memo also claimed Palmdale could not provide Packard Bell with 
the 400,000-square-foot interim facility it would need. 
</P>
<P>
 The same memo identified a former Army depot in Sacramento as the site Packard 
Bell is considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's disclosure hit Palmdale leaders hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a huge shock to us," said an aide to Assemblyman R.J. (Pete) 
Knight (R-Palmdale). Knight has been part of the team boosting Palmdale's bid 
with $40 million of incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "With good old Packard Bell, the dance is over," sighed Al McCord, Palmdale's 
economic development director. "We lost, and that's part of the competitiveness 
in economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the powerful incentives Palmdale was ready to offer Packard Bell were 
the gift of 50 acres of land, valued at $7.5 million; $4 million in housing 
assistance to help Packard Bell employees move to Palmdale; $10 million in 
tax-exempt bonds to help build Packard Bell facilities, and low-cost financing 
to help Packard Bell subcontractors construct their plants in Palmdale. Even 
local Palmdale businesses agreed to offer furniture and other discounts to 
Packard Bell employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, news that Packard Bell was ready to go to Sacramento was greeted 
warmly by Gov. Pete Wilson's office.

 TWA Reduces Operating Losses: Trans World Airlines Inc. said its operating 
loss in the quarter ended June 30 totaled $17.4 million, compared to a 
$31-million loss a year earlier.But higher debt-interest costs resulted in a 
$58.2-million net loss in the period for the St. Louis-based carrier, up from a 
$52.3-million net loss a year earlier. TWA's revenue climbed 12% to $885.8 
million, from $792.9 million. The airline, alluding to plans to overhaul its 
business and negotiate new contracts with its unions, said the results confirm 
that TWA "must remake itself" to be profitable and competitive.

 Accounting Firms Convert to Limited Liability Partnerships: KPMG Peat Marwick 
and Deloitte & Touche both announced the switch from general partnership to 
protect their partners from personal liability in lawsuits brought against 
their firms.The conversion affects 16,000 Peat Marwick partners and 1,450 
partners at Deloitte & Touche. Without limited liability designation, partners' 
bank accounts and other personal assets could be tapped after the firms 
exhausted all insurance coverage and corporate assets to pay damages in suits 
charging faulty auditing or consulting work, negligence or wrongdoing. Coopers 
& Lybrand and Ernst & Young have also converted to limited liability 
partnerships.

 Former Salomon Chairman Seeks Back Pay: John Gutfreund has asked a New York 
court to overturn an arbitration panel's decision denying him $55.3 million in 
back pay and other compensation. Gutfreund contends that the New York Stock 
Exchange panel's decision ignored the terms of his contract with Salomon Inc. 
and violated New York state law barring employers from withholding earned 
compensation. Gutfreund, once one of the most powerful men on Wall Street, was 
among several top Salomon executives who quit soon after the firm admitted in 
August, 1991, that it had violated bidding rules at several Treasury auctions.

CAREMARK TO ACQUIRE SOUTHLAND GROUP; MERGERS: ILLINOIS-BASED FIRM WILL ABSORB 
FRIENDLY HILLS HEALTHCARE NETWORK IN A DEAL WORTH MORE THAN $100 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Caremark International has agreed to acquire one of Southern California's 
largest medical practices for more than $100 million in a deal that illustrates 
how the rapidly consolidating health care industry and heightened competition 
are forcing many providers to seek bigger partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative deal, Caremark, based in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, 
will acquire the 274-bed Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center in La Habra, 14 
medical offices in Orange and Los Angeles counties and certain other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caremark officials stressed that Friendly Hills' hospital and other 
physical assets were not the primary reason for the deal. Friendly Hills 
Healthcare Network is considered one of the nation's most innovative medical 
groups in the area of managed health care. About 95% of the medical group's 
1993 revenue of $170 million came from contracts with health maintenance 
organizations and other managed-care firms. 
</P>
<P>
 C. A. Lance Piccolo, Caremark's chairman and chief executive, described 
Friendly Hills as "a pioneer" in managed care that also "rates high in patient 
satisfaction while keeping patient costs as low as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Caremark, a diversified health care concern with 1993 sales of nearly $1.8 
billion, specializes in home health care, prescription drug benefit management 
and physical rehabilitation services. The firm also manages medical practices 
and recently acquired a 165-physician group in Houston and a 100-physician 
practice in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 Piccolo lauded Friendly Hills for its programs in disease prevention and in 
monitoring how patients are cared for in outpatient settings. More important, 
he said, as many HMOs and other insurers try to cut costs by eliminating 
unnecessary hospital visits or overly long stays, Friendly Hills claims one of 
the lowest hospitalization rates in the nation: about 157 hospital days per 
1,000 patients, far better than the national average of 350 hospital days per 
1,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Caremark wants to expand its medical practice management services nationally 
and hopes to tap Friendly Hills' 15 years of experience in managed-care 
contracting in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Friendly Hills brought us was a home run in that type of (managed care) 
technology," Piccolo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Albert E. Barnett, who co-founded Friendly Hills in 1968 and serves as its 
chairman and chief executive, said the Caremark deal is a way for his group to 
remain competitive and expand its operations in California as the industry 
consolidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that Caremark had a lot to offer in terms of capital and expertise," 
Barnett said. "We just didn't feel we could generate that kind of capital on 
our own." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Friendly Hills has had discussions with hospitals and insurers locally 
and nationally about possible mergers but preferred Caremark because "it's more 
of a physician organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Caremark attracted some unwanted attention earlier this month when a federal 
grand jury in Minneapolis charged the company and three employees with 
participating in an alleged $1.1-million kickback scheme involving illegal 
payments to a doctor for patient referrals. The indictments resulted from a 
nationwide federal investigation of the company that focuses on whether some 
Caremark payments to doctors, such as research grants, may been disguised 
kickbacks to obtain patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Caremark has denied any wrongdoing in either the Minneapolis case or the wider 
investigation.

COMPAQ TO CUT PRICES ON PC LINES; COMPUTERS: THE MOVE COULD SET OFF A PRICE WAR 
DURING THE INDUSTRY'S PEAK BUYING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Compaq Computer Corp., which earlier this year took over as the nation's 
largest personal computer company, announced sweeping price cuts Monday on a 
wide range of products, a move that may trigger a price war. 
</P>
<P>
 The price reductions coincided with the start of the strong computer buying 
season, which runs from September to December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston-based company slashed prices up to 22% for virtually its entire 
line of Deskpro XL, Deskpro XE and ProLinea personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 It also lowered prices up to 17% on most of its Contura and Contura Aero 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 There was concern that Compaq might be fueling a price war in the PC business, 
with the reductions coming at a time when prices for some components have 
declined and inventories have risen. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling is that some vendors will react and some will not. It depends 
on their overall strategy," said John Carlo Bisone, Compaq's senior vice 
president of North American marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main point of this action is to combine affordability with availability," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Compaq said it is meeting demand for most of its product 
lines, with the exception of some models of its notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, customers sometimes could not find the Compaq desktop 
configurations or the quantities they really needed. Now that issue is, for the 
most part, solved -- and at a more affordable price," said Ross Cooley, 
Compaq's senior vice president for North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has had problems in the past few quarters meeting demand for its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pretty much current across the product line," Bisone said, adding that 
the company's price cuts are "not a fire sale" but an effort to continue to 
gain market share in the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, San Jose-based market researcher Dataquest Inc. said Compaq is 
again the biggest U.S. maker of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq stock closed up 25 cents at $35.125 Monday on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

GREAT WESTERN SELLS BRANCHES IN W. FLORIDA; BANKING: IT'S GIVING UP OPERATIONS 
IN THAT PART OF THE SUNSHINE STATE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Great Western Bank changed gears Monday in its much-publicized move into 
Florida, announcing the sale of its 31 branches in the western portion of the 
state to First Union National Bank of Florida for about $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western has bought several institutions in Florida over the last few 
years in an effort to diversify from its California base. The company said that 
selling its operations on the western side of Florida will enable it to focus 
on expanding in the central and southeast portions of state, where it has 119 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western, based in Chatsworth, also said it could not justify keeping the 
31 branches because the relatively small size of the group prevented it from 
enjoying the economies of scale needed to meet the bank's financial objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped to fill out the network in the western part (of Florida) by 
making other acquisitions, but now we think it would be better to focus on 
developing our business elsewhere in Florida," said Gordon Turner, a Great 
Western vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Although First Union will be purchasing all of Great Western's retail banking 
offices in western Florida -- a region that includes the fast-growing Tampa-St. 
Petersburg market -- Turner said the bank will keep its six home-loan offices 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western had only a small presence in Florida until 1990, when it bought 
71 branches of the failed CenTrust Savings Bank and 18 branches of the failed 
Gibraltar Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corp. for about $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 18 former Gibraltar branches are among the offices that Great 
Western is now selling to First Union, Turner said. Great Western said it will 
realize a gain of about $60 million from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western's stock rose 62.5 cents Monday to close at $23.75, a 1994 high. 
It had traded as low as $15.25 earlier in the year.

BABY BELL WILL CUT 5,600 JOBS; COMMUNICATIONS: BELL ATLANTIC WILL ALSO TAKE A 
$2.3-BILLION THIRD-QUARTER CHARGE IN PREPARATION FOR ITS DIGITAL TRANSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bell Atlantic Corp. said Monday that it will cut its work force by 5,600 over 
the next three years and take a $2.3-billion charge in the third quarter as it 
prepares to move to an all-digital communications network. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge will result in losses for the third quarter and the year, the 
Philadelphia-based regional phone company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic said the charge consists mainly of a $2.15-billion, non-cash 
provision to discontinue its accounting methods as a regulated company and to 
revalue its telephone operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also taking a $100-million charge for the staff cuts and a $35- 
to $45-million charge to write off some non-strategic investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic is "getting more efficient to deal with upcoming competition," 
said Steven Yannis, an analyst at Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, another regional phone company, US West, said it would take a 
charge of $3.8 billion to lay off 9,000 employees, accelerate its effort to 
adopt new technology and to change its accounting methods. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Nynex Corp. announced a $1.6-billion charge along with plans to cut 
its work force by a third, or about 16,800. Nynex also accelerated its plans to 
deploy a fiber-optic network and said it would lay another 500,000 miles of 
fiber-optic line by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic said it is making accounting changes appropriate to a 
competitive, rather than a regulated, industry that may be facing major 
legislative changes. 
</P>
<P>
 After its summer recess, Congress is expected to vote on whether the regional 
bell operating companies can enter into the intrastate long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts said Bell Atlantic's accounting changes will accelerate 
the depreciation of the company's aging copper network equipment, which is 
being replaced by a digital network able to carry voice, data and video. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic and all the regional telephone companies are moving to 
fiber-optic networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiber-optic networks will provide wider "pipes," or bandwidths, through which 
the Baby Bells are hoping to send a stream of products and services, ranging 
from voice, data, messaging and interactive video, on the much-touted 
information superhighway.

 GM Says Pension Bill May Be Cut: Under current accounting rules, the discount 
rate firms use to calculate the present value of their pension plan obligations 
must reflect interest rates on long-term, high-quality corporate bonds. Lower 
rates mean companies must assume they will have to contribute more because 
existing pension contributions will earn less.General Motors' estimate of its 
unfunded obligation rose to $22.3 billion at the end of 1993 from about $14 
billion at that point in 1992. Interest rates have increased by about 145 basis 
points from the date GM makes its calculations, so that, if maintained, the 
higher interest rates would cut GM's reported unfunded pension liabilities at 
year-end 1994 by more than $7 billion, the firm said in a report to the SEC.

AMERICAN HOME HEATS UP TAKEOVER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turning up the heat in its takeover bid, American Home Products Corp. said 
Monday that it will offer up to $100 a share for American Cyanamid Co. if the 
latter will agree to a friendly transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home said its $100-a-share offer stands until Aug. 16. But it said it 
will proceed with its previous $8.5-billion, $95-a-share tender offer if an 
agreement between the two companies cannot be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 American Cyanamid's spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. 
Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products, which makes Advil, Anacin and 
Dristan brand pain relievers, unveiled the offer for Cyanamid earlier this 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, American Home filed a lawsuit against American Cyanamid, which 
produces drugs, medical products, pesticides and animal health items, accusing 
management of depriving shareholders by ignoring its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home is also seeking to strike anti-takeover defenses from Wayne, 
N.J.-based American Cyanamid's charter. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stafford, American Home's chairman and chief executive, met with American 
Cyanamid Chairman Albert Costello on Sunday, according to a letter released by 
American Home. American Home set the Aug. 16 deadline for American Cyanamid to 
accept the $100-a-share offer and an Aug. 19 deadline for a definitive merger 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Costello, Stafford said, "While we have always believed that 
our $95-per-share offer represented a full and fair price . . . we were willing 
to propose an increase of that price to $100 on the basis of our belief that 
such an increase would permit us to reach agreement and proceed rapidly to 
conclude a transaction supported by both companies." 
</P>
<P>
 "If our proposal is not accepted by your board of directors, we will proceed 
with our pending tender offer at $95 per share," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products closed at $59, up 75 cents on the New York Stock 
Exchange. American Cyanamid fell $2 to $90.875.

6% AUTO RATE HIKE PROPOSED TO AID QUAKE-DEVASTATED FIRM; INSURANCE: STATE 
AGENCY, CONSUMER GROUPS ENDORSE PLAN TO BOLSTER 20TH CENTURY'S TWO UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual proposal to bolster the capital of earthquake-ravaged 20th 
Century Industries' two insurance units, the state Insurance Department, 20th 
Century and two consumer advocacy groups have together endorsed a temporary 6% 
increase in the companies' auto insurance rates, effective Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, negotiated late last week and subject to approval by an 
administrative law judge and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, would 
generate an additional $54 million in annual auto premiums for Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co. and its sister, 21st Century Casualty 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal -- an apparently unprecedented aspect -- 20th Century 
would deposit $1 million of its surplus in Oakland-area banks to help promote 
economic development there and would contribute $50,000 directly to support 
nonprofit community activities, according to Selwyn Whitehead, president of the 
Oakland-based Economic Empowerment Foundation, which negotiated that part of 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated $685 million in claims costs from the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake have depleted 20th Century's capital to the point that "there was 
concern about the company's solvency," Insurance Department spokeswoman Elena 
Stern said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, 20th Century would get the 6% rate increase until its 
surplus -- or cushion against losses -- reached the level of one-third of its 
premiums for two consecutive months. Currently, the insurer's surplus is only 
about one-fifth of annual premiums. Once that threshold was reached, the rate 
increase would drop to 3% above current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century had originally requested a 9.2% auto rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rosenfield, author of the Proposition 103 insurance rate-cutting 
initiative approved by California voters in 1988, criticized the proposal as 
"deeply flawed." He said it would require 20th Century's auto insurance 
customers to "make a forced investment in the company to maintain its solvency" 
but would deny them any return on that investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield's Proposition 103 Enforcement Project requested a formal hearing on 
the proposal before it is approved. Administrative Law Judge Michael Jacobs 
scheduled the hearing for Aug. 25 at the Insurance Department offices in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehead in turn criticized Rosenfield for trying to thwart the agreement, 
saying that his organization "seems to want to play the sole leadership role in 
representing consumers against insurers." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Whitehead's organization, the other advocacy group that negotiated the 
proposal was San Diego-based Utilities Consumer Action Network. Its director, 
Michael Shames, said the proposal benefits consumers by keeping 20th Century -- 
consistently among the least expensive California insurers -- from shutting 
down or being swallowed up by another company.

 The Presley Companies: The Newport Beach home builder reported second-quarter 
profit of $989,000, or 2 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of $15.6 
million, or 84 cents a share, for the comparable period a year ago. Sales 
increased 5%, to $56.8 million from $54.2 million.For the six-month period, a 
profit of $2.5 million, or 4 cents a share, was recorded, contrasted with a 
year-ago net loss of $18.8 million, or $1.02 a share. Sales rose 21%, to $122 
million from $100.6 million. The company said the results are based on the 
retroactive effect as of Jan. 1, 1994, of a capital restructuring and 
quasi-reorganization, which resulted in a reduction of the book value of the 
company's real estate assets and liabilities.

$4.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate Group Inc.: The Newport Beach real estate development 
services company said it lost $4.5 million, or 11 cents a share, for the second 
quarter, compared to a loss of $3.5 million, or 9 cents a share, for the like 
period last year. The 1993 quarter included $1.9 million of income from 
discontinued operations.Revenue jumped to $4.8 million from $900,000. The 
company attributed the revenue increase primarily to operations of the domestic 
real estate development business acquired from the Koll Co. in September, 1993, 
as well as sales from a residential project in New Hampshire. For the first 
half, the company had a net loss of $8.5 million, or 20 cents a share. That 
compares with a year-ago net loss of $41.9 million, or $1.05 a share, which 
included a charge of $36 million for an accounting change. Revenue rose to $8.2 
million from $1.1 million.

 If the Rams leave Orange County, the Anaheim Hilton may well find itself with 
a few more open rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hilton says that it's one of only 13 Hiltons in the chain that are 
officially recognized this season by the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, it is the overnight home to traveling NFL officials, and it 
occasionally hosts NFL teams coming to face the Rams, like the Washington 
Redskins and Detroit Lions last season. 
</P>
<P>
 It has amenities that gridiron stars can appreciate, like the sports and 
fitness center. And, teams that can spare the time from flight schedules might 
like to visit the Rams cheerleaders, who sometimes show up for "Monday Night 
Football" promotions in the bar, according to Hilton staff.

HOME-SELLING AIDS INCLUDE COMPUTERIZED HOT LINE

 Talking houses are only one of a number of high-tech tools being used in the 
Southern California real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, for example, a company called Hotline to Hot Properties 
offers a computer-operated, toll-free phone service to nearly 100,000 real 
estate brokers nationwide.Prospective buyers can call to hear more about homes 
they see listed in newspaper advertisements or on yard signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A talking house is very limited -- it's only for drive-by shoppers," said 
Bradley Cheatum, founder of Hotline to Hot Properties. "You have to pull up to 
the property in your car and tune in your radio." 
</P>
<P>
 With the hot line, by contrast, the prospective buyer dials an 800 number, 
then punches the four-digit code for the home in which he or she is interested. 
The real estate agent is notified each time an inquiry is made about a 
particular property and can follow up on the call -- the system has a "call 
capture" function that records the caller's number by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Amstadter, a Corona del Mar broker for Orange County homes priced at 
more than $500,000, points out that prospective buyers using the hot line can 
also shop while they drive, simply by using their car phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people want information, they want it now," she said. "They don't want 
it later." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the hot line only six weeks, Amstadter has closed two home sales, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 15 properties she now has listed advertise the toll-free phone 
number on the signs out front, Amstadter said. "If I can't be on the cutting 
edge of real estate, then I'm going to fall behind." DEBORA VRANA

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION RISES IN JULY; ECONOMY: FED GOES INTO POLICY MEETING WITH 
INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO FURTHER RATE HIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 14th consecutive monthly increase in production at the nation's factories, 
mines and utilities offered Federal Reserve Board policy-makers a last bit of 
evidence Monday to justify pushing interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the Fed . . . a little nudge" a day before today's policy meeting, 
said economist Laurence H. Meyer, a St. Louis consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's industrial production index rose a modest 0.2% in July, following a 
robust 0.5% gain the month before. The gain was stronger than predicted and 
would have been twice as large if not for a decline in electricity generation 
from an unusually high level in June and a strike at heavy equipment 
manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer and other analysts expect the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open 
Market Committee, meeting today, to view the report as another reason to 
implement a fifth increase in short-term interest rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Between February and May, the committee raised the rate that banks charge each 
other for overnight loans to 4.25% from 3%. It will probably increase the rate 
by at least a quarter of a percentage point and perhaps by half a point, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed is determined to demonstrate its zeal as an inflation fighter," said 
economist Sandra Shaber of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 She anticipated the rate increase even though inflation appears under control. 
Through July, consumer prices rose at a rate that, if continued, would match 
last year's 2.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, analysts said, is trying to keep the economy from overheating before 
inflation starts to accelerate. In so doing, it hopes to restrain the rise in 
long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates, which are set in financial 
markets rather than by the Fed directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial plants in July operated at 83.9% of capacity, the same as last 
month but up from 81.3% a year earlier and only nine-tenths of a percentage 
point below the pre-recession peak reached in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating rates were particularly high for industries manufacturing materials 
used in a wide variety of goods: primary metals such as steel, 92.2%; paper 
products, 92.7%, and petroleum products, 93.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, production rose 0.4% at factories after edging 0.1% higher in June. 
It fell 0.9% at mines and oil wells after a 0.3% increase. And it dropped 1.2% 
at utilities after soaring 5.2% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 Production of consumer goods rose 0.4% despite a 2.3% drop in the output of 
autos and trucks. Production of appliances, televisions and other durable goods 
designed to last three or more years was strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Although held back by continuing weakness in aircraft manufacturing, business 
equipment production advanced 0.5%, led by information-processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's overall industrial production index was 5.6% higher than a year 
earlier. Among factories alone, it was up 6.3%. Capacity Utilization

 'Aladdin' Added: Disneyland has updated one of its oldest -- and most 
simplistic -- rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Storybook Land Canal Boats," which small children will instantly 
recognize as the ride in which slow-moving boats are swallowed by Monstro the 
whale, has added scenes from the animated movies "Aladdin" and "The Little 
Mermaid." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride, which debuted with the opening of the park in 1955, women dressed 
as girls in white knee socks give a guided tour past miniature villages. The 
villages depict scenes from such classic stories as "Cinderella," "The Three 
Little Pigs" and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, added to the list are the gold-leafed, onion-shaped domes of the Sultan's 
royal palace from "Aladdin." There is also the marketplace where Aladdin dodged 
the Sultan's guards and met the princess. The lamp? It's in the "Cave of 
Wonders," surrounded by the usual gold booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Also added were Prince Eric's castle from "The Little Mermaid" and the willow 
tree where Ursula the Sea Witch hangs out.

 More People Flying: Southwest Airlines reports that Orange County is exceeding 
its expectations for passenger growth, and it would like to start additional 
flights at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the airline boarded 45,572 passengers at John Wayne, a 21% increase 
over 37,727 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Burke, spokeswoman for Dallas-based Southwest, said the increase is a 
response to the spreading reputation of the airline's low fares. Southwest was 
the first low-fare airline to start service at John Wayne when it began in May 
with 15 daily flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our second full month of service, so we are going to see a learning 
curve as customers see we are convenient and affordable," she said.

NO SIGN OF SLIDE, BUT MYSTIC HILLS' FATE NOT SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No direct evidence of an ancient landslide has been discovered in the 
fire-ravaged Mystic Hills neighborhood, according to a city geological report 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report said enough slope instability was found to potentially 
cost some homeowners a lot of money to rebuild their destroyed homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 14 homes were burned, geologists studied the soil on 21 parcels, 
believing that's how many might require shoring up to stabilize the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said 16 of the lots could, despite the apparent absence of an 
underground landslide, still require expensive stabilization before rebuilding 
can take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists emphasized that neighboring property owners need to develop a joint 
plan to strengthen the land rather than working independently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very complex situation," said Hannes Richter, a geotechnical engineer 
for Geofirm, one of three consultants hired to study the area. "Some of these 
homeowners will need to work cooperatively to settle conditions in their 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said building permit applications will be reviewed on an 
individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 44 building permits have issued citywide since the disastrous firestorm 
destroyed or damaged more than 400 homes last Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mystic Hills, residents saw their hopes for prompt rebuilding come to an 
abrupt halt when geological surveys in May indicated that their neighborhood 
could be resting on an ancient landslide site. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report raised mixed feelings for Mystic Hills property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they finally released a report that will allow people to rebuild," 
said Polly Sloan, leader of the Mystic Hills Ancient Landslide Committee. "I 
hope every single person up there can now get a permit. But I suspect some 
people will find it so expensive, they can't rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was some argument among geologists over the existence and location of a 
suspected ancient landslide in the area, city officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But all agreed in the report that a "sheared zone" -- consisting of unstable, 
slide-prone surface material resting on a solid ground base -- runs through a 
section of the Mystic Hills neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Geofirm officials still believe, despite having no solid proof, that the 
ancient landslide exists, "but the bottom line, what residents have to deal 
with, is this sheared zone," Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will have a public meeting Saturday to discuss the report's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had conditionally allowed Mystic Hills residents who could prove 
their lots were stable to move ahead with construction. However, several 
homeowners and their geological consultants thought it wiser to wait until the 
report was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of waiting, Sloan is busily packing the belongings in the home she 
rented after the fire in preparation of a permanent move to Monarch Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always be a Lagunatic," she said. "But all this waiting has been more 
stressful than the fire was. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the fire burned us out, we knew what to do," Sloan said. "But this 
landslide stuff put us in the position of having all the control out of our 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Temple Hills residents learned from another geological study 
that their lots were above a old landslide site that was much smaller than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some property owners in Temple Hills will still be required to invest 
$50,000 or more in slope stabilization measures.

HUGE JUDGMENT AGAINST FARMERS IS OVERTURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has overturned a $58-million judgment against the 
Farmers Insurance Group of Companies and one of its members, reversing one of 
the largest jury awards in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled that Truck Insurance Exchange and 
its parent company, Farmers Insurance, were not obligated to cover an Orange 
County-based engineering firm, Marmac, its founder and four stockholders in a 
third-party lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, handed down last Thursday, reversed a 1991 Orange County jury 
verdict that Truck Insurance Exchange and Farmers acted in bad faith and 
committed "malice, fraud or oppression" toward the engineering firm and the 
others, who contended that their insurance company failed to honor a liability 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This completely vindicates the fundamental position of Farmers and Truck 
Insurance Exchange, members of Farmers Group, that there was no coverage 
provided for the alleged loss of the plaintiff and thus no basis whatsoever for 
the original judgment," John C. Millen, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance, said 
Monday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Ford III, who represents Marmac founder James R. Waller Jr., said 
the decision will be appealed to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain extremely confident that all of the numerous bases of bad faith and 
every penny of the award will ultimately be upheld," Ford said in a statement. 
He said he believes the appeals court erred in basing a large part of its 
decision on a relatively new appellate ruling that he described as "flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in 1986 when Waller sold his Marmac stock to four buyers. When 
an unhappy minority stockholder sued, alleging a conspiracy between Waller and 
the buyers, the defendants sought to finance their legal defense through their 
insurance by filing a claim. Waller was exonerated in a trial stemming from the 
initial lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the firm and officials said they were unable to get Farmers and 
Truck Insurance Exchange to honor their claim. They filed suit against their 
insurer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the end of a 10-week trial presided by Judge Byron K. McMillan in 
1991, an Orange County jury awarded $62 million, mostly in punitive damages, to 
the plaintiffs. A juror at the time said she hoped the verdict would serve as 
an example that "insurance companies have to look out for their policyholders." 
The judgment was later reduced to just over $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision, the appeals court cited previous rulings that say an 
insurer's duty to defend policyholders in lawsuits is not absolute, but depends 
on the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy. In Marmac's case, the 
court ruled that its insurance policy did not cover the liability claim being 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 The court reversed all the judgments and ordered the Superior Court to enter a 
judgment in favor of Truck Insurance Exchange and Farmers.

WITNESS TELLS HOW YOUTH WAS SPEARED IN HEAD; TESTIMONY: TRIAL BEGINS FOR TWO 
ACCUSED OF MURDER IN DEATH OF STEVE WOODS, 17. PROSECUTION CALLS ATTACK 
GANG-RELATED. DEFENSE CALLS IT AN ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A 15-year-old San Clemente High School student on Monday quietly recalled her 
horror last October when a confrontation at a beach ended with her friend being 
speared through the head with a paint roller rod, an injury that would 
ultimately claim his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Christianne Malberg testified that she and Steve Woods, 17, were sitting side 
by side in a friend's car as they tried to flee a group of young men who pelted 
their vehicle with bottles and other items. She heard shattering glass and 
realized Woods was no longer moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I glanced over at him," Malberg said, looking down at her fidgeting 
hands as she responded to questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer. "I saw 
it hanging out of his head. . . . He didn't make a sound. He was slouched over. 
I screamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a San Clemente High School student, died 25 days after the Oct. 15, 
1993, incident, which apparently grew out of dispute between his friends who 
had gone to Calafia Beach County Park to party and drink beer and a group of 
other teen-agers the prosecution contends were gang members or gang associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Malberg was the first witness called in the non-jury trial of Hector Penuelas, 
17, and Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, two of six young men charged in Woods' 
killing. Three others face trial, while the sixth defendant has pleaded guilty 
to voluntary manslaughter and awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has stirred angry protests and revealed racial divisions in a beach 
community where crime and gang violence is still scarce. Many Latinos say the 
case has helped resurrect racial stereotypes and question whether police and 
community response would have been the same if the victim had been a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys Dennis McNerney and Duane T. Neary say they chose to allow 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey to decide the teen-agers' 
innocence or guilt because they do not believe a jury could fairly assess the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "All (the jury) would have to hear is 'Mexican' and 'gang member' and it would 
all be over," McNerney said outside of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer told the judge the incident began when teen-ager Sterling Breckenridge 
was leaving the park. He mistakenly believed he recognized some of the reputed 
gang members and asked them about a party later that night in San Juan 
Capistrano. That seemingly innocent comment set off the reputed gang members, 
whose rivals are from that area, Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our position this is a gang-related attack all starting from the mere 
mention of San Juan," Paer told the judge. "These victims did not provoke 
anyone. Their biggest crime was being at that beach at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Breckenridge testified that one of the young men -- possibly one of the 
defendants -- quickly approached his car and punched him twice in the head. 
Breckenridge said that he then drove back to his friends in the parking lot and 
told them to leave because "a bunch of Mexicans" were starting trouble nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 When the teen-agers left in a caravan of three cars, the assailants began 
throwing rocks, bottles and other items at the cars, including the paint roller 
rod, which pierced Woods' skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer has declined to say which of the six defendants threw the paint roller, 
but he told the judge during his opening remarks that he believes Penuelas and 
Bonilla aided and abetted Woods' death because they participated in the 
assault. It will be up to Dickey to decide whether the youths are guilty of 
murder as charged, and if so, what degree is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 McNerney told the judge during his opening statement that the defendants 
believed they were about to be attacked -- even believing they were going to be 
run over as the teen-agers drove out of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, the defendants exchanged "high fives" and laughed, Paer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was any high-fiving, they had no idea Steve Woods was about to die," 
McNerney said, calling the case an "extreme, horrible coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is basically an accident, based on a misunderstanding by both sides that 
there was going to be a fight," the defense attorney said. "It doesn't amount 
to murder."

 Disneyland on Monday celebrated the 100th birthday of the little engine that 
could -- a vintage steam locomotive that's graced railroad tracks since 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 Steam Train No. 3 is one of four engines that make up the Disneyland 
Railroad.The railroad transports passengers around the park, with stops on Main 
Street, New Orleans Square, Mickey's Toontown and Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was brought to Disneyland in 1957. Before that, it was used to 
transport sugar cane from the Godchaux Sugar Co. in rural Louisiana to the port 
in New Orleans, said Disney spokesman John McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney executives in the 1950s had a special fondness for trains, and company 
founder Walt Disney even had a small train in his back yard, McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the engine was purchased by Disney, it was brought to Disney's Burbank 
studios, where designers restored it.  
</P>
<P>
 Former Disney animator Ward Kimball was on hand for Monday's 
celebration.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; RESIDENTS COMPLAIN ABOUT TRASH BIN FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some residents are trashing the new $25 fee the city is charging them to place 
rubbish bins on residential streets and other public rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fee went into effect in July, a dozen residents have complained to 
Madelene Arakelian, the owner of the Irvine-based South Coast Refuse Corp. and 
Integrated Recycling Systems, where the bins are rented. 
</P>
<P>
 Arakelian said he was losing business because of the fee. "People call up and 
ask how much we rent for. We tell them the price, then the fee, and they say, 
'Forget it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Morris, the city's public services director, said the fee was imposed as 
part of a cost-recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never a good time to raise fees to cover overhead," he said. "But the 
city isn't making any money -- we're losing money." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said it costs the city every time it sends inspectors out to ensure 
that the movable bins have reflectors on them when they're placed in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't, then motorists could run into them in the dark, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels on some of the heavier bins, Morris said, can ruin streets by 
sinking into the asphalt on hot days. 
</P>
<P>
 So inspectors must double-check that they're placed in just the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 If residents want to avoid the fee, they should place the bins in their 
driveways, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arakelian, however, would like to see the new fee tacked onto only the 
40-cubic-yard size bins and not the smaller, 3-cubic-yard models.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see something more reasonable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said the city has never charged for inspection fees in the past and he 
didn't think the fee was too high for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city is liable for any damages the large bins might cause, and 
that is another reason behind the new fee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arakelian said she thinks the city is just trying to bring in extra 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a damage claim filed by the city in 18 years," she said. "I 
think the fee is too excessive." TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY MOVING TO HOLD DOWN NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing Thursday to gauge community 
reaction to the city's first comprehensive noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, efforts to regulate noise have been made through ordinances 
governing other matters, such as public nuisance and construction permits, 
planner Patricia Temple said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do not perceive noise in the same way. Some people are very sensitive, 
others are almost oblivious. So you're regulating to an objective standard," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance is designed to reduce current and foreseeable noise 
problems, with specific attention to leaf blowers and air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is a problem where we have a lot of really small lots with short 
setbacks," on which air conditioners can't be enclosed as they could with 
bigger properties, Temple said. "If there's only one place to put it and it's 
in a 3-foot side yard and it's next to someone's bedroom window, that's a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan would classify properties in the city as residential, commercial 
or industrial and assign acceptable noise limits for each. Under the 
regulations, daytime is 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., nighttime is 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 New policies under consideration include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring new air conditioning units to have noise levels lower than 55 
decibels at the property line, or 65 decibels if the property owner gets 
written consent from affected neighbors; existing units will be allowed to 
operate at 65 decibels until Jan. 1, 2000. (An average automatic dishwasher 
operates at about 60 decibels.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Adding noise from leaf blowers, lawn mowers and chain saws to the list of 
noise complaints to be fielded by police. Calls about barking dogs, loud 
parties, construction and remodeling already are answered by police. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coordinating noise enforcement efforts by police and code inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assessing a development fee to pay for construction of traffic noise 
barriers where the project is likely to generate new traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a threshold level for noise from home remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limiting the amount of noise that in-home work or hobby activities may 
generate without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consideration by the city of noise issues before issuing new charter boat 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple said that there has been little community opposition to the plan. HOLLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; TWO GOLF COURSES, BILLBOARDS ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider proposals that would privatize its two 
municipal golf courses, strengthen its smoking ordinance and overturn a 
25-year-old ban on freeway billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles firm, Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc., has proposed putting up 
10 freeway billboards. Up to 60 feet above the roadway, the signs would be up 
to 950 square feet and at least 500 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards would be scattered throughout the city, but Regency's proposal 
also includes installing four signs at the junction of the Orange and Riverside 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has shot down four billboard proposals by the company in the last 
decade. The last billboard sign proposal was defeated in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of freeway billboards, which include the city Planning Department, 
argue the signs would diminish freeway appearances and could ruin $1-million 
freeway landscaping projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also is scheduled to decide whether to privatize H.G. Dad Miller 
and Anaheim Hills golf courses. Supporters say it will create additional 
revenue for the city, while opponents say the city would be losing control of a 
valuable asset. 
</P>
<P>
 City analysts have recommended against privatization. They said financial 
benefits from having a private company operate the courses are minimal and do 
not justify the risk of losing control of the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council also will weigh a proposal by Councilman Irv 
Pickler to tighten city smoking regulations. Pickler wants city laws to match a 
more restrictive 1993 county smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while Anaheim allows smoking in film theater lobbies and in 
privately rented areas and concourses in public buildings, the county does not. 
The county law applies only to county facilities and unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack White has warned council members that more restrictions on 
smoking may eventually cost the city needed revenue. Some conventioneers may 
refuse to visit Anaheim if smoking is regulated further, especially at Anaheim 
Stadium or the Convention Center, White said. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALLS COMMITTEE MAY SUE BANKHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Fullerton Recalls Committee said Monday that they hope to sue 
recalled Councilman Don Bankhead in an effort to keep him from being elected to 
a four-year City Council term in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee chairman Thomas S. Babcock said a suit will be filed if a Superior 
Court judge rules today that the committee may recover its legal fees -- 
totaling about $10,000 -- in a recent lawsuit it won to force a special recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get our legal fees back, we will have money to sue Bankhead," Babcock 
said. "We feel that when the people removed him from office, it was intended to 
remove him until November, 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead and two other members of the council, Molly McClanahan and Mayor A.B. 
(Buck) Catlin, who were recalled in June, have been prohibited from running in 
the October special election to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead submitted candidacy papers Friday to run for the council in the 
general election, which is not affected by the special recall election, City 
Atty. R.K. (Kerry) Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead, whose term expires in 1996, may legally run in the general election 
because it is not meant to replace him, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But recalls committee members disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't have the opportunity to run and take a seat on a governing body 
that the voters removed him from until the end of his term," Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead said: "I think it's ridiculous. Every person that qualifies in this 
country has the right to run for public office. I certainly don't think I 
violated any law that would prohibit me from running for office." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is seeking office "because I care about what happens to the city of 
Fullerton."MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SENIOR CENTER SEEKS DONATIONS OF FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The food pantry is almost bare. 
</P>
<P>
 And donations are needed to stock up on the emergency food supply at the 
Senior Outreach Center on Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give to the elderly who are short on money after paying their bills," said 
Betsy Crimi, human services coordinator at the Senior Outreach Center, which 
offers the service for low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A key source for the center's food bank are donations from schools, but 
because schools are shut for the summer, the food supply is running short. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimi said the center will coordinate canned food drives in September with 
students at Ethel Dwyer Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts of protein-based items, such as chunky soups and peanut butter, are the 
most sought after. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the center can use canned fruits and vegetables, Jell-O and 
crackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cereal, rice and dry beans are also needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimi, who coordinates services for frail and elderly people, said that many 
seniors live on tight budgets and need the food to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really tides people over. It gives them the relief they need until their 
next check comes in," Crimi said. "They appreciate it and are very grateful to 
have a pantry available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people receiving emergency food are on our caseload, and we 
see them on a weekly or monthly basis," Crimi said, adding that some 15 seniors 
regularly use the emergency food service each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are other low-income seniors who just drop by occasionally when 
they need a few extra groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep it rather low key, and we want to make sure the persons are really in 
need," she said. "The system hasn't been abused." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senior Outreach Center, 1718 Orange Ave., is open Monday through Friday 
from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; REFUSAL TO SELL BEER FOLLOWED BY MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took more than 20 police officers to quell a fracas that broke out Sunday 
night after a store clerk refused to sell beer to a man she thought was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people were arrested on various charges after battling with police in the 
parking lot of a Smith's Food and Drug Center on Harbor Boulevard about 9:30 
p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three officers suffered minor injuries, including one with a broken hand, Lt. 
John Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk refused to sell a 12-pack of beer to customer Manuel Tellez, 36, of 
Garden Grove, after he became unruly because his automatic teller machine card 
failed to work at the cash register, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Screaming profanities, Tellez was escorted from the store by a security guard 
and then began shoving the guard, according to store manager Glen Borst. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Tellez's relatives and friends joined in fighting with the guard 
outside and then attacked the first two police officers who showed up, Woods 
said. More than 20 additional officers were called in to handle the fight amid 
a crowd that grew quickly to an estimated 150 people on the busy street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did attract quite a crowd. A lot . . . gathered and were taunting the 
people to fight with the officers," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police eventually used pepper spray to quiet the melee, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Booked into Orange County Jail were Tellez, 36, Ida Tellez, 45, Raymond 
Escalante, 50, Richard Escalante, 26, and Harvey Escalante, 22, Woods said. 
Charges against the five included assault, assault on a police officer and 
resisting arrest. Police did not know whether those arrested were related. 
</P>
<P>
 Borst said business was back to normal at the supermarket on Monday and there 
were no plans to beef up security. "It's business as usual," he said.KEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS OPEN HEARINGS ON BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without a budget deficit to manage, Orange County government officials open 
hearings today in better financial shape than at any time in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county library system is still looking for an additional $10 
million to maintain its operations through next year, the trouble does not seem 
to compare to 12 months ago when state officials raided local government 
coffers for $148 million in property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen worse times," county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron said 
Monday. "I think the state forced us to do a certain amount of downsizing that 
has forced us to live within our means." 
</P>
<P>
 Living within its means has required the county to slice about 2,000 positions 
from various departments in the past three years. Only about 100 of the job 
cuts resulted in layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, county officials are preparing a $3.5-billion budget that 
provides about the same level of funding as last year. But some departments are 
expected to get boosts in staffing -- funded predominantly through state and 
federal grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Care Agency, among the first county departmental budgets scheduled 
for review today by the Board of Supervisors, has requested continued funding 
for 51 employees added last year. More than three dozen of those employees were 
hired to manage tuberculosis care after local outbreaks were reported. The 
remainder have been providing nutrition programs for children and pregnant 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's proposed $235-million budget provides for a range of services, 
from disease control and immunization services to general health education, 
mental health and drug abuse services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can let our guard down on tuberculosis," Steiner said, 
adding that he was supportive of the agency's request. "I'm not getting any 
signals from the health care community. I think they are pretty satisfied with 
what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single personnel increase -- 123 workers -- is being proposed for 
the county Social Services Agency. Officials have said the increase is needed 
because of rising caseloads of welfare, Medi-Cal and food stamp 
recipients.KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; KICKOFF PLANNED FOR UNITED WAY DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disneyland, Rockwell, Motorola and six other prominent county businesses plan 
to kick off the United Way's annual fund-raising drive by collecting $544,000 
in donations in the next month from their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pacesetter" drive is set to run through Sept. 15, the day before the 
United Way's official fund-raising campaign begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The "pre-campaign" is designed to generate interest in the United Way and set 
the pace for donations from other companies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking part in the Pacesetter drive are the Ernst & Young accounting firm 
and the Mervyn's department store in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way has named Roy Brown to head this year's campaign. Brown is an 
accountant and area managing partner of Ernst & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's campaign raised $19 million. The money went to benefit more than 
100 health, human services and nonprofit agencies in the county. United Way 
funds have been allocated to a variety of agencies from child-care providers to 
food banks.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; STREET LIGHT PANEL WANTS TO DISBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizen panel created this month by the City Council to study the city's 
street lighting system may be dissolved before it begins work. 
</P>
<P>
 The council today will consider a request by members of the special committee 
on street lighting that the panel be disbanded because its work would cause an 
"undue burden" on city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees would be called upon to prepare and publish the agenda for all 
committee meetings as required by the Brown Act, the state law that governs 
public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be taking time away from more pressing duties for city employees, 
committee members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Ray Litrell, a committee member, said the group had decided 
to review the street lighting issue as private individuals. The other committee 
members are Jack Schild and Tom Petrosine. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Southern California Edison Co. and the city sit on the 
committee as non-voting members. 
</P>
<P>
 The council created the committee Aug. 2 to investigate, among other things, 
whether Edison was charging the city twice for some streets lights -- once at a 
flat rate and again at a metered rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was also expected to look into reports that the city may be 
paying for street lights outside city limits, and into complaints that current 
street lighting fees are not fair to all residents.BERT ELJERA

<P>
 With Mayor Frank Kessler deciding not to seek reelection, the deadline for 
filing candidacy papers for mayor has been extended until 5 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Carolyn Morris said three candidates have so far filed papers: 
Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater, Al Snook, an insurance broker, and Kelly 
Sherwood, an engineering assistant.The mayor holds office for a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said he has been frustrated with City Council members whose "egos have 
prevented this council to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that despite his objections, the council decided to withdraw from the 
California League of Cities, leaving the city "an island within a county with 
no interaction with other cities, and therefore no progress." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for new faces with new ideas," Kessler said. "It is time for a 
council that can put their political ambitions aside and start working for good 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler, 65, was Garden Grove police chief for 13 years. He was elected to the 
council in 1988 and won as mayor in 1990. He was a police officer in Tucson, 
Ariz., for 20 years before his appointment as police chief in 1976. BERT ELJERA

WINDS TAKE SOME OF THE SIZZLE OUT OF HEAT WAVE; WEATHER: TEMPERATURES REACHED 
THE 90S IN MANY PLACES, BUT A STRONG AFTERNOON SEA BREEZE BROUGHT A MEASURE OF 
RELIEF. SLIGHT COOLING IS FORECAST. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County suffered through another steamy summer day Monday, with some 
welcome relief coming to the coast in the form of a strong afternoon wind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest spot was Lake Forest, which reached 97 degrees. Irvine sizzled at 
94, Anaheim was 93, and Santa Ana and Laguna Beach both saw highs of 91. The 
thermometer peaked at 84 degrees in Dana Point and was a relieving 78 in 
Newport. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest Aug. 15 in Santa Ana history was in 1920, when it was 94 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters suggested that the best chance of any real relief soon will 
probably be at the ocean, and hundreds of thousands of people took them at 
their word and headed for county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Local lifeguards said surf was smaller Monday than over the weekend, and that 
a strong wind helped cool the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind blew everybody off the beach this afternoon. There's very few people 
left compared to yesterday," Newport Beach Marine Safety Lt. Eric Bauer said 
about 4 p.m. Monday. "The wind put a lot of sand in everybody's sandwiches." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Marine Safety Lt. Steve Seim said waves of only four feet -- 
about half of the weekend swell -- and the fact that community college students 
are heading back to school this week meant shrunken crowds Monday compared to 
Saturday and Sunday. But the water was still warm, and plenty of people were 
around to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight "cooling trend" is scheduled to develop today and Wednesday, with 
temperatures of mid-70s along the coast and mid-90s inland, according to Curtis 
Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still expecting a cooling trend over the next few days," Brack said. 
"The high pressure that's over California is going to weaken a little bit and 
we'll finally develop a little more marine layer, a little offshore breeze, and 
some clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you guys want some relief, go to the mountains," Brack added. "They're 
getting lots of rain." 
</P>
<P>
 While no records were broken here, the 98 degrees registered in downtown Los 
Angeles topped the old mark of 96 set in 1885, and triple-digit temperatures 
hit several locations in Southern California. Van Nuys and Ontario registered 
100 and Newhall reached 101, while it topped out at 102 in Riverside, 104 in 
Lancaster and 107 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Record or not, crowds still gathered at the beach -- and complained about the 
heat, lifeguards said. Laguna had about 15,000 beach-goers, according to 
lifeguard Christian Corbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hot in the morning, but when the wind started blowing it cooled down a 
little bit," Corbo said. "I've been sitting inside all day, so for me it was 
nice."

MARINA PACT RENEWAL MAY HIT A SNAG; BOATING: SUPERVISORS RILEY AND STEINER 
OPPOSE PROPOSAL THAT COUNTY FORGIVE $200,000 IN BACK RENT. NEW LEASE OUTLINES 
$10-MILLION DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A $10-million development plan and lease extension for Sunset Marina in Sunset 
Beach could run into opposition at the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
today, as two supervisors say they will not forgive $200,000 in rent owed the 
county as a condition of the new lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to his colleagues, Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley 
said Monday that marina operators Goldrich & Kest of Culver City should have to 
pay the back rent before such a lease extension is granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If G&K is willing to accept this change . . . we believe it is advantageous 
to begin formal negotiations and return the lease for consideration," Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner also signed the letter, which was circulated to 
board members Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's consideration comes after the county Harbors, Beaches and Parks 
Commission voted late last month to offer G&K a 35-year lease extension. The 
firm has operated the marina since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the proposal before the supervisors, which would replace the 
current lease set to expire in 1999, the county would spend $4.4 million on 
improvements to the marina, including an interpretive kiosk, landscaping and 
trails. It also would forgive $200,000 owed by the management company in back 
rent. In exchange, G&K would spend $5.5 million to expand the number of boat 
slips from 276 to 341, increase dry boat storage from 97 to 241 spaces and 
increase the number of parking spaces from 190 to 280. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lease proposal comes to the board despite a county policy which states 
that such contracts, whenever feasible, should be allowed to expire and then 
put out to competitive bid. But county officials have said that the new 
agreement, if approved, would more than double the annual revenue from the 
marina over the next several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of the county earning additional revenue through renegotiation of 
existing contracts is one exception to the rebid policy. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt to extend G&K's lease was put off three years ago when it was 
disclosed that Lee E. Wieder, the son of Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, whose 
district includes the marina, worked as a lobbyist for G&K. At the time, G&K's 
maintenance record at the marina had been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have said Wieder's son is no longer involved and maintenance 
is no longer a problem.

FIRE AT CHAPEL IN ANAHEIM CALLED WORK OF ARSONIST; CRIME: OFFICIALS SAY $50,000 
BLAZE AT FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH'S HISTORIC BUILDING MIGHT BE RELATED TO A 
STRING OF BREAK-INS AT LOCAL CHURCHES.

<P>
 A historic chapel was seriously damaged Sunday night by arson that 
investigators said might be connected to a recent spate of break-ins at local 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire gutted a choir office and Sunday school classroom and sent smoke 
throughout a 66-year-old adobe building, which is part of the First 
Congregational Church on State College Boulevard. Investigators estimated the 
damage at $50,000 to the Griffith House. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny chapel used for weddings and rented to smaller denominations suffered 
smoke damage but did not burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators said the 11:50 p.m. blaze apparently was set by someone who 
broke in and set fire to paper in the choir room. Food was stolen at another 
building on the church grounds -- the latest among a string of thefts at local 
churches in the past five weeks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely arson," Fire Investigator Ray McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities could not determine a motive for the blaze, which firefighters 
brought under control in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said this was the second fire in 14 months in the historic 
Griffith House building, listed among the city's historic buildings. A fire 
believed set by transients damaged a wooden floor on July 4, 1993, said Pastor 
Jim Schibsted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-member church owns the adobe house but meets in another building. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire Sunday was the latest in a string of thefts and break-ins at the 
church's complex at 515 N. State College Blvd., Schibsted said. Concern over 
security has prompted officials to cancel a planned sleep-over this Thursday by 
about 30 children who attend the church's summer day camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's just sick," said Teri Hettig, director of the preschool and day 
camp. "Who would do such a thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police are already investigating five other break-ins in the past five 
weeks at churches within a two-square-mile area. Pastors at two nearby churches 
have reported the theft of computers and audio equipment, Schibsted said . 
</P>
<P>
 The fire came as the church is beginning a $90,000 renovation of the complex. 
The incident will delay the work, but repairs will be made to the building, 
which was donated to the church in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The rambling Spanish-style house was listed as architecturally important in 
the city's 1980 survey of historic structures.

NIGHT FLIGHT EXERCISE DRAWS COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 90-minute flight exercise Monday night involving a squadron of jets about to 
be deployed on an aircraft carrier sparked a number of noise complaints to the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, a base spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They practiced landing like they will on the ship," said the officer, who 
asked not to be identified. "It's something that's a perishable skill. Landing 
on an aircraft carrier is not the easiest thing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no incidents during the exercise, the spokesman said, declining to 
say where the 12 planes will be deployed.

FAMALARO'S LAWYER LIKELY TO DROP EXTRADITION FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Arizona attorney for murder suspect John J. Famalaro said Monday that he 
will likely drop a challenge to extradition proceedings, paving the way for the 
37-year-old house painter's transfer to Orange County to be tried in the 
slaying of Denise Huber of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Thomas K. Kelly said the decision to drop the challenge would likely 
come by Aug. 29, the date when the issue is scheduled to be argued in a 
Prescott, Ariz., courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this would make it much easier for the state to move the case to 
California," Kelly said. "We have no objection to this case being tried in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The development comes as California authorities moved forward with proceedings 
that would force Famalaro's transfer to Orange County. On Friday, Gov. Pete 
Wilson's office began a review of the extradition papers signed by Newport 
Beach Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Kevin Herglotz said the extradition documents were still 
being reviewed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was arrested last month when Arizona authorities found Huber's 
preserved body inside a freezer in the driveway of his Prescott Country Club 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The painter is accused of kidnaping and murdering Huber and then carting 
around her nude, handcuffed body inside the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, a UC Irvine graduate, vanished June 3, 1991, after her tire blew out on 
the Corona del Mar Freeway as she headed home from a rock concert in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents and police launched a nationwide search, but Huber's whereabouts 
remained a mystery until Arizona law officers found her body inside a freezer 
locked in the back of stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber died from nearly a dozen blows to the head, according to an autopsy.

SOMEHOW, WOODSTOCK WAS PRETTY COOL; ALL THAT MUD WAS WORTH SOMETHING, EVEN IF 
THIS '94 VERSION DIDN'T DEFINE A GENERATION AND DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CONTEMPORARY 
ACTS -- LIKE NINE INCH NAILS. IT OFFERED A GOOD TIME AND MIGHT SPAWN FUTURE 
EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Look at that (expletive)," John Scher, co-producer of Woodstock '94, said 
forcefully backstage Sunday afternoon. He was pointing to a blimp flying over 
the festival grounds, advertising a major beer company to the more than 
quarter-million fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those (expletive). I turned their money down, and there they are with their 
(expletive) blimp," he said, explaining that festival directors had rejected 
millions of dollars in sponsorship offers by beer and tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 It felt good to Scher to be calling someone else names after all the names he 
had been called since plans for Woodstock '94 were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 To many in the rock world, the idea of another weekend festival violated the 
innocence and legacy of the original 1969 Woodstock, especially since it would 
be a $30-million affair with various sponsorship pacts and moneymaking side 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe all the (expletive) when we started out," Scher continued, 
sitting on a golf cart that he used to maneuver around the 840-acre site. "They 
said the tickets were too high . . . the concert rules too (restrictive). But 
that wasn't all. They also said, 'How dare you tamper with the Woodstock 
legacy?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the people who put on the first Woodstock were out to make money too. 
The only reason it turned into a free festival was that they didn't do it 
right. It's a miracle that everyone who went (to that festival) got through it 
all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure everything was done right this time and you know what? 
Take a look around -- we've got 350,000 people out there today and they're 
having the time of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride was evident in Scher's face as well-wishers stopped to congratulate him 
on recapturing some of the gentle spirit of the 1969 weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Trent Reznor, one of the leaders of the alternative rock scene that has 
long complained about the commercialization of the mainstream rock world, had 
praise for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway during a splendid set by his band Nine Inch Nails on Saturday night, 
Reznor looked out at the massive crowd -- from those colliding in the mosh pit 
in front of the stage to those in the tent village hundreds of yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this was going to suck," Reznor said. "But it was pretty cool." 
</P>
<P>
 And much of Woodstock '94 was cool. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little evidence that the festival will have anywhere near the 
musical and cultural impact of the original Woodstock, whose power was driven 
by a restless generation coming of age and the music that heralded their 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the quarrels with Woodstock '94 turned out to be on aesthetic 
grounds -- too few contemporary acts who could speak to the twentysomething 
audience with the eloquence and vision of the best of the original Woodstock 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
 In other regards, however, the festival earned high marks, despite the 
near-chaos that occurs when hundreds of thousands of fans are gathered in one 
place for three days, intent on having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, as when you hear about four deaths (two on the grounds because of 
pre-existing medical conditions and two others in a traffic accident on the way 
home) and the number of people treated in the medical tents (more than 1,500), 
you wonder if it's worth all the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking alone, with buses taking fans to and from parking lots up to 30 
miles away, proved nightmarish at times. Sunday evening there were estimates 
that it would take nearly 24 hours to get everyone back to the lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to most '60s and '70s festivals, however, Woodstock '94 was as smooth 
as a contemporary theme park, with considerable evidence of concern for the 
safety and comfort of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 This was due in part to both the efforts of concert organizers -- PolyGram 
Diversified Ventures, of which Scher is president, and Woodstock Ventures, 
headed by the men behind the original Woodstock -- and stringent state and 
local regulations governing large public gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 At press conferences through the weekend, some state authorities praised both 
the concert producers and the peacefulness of the audience. For the most part, 
fans too were enthusiastic as they began the long journey home Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean there will be a rash of festivals around the country? 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock '94 doesn't just mark the return of Woodstock, but also of the 
festival concept that was dismissed as a dinosaur a decade ago, its bones 
buried at Glen Helen Regional Park in Devore, Calif., site of the ill-fated US 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Scher, one of the nation's most prominent concert producers, said other 
promoters around the country are no doubt poised to experiment with festival 
concepts, but the jury is still out on the money issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Because fewer than 200,000 of the available 250,000 tickets were believed to 
have been sold, the concert part of the Woodstock '94 operation lost up to $7 
million. The goal is to make that up and add millions more on a documentary 
film and album, as well as other merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are more festivals, you can bet that there will be fans waiting. The 
word is already out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have read about what goes on at festivals," said one fatigued, 
mud-covered young man who had driven here from Philadelphia. "Now we have our 
own stories to tell."

JUST A KID FROM THE BLOCK; TINA MAJORINO IS BECOMING A FAMILIAR FACE ON THE BIG 
SCREEN. BUT, SAYS THE 'ANDRE' STAR, MOST PEOPLE 'THINK I'M THEIR NEXT-DOOR 
NEIGHBOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ESSOYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Tina Majorino tucks one leg under the other and leans back 
nonchalantly in her wicker chair. Ready for her interview, she blows her nose 
with a honk. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirited young actress, featured in three films opening within three 
months of each other, seems completely unfazed by her newfound celebrity 
status. Despite the glare of TV cameras at the posh Mauna Lani Bay Hotel, she 
comes across as natural and unaffected as the quintessential girl next door. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she says, she is often mistaken for just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know they have seen me somewhere, but they don't know where. They 
think I'm their next-door neighbor," she says, looking the part in faded 
overall shorts and a white top. "I don't tell them. I don't need them to know 
who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 People will find out soon enough. The four-foot actress won raves for her 
performance as the older daughter of an alcoholic mother in "When a Man Loves a 
Woman" this spring, and is likely to capture moviegoers' hearts starring with 
Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta in New Line's current comedy "Corrina, Corrina." 
She also stars in Paramount Pictures' "Andre," which opens Wednesday and is 
based on a true story about a seal that adopted a Maine family. 
</P>
<P>
 And she is now filming her fourth movie, Universal's epic adventure, 
"Waterworld," opposite none other than Kevin Costner, on the island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tina's a major talent, no doubt about it," says Keith Carradine, who plays 
her father in "Andre." "There's a certain focus she has that belies her age. 
She's a very centered, very focused little girl. It's amazing to me that 
someone who's nine can be so sure of what she wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Majorino says she has wanted to be an actress "since I was 2 or 3." Her mother 
lined up singing and dancing lessons, and Majorino appeared in her first TV 
commercial at age 3 1/2. She also took part in neighborhood plays, but it took 
some persuasion before Sarah Majorino allowed her daughter to pursue 
professional acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I begged and begged and begged her," Majorino explains, her clear blue eyes 
widening. "I just think it's fun. Being able to do what you don't get to do at 
your own house, being somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 She landed the role of Sophie in the ABC series "Camp Wilder" in 1992. Since 
then, it's been a feature-film whirlwind for Majorino, who won't even turn 10 
until February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met Tina and we didn't even have her read for us; we knew she was it," 
says Annette Handley, "Andre's" producer. "There's nothing self-conscious about 
her. . . . She has the wisdom of a much older person." 
</P>
<P>
 Majorino says she was inspired watching "The Wizard of Oz" over and over as a 
youngster, and acting became a passion. "It's work, but it's work that I love," 
she says. "I really feel like I'm going to be an actress for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 When not filming, she attends school in the San Fernando Valley, playing 
roller hockey in the neighborhood with her brother Kevin, 14, and looking after 
her dog, Angus. On location, the fourth-grader must keep up with her schoolwork 
as well as her lines, but her colleagues say she is always well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a real pro, in the best sense of the word," Carradine says. "Some child 
actors are pros in the worst sense of the world. Suddenly life is consumed with 
'Where do I get my next job?' and 'Call my agent.' It doesn't seem to have 
changed Tina. . . . She seems to be well-rounded. Her folks should take a lot 
of credit for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Majorino's family does strive mightily to keep her life in balance. "It's a 
big challenge," acknowledges her mother, who accompanies her on all sets. Her 
father, Bob, owns a real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met a lot of stage mothers and a lot of child actors," says Handley, the 
producer. "This was Tina's dream, not Sarah's." Her mother is "very present, 
very protective, yet not overbearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of Majorino's roles this year has been demanding. She is slapped and is 
forced to parent her alcoholic mother in "When a Man Loves a Woman." In 
"Corrina, Corrina," her mother in the movie has died, and Majorino must display 
a vast range of emotions. Asked if her tears are real, Majorino seems almost 
insulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do cry, of course," she says. "I don't think of what I'm thinking; I 
think of what my character's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 But she acknowledges that the scenes she finds easiest are "the laughing and 
silly ones," like when she dances with Andre, the sea lion, on a boardwalk, or 
bounces high on a bed in "Corrina, Corrina." 
</P>
<P>
 After her interview, Majorino leaps into her mother's arms, wrapping her legs 
around her waist, to be carried away for a break. Surrounded by the luxury of 
the Mauna Lani resort, her tastes remain simple. Her choice of dessert when the 
options seem limitless? "A dish of vanilla ice cream," she says simply, "with 
nothing on it."

FELZ TO DIRECT TWO FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to keep municipal expenditures down, Fullerton Museum Center 
director Joe Felz will assume the additional duties of managing the city's 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center. Muckenthaler director Judith Peterson has been 
given a new job, overseeing recruitment and training of volunteers to work in 
every city department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is downsizing and reducing costs," said Susan Hunt, Fullerton's 
director of community services. The budget for Hunt's department, which 
includes the Museum Center and the Muckenthaler, was cut by about $200,000 in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 City support of the Muckenthaler has been decreasing in recent years as 
efforts toward eventual privatization of the facility continue. A private, 
nonprofit Muckenthaler Cultural Center Foundation would assume financial 
responsibility and management, alleviating Felz of many of his new duties 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muckenthaler's schedule of five exhibits a year would not change, 
according to Hunt, who said she expects the City Council to vote on the 
privatization by October.FULLERTON M

LAST CHANCE: FINAL THOUGHTS ON WOODSTOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Altamont Factor: The first major attempt to hold another Woodstock-like 
celebration was at a race track in Altamont, Calif., on Dec. 6, 1969, and it 
ended in ugly violence, including the stabbing death of a young fan near the 
stage as the Rolling Stones were performing. The horror of a similar outbreak 
surfaced late Saturday night when a medical worker stopped in the press tent 
and told a reporter that a girl had been stomped to death in the mosh pit in 
front of the stage. The report proved false, but the possibility of tragedy 
caused a certain unease during the entire weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rumor Mill, Part I: If there are 250,000 people at a festival, there's a 
chance for 250,000 rumors. The first one, invariably, will involve some 
surprise act coming to the show -- normally an indication of who the fans 
really most want to see. Rumors of everyone from U2 to the Rolling Stones were 
common, but most frequently cited was Pearl Jam. A late entry Sunday was Guns 
N' Roses, but that may have been prompted by news that GNR guitarist Slash 
would be joining Paul Rodgers' rock revue on the smaller stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rumor Mill, Part II: The second most common musical rumor is that someone 
is going to give a surprise performance at some other site nearby. The 
alternative this time was the original Woodstock grounds in Bethel, about 60 
miles southwest. Pearl Jam again was the subject of most of these rumors, 
though Neil Young was also mentioned frequently. The idea in Young's case was 
that the veteran rocker, who turned down an offer to appear at Woodstock '94 
because he "didn't believe in it," was going to appear as part of the free 
Bethel concert. He didn't, but Melanie and Arlo Guthrie did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rumor Mill, Part III: There is a certain crowd intoxication in knowing you 
could be part of history by setting an attendance record. Once the crowd begins 
taking shape and the bodies stretch as far as the eye can see, the imagination 
begins running wild. Before there were even 100,000 people on the grounds, 
people began measuring the crowd at 300,000, then 500,000, and a million wasn't 
far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rain Factor: Besides the music itself, what most people will remember is 
roughing it. City-dwellers aren't used to sleeping on dirt and walking to 
portable toilets in the middle of the night, trying to step around thousands of 
bodies and tents. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing brings out the sense of adventure more than rain. Some fans will 
probably never even attempt to clean their mud-caked shoes; they'll just keep 
them as their own part of history. You can even imagine their showing up some 
day at a rock 'n' roll memorabilia sale, billed as genuine Woodstock '94 boots, 
complete with statement of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild Card: You never know what will emerge to give a festival its 
individuality. The wild card this time: mud. Most striking were the fans who 
covered themselves with the goo. Several artists saluted these Mud People from 
the stage. "Hi, Woodstock," Peter Gabriel told the audience Sunday night. "This 
is your festival. This is your mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans used the mud to write their names or other messages on one of the 
stage walls. And there was the inevitable flinging. During Green Day's show on 
the south stage, fans began good-naturedly throwing mud. Unable to resist, the 
group's lead singer Billy Joe started throwing gobs of it back. On Sunday 
morning a local couple even got married in the mud. What about a honeymoon? 
"This was our honeymoon," bride Linda Brandt, 30, told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Music, Stupid: Despite everything else going on, the reason for the 
festival is the music, and everyone walks away with favorite moments. For me, 
it was Nine Inch Nails on Saturday night. The band, whose industrial-rock sound 
is relentless and stark, came out covered with mud, in a salute to the most 
radical members of the audience, and put on a performance as triumphant as any 
of the legendary acts at Woodstock '69.

<P>
 Don't Forget a Camera: It's not cool in the rock world to be overly 
sentimental, but you could have made a fortune here by selling cameras. As the 
weekend drew to a close, fans began looking for souvenirs to take home, and 
what better than a picture of yourself at the site? Newspaper photographers 
were frequently asked if they would take a photo and send it to the fans. Even 
some journalists, many of whom came here quite cynical of the whole reunion 
concept, were seen standing next to a Woodstock poster or stage, posing for a 
souvenir snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Back: As time goes on, most of the young fans will look back on the 
experience with affection. For all the talk about anger and alienation in 
today's young rock crowd, they appeared just as eager as their earlier 
counterparts to help each other and make this weekend a success. 
</P>
<P>
 There will never be another Woodstock, just as there will never be another 
Beatles. There are unique social and cultural elements that create touchstones 
in our lives. This weekend didn't disprove the old adage that you can't go home 
again. Still, it gave a new generation of fans a chance to see the old place.
