 NO LOOKIE-LOOS: The most expensive home ever sold in Orange County is on the 
market again. But before racing out to Harbor Island to take a peek, have your 
banker call first. . . . "You need an appointment," says agent Gayle Amato at 
Prudential California Realty in Newport Beach, "and we really like people to be 
pre-qualified." . . . Price tag on the 12,000-square-foot bay-front house is 
$13.5 million -- 2.2% less than owner George Yao paid new in 1991. By 
comparison, the asking price for the place next door is just $8.9 million, down 
from $14.5 million asked in 1991.

 SPOTLIGHT ON HORROR: Are afternoon talk shows often just as sleazy as the 
evening tabloid shows? Add this to the debate: Maury Povich on Monday (Channel 
9, 1 p.m.) will give a full hour to ex-convict Charles Rothenberg, who was 
imprisoned after setting a fire in a Buena Park motel room in 1983 that left 
his son David, then 6, permanently disfigured. . . . No sensationalism, the 
show's producers say, but an attempt to prevent other instances of child abuse.

 DANCE DOCTOR: Sheela Rao, 19, is a premed student at UC Irvine in a hurry to 
do something for medicine. So she's doing what she knows best -- dancing. Rao 
will highlight a show of classical Indian dance tonight at UC Irvine's Crystal 
Cove Auditorium. It's being sponsored by the premed honor society on campus, 
with funds going to the American Cancer Society. Says Rao: "This is the best 
way I can contribute at this point in my life."

 HEAD RAMS: Old football players aren't always forgotten -- particularly if 
they were Pro Bowl caliber. The Rams Booster Club is honoring nearly two dozen 
Rams who made the Pro Bowl, as far back as 1946, with a dinner at the Yorba 
Linda Country Club Monday night -- preceded by a golf outing. You can attend 
the dinner for $40, or play golf with them for $100. . . . Club officials are 
upfront about the purpose -- anything to help persuade the Rams that Orange 
County wants the team to stay.

 NO FEES: The Northridge quake, of course, came with a big price tag. Many 
folks lost their homes or their sanity. Or both. So any break is welcome, such 
as the vote Friday by the City Council to waive for 18 months the permit fees 
needed to rebuild quake-damaged structures. . . . But before you give City Hall 
too much credit, you should know that FEMA will reimburse the city for lost 
fees (B8). 
</P>
<P>
 MUM ON MANURE: Politicians are usually at no loss for words, but Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg had good reason to stop herself just in time Friday. . . . The 
council was talking about curbside collection for horse manure (B4), when 
Goldberg was told there are about 8,000 horses registered in the city, and each 
generates an average of 90 gallons of manure per day. "Wow, that's a lot of . . 
. " she said.

 SAINT SUB: Poor Emydius. He was named patron saint against earthquakes for 
Southland Catholics some 130 years ago, and his position seemed pretty secure. 
But now, a Valley businessman is thrusting a new saint on the scene -- St. 
Gregory the Wonderworker, identified by a new book as the expert in quake 
prevention. . . . He's selling St. Gregory pocket medallions (above) (B1).

<P>
 FAREWELL: It's one of the prettiest spots in the Valley and it's been Fred 
Bermel's kingdom -- and sometimes home -- during the past 23 years. It's the 
Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, where Fred has retired as the dean of 
dam-keepers (B1). . . . After a final inspection Friday, Bermel said goodby and 
now heads for Utah. "We're losing a good man," said one colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 STILL ALIVE: It was do or die for the CSUN baseball team Friday. And guess 
what? They did. Well, at least, so far. The Matadors took the first game of the 
crucial three-game series against division-leading San Diego State, 7-6, in 12 
innings. . . . They must still win the next two games to have a realistic 
chance of making it to postseason play (C14). Michael Arkush

BERTON ROUECHE; MEDICAL WRITER FOR THE NEW YORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Berton Roueche, 83, a medical writer whose tales of baffling diseases 
fascinated doctors, mystery writers and a generation of hypochondriacs. Roueche 
originated the New Yorker magazine's "Annals of Medicine" series.His book 
"Eleven Blue Men," a collection of his New Yorker pieces published in 1954, won 
a Raven award from the Mystery Writers of America for the best book in a 
mystery field outside its regular categories. Roueche once said the detective 
story owes much to the annals of medicine, noting that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
based his fictional character Sherlock Holmes on a physician. Roueche joined 
the staff of the New Yorker in 1944. His last story, on aplastic anemia, 
appeared more than three years ago, but he remained on the magazine staff. In 
Amagansett, N.Y., on Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

RUSSELL KIRK; VOICE FOR CONSERVATISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russell Kirk, an eloquent spokesman for conservatism for 40 years whose views 
were valued by former presidents and whose writings helped solidify a divisive 
movement, died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The former National Review columnist and author of "The Conservative Mind," a 
seminal work in the literature of American conservatism, was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk died of congestive heart failure at his rural home here, said his 
daughter, Monica Carman. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote more than 25 books and hundreds of columns for the New York Times, 
Christianity Today, the Yale Review and other publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Conservative Mind" was first published in 1953 and was recently revised a 
seventh time. Time magazine devoted its entire book review section to the work 
when it was published, saying: "Kirk tells his story of the conservative stream 
with the warmth that belongs to it. Even Americans who do not agree may feel 
the warmth -- and perhaps feel the wonder of conservative intuition and 
prophecy." 
</P>
<P>
 A year after its publication, William Buckley introduced the National Review, 
giving a dormant conservative movement new voice and life. The conservative 
philosophy had been relatively silent since reformist Theodore Roosevelt formed 
a third party in 1912, splitting the Republican vote between himself and 
conservative President William Howard Taft. Democrat Woodrow Wilson's victory 
was the result. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first book, Kirk said "liberal" ideas have not generally defined the 
American experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence," Kirk wrote, "'the body of belief that we call 'conservatism' is 
an affirmation of normality in society. There exists standards to which we may 
repair; man is not perfectible, but he may achieve a tolerable degree of order, 
justice and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan once said Kirk helped renew interest in 
conservatism and "guided Americans in finding the meanings of the political 
world around them and in dealing with the universal problems of the human 
experience."

Gallo, a relative by marriage whom he had known since Prohibition.The Carlo 
Rossi Red Mountain brand was developed in 1955 and grew to become the leading 
economy brand of table wine in the United States. In the mid-1970s, Gallo 
sought an actor to do radio and TV ads for the Carlo Rossi wines, but decided 
that Rossi was better than all the actors. Rossi's tag line on the commercials 
was: "I like to talk about Carlo Rossi wine, but I'd rather drink it." On

JANITOR, 32, WHO WAS SHOT AT STOP SIGN DIES; VIOLENCE: JOHN EDWARD RIOS JR., 
WHO HAS BEEN IN A COMA SINCE THE ATTACK, WAS TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT. THERE IS 
STILL NO APPARENT MOTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old janitor died early Friday, three days after he was shot while 
waiting at a stop sign in a case that continues to baffle Ventura police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and family members said John Edward Rios Jr. did not appear to have 
personal or business problems that might have prompted his slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no motive," said Melissa Rios, his younger sister. "He had no 
enemies. I don't understand why this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios, who had been in a coma since the shooting, was taken off life support 
and pronounced dead at 5:50 a.m. Friday at Ventura County Medical Center, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and neighbors said they were shocked at Rios' death, and described 
him as an easygoing, reserved man who loved to fish at the Ventura Pier and 
play video games. He lived with his parents, Victoria and John Rios, and had 
worked as a janitor for the family-owned cleaning service since he was 15 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios was shot about 100 yards from the family business, JR Janitorial Services 
on Callens Road, as he and a co-worker sat in the company van. They had just 
finished cleaning the nearby American Red Cross office, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rios braked for a stop sign at Callens and Market Street, a man wearing 
dark clothing and a ski mask walked across the street in front of the van, 
police said. When the masked man was close to the driver's side, he pulled out 
a handgun and fired at Rios through the window. The co-worker, sitting in the 
passenger seat, was not hurt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fled as Rios, badly wounded in the head and left shoulder, drove 
across the intersection before crashing into a bus bench and mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they have no clues about what may have led to Rios' 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really kind of baffling," Ventura Sgt. Bob Anderson said. "We're 
exploring every possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he suspects the attack was premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circumstances point to someone knowing him," he said. "Their itinerary is 
very predictable. They're there every Tuesday night. The gunman shot at the 
driver, not the passenger." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, as news of Rios' death spread around Callens Road, those who knew 
him were convinced the shooting was random. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have an enemy in the world," said Scott Reed, who works at 
California Electric Supply, just down the street from JR Janitorial. "He was 
easygoing. He worked, he came home, he fished occasionally. But he didn't go 
out a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Turley, a mechanic who runs an auto shop across from the garage where JR 
Janitorial is based, said he has known the Rios family for 12 years. He 
repaired the slain man's car many times and said Rios didn't seem like the type 
to be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always up," Turley said. "He never seemed depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Rios said she thinks her brother was the victim of a bizarre, random 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the wrong place at the wrong time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa described her older brother as a "homebody" who enjoyed living with 
their parents and was happy with his life. He was a Ventura native who had 
dropped out of Buena High School in 10th grade to join the family janitorial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked what he was doing. He didn't have anyone breathing over his shoulder 
all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Rios had no long-term plans and "lived his days day by day." 
</P>
<P>
 As their father grew older, Rios helped out more with the family business, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever saw him in a bad mood," Melissa Rios said. "He was very, very 
friendly, never rude, never mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Garrety, a neighbor who knew Rios for 10 years, said his favorite hobby 
was fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought over fish he had caught," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios was a helpful and trustworthy neighbor, she said. Sometimes he would pick 
up and bring Garrety's 10-year-old daughter to school. He was the type of 
person you could count on for help if, for example, your car broke down, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us can understand what happened," Garrety said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also surviving are a sister, Michelle, and brother, Steven. A memorial service 
is scheduled for 7 tonight at the Joseph P. Reardon Funeral Chapel in Ventura.

SEN. BOXER BACKS FIGHT TO MOVE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing beneath the looming 98-foot-high radar tower on Sulphur Mountain, 
U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer told about 50 Ojai Valley residents Friday that she is 
committed to getting the weather tracking system moved to a less populous 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fight that I am in," she said. "Our ultimate hope is that this is 
moved." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the National Weather Service's radar tower have written to Boxer 
(D-Calif.) and other elected officials in recent months seeking their support 
in demanding that the government relocate the tower, one of 165 weather 
tracking systems being constructed nationwide to improve the monitoring of 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents say they fear low levels of radiation emitted from the radar 
could pose health risks, but weather service officials say studies show the 
system is safe. A federal judge has rejected efforts to stop its operation and 
has ruled that further health studies are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer, who took up the residents' cause in February, said if no agreement can 
be reached with the U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the National 
Weather Service, she will introduce legislation and take the matter to the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I ran for the Senate, I promised I would fight for the people of 
California and the environment -- those were not hollow words," Boxer said amid 
rousing applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer spoke for about 15 minutes on a grassy hill by the tower and assured 
residents that she is committed to their fight. She campaigned twice in Ojai in 
1992 and has many supporters in the small valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally have been able to get the attention of the deputy secretary of 
commerce (David Barram)," Boxer said. "He now knows he's got a problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer discussed the tower with Barram earlier this month, she said, and told 
him it was "unacceptable" in its present location. She has arranged a Monday 
conference call for representatives from her office, the National Weather 
Service and Barram to "get the facts on the table," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If negotiations with the Commerce Department are unsuccessful, the senator 
said she will look for a solution further up the chain of command. "We always 
have the President," she told the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has already introduced a bill in the House 
of Representatives seeking further study of possible health risks associated 
with the weather service's towers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boxer said Friday her chief concern was not health risks but the "sneaky" 
manner in which the government erected the tower last fall during the 
Thanksgiving holiday, when many residents were out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in the middle of a war where the Department of Defense comes in and 
says, 'Take that hill,' " Boxer said. "This is the National Weather Service."  
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Valley residents were thankful for Boxer's visit and optimistic that with 
her help the tower might be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always believed that we are right and we'll win," said actress Mary 
Steenburgen, who called Boxer months ago seeking her support. "We're hoping 
that we can handle this in a cooperative and civil way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Mayor Pro Tem Nina Shelley said Boxer's visit was a testament to the 
power of activism in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something happens here . . . we all come together," she said. "We're 
just tired of being trampled on."  
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said she believes the senator will be influential in getting the tower 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not going to let it go," she said. "She's going to go all the way to 
the top if she has to." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping tears from her eyes, Linda Fuller spoke with the senator after her 
brief speech and said she appreciated Boxer's visit. The Fullers vacated their 
house, which stands about 200 yards from the tower, earlier this year, fearing 
low levels of radiation might harm their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to move," Fuller said. "It's hard for me to work. I can't sleep. 
It's just a real emotional strain on all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Scribner, an Ojai resident and USC professor of preventive 
medicine who has investigated the possible health risks associated with the 
tower, said Boxer's visit justifies the position of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we haven't had support before," he said. "But when a politician 
goes to this effort it shows how committed the people are."

YOUTH IN SHOOTING FAILS TO SHOW AT ARRAIGNMENT; COURTS: PROSECUTORS BELIEVE 
TEEN-AGER MIGHT HAVE FLED TO HIS NATIVE TAIWAN. AN ARREST WARRANT IS ISSUED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 16-year-old charged in connection with the shooting of two Westlake High 
School football players failed to appear in court Friday and may have fled to 
his native Taiwan, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli said in court that James Tung Lee and his 
parents are recent immigrants with extensive family ties in Taiwan. He told 
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch that the Lees have considerable financial 
means, and later said they could easily finance a trip out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge issued an arrest warrant for Lee and raised his bail from $5,000 to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's attorney said in court that he has been unable to establish contact with 
either James Lee or his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oak Grove Place in Thousand Oaks, where the Lees have lived for about five 
years, neighbors said the family has not been seen for at least two weeks, 
since shortly after James Lee was bailed out of Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I can tell you is the parents were receiving hate mail, 
telling them to leave the country," said the attorney, Thomas Messereau Jr., 
outside the Ventura court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee first failed to appear for a Superior Court arraignment Wednesday. At the 
time, Storch rescheduled the arraignment and gave the teen-ager's attorney 
until Friday to have his client make it to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's no-show Friday comes one day after another judge ordered three of the 
youth's alleged accomplices in the Feb. 4 melee, all 16-year-old Asian 
Americans, to stand trial as adults in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl occurred after Lee and football player Curtis Simmons agreed to meet 
after school at North Ranch Park to engage in a fight, according to court 
testimony. Investigators say Lee showed up with five carloads of supporters, 
some of whom were armed with bats, sticks and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Lee's friends jumped out of their cars and announced, "We're 
the Asian Mafia," and attacked Simmons and his friends. Two were shot, but 
recovered from their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was ordered to stand trial as an adult, but prosecutors dropped one of the 
two assault charges against him on Wednesday. He faces up to four years in 
state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they haven't gone," prosecutor Vanarelli said. "I'm just shocked. I 
just never expected them to fail to appear like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli attributed Lee's failure to appear in court Wednesday to 
miscommunication. But now he believes it may be more than that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them not to show up, and the attorney not to be able to get ahold of them 
is worrisome," Vanarelli said. "I have to assume the worse: that they have left 
or are planning to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the case against the other three boys could be compromised if Lee does 
not show up, because he would expect their attorneys to blame everything on the 
missing defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Messereau said his client's absence from court surprised him, 
but Messereau refused to discuss his attempts to locate the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have been unable to locate Lee's older brother, Frank, since the 
shooting. They believe he helped his younger brother arrange for the massive 
turnout of Asian American youths at the park and are considering filing charges 
against him, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Messereau said he expected his client to appear Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry he didn't because I think the case has been looking better and 
better for the defendant," said Messereau, noting that one of the charges had 
been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the case had caused Lee's parents to experience some stress-related 
medical problems and that the family believed the charges were racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees' Spanish-style compound, nearly hidden from sight atop a hill off a 
private drive, is guarded by a double, wrought-iron gate flanked by two 
red-brick columns. The gate was locked Friday and no one answered the security 
intercom at the six-bedroom house, valued at roughly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, who refused to be identified, said she last saw James Lee's 
father, whose name was not immediately known, about 14 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he had lost a lot of weight," the woman said. "He looked very 
dejected." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she said she has not seen the family, though the gate was opened 
several times last week, possibly by the gardeners. "It's just kind of spooky," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior at Westlake High School who lives on the other side of the Lees' 
house said she last saw the parents driving their Mercedes-Benz the day their 
son was released from Juvenile Hall.

COLD WARRIOR NOW LOYAL TO PEACE CORPS 
</P>

<P>
 For much of Jim Tandy's nearly 25-year career in aerospace, he worked on the 
B-1 bomber, the Stealth bomber and other aircraft capable of carrying weapons 
of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Santa Paula resident undoubtedly had a head for physics, his 
heart was in other places. It began to nag at him, he remembers, that he was 
helping to build weapons that might one day be used to annihilate so many 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me a queasy feeling thinking what it would be like having (a missile) 
coming at me," Tandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had a wife, two children and a mortgage. So he continued working on the 
jets, putting the implications of his contributions out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced now, and pushed out of aeronautics by the defense contract bust of 
the late '80s, the 62-year-old Tandy is following a new course. He has been 
accepted into the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds like I'm just trying to make up for the bad stuff I did in 
aerospace," he said. "And when I analyze it, maybe I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Tandy leaves for the Dominican Republic, where he will work with 
forestry officials to plant trees, among other jobs. The trip is the 
realization of a decades-long goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since President Kennedy initiated the Peace Corps in 1961, it's been a 
dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, reality got in the way for many years, Tandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1963, he had quit Cal State Long Beach, a few units short of a degree in 
physics. He left college in his senior year, Tandy said, because he already had 
a defense job that kept him busy 12 hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked for Garrett Airesearch in Torrance, testing ways to keep astronauts 
alive in the command modules being built for the Apollo space program. Already 
married with children, Tandy worked for Garrett for the next 11 years, 
marveling along with the rest of the country as Neil Armstrong took his famous 
moonwalk in July, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy then began a series of short stints as an entrepreneur. He dabbled in an 
epoxy-coating business and in real estate. But whenever those ventures didn't 
work out, he returned to his lucrative defense work. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with defense giant Rockwell, in Rockwell's Palmdale plant, that he went 
to work on the now-defunct B-1 bomber. At the time it was hailed as the most 
sophisticated warplane ever, capable of delivering conventional and nuclear 
weapons while evading radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time I got to see the guts of an airplane being built," 
Tandy recalled. "As it evolved, I really realized what an effective weapon of 
destruction it was. If I saw that thing coming at me, I would just bury myself 
in the dirt. That's all you could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy later worked on the Stealth bomber, but said he didn't worry too much 
about his participation because he only built tools needed to maintain the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being far removed from it made it acceptable to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy moved to low-rent senior housing in Santa Paula when the end of the Cold 
War left him jobless in 1989. He said he looked for another $40-an-hour 
aeronautics consulting job for months but had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended up accepting a $4.25-an-hour job with the Ojai Ranger District 
picking up trash in campgrounds at Rose Valley and Piedra Blanca. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just nothing else out there for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He will leave his forestry job to take the unpaid, two-year Peace Corps 
position. He held a garage sale to sell most of his modest belongings.  
</P>
<P>
 Tandy will donate his numerous books to a library and will give other items to 
Goodwill Industries, he said. He is also selling a 1965 Volkswagen Beetle but 
will put his Honda 450 in storage so he has transportation when he returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy sees his stint in the Peace Corps as an adventure. He will live in a 
small village, renting a room from a family. The home has no plumbing and has 
an outhouse, but that doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my loves is backpacking and when you go backpacking, there is not even 
an outhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy asked to go to a Spanish-speaking country and took two courses at 
Ventura College to prepare. His goal, he said, is to be fluent in the language 
by the time he returns. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague of Tandy's at the ranger district said the former engineer is a 
natural for the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim's a great guy," said Ranger Dirk Shupe. "And he loves working with 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy supervised a youth crew that built hiking trails last summer and did and 
excellent job, Shupe said. And his love for nature is apparent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really dedicated to his work here and the forest," Shupe said. "He 
hikes all the time. When he's not working, he's still out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although two-thirds of Peace Corps volunteers are between the ages of 20 and 
29, many host countries favor older volunteers, Peace Corps officials say. 
Older workers like Tandy tend to command greater respect and prestige in 
traditional cultures that value the wisdom of age.  
</P>
<P>
 "What the Peace Corps tells me is that older people have a lot of experience 
that younger people don't have," Tandy said. "Life experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy is also looking forward to the freedom Peace Corps officials have told 
him to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in aerospace, there was someone telling me almost hour by hour 
what to do," he said. "The Peace Corps points you in the right direction, pats 
you on the head and says, 'Good luck.' "

PROPOSALS TO BE STUDIED IN CITY MANAGER HUNT; VENTURA: JOHN BAKER IS HELPING TO 
ORGANIZE THE HUNT FOR HIS SUCCESSOR AND HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE 
RIGHT SEARCH FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving swiftly to replace the city's outgoing city manager, Ventura City 
Council members Monday will consider proposals from half a dozen executive 
search firms that want to conduct the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John Baker, who announced his departure plans on Monday, is 
taking a strong role in organizing the hunt for a successor and has already 
begun the process of finding the right search firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will ultimately decide who to hire as the city's most powerful, 
highest paid administrator. But as he has done for the past 13 years, Baker is 
guiding the politicians along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'What do you recommend we do next?' " said Councilman Steve Bennett, 
recalling the reaction of the stunned seven-member council upon learning in 
closed session last Monday that Baker plans to leave the city on July 1. "And 
he said, 'Hire an executive search firm.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And what, Bennett asks, could be more natural than to put Baker in charge of 
that process as well? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only guy who's been through the process from the other end," he 
said. "I think the council will actually control this, but it's sort of like, 
to get some of the procedural legwork done, you ask the city manager to do that 
for you."  
</P>
<P>
 Baker says the task is actually relatively simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get flyers from (the placement firms) all the time," he said. "You know 
who's in the business. There aren't a lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
 He refuses to say what traits council members should look for in their next 
city manager, but he plans to advise them Monday on what kind of time frame 
they might be looking at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three months, minimum," he said, adding that in the interim, council members 
could temporarily promote a division manager to the post, or bring in retired 
city managers who now work as professional temps.  
</P>
<P>
 As for his permanent replacement, he has some idea where the council might 
locate that person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'You can go as broad as you want, but I think your primary 
market is California,' " he said. "People have a tendency to move within the 
state, because then they have a leg up on everybody else. They know the laws, 
the rules, the regulations."  
</P>
<P>
 Baker left a city administration job in Oakland to take the city manager's 
position in Ventura in 1981. In July, he will go into the consulting business 
with a former colleague from Oakland, who now lives in Cincinnati. The two men 
plan to remain in their separate cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Baker in town, however, is not the same thing as having him at the helm 
of the city's ship, council members said. "It's going to be chaos," predicted 
Councilman Gary Tuttle, who has not worked with any other city manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said the loss of Baker -- whom he described as a "strong, central 
figure" -- will create a power vacuum that some ambitious council members will 
rush to fill.  
</P>
<P>
 Others on the council, however, are more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the business of city administration, change is inevitable," said Mayor Tom 
Buford. "I think John's done a great job, and I hope whoever follows him will 
too."

 A good Samaritan's not-so-good luck: A year ago John Leslie stopped work on 
his bar exam in Pasadana and ran to the aid of another test-taker who had 
suffered a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy (and lots of lawyer jokes) followed when the State Bar initially 
refused to give Leslie, and four others who also assisted, additional time to 
finish the test.  
</P>
<P>
 The bar later agreed to disregard that section of the exam and Leslie, 29, 
passed. He was praised in editorials, named Citizen of the Week by KNX radio 
and appeared on the "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno. All of which was gratifying, 
but what he wanted was a job with a law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent out dozens of letters. He was encouraged after appearing on some radio 
talk shows. "Lawyers would call in and say, 'We'd love to hire him,' or 'Wish 
we knew where he was,' " Leslie said. But when he later phoned those firms, he 
not only wasn't hired, "they wouldn't even take my calls."  
</P>
<P>
 So he started his own practice in North Hollywood. "It isn't easy," said 
Leslie, who takes occasional musical gigs as a saxophonist to make ends meet. 
"But I've got one client who was wronged by a corporation -- it's the kind of 
case that got me interested in the law in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie harbors no bitterness. "Jobwise, the legal profession is feeling the 
recession, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were more attorneys like Leslie, lawyer jokes might disappear 
altogether. 
</P>

 The hard-working sleeping policeman: The announcement that the city of L.A. 
plans to install speed humps on local roadways stirred memories for Al Cadis of 
Hawthorne. He recalled hearing on a "trip through the Caribbean (I don't 
remember which island)" that humps "were actually called 'silent policemen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cadis wasn't conked on the head by a coconut or anything. He's almost correct. 
Of course, we didn't even know what a speed hump was when Jim Stott sent us a 
picture of a mysterious sign in Westlake Village several months ago. We learned 
that they're street barriers that are about 12 feet wide and 3 inches high -- 
flatter than their cousins, speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 It was soon afterward that we were informed by Diana Britt of Pasadena that in 
Jamaica a speed hump is a "sleeping policeman." We learned, too, that it's a 
"judder bar" in New Zealand and a "flic alonge" (sleeping or reclining cop) in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only repeat our call for a special session of the United Nations to 
come up with a handle for humps that is acceptable worldwide. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Counterpoint: A North Hollywood reader, recalling the Watergate era, suggests 
that a proper observance for President Richard Nixon would have been an 18 
1/2-minute period of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Embraceable Lakewood: T.C. Cirillo notes that the publicity over the Spur 
Posse, the high school boys who keep statistics on how many girls they slept 
with, still seems to be in the city's subconscious. At least, he assumes that 
Colony Cablevision of Lakewood meant "Lakewood Living" when it listed Channel 
27 as the home of "Lakewood Loving." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that the only reason we received a flyer from Dr. Dudley Danoff, the 
guru of "super potency," is that we previously wrote about a firm whose "Men 
Only" ads talk about a penis-lengthening procedure. Danoff says that "super 
potency . . . is more than size, blood vessels, the nerves -- it's about 
heightened self-awareness. . . ." That, he says, is how you acquire "penis 
power." Lakewood doesn't want to hear about it, Danoff.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY FOUNDATION GETS $300,000 GRANT

<P>
 The Ventura County Community Foundation has received a $300,000 grant that it 
will use to raise more money for its permanent endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time the James Irvine Foundation, the largest private, 
nonprofit foundation in California, has given the Ventura County foundation a 
$300,000 grant, said Executive Director Kate McLean. 
</P>
<P>
 The first donation came in 1991 and served as seed money to help the 
foundation's assets grow from less than $500,000 to $5.5 million today, McLean 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the previous grant, the money will be spread out over three years, she 
said. Staff hired through grant funds will solicit new donations and endowments 
for the Ventura County Community Foundation fund, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual interest from funds placed in the foundation are used to benefit a 
variety of organizations, including homeless shelters, food banks and arts 
productions. The foundation handed out $1.7 million in grants in 1993, McLean 
said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE ARREST 1, WARN OTHERS IN GANG SWEEP 
</P>

<P>
 Authorities conducted a surprise sweep through Oxnard on Friday, arresting one 
man and warning suspected gang members that illegal gang activities would 
result in stiff prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 officers from local law enforcement agencies participated in the 
operation, which began at 7 a.m., Oxnard Police Sgt. Chuck Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers went to 14 households, serving warnings to six gang members and 
arresting Richard Mendoza, 19, on suspicion of possessing a controlled 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, who was being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail, is 
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suspected gang members were at school or work and will be served 
with warnings later, Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The warnings said gang participation in a criminal activity could lead to a 
three-year prison sentence under a state anti-terrorism law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make a statement to this particular gang that we're watching," 
Hookstra said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: BOARD TO CONSIDER RENAMING SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Paula school board is scheduled to decide next month whether an 
elementary school should be renamed for a Latino school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers for and against the proposal to rename Glen City School voiced their 
opinions on the issue at a hearing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people spoke in support of the proposal to rename the school after 
longtime Santa Paula civic leader Joe Bravo at Thursday's school board meeting, 
said Bob Borrego, who requested the name change. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, a former mayor, is a member of the Santa Paula Elementary District 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrego told school board members that he and several others favor the 
proposal because every elementary school in Santa Paula except Glen City is 
named after a prominent local citizen, all of whom are white. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming Glen City after Bravo would give the city's Latino majority a model to 
look up to, Borrego said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other speakers told the board that they want Glen City's name to remain 
the same. If the school's name is changed at all, it should be renamed 
Pinkerton Elementary, in honor of Dorothy Pinkerton, who served as the school's 
principal for more than 20 years, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees made no comment on the public testimony, said district clerk Celia 
Meza. The board is scheduled to make a decision on the proposal at its May 26 
meeting, Meza said. KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TIME RUNS OUT ON BID TO CANCEL TIMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A revolt against Thousand Oaks' purchase of a $2,700 system to time speakers 
at public meetings fizzled when a majority of council members refused to 
reconsider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the fancy digital timer will be used in the new council chambers 
at the Civic Arts Plaza.Public speakers will see a clock counting down how many 
seconds remain in their allotted time. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Grant Brimhall has touted the timer as an improvement over the 
current system, which is somewhat imprecise. Speakers now see a green light for 
the bulk of their time, a yellow warning light with one minute to go and 
finally a red light indicating "stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the lights are small and perched on the edge of the podium, speakers 
often forget to check them. And even when residents do look at the lights, they 
have trouble pacing themselves because they don't know exactly how much time 
remains, Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council's most regular visitor, activist Ekbal Quidwai, has railed 
against the sophisticated timer as an unnecessary expense and a waste of 
taxpayer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered the council an inexpensive digital clock as a substitute for the 
costly system and faxed officials a survey indicating that neighboring cities 
use far less intricate timing devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai's arguments earned some high-level backing this week when Mayor Elois 
Zeanah urged her colleagues to reconsider the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Zeanah had voted to buy the timer, but only because she believed 
that the council's finance committee supported the purchase. As it turned out, 
the committee had never reviewed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming that she had been misled, Zeanah called for a new vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But all four of her colleagues instead supported a motion by Alex Fiore to 
table the issue indefinitely, letting the purchase stand. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 A 45-year-old woman pleaded guilty Friday to nine charges in connection with 
shooting up a Thousand Oaks neighborhood in a drunken rage two weeks before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Ann Quinn faces up to 14 years in prison, but her attorney said Quinn 
plans to tell the court about the circumstances surrounding the shooting in 
hopes of leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Scovis, the Thousand Oaks attorney, would not reveal what brought on the 
shooting spree. Police have said she was upset over the breakup of her 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had charged Quinn with 19 criminal counts ranging from shooting at 
inhabited dwellings and vehicles to drunken driving. Quinn first pleaded not 
guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she pleaded guilty to five counts of shooting at inhabited 
dwellings, three counts of shooting at vehicles and one count of driving under 
the influence. No one was injured in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors plan to dismiss the remaining 10 counts. Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger 
A. Inman said the defendant would have faced no more than 14 years if convicted 
of all 19 counts.

AL MARTINEZ: SHADOW OF THE WOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The past of Ricardo Resendez follows him through life like the shadow of a 
wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 He feels it behind him most of the day, and at night, the worst time, it 
crouches at the edge of his memory, red eyes staring through the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't go away," he says in anguish as we talk across a restaurant table, 
where even the clatter of dishes and forks brings the wolf closer in flashing 
images. 
</P>
<P>
 Medication meant to dull his pain works sometimes, and booze will get him 
through a few hours. But after everything wears off there are always the 
terrible memories, always the shadow of the wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 That's understandable. Twenty-five years in one of the most brutal prisons in 
America is hard to get over. 
</P>
<P>
 Resendez got there by killing a man in 1961. He was a soldier stationed at Ft. 
Bragg, N.C., when a stranger attacked a friend with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 He intervened and the stranger went after him. As he would recall later, 
"something snapped." Resendez drew his own knife, and after a violent scuffle, 
the stranger lay dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Resendez had been urged by his mother to join the Army in the 
first place to escape the gang-ridden environment of his own East L.A. 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, at age 18, he faced a quarter-century behind bars in a North Carolina 
state prison. It was where the wolf was born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Resendez shortly after he had been released from prison. He was 
living with a woman he loved dearly and talking to gang members about his own 
life, telling them: "Don't be a fool, don't be like me." 
</P>
<P>
 He was trying hard to overcome his past and, with an IQ measured in prison at 
142, he was doing all right. L.A.'s Department of Water and Power had hired him 
as a laborer, but everyone figured he'd climb higher soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the wolf cast its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be eating or driving or just doing nothing," he says, "and suddenly 
remember a guy in prison who'd been doused with paint and set on fire. I'd hear 
the screams and smell the burning flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would just pop into my head and I'd try to get it out, but it would come 
back again and again. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That was only one of the memories. The wolf throws a long shadow. Without 
closing his eyes, Resendez can see a body hurtling through space from the fifth 
tier of the prison and hear it splat on hard concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the gore of its impact and covers his face with his hands, shutting it 
out . . . but only for a little while. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist describes his condition as post-traumatic stress, the same 
emotional affliction that affects veterans of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Resendez calls it a living nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashes of memory altered his behavior. He became morose and angry. He 
lost the love of his life and then his job, and spent two terrifying weeks in 
jail on a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was later determined that the violation had never occurred, but by then 
Resendez's life was in a tailspin from which it has never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I met with him the other day, it was clear the shadow of the wolf 
continued to lie over him. Even the normal din of a restaurant was too much. It 
reminded him of prison. He had to leave and stand in the open to calm his 
anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Three drunk-driving arrests had cost him his last job. An attempt at group 
therapy went awry when he began talking about his life behind bars. It so 
frightened others in the group that the leader asked him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get over the past," Resendez says. "I can't even get mad without 
someone thinking I'm going to commit murder." 
</P>
<P>
 After five months in the county jail on the drunk-driving convictions, 
Resendez wandered through the Southwest and Mexico, then returned, realizing at 
last that he couldn't escape the shadows. So he lives with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 51, he survives on $600 a month from Social Security. Until recently, he 
has lived with his mother in Boyle Heights, but when I saw him he was in the 
middle of moving into a room on the edge of Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 The medication he takes helps only marginally to relieve him of his 
nightmares. Eight or 10 beers, he says, help a lot more. He's taking a 
correspondence course on animal care, and hopes that will end up getting him a 
good job. He loves animals and identifies with strays. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could," he says, "I'd help all the innocent creatures of the world to 
quit hurting . . . because I know what it's like to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 I see him wince at the clatter in the restaurant and watch him hurry to the 
door and leave. He stands alone in the muted sunlight, a pained and lonely 
figure, smoking a cigarette and listening to the distant, persistent howling of 
the wolf.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; JUDGE SIDES WITH SQUIRRELS' ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Adams, a self-proclaimed squirrels' advocate who has been sued for 
allegedly luring the fuzzy rodents into her Thousand Oaks neighborhood, can 
continue to fill her tree feeders with nuts for now, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John Hunter denied a temporary injunction sought by 
Adams' neighbors, Randy and Nancy Hecht, that would have prevented her from 
feeding the squirrels that roam into her yard from the hills of Wildwood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great about how things are going," Adams said Friday. "We're going to 
continue to fight this." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams contended that the squirrels are native to the area and that her food 
did not prompt their frequent visits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hechts argued that squirrels lured by Adams have ravaged their lawn, 
fence and roof, causing $12,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients are going to fight this, not for the money but to stop the 
infestation," attorney Leigh Datzker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case moved into some unusual areas of law when Adams' attorneys said they 
asked Judge Hunter to rule on the question of squirrel literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted it to be clear that, even though Ms. Adams has put up signs which 
say squirrels are welcome, they couldn't possibly read them," said Patrick 
Paul, who is part of the team defending Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Paul, the judge ruled that, because squirrels cannot talk, it 
cannot be determined if they can read. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs in the case are not laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients see this as a very real threat," said Datzker. "Even though we did 
not get this preliminary injunction, we will continue to seek an injunction 
because the damage and the health risks will persist if we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The next hearing in the case is scheduled for mid-May. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TRAFFIC LIGHT NEAR METROLINK PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider installing a traffic 
light at an intersection near the Metrolink station where a police cruiser 
slammed into a nurse's car two weeks ago and caused injuries that left her in a 
coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Sphar, 45, suffered severe head injuries when she was thrown from her 
car after it was broadsided by a cruiser driven by Simi Valley Officer Rick 
Rinehart, who was not injured.On Friday, Sphar was still in a coma at Simi 
Valley Hospital, a relative said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sphar, a nurse at the hospital, was driving out of the Metrolink station's 
parking lot when her station wagon was struck by Rinehart's cruiser as it 
traveled along Los Angeles Avenue. Police are still investigating who was at 
fault, Sgt. Gary Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers this week gave the City Council a list of sites for proposed 
new traffic lights and signal upgrades -- topped by the intersection at the 
Metrolink entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to that signal, engineers proposed installing a light at Alamo 
Street and Texas Avenue and improving signals at half a dozen other crossroads 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers estimate that 19,700 cars move through the Metrolink 
intersection in a 24-hour period and that the light will cost $100,000 to 
install -- $11,500 of which will be paid by the city and $88,500 by federal gas 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The light was recommended long before the accident because increased ridership 
on Metrolink was expected to boost the number of vehicles traveling in and out 
of the station's parking lot, said Bill Golubics, Simi Valley traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until this recent accident, we have not had any report of collisions at L. A. 
Avenue and the driveway since the station opened," Golubics said. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOME-PURCHASE AID PROGRAM APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program to help low-income renters purchase homes in Thousand Oaks will take 
effect this week, after officials pledged not to discriminate against large 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ownership Assistance Program, approved by the City Council on Tuesday, 
sets out eligibility requirements that suggest first-time buyers must meet 
certain household size guidelines to qualify for city-backed loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Families with five members, for example, would have to purchase a three- or 
four-bedroom home to meet the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of linking loans to household size drew criticism from some 
housing experts, who worried that larger families might find themselves locked 
out of the program. A family with three young children might be able to afford 
only a two-bedroom house -- yet the guidelines would urge them into at least a 
three-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But mortgage banker Katherine Luna, who will administer the program, said she 
would be flexible in applying the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "My direction from the council has been to make the units available for as 
many families as possible and not restrict people by following the guidelines 
too closely," Luna said. "I have definitely not been directed to discriminate 
against anybody because of household size." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year loans, which can help families with down payments or mortgage 
financing, will be offered first to low-income residents of the Las Casitas 
Neighborhood in Newbury Park. If the $500,000 allocated for the program 
stretches far enough, the program will be opened to other residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a really historic opportunity with housing prices so low," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "If we give up this opportunity to make home 
ownership available for our truly low-income residents, we might not have 
another chance." STEPHANIE SIMON

ELECTIONS / 4TH SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT; WILLIAMSON TAKES ON COUNTY SPENDING IN 
QUEST FOR SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her extensive financial background, Ventura County supervisor candidate 
Barbara Williamson says one of her top priorities if elected will be to zero in 
on wasteful government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in a bank, so I know about budgets," said Williamson, 50, a Simi 
Valley councilwoman and vice president in charge of business development at 
Simi Valley Bank  
</P>
<P>
 And Williamson, one of three candidates competing in the June 7 election for 
the seat being vacated by Supervisor Vicky Howard, is not shy about citing what 
she considers wasteful spending. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, she was very critical of Richard Wittenberg, the 
county's chief administrative officer, for hiring an outside consultant to find 
a replacement for Fire Chief George Lund, who recently retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Mr. Wittenberg gets paid how much money, and he can't pick a fire chief? 
That's inexcusable," Williamson said. "If this is any reflection of how he 
(works), I'll tell you I don't think he and I will get along." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Board of Supervisors voted to spend $15,000 to hire a consultant 
to conduct the search because they believed it would cut by half the time it 
would take to fill the vacancy. Wittenberg made no recommendation on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 When informed of this, Williamson said, "Then he should have made a 
recommendation (to do the search himself). That's his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson was also critical of a $12,400 pay raise for the county's top 
courts administrator, Sheila Gonzalez. Seventeen of the county's 27 judges 
approved the pay hike in February, saying Gonzalez had gone three years without 
a raise and crediting her with saving the county more than $3 million by 
streamlining the operations of the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12.8% raise pushed Gonzalez's base salary to $109,000, making her the 
third highest-paid appointed county administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy cow," Williamson said. "This is why residents are upset with government. 
I don't care who approved (the raise), it was wrong. This lady may walk on 
water, but maybe she belongs in private enterprise and not in government 
service if that's the kind of salary she's looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending her get-tough attitude, Williamson said if government is ever going 
to get serious about reducing expenditures "then we've got to find a way to 
work smarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson is equally passionate about other issues. She strongly supports the 
development of a commercial airport at Point Mugu to help create more jobs and 
attract new businesses to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But she opposes a $30-million renovation and expansion of the 69-year-old 
Ventura County Medical Center. "There's no money for it," she said flatly. "I 
think this is a real sales job and I'm opposed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the county's need for a new landfill to serve the west county, 
Williamson said she has her own solution but is reluctant to give any details. 
She said it does involve a longtime proposal to develop a landfill at Weldon 
Canyon in Ojai, which has successfully fought against a dump. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bailard Landfill in Oxnard scheduled to close in 1997, Williamson said 
she wants to ensure that the Simi Valley Landfill does not become the county's 
only dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do these hoity-toity people in Ojai get off sending their trash 
somewhere else," she said. "If they have a trash problem, then they have to 
find other ways to get rid of it and not put it on their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 In other issues, Williamson said she backs efforts by county firefighters to 
establish their own paramedic program and to collect a share of Proposition 172 
sales tax money. Money raised from Proposition 172 -- approved by voters in 
November after wildfires swept the region -- is now split among law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are upset because they went to the polls to ensure that firefighters 
had equipment to fight fires," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since announcing her candidacy in January, Williamson has raised more than 
$20,000 in campaign contributions, far outpacing her two opponents. She has 
also won the support of four county employee unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This says to me that people are looking for a change," said Williamson, who 
will keep her Simi Valley council seat if she loses the supervisor election. 
She was elected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But her two rivals -- Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and Moorpark 
Councilman Scott Montgomery -- say Williamson lacks the experience necessary to 
be a county supervisor. Mikels has held public office for three years, 
Montgomery for six. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she's proven herself yet as far as her ability to grasp the 
issues and work them through," said Mikels, who has been endorsed by Howard. "I 
don't think that's the kind of politician we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels also questioned Williamson's commitment to her job with the city, 
saying Williamson avoids committee assignments and has missed numerous 
meetings, both as a council member and a member of the Planning Commission. 
Williamson served on the commission from 1990 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbara likes to take vacations," Mikels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson defended her attendance record in both instances, saying, "I've 
been there on all the important votes." City records show that Williamson 
missed six of 57 council meetings, contrasted with two for Mikels; Williamson 
missed seven of 49 Planning Commission meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a non-issue," said Williamson, adding that it is difficult to coordinate 
her vacation schedule at the bank with the council's. "I think (Mikels) is so 
far behind she's grasping at straws." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Williamson questioned Mikels' fiscal priorities, saying Mikels 
is a strong supporter of the city spending $2.8 million in redevelopment funds 
to turn an abandoned church into a cultural arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the city should have a cultural arts center, but I think the money 
should come from the private sector," not from government, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said the project is too important for the city to pass up, saying it 
would not only be getting a new performing arts theater but would also be 
preserving one of its few historical buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her lack of government experience, Williamson said she considers this 
an asset, not a liability. Besides, she said, "I'm a quick learner." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has demonstrated that she is unafraid to take a stand on issues, 
saying she was the first council member to publicly oppose the building of a 
Wal-Mart on a city hillside. Despite Wal-Mart's well-financed campaign to win 
support, the proposal was shot down by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "With me, what you see is what you get," Williamson said. "There's no mirrors 
or sleight of hand. I'm just who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Williamson has picked up the endorsements of the Simi Valley Police 
Officers Assn., the Ventura County Deputy Sheriff's Assn., the Ventura County 
Firefighters and the Service Employees International Union Local 998. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Hammitt, executive director of the employees' union, said he is most 
impressed with Williamson's energy, persistence and attentiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has an openness and a willingness to talk," Hammitt said. "And there's a 
desire to change the way things are done. With Vicky Howard, I never knew where 
she stood on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about her lack of government experience, Hammitt said, "It doesn't make 
a difference if you have one year or 1,000 years' experience. The question is, 
do you have the right personality makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her banking experience, Williamson said she considers herself 
pro-business and pro-growth. But she said this doesn't mean she supports all 
development, citing her opposition to Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe if a city doesn't grow, it will die," she said. "But I also believe 
in managed growth." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Williamson's former husband, John, a Simi Valley attorney, who got her 
interested in politics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the couple moved from San Diego to Simi Valley in 1972, 
Williamson said, her husband urged her to join a neighborhood council group. 
She served for 18 months as chairwoman of the organization, which advises the 
City Council on neighborhood issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson enjoyed the experience and stayed involved in local politics, 
working on the campaigns of Simi Valley Republicans Rep. Elton Gallegly and 
state Sen. Cathie Wright -- both of whom are former council members. 
</P>
<P>
 A registered Republican, Williamson also worked on the campaigns of a number 
of Democrats, including that of Councilman Bill Davis in his bid for county 
supervisor against Vicky Howard in 1990. Davis has since switched to the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, friendship is more important than politics," said Williamson, whose 
former husband was also a longtime Democrat until recently. The two remain 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Williamson's association with former Democratic consultant Jim 
Dantona that some say could hurt her campaign among Republican voters, even 
though it is a nonpartisan race. Dantona was Williamson's campaign consultant 
in her 1992 council race and is an adviser in her bid for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 A former aide to state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), Dantona, a Simi 
Valley resident, now serves as assistant to state Controller Gray Davis, a 
Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. One of Davis' opponents is 
Wright, the state senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think her affiliation with liberal people isn't going to help her" in an 
area that is mostly conservative and Republican, Montgomery said. "There's a 
lot of negatives tied to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said she will not let politics ruin her friendship with Dantona. 
Meanwhile, she said she has already spent several thousand dollars on a 
professional consultant to work on her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a politician," Williamson said of her decision to hire a consultant. 
"I don't know how to run a campaign. But I want to win." Profile of Barbara

SCHOOL OFFICIALS WILL CONTINUE GIVING CONTROVERSIAL CLAS EXAM; THOUSAND OAKS: 
DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES WILL TELL STATE THAT CONTROVERSIAL EXAM NEEDS 
REVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite intense pressure to ban the CLAS test, school officials in Thousand 
Oaks will continue giving the controversial exam while telling state officials 
it needs revision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board's 3-1 decision to endorse the concept behind 
the California Learning Assessment System exam came as parents in Ventura 
County and throughout the state have grown increasingly critical of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting of the Conejo Valley Unified School District board drew an 
overflow audience of more than 150 parents opposed to CLAS, some of whom said 
they were bitterly disappointed with the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience gave a standing ovation to board member Mildred Lynch, an 
outspoken critic of CLAS who refused to support the board's recommendation. 
Board member Bill Henry did not attend the meeting because he was traveling 
outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents who spoke Wednesday criticized CLAS as an instrument of political 
correctness, a psychological tool and a huge waste of taxpayers' money. They 
said they objected to questions on the reading and writing test that ask 
students about personal experiences, opinions and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the parents' responsibility to teach their children about ethics, 
morality, family values and religion. Not the school and not the state," said 
Ken Thorley, who has children in the third and fifth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the state nor anyone else has the right to rummage around in my 
family's collective psyche," Thorley added, as members of the audience shouted 
support and burst into loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents complained that the state was usurping the rights of parents and 
individual school districts by requiring the test be given. For the second 
consecutive year, the CLAS test is being given statewide at a cost of about $26 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to last year's failed school-voucher initiative, parent Sherrie 
Mithcel said: "Remember that voucher system? It sounds pretty good right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The boisterous crowd grew quiet when fourth-grader Kimberly Westmiller took 
the podium and told how some test questions had made her uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had questions on the test I felt I should not answer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who spoke said they kept their children home while the CLAS test 
was given in the fourth, eighth and 10th grades during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson confirmed that 7% of the district's 
fourth-graders, 15% of eighth-graders and 40% of 10th-graders have skipped the 
test. Simpson attributed many of the 10th-grade absences to students who 
convinced their parents that the testing was optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing in Thousand Oaks' schools is nearly complete, district officials said, 
and should be finished by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the roomful of critics, one teacher from Newbury Park High offered her 
support for the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think it's a good instrument," said Christine Thompson, chairwoman of 
the school's English department. However, Thompson also said she shared the 
parents' concerns about the overall cost of the test and the time it took to 
administer. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jerry Gross told the audience he agreed that CLAS relied too much on 
"opinion, opinion, opinion" and contained some passages with "themes that are 
very dark." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the secretiveness surrounding the exam is no different from other 
standardized tests given in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to many of the criticisms, school board member Richard Newman said 
he had reviewed copies of this year's test and found "nothing that would prompt 
me to keep one of my children home, even though I wasn't wild about some of 
what I read." 
</P>
<P>
 "From my standpoint, that test is not the threat you say it is," he told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's recommendation urges state officials to find a better system for 
picking questions, provide parents with more information, release copies of old 
tests and reconsider the overall cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dolores Didio said she will present the parents' concerns 
about CLAS, along with the board's suggestions for improvement, to state 
legislators in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Tempes, associate superintendent with the state Department of Education, 
said such recommendations carry weight when other districts throughout the 
state offer the same suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always trying to improve this thing," he said. "I don't think we've 
ever made claims for perfection."

400 KIDS GET THEIR DAY IN THE SUN TO TEST LIMITS, TRY NEW THINGS; CARNIVAL: THE 
CHILDREN, MOST WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES OR SPECIAL CLASSROOM NEEDS, GET THE 
RUN OF THE GROUNDS. 
</P>

 Nine-year-old Laura Felix took a giant step toward adulthood Friday during 
Special Kids Day at the Conejo Valley Days carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura and her friend Mary Jan Williams took the leap from the "dinky kids' 
rides" to the "bigger, scarier rides." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my second time here, and it's much better this year because we're 
going on all the good rides," Laura said as she headed toward the Ferris wheel. 
"We're the big kids now." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 400 children who came from schools around Southern California, Friday 
was a day to test the limits, to try new things and to escape the routine of 
the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 For three hours the children, most of whom have physical disabilities or 
special needs in the classroom, had the chance to flip on the sirens and lights 
in a Sheriff's Department squad car, scream as they flew by on a roller 
coaster, and stare wide-eyed from the top of the 50-foot Ferris wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to go on all the rides and do anything we want," said a smiling Keith 
Casequin, 9, of Yerba Buena. "It's great!" 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event matches each child with a volunteer and allows them to roam 
free across the carnival grounds. It was first run 13 years ago when a festival 
official decided to give the children the freedom to enjoy Conejo Valley Days 
without the hassles and hazards of a crowded park. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started doing this it was just about 50 kids," recalled Jo-Ann 
O'Beirne, who has attended every Special Kids Day. "It started as a grass-root 
kind of a thing and just mushroomed from there." 
</P>
<P>
 To pull off the annual event, members of the service club Zonta International 
had to find 400 volunteers to come and assist the children, in addition to 
bringing in food, drinks, hats, T-shirts and badges for all involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Although just about every local service club has events to organize over the 
course of Conejo Valley Days, the task of putting Special Kids Day together is 
particularly challenging to the tiny Zonta Club, which has only 28 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a struggle, but every year we just hope for the best," said 
Martha Desch, a member of the club which promotes the advancement of women. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before the event, organizers feared they would not be able to pull it 
off. Fewer than half of the 400 volunteers needed had signed up to help. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 10:30 a.m. Friday, every child was spoken for, and the organizers were 
able to step back and admire what they had accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at them out there," Desch said as she viewed the park filled with 
laughing children on colorful rides. "They're just living it up." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the rides and the food, nearly every child had the chance to 
play carnival games and win prizes, all of which were donated by the Los 
Angeles-based company that organizes the games and concession stands for the 
five-day carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they win you wouldn't believe the way the kids just light up," said 
Kristee Blash, 15, as she handed out giant inflated pink lollipops and yellow 
saxophones. "They are just thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the carnival crews that donated their time to the event, the 
400 volunteers included high school students, off-duty police officers and 
firefighters, politicians, business leaders and others looking for a way to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got about a dozen firefighters who are taking their vacation days to be 
here for this," said Dave Pumphrey, a Ventura County firefighter who gave 
children tours of a fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come up here and just want to meet us and look at the truck and a lot of 
them tell us they want to be firefighters when they grow up," Pumphrey said. 
"It's really gratifying for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival resumed Friday afternoon at 5 after two days of low attendance, 
attributed in part to cool weather. On Thursday, 2,987 people visited the 
event, down from 3,342 on the second day in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days officials said Friday that they were counting on a surge of 
attendance over the weekend to make up for the low turnouts the first two days.

MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, THERE'S A MESSAGE HERE; REPORT OF LOW QUARTERLY GROWTH 
SHOULD GRAB FED'S ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The surprising slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter has 
unsettled financial markets. At 2.6%, the increase in the nation's gross 
domestic product was almost a full percentage point short of the 3.5% expected 
by many analysts and was less than half the 7% increase posted in the fourth 
quarter. At the same time, if the number wasn't exactly thrilling it was 
respectable: After all, economic growth proved to be steady in the first three 
months and the new statistics reveal that the economy is not overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the markets are in turmoil -- as they seem to be so often 
lately. The ghost spooking the market this time is said to be the widening fear 
that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates for the fourth time 
this year -- perhaps as soon as next month. Adding to the jitters is the 
concern that a strengthening of the German mark and the Japanese yen against 
the dollar -- meaning that a dollar will buy fewer marks and yen -- will put 
additional pressure on the Fed to increase interest rates in hopes of 
attracting more foreign investments. Indeed, the Fed intervened in foreign 
exchange markets on Friday to bolster the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the Fed is hyperactive now. Three times since February, Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan opted for a preemptive strike against inflation that also aimed 
to wring out market speculation; this took the form of raising the short-term 
interest rates that the Fed charges banks. The last thing needed now is yet 
another move upward, for that might drive up long-term interest rates even 
more. And that in turn would mean higher borrowing costs for consumers, who 
already have seen mortgage rates spike up just as the spring home-buying season 
was beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher long-term interest rates could depress home sales at a time when 
economic data gives further evidence of weakening in the economic surge that 
closed out 1993. Although sales of new homes jumped 11.1% in March, the biggest 
increase in six months, personal income rose only 0.6% last month and consumer 
spending increased only 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In recovering from its worst slump since the Great Depression, California has 
lagged badly behind most of the rest of the nation. Before the Fed began 
punching up interest rates some analysts saw the state as being on the verge of 
a dramatic comeback. But such hopes were based on forecasts of mortgage rates 
below 8%. Now fixed rate, 30-year home loans are above that. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation thus has begun an economic recovery without California. But it has 
long been recognized that any recovery might stall without a resurgence in 
California, which accounts for about 15% of the gross domestic product. The 
Federal Reserve Board's interest rate game plan is aimed at keeping the 
national recovery under inflationary control, but its castor-oil prescriptions 
are not the right remedy for California. The Fed would be wiser to understand 
that a moderate national recovery that includes this state is far more 
sustainable than one that leaves behind a recessionary California, gasping for 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed must be reminded that the first-quarter GDP figures give evidence that 
the economy is not overheating and inflationary pressures are not immense. It 
should forget about any more interest rate hikes for the time being.

FOLLOW-UP AS A TOOL FOR REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kolts Commission and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department are 
conducting their sometimes tense relationship in the manner of mature adults. 
That is both refreshing and commendable. There is much at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kolts panel was created by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
amid increasing criticism of the Sheriff's Department. The supervisors were 
wise to have done that: In July, 1992, they got a thorough report about what 
was wrong with the department and how it might be fixed. The Kolts report 
echoed the valuable work the Christopher Commission had done in analyzing 
problems in the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One key difference between the two efforts, however, was that the Christopher 
recommendations did not include a formal mechanism for periodic follow-up 
review. The Kolts recommendations did. They provided for semiannual reviews by 
the panel's staff, headed by special counsel Merrick Bobb. 
</P>
<P>
 Another helpful difference was that Sheriff Sherman Block, the department's 
elected head, did not fight the panel every inch of the way but instead 
accepted its central premise that the department could and must be improved. 
Block has chosen to work with the panel rather than resist it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the relationship has not always been harmonious, and it is clear from 
reading between the lines of the recently released second semiannual report 
that a lot more work needs to be done. Naturally, some reforms had to be kept 
on hold because of budgetary considerations. But others that could have moved 
forward haven't gotten anywhere (for example, working to reduce the time that 
deputies are stuck in mind-numbing jailhouse assignments, moving more quickly 
to investigate sheriff's stations that become trouble spots and dealing with 
command officers who still escape accountability by laying blame on those lower 
in rank). And the evaluating panel expresses concern about instances when the 
department was slow to produce needed information. 
</P>
<P>
 All that said, the promising part of this process is that on balance the Kolts 
panel remains enthusiastic about its relationship with the department and 
optimistic about the future. Sheriff Block, the report notes, has agreed to 
accept an outside ombudsman to review citizen complaints and, if needed, to let 
a panel of judges review certain complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike other police departments," the new report says, "the personnel in the 
LASD are not divided into a host of mutually antagonistic camps. Some of the 
brightest and most moral and decent individuals we have come across work in the 
. . . department. Our disagreements . . . may be as vigorous as ever, but we 
have increasing comfort that our relationship with the department is 
characterized by mutual respect, good faith, and a common set of goals." 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds like a sensible formula for success.

WOMAN TO HONOR HER SLAIN SISTER IN PARADE; FESTIVAL: AT CONEJO VALLEY DAYS, 
MARY JANE MOOREFIELD WEARS WESTERN OUTFIT MADE BY JUNE ABE, KILLED IN 
MURDER-SUICIDE.

<P>
 For five months, June Abe worked on an outfit to wear in the 1994 ladies 
Western dress contest at Conejo Valley Days. She had won the contest in 1993 
and hoped to win it again. 
</P>
<P>
 But in February, before Abe could finish the glitzy outfit, her husband, Carl, 
fatally shot his 35-year-old wife and then turned the gun on himself, leaving 
their three children orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, June Abe's sister, Mary Jane Moorefield, wore the white and fuchsia 
outfit in the same contest, which also featured a raffle that raised $425 for 
the couple's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Moorefield will participate in the Conejo Valley Days Parade as one of 
the contest winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish my sister had been there," said Moorefield, who flew in from her 
Danville, Va., home for the event. "People have been extremely generous. They 
really cared about June." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of June Abe (pronounced AH-bee) wanted to pay tribute to her and help 
her children, said Mary Currie, who organized the contest and raffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a real tragedy that the kids were left alone," Currie said. "Just 
thinking about my children being in a similar situation hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Feb. 10 shooting at the Abe home in Moorpark, Moorefield has taken 
the three Abe children -- ages 6, 3 and 1 -- into her custody and cared for 
them at her home in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorefield, 45 and single, said she is adopting her niece and two nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are like my grandchildren," Moorefield said. "I helped to raise June and 
now I am raising her children." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time that Moorefield and the oldest child, Paige Abe, 6, 
have returned to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, we are really excited about the contest," said Moorefield, who wore the 
outfit, decorated with glittery sequins and stones. Moorefield also wore the 
silver-braided belt that June Abe won in last year's contest. 
</P>
<P>
 During the contest, in memory of her mother, Paige Abe paraded in a white 
Western outfit and was awarded a 2-foot-tall wooden trophy donated by one of 
the contest's sponsors and a plate buckle. 
</P>
<P>
 June Abe had been an avid country-Western dancer who worked out of her house 
making fancy country-Western hats and shirts, which she sold at country dance 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carl Abe left his children financially provided for, Moorefield said 
it was touching to see June Abe's friends trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how generous people have been," said Moorefield, who owns a 
company that makes business forms. 
</P>
<P>
 After her sister's death, Moorefield said she received several calls from 
people in the community offering to run errands for her and even to adopt the 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorefield said she would not consider letting someone else rear her sister's 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so fortunate that I got them," Moorefield said, her eyes welling with 
tears. "I am thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorefield, who has no children of her own, said the 1-year-old boy now calls 
her "Mommy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I was concerned that Carl's family would want to adopt the 
children," Moorefield said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said Carl Abe left a cassette tape asking his brother, who lives in La 
Mirada, to adopt the children. But the brother, who has four children of his 
own, agreed to let Moorefield raise them. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorefield said it has been difficult for the children to adjust, particularly 
Paige. On the morning of the slaying, she said, Paige found her father dead on 
the floor of the family's master bedroom. Her mother, who had filed for divorce 
a few days before, lay dead in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is going through phases," Moorefield said. "First, she blamed herself and 
now she thinks it was an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Paige and the 4-year-old boy, Chase, have been seeing counselors.  
</P>
<P>
 Paige is already attending school in Virginia and Chase will start next year. 
Moorefield has hired a full-time housekeeper to help her care for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to give them a lot of love," Moorefield said. "They will have the 
best."

FOR SOME, A TAN WILL BECOME CHEAPER; STATE EXPERIMENT IS CUTTING BEACH PARKING 
FEES AT HUNTINGTON BEACH AND BOLSA CHICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, the pleasures of the beach. The sun. The waves. The $6 parking fee. Six 
dollars? 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the California Department of Parks and Recreation raised 
parking charges at a number of state beaches. The state definitely needed the 
extra income. Still, $6 is a hefty price, especially for someone planning to 
stay only an hour or two. 
</P>
<P>
 When the increase took effect three years ago at Huntington Beach state beach, 
increasing numbers of beach-goers started parking on nearby streets. Residents 
found streets clogged and parking spaces nonexistent, and the state's revenue 
from the fees plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the state announced a two-month trial reduction to $5, starting 
Sunday, for parking at the Huntington Beach and nearby Bolsa Chica state 
beaches. That should placate local residents if it gets cars back into the 
beach lots, but it might also serve as a kind of "supply-side" experiment that 
eventually could increase revenues at other Southern California beaches. State 
officials say they hope to attract enough additional cars to Huntington Beach 
to make up for the $1 cut and that they might try the program at other beaches 
if it is successful. It's worth a look. Cities and counties that operate 
beaches also should monitor the test and perhaps reduce their parking fees, 
some of them higher than $6. (Weekend parking fees at some Los Angeles County 
beaches are as high as $7.) 
</P>
<P>
 State officials and Orange County beach cities sparred earlier this year over 
the issue of curfews, and in that instance a state agency correctly if 
belatedly listened to what the localities directly affected had to say.  
</P>
<P>
 Adjusting parking fees in response to neighborhood concerns and allowing 
localities to do what they have to do to make their beaches safe are examples 
of how the cities and the state should cooperate on coastal issues. Both have 
to work to find ways to bring one of the state's major assets within the reach 
of most without unduly penalizing those lucky enough to live close to the 
waves.

COAL MINING AND HOPI WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial, "Saving the Hopi Culture" (April 14), requires clarification 
and correction. The Hopi culture is not in danger from Peabody Western Coal 
Co.'s use of water from the Black Mesa in Arizona. Rather, it appears members 
of the Hopi Tribe wish to have a pipeline for their future growth and economic 
development. Why else would they be proposing a 50,000-acre-feet-per-year 
pipeline when Peabody Western only uses 3,500-acre-feet per year? The facts are 
as stated below. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabody Western Coal Co. extracts water from the Navajo aquifer, which lies 
more than 2,500-3,000 feet beneath the Black Mesa. This water is primarily used 
in transporting coal in a pipeline from the Black Mesa mine to the Mohave Power 
Station in Nevada. The pipeline allows 4.5 million tons of coal to be 
transported annually across the high desert in an environmentally benign way. 
The water is also used a second time at the power plant, thereby reducing the 
water extracted from the Colorado River at the plant. Under agreements with the 
Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation, which were renewed as recently as 1987, Peabody 
Western pays the tribes more than $46 million per year for water, coal 
royalties and taxes, and provides more than 850 Native Americans with 
well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopi Tribe has now apparently reversed its position on our use of the 
water from the Navajo aquifer, even though numerous studies, including a 1993 
study undertaken jointly by Peabody Western and the two tribes, concluded that 
Peabody Western's use of water from the Navajo aquifer has no significant 
adverse impact on ground-water use on the Hopi Reservation. We are not aware of 
any "fact-based studies" which contradict these results. The Navajo aquifer 
encompasses an area of approximately 5,400 square miles and in the entire 
35-year life of the mining operation, less than one-tenth of 1% of the water in 
the Navajo aquifer will be consumed by our operations.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hopi seem to propose a Lake Powell pipeline as a means to address their 
concerns about flows from certain springs, but their proposal misses that 
point. Changes in the flows from their springs may be the result of drought 
conditions in the region, and perhaps from the increased pumpage from Hopi 
community wells located near these springs. Peabody Western is sympathetic to 
the Hopi concern about their springs, but Peabody Western's pumping from wells 
that are 2,500-3,000 feet deep does not affect these springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabody Western has offered to work cooperatively to review the practicalityof 
a smaller Lake Powell pipeline alternative. However, such a proposal is very 
complicated. In addition to the economic and environmental considerations of 
the pipeline construction, there is the problem of water rights. The parties 
currently have no water rights from Lake Powell and existing water rights are 
the subject of complex interstate arrangements and disputes. Certainly, the 
parties must cooperate if the pipeline is to receive proper consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Mesa mine has been thoroughly reviewed in previous environmental 
impact statements and has operated successfully for 25 years. Renewal of the 
Black Mesa mining permit has been pending before the U.S. Department of the 
Interior for nine years. On the basis of the government's supervised water 
studies, renewal of the permit is long overdue.

UNWED TEEN PARENTS AND WELFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Caryl Rivers' article "Is Any Husband Better Than None?" (Commentary, April 
19) was interesting and informative. However, like so many recent articles 
involving men and women, it was written to portray the female as the victim and 
the male counterpart as the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a sexist issue. The answer, if there is one, is pregnancy 
reduction. Education and access to contraception are certainly part of the 
answer to this problem, as is responsible parenthood. Each of these teens have 
parents, where are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Women who have children out of wedlock are no more and no less irresponsible 
than the biological father, they are simply the sex that gets pregnant. Is a 
15-year-old girl who gets pregnant from her gang-member boyfriend or a woman 
who gives birth to a child of a crack addict, any more mature than the gang 
member or the crack addict? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to the question, "Is any husband better than none?" is obviously, 
no. The same answer is appropriate to the question, "Is any wife better than 
none?" or "Is any mother or father better than none?" I do agree with Rivers' 
conclusion that marriage under such circumstances is not the answer. As a 
divorce attorney, I get my share of business from those who think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not offended by a young woman who has one child and is on welfare 
(provided she is attending school or making some effort to become 
self-supporting). I am offended by a welfare recipient who has three or four 
children, is pregnant and whose parents and grandparents were also on welfare. 
That is a lifestyle, not an interim solution.  
</P>
<P>
 The real problem in our society is lack of responsibility.

 * There are half a dozen references to unwed teen-age pregnancy, and about as 
many to welfare payments for unmarried mothers, but not one mention of the 
words maturity , responsibility , or commitment . The word love does manage to 
get in.  
</P>
<P>
 Rivers ends: "Marriage is a wonderful institution, the source of love, joy and 
nurture. But it's not a quick fix for social problems." If Rivers is right, 
what happens when she convinces us that teen-age unwed pregnancy and parenting 
are all right; who will work to pay the taxes to support the welfare to pay the 
children having children?

 * Lisbeth B. Schorr's column "Help the Parent, but Not at the Child's Expense" 
(Commentary, April 18) misses the boat on many important points. First, it 
takes parents rather than a parent to have a child. Two, although Schorr's 
article purports to have the child's interest paramount she only wants to 
maintain the status quo position of the government being the substitute husband 
for single mothers by providing welfare checks. The interest of the child is 
best served by having two parents, a mother and a father.  
</P>
<P>
 I propose that only families with a father and a mother present receive 
welfare benefits. And only for a limited time. Let's put the father back in the 
family where he belongs.

POLITICAL FUNDS REFORM INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The selected comments of California Common Cause Executive Director Ruth 
Holton quoted in your April 21 article, "Hayden Supports Campaign Reform 
Initiative for 1996," created an incorrect impression of the position of the 
organization. The article suggests that Common Cause is not supporting a 
recently submitted campaign finance reform initiative because it may be 
sponsored by gubernatorial candidate Tom Hayden. This is incorrect. We have not 
yet taken a position on the initiative, which contains many elements we have 
supported in the past, because it was filed very recently and our board has not 
yet had an opportunity to consider it. Whether Tom Hayden sponsors or supports 
the initiative will have no bearing on Common Cause's position. While it is 
correct that Common Cause does not endorse political candidates, we have 
supported initiative measures in the past that were sponsored by candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also implies, in part through selected quotations from Holton, 
that Hayden may only be advancing this reform initiative as a vehicle for his 
gubernatorial candidacy. That implication is totally inconsistent with the 
facts. Hayden has for years been one of the most vocal and active supporters of 
meaningful campaign finance reform in California. While we do not endorse him 
or any other candidate for governor, we applaud state Sen. Hayden for making 
campaign finance reform a central part of his platform and of the campaign 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 We urge the other candidates for governor similarly to make campaign finance 
reform a top priority. Four elected officials have been convicted of exchanging 
votes for campaign contributions. The public's confidence in elected officials 
is at an all-time low because of the money that is flowing into the state 
Capitol from special interests. Until the campaign finance system is reformed, 
public policy will continue to be shaped by the demands of moneyed special 
interests rather than the needs of the public.

PIPE BOMB RIPS CAR, JOLTS SIMI NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pipe bomb exploded beneath a sports car in Simi Valley, peppering nearby 
homes with chunks of shrapnel that narrowly missed one young couple's heads, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blast late Thursday, but the explosion severely 
damaged the car and jolted residents awake in a quiet cul-de-sac surrounded by 
middle-class homes at the end of Calle La Sombra, in Simi Valley's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said they do not know who detonated the bomb or why, but they were 
waiting to interview the apparent intended victim, Richard Scott Taylor, 28, 
whose 1979 Mazda RX-7 was seriously damaged by the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who police said is unemployed, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Lt. Mark Layhew said someone had threatened several months 
ago to hurt Taylor, but there is no evidence yet tying those threats to the 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Layhew said the blast was the first incident of an explosive device in the 
city since two high-school pranksters blew up a sign, a public telephone and a 
series of mailboxes with small pipe bombs in March of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the device set off Thursday night was larger and more powerful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb was 7 inches long, 1 1/2 inches in diameter and was lit from a grassy 
area nearby with a 7 1/2-foot-long fuse. "It was fairly substantial," Layhew 
said of the device. 
</P>
<P>
 It was placed almost directly under the center of the car and when it went off 
it flung shrapnel and car parts up and into the car's interior, according to an 
initial report by Senior Officer Darin Muehler.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the larger fragments passed completely through the car and out of the 
windshield on the passenger side. Shrapnel also punctured the car's oil pan, 
flooding the street with oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shrapnel struck nearby homes, including one piece that plunged through a 
closed bedroom window 120 feet from the blast site, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katrina Kuratli said she and her husband, Dan, had just lain down in their 
bedroom when the bomb went off around 10:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a bang, and I heard a ping, and I looked up to see where that 
shrapnel -- a fragment of the pipe bomb -- went through our window and through 
the wall," she said. "And it went into our neighbors' living room -- this is a 
common wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuratli pointed to a shattered window, her finger drawing a path just 2 1/2 
feet above the pillows to a hole in the wall the size of her fist. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought there was like a random shooting," she said. "I thought 
somebody had shot a shotgun, especially when I saw the hole in the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuratli said she called 911 "in tears, telling them to get out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the bomb startled them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped a good foot -- 2 1/2 feet," said Neil Jackson, who lives next door 
to the apartment where Taylor was staying temporarily with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure scared the hell out of us," said Erik Lorenz, of Newport Beach, who 
was visiting Jackson. "Have you ever seen that movie 'The Terminator,' where 
he's throwing pipe bombs? It sounded just like that. I've heard a stick of 
dynamite go off before, and it was as loud as a stick of dynamite."

POPCORN IN THEATERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Popcorn is not only a hazard to your health but to the aesthetic enjoyment of 
a movie. When we go to a live play in a theater, we don't have to cope with the 
rancid stench of popcorn oil, the crunching of teeth, the smacking of lips. 
That's why my family stays away from movie theaters and rents videos.

DODGERS LET METS OFF HOOK IN EIGHTH, 6-4; BASEBALL: THINGS ARE LOOKING UP UNTIL 
CANDIOTTI AND TREADWAY LEAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He sat at his desk in the visitors' clubhouse Friday night, eating. Patiently, 
Manager Tom Lasorda tried to answer questions about his team's 6-4 loss to the 
New York Mets.  
</P>
<P>
 Between answers, though, it became increasing clear that the frustration of 
playing without his regular second baseman or a dominating left-handed reliever 
is beginning to take its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cold, damp night at Shea Stadium, starter Tom Candiotti left after seven 
innings, turning a 4-3 lead over to the bullpen. But by the end of the eighth, 
the Mets had scored three runs on two walks, a hit batter, an error and one 
hit. The Dodgers went quietly in the ninth, with John Franco earning his fifth 
save. Bret Saberhagen (3-1) pitched eight innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way, I'm not happy," Lasorda said. "These are the kind of 
games that keep you up all night." 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Darren Dreifort, who started the eighth inning, walked David 
Segui, and Lasorda brought in left-hander Gary Wayne (1-3) to pitch to 
left-handed pinch-hitter Joe Orsulak.  
</P>
<P>
 "You bring a left-handed pitcher to pitch to the left-handed batters, that's 
what we got him down there for," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne got two strikes on Orsulak, pitching him outside before Mike Piazza 
called for a breaking ball. But Wayne, who had faced Orsulak before, shook 
Piazza off. "I wanted to bust him in, because when I faced him with the 
Orioles, he dived for it and hit it, and he was diving at stuff tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wayne's pitch was a little too far inside, and he hit Orsulak, putting 
runners at first and second with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wayne) is 0-2 to the left-hander and winds up hitting him," Lasorda said. 
"He's got to get him out, if he does, there are two out and a runner on first 
base and that changes it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Hundley followed with a single to left field to score the tying run. 
Then, Lasorda started pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne had Tom Cangelosi down 1-and-2, then walked him. "He had him struck out, 
but the umpire said it was low," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a double switch, Todd Worrell was brought in to relieve Wayne and Cory 
Snyder, who was in right field, took over at second base for Jeff Treadway, who 
had made the final out of the eighth inning. Mitch Webster went into right and 
would lead off the ninth inning, batting in the pitcher's spot. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bench was Delino DeShields, who joined the team for the first time 
since suffering a concussion last Saturday night, but he won't be available 
until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 So Lasorda used his third-string second baseman, who has played the position 
only five times in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Vizcaino hit a routine grounder to Snyder, who tried to backhand it to 
make the throw to the plate, but the ball skipped under his glove and into 
right field. The Mets scored two runs to go ahead, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell struck out the next two batters to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing back and it hit on the edge of the dirt and didn't come up," 
Snyder said. "It was a double-play ball and a clutch play that I needed to 
make, and I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder made his first career start at second base on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the second baseman is in the lineup, he would have played there," Lasorda 
said. "When you are a man short, what are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields wasn't on the bench when Snyder made the error; he was already back 
in the clubhouse.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it, though," he said quietly.  
</P>
<P>
 And on that subject he said nothing else.

RED SOX JUMP ON LEFTWICH; BASEBALL: BOSTON TAKES QUICK 4-0 LEAD EN ROUTE TO A 
6-4 VICTORY OVER ANGELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, a change of venue meant nothing. The results were the same for the 
Angels and starting pitcher Phil Leftwich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who were swept in three games at Boston last weekend, couldn't 
handle the Red Sox again, and Leftwich couldn't overcome a horrible start, 
losing his fourth game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-run first inning was too much to overcome and the Angels fell, 6-4, 
before 30,178 Friday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, the Angels held a short team meeting, but Manager Buck 
Rodgers, who was ejected by home plate umpire John Hirschbeck for arguing a 
called third strike on Chad Curtis in the fifth, said nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I wanted you to know what was said, I would have invited you in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich recovered to pitch 7 2/3 solid innings, but he looked as if he 
wouldn't survive the first inning. Four batters into the game, the Red Sox had 
a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a leadoff walk to Otis Nixon, he gave up singles to Mike Greenwell and 
Tim Naehring. Naehring's hard-hit single to left-center scored Nixon for the 
game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
 Mo Vaughn then slammed a 1-and-2 pitch 10 rows deep into the right-field 
stands for a three-run homer and a 4-0 lead before Leftwich could record an 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers wouldn't say Leftwich's future with the Angels rested with this start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for him," Rodgers said. "It's important for us. It's not a 
make-or-break start. We're not going to ship him to Siberia. It's important in 
the grand scheme of things." 
</P>
<P>
 With injured starters Joe Magrane and Mark Langston expected back next month 
and rookie Brian Anderson pitching so well, Leftwich needed to impress in order 
to stay in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a bad outing, but even if he had overwhelmed Boston, it might not 
have been enough to keep him from being sent to triple-A Vancouver when Magrane 
and Langston are sound again. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the second, he pitched super," Rodgers said. "We were just in such a 
hole we couldn't make it back. I think obviously after the first it was a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it serves as a kick in the butt for him, it's a good performance. If it 
just means he can pitch better when he's down, 4-0, it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 But it certainly didn't help matters that Leftwich faced a Red Sox team that 
was putting the finishing touches on the finest April in club history. 
</P>
<P>
 A congratulatory note from General Manager Dan Duquette was posted in the 
visitors' clubhouse before the game. It read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Butch (Hobson) and team, congrats on winning more games in April than 
any other Red Sox team in history. We're off to a great start. Keep it going!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox improved to 16-7 with their ninth victory in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston starter Aaron Sele (3-0) held the Angels to a single by rookie catcher 
Jorge Fabregas in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis ended Sele's shutout bid with a leadoff homer in the seventh. Sele 
didn't make it out of the inning, giving way to Scott Bankhead after walking 
the next batter, Eduardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead avoided further trouble by retiring the next three batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sele left after giving up five hits and one run with seven strikeouts and one 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 6-1, entering the bottom of the eighth, the Angels rallied. Scott 
Cooper, hitting .436 in the last 11 games before Friday, had hit the first 
pitch from reliever Bob Patterson for a two-run home run to right in the top of 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Damion Easley hit a two-run homer off Bankhead and Dwight Smith later 
scored when Perez grounded into a double play with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Boston Manager Hobson went with Ken Ryan rather than standout 
closer Jeff Russell, who saved victories over Oakland Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who would pick up his first save, was in immediate trouble through 
little fault of his own. Fabregas reached base on an infield single and Harold 
Reynolds grounded into what should have been a double play, but Cooper threw 
the ball into right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina sacrificed to put the tying runs on second and third, but 
Easley struck out and Smith grounded out to end the game.

GOLF ROUNDUP; KITE'S HOT STREAK PUTS HIM IN LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Kite used a five-hole run of four birdies and an eagle en route to a 
seven-under 65 Friday and a two-shot lead over rookie Mike Heinen after the 
second round of the Houston Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite was one under through 11 holes when he birdied No. 12, eagled the 13th 
and birdied the next three holes to reach 11-under 133 after two trips around 
the Tournament Players Course at The Woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden the balls started going in," Kite said of his 30 on the back 
nine. "Why? I don't know. But I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 His 65 was the best round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinen, who opened at 67, shot a four-under 68 in his second round. The 
nine-under 135 is his best so far during his first year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite, the tour's career earnings leader with $8.8 million, never has won a 
tournament in his home state of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Florida don't make a big deal out of winning Florida. People in 
California don't make a big deal out of winning in California. But we have our 
own little nation here in Texas . . . and we make a much bigger deal out of 
it," he said. "No question I'd like to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit Zarley and Larry Gilbert each shot six-under 66 to share the lead after 
the first round of the Las Vegas Senior Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley, who led last year after the first round, and Gilbert, coming off a 
victory last week at the Dallas Reunion Pro-Am, were two shots ahead of Jack 
Kiefer, George Archer and Raymond Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley and Gilbert are among 56 players using the TPC stadium course at 
Summerlin for the first time since leaving the Desert Inn, the site of the 
$900,000 tournament for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trish Johnson's second-round 68 gave her a nine-under 135 total, one better 
than Michelle McGann, Sherri Steinhauer and Kelly Robbins after 36 holes of the 
$1.2-million Sprint Championship at Daytona Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time I started playing decent golf," said Johnson, who said she 
had been lucky to shoot 67 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhauer, McGann and Robbins all matched first-day 68s to stay within a shot 
of the lead and build a four-stroke cushion over their closest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round leader, Alicia Dibos of Peru, soared to a 76 Friday and was 
seven shots back at 142.

CLIPPERS SEEM TO DELIGHT IN STAYING AT THE BOTTOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to emphasize one point: The Clippers are simply the worst 
organization in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Other organizations try to get better. Donald Sterling actually looks forward 
to the NBA lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 This team has had only one good coach in the last 10 years and he left last 
year. The Clippers hired Bob Weiss, who has never had much success anywhere he 
has coached. They could have had Lenny Wilkens, but they wasted time and he 
ended up in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are the laughingstock of professional sports, and nobody seems to 
care but the fans.

 Please, Grahame Jones, enough already with your sour grapes regarding

 Boxing is crooked. Evander Holyfield was robbed. You know something's wrong

happened when the judges robbed Pernell Whitaker when he beat Julio Cesar

 How about requiring judges to post their scores after every round, on a

IN RAMS' WAR ROOM, THEY REMAIN PREPARED FOR GROUND OFFENSIVE

 Congratulations to the Rams for conducting a shrewd 1994 draft. Instead of 
taking a future franchise quarterback to lead them over the next 10-15 years, 
the Ram brain trust concurred that any quarterback, even Chris Miller on 
crutches, can hand off to Jerome Bettis in the Ground Chuck offense.

 After watching several segments of Sunday's draft, it struck me that I saw no 
evidence of any on-line computer support. No PCs, no terminals, just 
worried-looking guys in their "war rooms" sifting through clipboards full of 
paper. It must be WW II they are preparing for. No wonder it takes so long. I 
half expected the next draft announcement to be made by a man wearing a green 
eyeshade, celluloid cuff protectors and looking strangely like Bert Bell.

BRUINS HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER THAN THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me see if I understand this. Everyone knows that UCLA simply scalped 4,000 
Rose Bowl tickets through a third party (obtaining a $100,000 "scholarship 
contribution" from booster Angelo Mazzone, who then apparently sold the tickets 
for several times that amount), yet the official line from the athletic 
department is this: 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that a year ago the University of Washington had been stuck with 
several thousand Rose Bowl tickets, UCLA administration panicked and sold the 
4,000 tickets to Mr. Mazzone to avoid a similar catastrophe; this, despite the 
fact that a year ago Washington was competing in its third consecutive game, 
its campus is located a little farther from Pasadena than UCLA, it was more 
than a month until the game, ticket brokers had already advertised that they 
needed tickets, and season-ticket holders and alumni had already been told that 
additional tickets were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA cannot have it both ways. It cannot graduate superbly educated alumni, 
and then expect them to believe a phony story like this. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl ticket scandal is but further proof of the utter intellectual 
and moral bankruptcy of the UCLA athletic administration. Their consistent 
attitude of arrogance and contempt toward alumni, students and fans has led to 
massive disaffection, dwindling ticket sales and revenues, and now this crass 
and venal episode. 
</P>
<P>
 These are truly the Dark Ages of UCLA athletics, where mediocre, unpopular 
coaches have their contracts extended, respected head coaches and assistants 
are forced out and successful minor sports are callously sacrificed. There will 
never be a Bruin renaissance until Peter Dalis and his cohorts are removed from 
power.

 I found it interesting that when asked about the ticket sale to Mazzone and 
whether tickets were later scalped, Chancellor Young stated, "It's not illegal 
to scalp tickets. Why should I ask him?"  
</P>
<P>
 This sounds a bit hypocritical, coming from the head of a school that, as part 
of the UC system, is one of the proponents of political correctness. I suppose 
that this "as long as it's not illegal, it's OK" attitude applies only to 
school administrators, but not to students.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To all the Magic-bashing Laker fans: 
</P>
<P>
 You surely must not be from California, or just moved here, or have a bad case 
of memory loss. Magic Johnson is and always will be Los Angeles Lakers 
basketball -- playing, retired, playing, retired, coaching, retired.It's his 
privilege. He has earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be so thankful to have him around and willing to help, no matter 
what the duration. Maybe it didn't turn out like all the other Magic fairy 
tales he has treated us to, but his assessment of the team was fair and honest, 
and he certainly addressed some issues that not too many men would have the 
courage to do.

 Don't worry, Magic, you can't make everybody happy, no matter how much you do.

 The people who wrote those negative letters are probably spoiled and very 
unhappy and will be miserable for the rest of their lives.

IT'S TIME FOR ANGELS TO SNAP OUT OF THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just read that the beverage sponsor of Angel broadcasts is introducing eight 
new flavors. Does this mean the broadcasters will be interrupting play by play 
eight more times during an inning? 
</P>
<P>
 Until it is decided to speed up the game by shortening the breaks between 
innings, let's keep the commercials in these ample time periods.

NBA PLAYOFFS; NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN FOR WARRIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Barkley scored 36 points and grabbed 19 rebounds as the Phoenix Suns 
withstood a rally by Golden State for a 111-104 victory in the opening game of 
their best-of-five first-round Western Conference series Friday in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors played according to their recent history. They have lost 19 
consecutive games at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson added 24 points for the Suns, who are trying to reach the NBA 
finals for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Owens scored 27 points and Latrell Sprewell had 24 for Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley had 18 points and 11 rebounds in the first quarter as the Suns raced 
to a 38-23 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 They maintained their lead, holding a 92-80 advantage heading into the final 
quarter, which the Warriors began with a 15-2 run. That gave them a 95-94 lead, 
which came on two free throws by Keith Jennings with 7:30 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle then hit a three-pointer, Phoenix's first field goal of the 
quarter, for a 97-95 lead the Suns would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens had a dunk to bring the Warriors within 107-104 with 47 seconds to play. 
After Cedric Ceballos missed a jump shot, Golden State had the ball on a 
three-on-one fast break, but Majerle intercepted a pass by Jennings intended 
for Sprewell, who was wide open for a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson then missed two free throws with 16 seconds to play, but Barkley got 
the offensive rebound and tipped it in to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 91, New Jersey 80 -- Patrick Ewing, surrounded by defenders most of 
the game, led a decisive 10-0 fourth-quarter run and combined with Charles 
Smith to boost the Knicks to a victory in Game 1 at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We limited them to one shot, and Charles and Patrick made some timely 
baskets," Knick Coach Pat Riley said. "We don't try to trick anybody. We just 
get the ball to our strongest players." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing and Smith scored 11 points each in New York's 28-point fourth quarter. 
Ewing finished with 25 points and 13 rebounds and Smith had 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy, but I'm not overly excited about my performance," said the 
6-foot-10 Smith, who has been criticized in the media and booed at Madison 
Square Garden for soft play. "Coach Riley has really pushed me to get back into 
the offense. I'm not concerned with the crowd. If I have to worry about what 
they think instead of winning the game, I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams set an NBA record for fewest points in the first half of a playoff 
game as the Knicks took a 35-33 halftime lead. The previous mark was 69 points, 
by Syracuse and Ft. Wayne in 1955 and Seattle and Utah in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks, with Ewing missing 13 of his first 17 shots, trailed, 68-64, 
before he started the winning burst with a three-point play. Smith put New York 
ahead with a layup, and when he missed a free throw, Ewing made it 71-68 with 
an emphatic rebound dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing finished the run with an assist to a wide-open Greg Anthony for a 
three-pointer, giving the Knicks a 74-68 lead with 7:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman scored 27 points for the Nets, who defeated New York in four 
of five regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 104, Cleveland 96 -- Scottie Pippen scored 31 points and Scott 
Williams had 13 of his 21 in the final quarter at Chicago as the Bulls began 
their quest for a fourth consecutive NBA title, beating the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers played without the heart of their inside game as John Williams, 
Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance watched from the bench in street clothes because 
of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price, Cleveland's leading scorer at 17.3 points per game, managed only 
nine points. Gerald Wilkins led Cleveland with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, who became the Bulls' leader when Michael Jordan retired and took up 
baseball, led a third-quarter surge and then had two spectacular baskets in the 
fourth quarter. He also finished with 12 rebounds. His 31 points were one short 
of his playoff high. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 114, Portland 104 -- Vernon Maxwell broke out of a shooting drought 
with 10 consecutive points late in the game, leading the Rockets to a 
opening-game victory at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets were protecting a 97-95 lead with 5:20 to play when Maxwell -- who 
scored 24 points and made five three-pointers -- started his charge. He hit 
consecutive three-point baskets and then two jump shots, giving Houston a 
107-98 lead with 2:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell made his first four baskets of the game, but then missed six of his 
next seven before heating up again. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 15 three-pointers to match a playoff record, and Terry 
Porter's four second-quarter three-pointers equaled the record for one quarter.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; CANADIENS ASK TOO MUCH OF ROY IN LOSS TO BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Roy had to have a bad game eventually, and when it happened Friday, 
there was little the defending Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens could do 
to extend their season. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy had played spectacularly in getting the Canadiens to a seventh game in 
their first-round playoff series against the Boston Bruins, stopping 99 of 102 
shots in victories in Games 4 and 5. But he lost Game 6 and allowed four goals 
on the Bruins' first 16 shots of a 5-3 victory Friday night in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just justice that was made," Montreal Coach Jacques Demers said. "They 
should have won the series long ago. We were fortunate to be here for Game 7." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the spectacular play of Roy had kept the Canadiens alive after he sat out 
their Game 3 loss because of appendicitis that was treated with medication. But 
he was shaky when his team needed him most. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that eventually we could get to him," said Ted Donato, who scored one 
of the three goals that went between Roy's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston led, 4-0, early in the second period and 5-1 in the third before 
Montreal rallied on goals by Kevin Haller and Mike Keane. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins begin the second round Sunday in New Jersey against the Devils, who 
beat Buffalo, 2-1, in another Game 7 showdown Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal, which lost its fourth consecutive playoff series against Boston, is 
the first defending champion to be eliminated in the first round since Calgary 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so hungry last year," Demers said. "We won the Cup because we were 
together. We pushed together. I don't think everybody was pushing together" 
against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The hungry player was Boston goalie Jon Casey, overshadowed during most of the 
series by Roy and maligned throughout New England for ineffective play much of 
the season. Casey had been benched in Games 3 and 4 but stopped 26 shots 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick is a great goalie. We've all seen that this series," Casey said. "I 
just try to be steady out there. I'm not trying to vindicate anything. I'm just 
trying to do my job." 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Buffalo 1 -- The Devils ended four years of first-round playoff 
frustration by outlasting the Sabres and Dominik Hasek at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Lemieux snapped a second-period tie with the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey didn't get to the next round until Buffalo's Dale Hawerchuk clanged 
a shot off the goal post with 16 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sabres went four overtimes and 70 shots Wednesday to force a seventh 
game, they were able to muster only 18 shots on Devil goalie Martin Brodeur. 
Only Hasek kept them in the game, stopping one shot after another in finishing 
with 45 saves.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BLUE JAYS HAVE HELP IN RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a night for Toronto's reserves at Minneapolis. Mike Huff, replacing 
center fielder Devon White, had three hits and tripled in two runs. Dick 
Schofield, replacing shortstop Alex Gonzalez and batting only .143, added four 
hits and two runs batted in as the Blue Jays defeated the Twins, 12-7, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Borders had three hits and John Olerud had two hits and three RBIs for 
Toronto, which pounded five Minnesota pitchers for 16 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why you keep plugging away, taking extra batting practice, so you're 
ready when the time comes," Schofield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby Puckett and Jeff Reboulet hit three-run homers for the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Guzman (3-2) held the Twins scoreless until the seventh inning, when an 
RBI triple by Alex Cole and Puckett's three-run homer brought the Twins to 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto had lost two in a row and four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Tapani (1-2) absorbed the loss for the Twins, who have given up 35 runs 
in their last four games, a stretch that includes a no-hitter by Scott 
Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto batted around in the eighth inning to put the game out of reach. 
Schofield drove in two runs with a single and Olerud hit a bases-loaded double 
to give the Blue Jays an 11-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had one game where we lost a six-run lead in the ninth," said Paul 
Molitor, remembering a game against the Angels two weeks ago. "So we just keep 
trying to score some runs. Right now, teams are out there with the philosophy 
that you never quite have enough." 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Oakland 6 -- Jim Abbott staggered through five innings at 
Oakland, giving up four runs, eight hits, eight walks and a wild pitch, but it 
was enough to give him his third victory in five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Polonia doubled three times, drove in three runs, scored twice and made 
an over-the-fence grab in the first inning to rob Ruben Sierra of a three-run 
homer and extend the Athletics' losing streak to 11. Oakland also dropped 11 in 
a row from June 8-18, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees knocked out Bob Welch (0-3) after 1 1/3 innings, his shortest 
start since June 30, 1984, when he worked one inning against the Chicago Cubs 
while with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch lost his seventh consecutive game, including his final four decisions of 
1993. His earned-run average ballooned to 8.18. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 4, Chicago 3 -- Kirk Gibson hit a two-run triple in the sixth inning 
at Detroit, sending the Tigers past the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gullickson (1-1) won for the second time in seven decisions against 
Chicago, giving up two runs and eight hits in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Henneman gave up an RBI single to Robin Ventura in the ninth, but struck 
out Dan Pasqua with two runners on for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere (2-1) lost for the first time since Aug. 8. He had nine consecutive 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Texas 4 -- Kenny Lofton homered with one out in the 12th inning 
as the Indians won at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton stood near home plate and watched his drive against Jay Howell (2-1) 
sail into the right-field seats. The home run, his third, improved the Indians 
to 4-0 in extra innings this year; they were 2-12 in extra-inning games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time Lofton has won an extra-inning game with a homer. He 
beat the Angels in the 10th inning on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 5, Baltimore 4 -- Ken Griffey Jr. and Jay Buhner hit back-to-back home 
runs in the eighth inning to rally the Mariners to a victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Mariners trailing, 4-3, Griffey hit his seventh homer to chase 
Baltimore pitcher Jamie Moyer. Buhner followed with his fifth homer, against 
reliever Alan Mills (0-1), sending the Mariners to their fifth victory in six 
games.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BAYLOR SEES ENOUGH, SAYS PLENTY TO RELIEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Baylor has been watching relief pitchers blow game after game, so he 
simply blew up Friday afternoon in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado had a two-run lead entering the bottom of the ninth inning, but 
reliever Darren Holmes walked the first two batters and got a visit from his 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him the players have played too damn hard for you to give this away 
with bases on balls," Baylor said. "I have no beef with the way they've played. 
They've played hard. But I was not going to go like it was in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes struck out Ryne Sandberg, then gave up a run-scoring single to Mark 
Grace before getting Glenallen Hill to hit into a double play to finish a 6-5 
Colorado victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was aided by Andres Galarraga's two-out double in the fifth inning that 
gave him his 30th RBI in April, a National League record. Dale Murphy (1985) 
and Ron Cey (1977) shared the old mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's 30 also matches Joe Carter's major league RBI mark. Both finish 
their months with games today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try to break both records," Galarraga said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs would like to break a record. They are 0-9 in what has become the 
unfriendly confines of Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone's pressing," Sandberg said. "In some of those 
situations, you want to come through with a big hit and we haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, San Diego 1 -- Kirk Rueter became the first major league pitcher 
since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 to start his career with a 10-0 record, 
pitching 7 1/3 innings and striking out seven in the Expos' victory at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueter (2-0) outdueled Padre starter Andy Benes (1-5) in helping Montreal win 
its third in a row and eighth in its last nine games. Mel Rojas pitched 1 2/3 
innings of hitless relief for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooks Wiltse holds the major league record of 12 victories to start a career, 
set with the New York Giants in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueter was 8-0 with six no-decisions last season after being called up from 
the minor leagues in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 8, Florida 5 -- Brian Dorsett had two run-scoring doubles to lead 
the Reds at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsett's first double drove in Tony Fernandez to make it 5-3 in the sixth 
inning. After the teams exchanged runs in the seventh, Dorsett again drove 
Fernandez home with a two-base hit in the eighth, making it 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Red starter Tom Browning (3-0) gave up three home runs in five innings -- 
including homers by Rich Renteria and Gary Sheffield on consecutive pitches -- 
but still picked up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, San Francisco 3 -- Mariano Duncan hit a three-run homer and 
Ben Rivera pitched seven strong innings at Philadelphia as the Phillies ended 
their five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera (2-1) gave up only three hits. He retired the first 12 batters he faced 
before Matt Williams walked in the fifth inning and Barry Bonds followed with 
his sixth homer of the season for a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 8, Atlanta 5 -- With four RBIs from Jeff King and a strong start 
from previously winless Steve Cooke at Pittsburgh, the Pirates continued to 
torment the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta is 15-7 but has lost three of four to Pittsburgh, which had lost, 
19-7, to the Reds the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke (1-3) gave up six hits and withstood Fred McGriff's two-run homer in the 
fourth inning for his first victory since he beat Florida last Sept. 15. The 
left-hander lost his final two decisions in 1993 and failed to win in his first 
four starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 King had a run-scoring single in the first, a two-run double in the fifth and 
a sacrifice fly in the seventh after driving in only five runs in his first 69 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, St. Louis 3 -- Jeff Bagwell doubled home the winning run with two 
out in the 10th inning in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Biggio walked with two out, and Bagwell lined a double over the head of 
left fielder Bernard Gilkey. Biggio easily beat the throw home, making a winner 
of Mike Hampton (1-0).

SUNSET LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; CROUCH TURNS ANXIETY INTO A MARINA VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch's last performance against Fountain Valley was embarrassing. She 
was knocked around for nine hits in five innings -- "and they were shots," her 
coach recalled -- as Marina suffered its only loss to an Orange County team. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch admitted she was nervous before Friday's rematch against the Barons, 
but she directed all that anxiety into intensity and pitched a masterful game 
as second-ranked Marina scored a 2-0 Sunset League victory and pushed Fountain 
Valley a little deeper into the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This puts us in a really good position to win the league title," said Crouch 
(12-2), who lowered her earned-run average to 0.43. "That's the most important 
thing to me. I'm not into revenge or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't tell by the way she set down the Barons. She surrendered two hits 
-- one in the first, one in the sixth -- and faced only one batter over the 
minimum through the first six innings before the Viking defense committed two 
errors in the seventh. She struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcy has to be challenged, and when she feels that challenge, she's 
dangerous," Marina Coach Shelly Luth said, calling Fountain Valley's lineup the 
league's most dangerous. "She really, really wanted to win today. . . . They 
beat us pretty good last time and all the girls wanted to show we're better 
than what we showed the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 In their first meeting, the Fountain Valley game was the Vikings' fifth in 
three days, and Marina's fatigue showed as Fountain Valley scored a 7-1 
victory. Friday's game was the first the Vikings had played in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (16-2, 8-1) remained in first place in the league race. Fountain Valley 
(10-8-1, 6-3) is locked in a battle with Huntington Beach (14-6, 8-2) and Ocean 
View (13-5, 6-3) for three playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Harrelson (8-6) limited Marina to only three hits, but a defensive 
meltdown in the second inning prevented a scoreless duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynette Velazquez's soft liner over third base went for a double and Heather 
Hibben's pop-up behind first baseman Laurie Gillis fell off her glove for a 
hit. A line drive at the third baseman was dropped, loading the bases, and a 
bouncer in the hole went off the third baseman Brooke Blower's glove for an 
error, allowing two runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit one ball hard and it was caught in center field," Fountain Valley 
Coach Cary Baker said. "When we hit the ball hard, (Marina) made the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 3, Rosary 1 -- Stefanie Noffsinger struck out nine and had a 
two-run single in the fifth inning for visiting Huntington Beach (7-2 in 
league). 
</P>
<P>
 Rosary pitcher Julie Luna (5-6), who pitched the entire game, struck out seven 
allowed only three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach improves to 14-6, 7-2.

ORANGE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; VALENCIA EDGES BREA-OLINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even by Valencia's standards, Friday's 12-10 victory over Brea-Olinda was a 
little bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, whose only consistency is their inconsistency, took Coach Mike 
Scheetz on another bumpy ride at Valencia. They went from peak to valley, 
inning by inning, but the result was worth it, even to an exasperated, but 
happy coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a nightmare," Scheetz said. "It was ugly. But it would have been 
even uglier if we had lost." 
</P>
<P>
 As silver linings go, this one will do. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the Orange League victory left the Tigers tied with Brea-Olinda for 
first place with four games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Valencia is in the hunt for a third consecutive league title, 
despite its 1-8-2 nonleague record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping you weren't going to ask me about that," Scheetz said. "I can't 
explain it." 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia (8-3, 9-11-2) had to rally three times in three innings for its 
second victory against the Wildcats (18-3, 8-3), who are ranked second in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But why should this day be any different? The Tigers have buried themselves 
often, only to escape. Last week was their pinnacle, rallying from a 14-3 
deficit against Anaheim to win, 18-14. Heck, even Brea-Olinda led, 7-2, through 
five innings this season, only to lose, 13-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers' excuse Friday was nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were real tense when the game started," outfielder Chris Draft said. "It 
took us a while to get loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Tigers got the kinks worked out, they began to work Wildcat pitchers. 
Valencia had six doubles during the final three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers scored two in the fourth, three in the fifth and three in the sixth 
-- erasing a Wildcat lead each time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best thing about this group, they don't give up," Scheetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't, not with their generosity. But there was plenty of that on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia pitchers walked eight. Starter Art Francis walked in three runs in 
the second inning. The Tigers also made four errors, which led to six unearned 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda wasn't much better. Its pitchers -- five in all -- walked in three 
runs. The Wildcats also made four errors, leading to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of giving and taking out there," Scheetz said. "But we'll 
take it." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 3, Anaheim 2 -- Josh Neding scored the winning run with a two-out 
double in the second inning for Magnolia (7-11, 4-7). Catcher Matt Nester 
scored the first two runs with a single in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna 1, Western 0 -- With two men on, Eric Duff singled to drive in Steve 
Brunner for the victory. Jose Vasquez (4-1) got the victory. Savanna improved 
to 9-12, 6-5. Western dropped to 4-7 in league.

NEWSWIRE: 49ERS TIP SALARY CAP BY RELEASING BONO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Bono, the San Francisco 49ers' backup quarterback, was released Friday 
in a move aimed at giving the team more room under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono would have earned $1.55 million next season as Steve Young's backup. With 
the 49ers bumping up against the $34.6-million cap before signing any of the 
eight players drafted last week, the team has been looking to cut its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono will be free to pursue his own deal and Carmen Policy, the 49ers' 
president, said the team might try to re-sign Bono at a lower salary. The club 
had asked Bono to take a 50% pay cut, to about $750,000.

BENNETT'S FULL SWING FLATTENS SIMI VALLEY; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: AFTER NEARLY 
STRIKING OUT, HE HITS TWO-RUN HOMER IN 10TH TO PUT NEWBURY PARK ON BRINK OF 
TITLE, 9-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bennett and Joe Carter have something in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, Newbury Park High's senior catcher, hit a one-out, two-run home run 
in the 10th inning Friday to give the Panthers a 9-7 Marmonte League victory 
over Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not win a championship, as the Toronto Blue Jay outfielder's did in the 
World Series last fall, but it came close. The Panthers (16-5, 9-1 in league 
play) moved three games ahead of Channel Islands, Royal and Simi Valley with 
four to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got it wrapped up now," Newbury Park second baseman Shawn Adams said. 
"Nothing can stop us now." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gary Fabricius isn't breaking out the champagne for Newbury Park's first 
Marmonte League baseball title since 1977 just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll feel better when we're up three with two to play," Fabricius said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park's second victory over defending league champion Simi Valley this 
season was a controversial one. Bennett's home run came one pitch after he 
checked his swing on a ball out of the strike zone. Simi Valley Coach Mike 
Scyphers thought it should have been called strike three. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely horrible how they can not call that guy out on strike three," 
Scyphers said. "Everybody knows he struck out. The hitter knows he struck out, 
the first base coach knows he struck out, Coach Fabricius knows he struck out. 
Everybody knows he struck out except (base umpire) Barry Long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely horrendous that we can't get quality umpiring in a high 
school game, where the kids are playing their guts out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers played their second game without leading hitter and ace pitcher 
Bill Scheffels, who is indefinitely suspended from school, reportedly for his 
involvement in a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers could have used a clutch hitter as both teams wasted opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (14-6, 6-4) missed a chance in the ninth when Bryan Wall reached 
base on an error but was caught in a rundown after he wandered too far off 
first base. In the 10th, Simi Valley had Jeff Michael at third with one out, 
but Brian Kavanagh hit the ball straight to shortstop Ray Clinton, who was 
playing in, and Kary Kozlowski took a called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park had the bases loaded with one out in the fifth, but Keith Smith 
hit into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers had runners at first and second with one out in the seventh, but 
Clay Bush and Smith took called third strikes. Newbury Park had runners at 
first and second with none out in the ninth, but Clinton and Bush struck out 
and Smith grounded into a force out. "In about the eighth inning, it looked 
like the game nobody wanted to win," Fabricius said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defenses faltered early. Newbury Park's infield made seven errors in the 
game -- two by Smith in the first inning leading to five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers built the lead to 7-3 in the fourth, but Simi Valley made two 
errors and center fielder David Krewson misplayed another ball, setting up 
Smith's three-run homer that tied the score, 7-7.

MCGRAW GETS LUCKY AT VENTURA; AUTO RACING: EIGHT OF 13 CARS FAIL TO FINISH AS 
HOMETOWN DRIVER WINS STREET STOCK MAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number 13 proved to be unlucky for the majority of entrants in the Street 
Stock 20-lap main event Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five out of the 13 cars that started the feature race were around at the 
finish, and two of them weren't on the lead lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy McGraw of Ventura was one of the survivors, taking his first victory of 
the season after inheriting the lead on Lap 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Pole-sitter Bill Bartels of Los Angeles had a half-lap lead when his car 
stalled in Turn 2, with a small flame coming from under his left fender. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels encountered the same problem in his eight-lap heat race, which was 
eventually won by Adail Gayhart of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 James Weston of Santa Barbara and Paul Moore of Oak View, the two prior 
feature winners, both suffered blown tires in the early going after dueling for 
the first five laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, Moore and Tom Stephens of Ventura all tangled for fourth place in Turn 
1 on the fourth lap, with Weston coming out in front -- only to pull off one 
lap later. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore went out with a flat tire on the sixth lap, as did Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 All three drivers rejoined the race on the 12th lap, during the caution period 
brought on by Bartels, but Stephens lost a tire and flipped in Turn 4 when 
racing resumed, bringing out yet another caution flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme was second in the feature, Al Adam of Westlake 
Village was third, while Weston and Moore were fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Pounds of Santa Maria won the 20-lap IMCA Modified feature, in his first 
Ventura appearance this year, and Ryan Cole of Santa Maria was second. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Dunson of Santa Barbara won the 20-lap Mini Stock main event, and Scott 
Boucher of Oak View won his second 20-lap Pony Stock feature.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: VENTURA'S GOLF SUCCESS IS PAR FOR THE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a brief hiatus, the Ventura College golf team is again executing the 
Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Marshall, in his 18th season of coaching at the school, will lead the 
Pirates into the Southern California Regional on Monday at the Santa Ana 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (24-8) qualified for the one-day, 36-hole event by finishing in a 
first-place tie with Bakersfield in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (15-5) are led by Kelly Schlender (76.0 average), the player of 
the year in the conference, and Yannick Bibeau (76.5). But the team has plenty 
of depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Schlender and Bibeau) have been the most consistent, but we've got good 
rounds from other players such as Tyler Satchwell, Tim Herman and Scott 
Anderson. They all average about 78," Marshall said. "It's a very young group 
but very talented. We have continued to get better as the season has 
progressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Marshall, the Pirates have won 10 WSC titles, six in the 1980s. Their 
last title came in 1990. JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Spirited Victory 
</P>
<P>
 Cold winds and a little drizzle -- OK, it rained hard Wednesday in Ridgecrest 
-- weren't going to keep Mission from winning its first Southern California 
Athletic Conference baseball title . 
</P>
<P>
 With a 20-11 victory over Cerro Coso, the Free Spirit (25-15, 17-7 in 
conference play) guaranteed itself a best-of-three home series May 13-14 in the 
first round of the Southern California Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 And although it wasn't a well-played game -- there were 30 hits and 11 errors, 
with many of the miscues caused by gusty winds -- the Free Spirit took the 
three-hour bus ride home in, well, fine spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, for some it might have hurt to laugh too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-fielder Jesus Perez, Mission's leadoff batter, was hit by a pitch five 
times in seven plate appearances. He flied out and reached on an error in his 
two other turns. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the early hurting was felt by Cerro Coso when Mission scored 11 
runs in the first inning, two shy of the school record set against El Camino in 
a nonconference game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could have been a long ride home if we had lost," Mission Coach John 
Klitsner said. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the Pitch 
</P>
<P>
 So much has been made of the Northridge softball team's batting prowess that 
the Matadors' pitching has been virtually overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into Friday's doubleheader against Colorado State, Northridge had the 
best earned-run average among Division I schools -- 0.37. Handling the entire 
pitching load this year is the right-handed threesome of senior Amy Windmiller 
(19-2, 0.24), junior Kathy Blake (12-5, 0.59) and sophomore Jennifer Richardson 
(7-0, 0.28). They have limited opponents to a meager .148 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they're all different," Coach Gary Torgeson said. "And all three are 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller is the ace and leads all Division I pitchers in ERA. She has 
pitched five no-hitters, including a perfect game. She has 13 shutouts and 165 
strikeouts in 145 innings. Her strikeout-to-walk ratio is 11-1. Around the 
Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Cesar Martinez, a freshman second baseman at Pierce, has stolen 27 bases in 
the WSC, two shy of the conference record. Martinez has 35 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gary Reznick, Northridge's senior setter, finished his career with 3,530 
assists, second on the school's all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collin Smith, a freshman from Santa Cruz, averaged 2.74 digs to break an 
eight-year Northridge single-season record set by Mark Bird. Smith's average 
was fourth best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jason DuBrovo, a junior from Simi Valley High and Moorpark College, leads 
the Cal Lutheran golf team with a stroke average of 78.9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge's Tamara Ivie, a career .288 hitter, is batting .424 with 34 RBIs 
and leads the team with 38 runs, five triples, 56 hits and 14 walks.

THEATRE REVIEWS; 'MISS PELL' IS MISSING CONFIDENCE OF ITS DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At this point, Leonard Gershe's "Miss Pell Is Missing" could qualify as a 
genuine antique. Its publisher, Samuel French, has it only in manuscript form. 
The play is a charming example of the simple, crystal clear comedy, with a 
delicious O. Henry ending, that was a Broadway staple six or seven decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What a nice nod to yesterday that Long Beach Playhouse chose to revive it. The 
play's situation is well-worn, about a milquetoast father and his antsy 
daughter trying their best to extricate themselves from the clutches of 
fearsome ogre of a woman. The same setup occurs in 1929's "Broken Dishes," the 
Donald Meek-Bette Davis vehicle that springboarded Davis to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Staple that it is, it is funny and often witty. The shame in this production 
is that director Hugh Harrison doesn't seem to like the play or, at the very 
least, doesn't think it's very funny. He doesn't trust it. Any revival deserves 
more respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although any comedy has to play at brisk tempos, Harrison drives most of this 
production at such a breakneck speed that the actors often have little time to 
do more than rattle off their lines. He incites mugging and physical shtick. 
It's surprising that Gershe's gentle humor still winks winningly through the 
mayhem every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bancroft's father Richard Pell is ludicrous, alarmingly overacted and 
without a shred of honest characterization. His mugging is disgraceful. Melissa 
Doty's maid brays her lines and never moves at less than a full gallop, a noisy 
proposition at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Alene Duncan Hyatt's cook is little better, along with John Matthew Sayre's 
boob of a fiance, a jerkily pretentious performance with no insight into 
character or style. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Teschke's lawyer is a bit closer to both character and period style, as 
is Tom Wagner's brash, incompetent private detective for whom, of course, the 
heroine finally falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Wagner, Sheri Shapiro as daughter Louise Pell eventually calms down after 
the lickety-split opening scene and gives the still energetic but gracefully 
charming performance her character deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro's gradual and realistic change from church-mouse timidity to 
self-contained flapper liberation survives the production's misdirection and 
Harrison's attempts to refinish a very respectable antique. What on earth would 
he do to a Chippendale chair?

MUSIC REVIEW; PIERRE BOULEZ CONCOCTS A GALLIC FEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierre Boulez isn't a very sentimental man not on the podium, at any rate -- 
and he doesn't care much about dubious traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Gallic master conducted 
an extraordinarily responsive Los Angeles Philharmonic in a stimulating evening 
of French music -- music presumably close to his heart as well as his homeland. 
The results, for the most part, involved revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part? The qualifier is ironic because it applies not to the 
familiar robust virtues of Boulez's Debussy and Ravel, but to the challenge of 
some unfamiliar music by Boulez himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The novelty, receiving its West Coast premiere, was "Le visage nuptial," 
a.k.a. "The Nuptial Countenance." A convoluted cantata evolving around five 
sensual poems by the surrealist Rene Char, it spans a rather dense and 
difficult half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the piece is significantly tortuous. The first version, an 
introspective chamber effort, dates back to 1946, when the composer was barely 
21 and still developing under a benign spell that fused the expressionism of 
Alban Berg with the exoticism of Olivier Messiaen. On several occasions over 
the decades, a restless Boulez expanded, thickened and toughened the structure 
drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 The current edition -- massive, heroic, even portentous -- materialized only 
in 1989. At last, according to Kathy Henkel's illuminating program notes, 
Boulez regards his problematic opus as "finished, finished, finished." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that. But is it good, good, good? 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence on Thursday, alas, didn't seem particularly positive. Char's hot 
emotions are contradicted at virtually every turn by Boulez's cool, analytical 
restraint. The erotic imagery of the text often gets submerged in turgid 
modernist formulas. The crucial words uttered (also mumbled, screeched, floated 
and slathered) by a pair of virtuosic sopranos and women's chorus tend to get 
obscured by symphonic clangor. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound washes are interesting, but there isn't much dramatic contrast here. 
The appeal to the intellect outweighs any appeal to the emotions. And despite 
Boulez's celebrated concern for clarity uber Alles , the textures often resist 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the cantata has undergone too many muddling transformations over too 
long a time span. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps W.C. Fields, an old musicological sage, was right. "If first you don't 
succeed," he said, "try, try again. Then give up. No sense being a damn fool 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic performance, politely applauded by a full house of 
first-nighters, seemed competent at worst. Phyllis Bryn-Julson and Lucy 
Shelton, avant-garde divas par excellence, executed their high-wire duties 
fearlessly. So, I think, did the women of Paul Salamunovich's Los Angeles 
Master Chorale, trained by Grant Gershon (his program credit was printed so 
small, only an ant could read it). Boulez's bare-hand signals -- no 
old-fashioned baton for him -- enforced calm accuracy even in moments of 
cataclysmic stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Calm precision also marked the conventional portions of the concert. But here 
the cerebral approach proved an interpretive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parisian maestro certainly does not subscribe to the theory that Debussy 
and Ravel were wispy wimps whose music must sigh and whimper, whisper and 
shimmer, in order to achieve stylistic purity. Boulez likes to deal in primary 
colors as well as fragile pastels, and, thank goodness, he doesn't like to 
dawdle over obvious effects. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the program with an unusually solid yet sensitive performance of 
Debussy's "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune." Then, after his own centerpiece, 
he brought suave momentum and even a soupcon of charm to Ravel's "Une barque 
sur l'ocean," in contrasting tandem with the non-aquatic splash of the same 
composer's "Alborada del gracioso." Finally, he made mighty, taut, tensely 
disciplined waves in Debussy's "La mer." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although the gentlemen of the orchestra sported their now-customary white 
tie and tails, Boulez, ever the individualist, asserted sartorial independence 
with a tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concertmaster chores were shared by Sidney Weiss and his associate, 
Alexander Treger. This odd variation on musical chairs is usually played here 
only for concertos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Philharmonic concert, to be repeated tonight at 8, Sunday at 
2:30 p.m., at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center. Tickets $6-$50 
(also senior and student discounts), (213) 850-2000.

THEATRE REVIEWS; THE BARRYMORE, THE MERRIER IN 'I HATE HAMLET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You just can't hate "I Hate Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 It's as shamelessly superficial as its lead -- a pretty-boy sitcom star who 
gets cast as Hamlet in New York's Shakespeare in the Park. But, hey, like the 
late Larry Shue, playwright Paul Rudnick knows where the laugh buttons are, and 
he pushes them like a virtuoso. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in a pleasing production at the North Coast Repertory Theatre, "I Hate 
Hamlet" was Paul Rudnick's first hit when it opened on Broadway in 1991. The 
playwright has since become known for doctoring "The Addams Family" film and 
writing "Addams Family Values" and for penning another surprise hit play, 
"Jeffrey," a serious yet funny story about a gay man so scared of AIDS that he 
swears off sex. 
</P>
<P>
 But here he's just having fun. Sure, there are some messages about art versus 
show business as the star's passion to do free "Hamlet" in New York conflicts 
with his desire to make scads of money playing high-concept TV roles in LaLa 
Land. But these messages are just setups for the jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the jokes are good enough to gloss over the script's flimsiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Rally (Michael Schwarz) is the star who has -- reluctantly -- agreed to 
do "Hamlet," mainly because his latest show, "L.A. Medical," was just canceled. 
His romantic but chaste girlfriend, Deirdre (Stina Sundberg Lake), is wildly 
enthusiastic about him doing "Hamlet." So is his real estate agent, Felicia 
(Dawne Ellison), who wants him to keep the apartment she found for him -- an 
ornate but run-down get-up that used to house John Barrymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Rally's friend, writer/producer Gary Peter Lefkowitz (Seth Neely), thinks 
Rally should jump into another TV show and refers to "Hamlet" as "algebra on 
stage." As for art, Lefkowitz says: "You don't do art. You buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 And just as commerce is about to win out, Barrymore himself (Stanley Madruga 
Jr.) returns from the dead to coach Rally as Hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been said that there are no small parts, only small actors. Under Olive 
Blakistone's direction, it's the small parts that carry the day. The leads are 
caricaturish cliches, and it's hard to imagine anyone who is not innately funny 
-- like a Jerry Seinfeld -- pulling off Rally. Schwarz, despite a hard-working 
performance, lacks the necessary wry, self-mocking sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also hard to imagine anyone making Deirdre anything but a silly goose -- 
though Lake, an appealing actress, does try hard. And that makes Rally's 
obsession with her even harder to care about. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Ellison, Madruga and Neely ride to the rescue. And for comedy 
connoisseurs, you cannot top Ellison as the pushy but dour real estate agent. 
She is impeccable as she matter-of-factly delivers a line about how she finally 
got her dead mother to talk to her at a seance: "Ma, it's after 10; the rates 
are down. Bingo." 
</P>
<P>
 Madruga, a wildly theatrical actor, plays Barrymore over the top -- though, 
thankfully, not as far over the top as Nicol Williamson did on Broadway, 
getting drunk and stabbing his co-star. But Madruga succeeds in getting as many 
laughs with looks as he does with such lines as "I know I'm dead and shall be 
for all eternity. But I still don't have all day!" And while Neely needs to 
build up confidence and speed as producer/writer Lefkowitz, he knows where his 
zingers are: "An actor -- what's that? An English guy who can't get a series." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the playwright's notes, Rudnick was inspired to write this piece 
when he rented an apartment where Barrymore had lived in 1904. This production 
captures the flavor of it in Marty Burnett's handsome set design. John-Bryan 
Davis did his usual fine work with the costumes, with Valerie Honea doing 
Rally's and Barrymore's black velvet, heavy medallion Hamlet outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all good but harmless fun, a crowd-pleaser but not a brain-teaser and, 
ironically, a lot more like the fluff Lefkowitz advocates for TV than the 
substantial nature of "Hamlet" that Rally is supposedly rallying for.

 The Death of a Theater: The city's namesake movie palace, the grandly designed 
Los Angeles Theatre at 615 S. Broadway, closed Thursday night, ending a run of 
62 years with a showing of the movie "Brainscan." Only last November, the 
Metropolitan Theatres chain initiated a low-price admission policy in a 
last-minute attempt to save the theater from closing. The Los Angeles, which 
will continue to host special events and movie locations, joins the ranks of 
such other Broadway movie palaces as the Globe and the Broadway theaters, which 
lately have been homes to swap meets, and the Million Dollar and United 
Artists, which house religious groups.

 * 'Mrs. Doubtfire' Setting Video Record: "Mrs. Doubtfire," released Tuesday on 
video, has been selling so fast that Fox Video president Bob DeLellis said 
deliveries to retailers reached 10 million units by Friday. He added that sales 
made "Mrs. Doubtfire" the fastest-selling live-action video ever. Fox initially 
predicted sales of 8 million units of the Robin Williams comedy by year-end but 
has now raised its estimates to more than 12 million. "Mrs. Doubtfire," 
released in 1993, is still playing in more than 800 theaters. TELEVISION

instructional materials for teachers and a guide for parents. Suggestions 
include ways to combine TV shows with family activities, advice to help 
children learn the difference between advertising and programming, and ways to 
examine portrayals of violence, women and minorities. Continental, which serves 
650 communities in seven states, including California, says it is also talking 
to other cable companies about distributing the kits to their communities.

 Record-Breaker: A 15th-Century Korean porcelain dish has sold at auction for a 
record $3.08 million, nearly 10 times the price estimated by experts, 
Christie's said Thursday. The blue and white bowl, sold Wednesday evening, set 
a record for a Korean artwork and for any piece of porcelain. Expected to bring 
$300,000 to $400,000, the dish was one of three known to exist and was 
considered one of the most important Korean works ever to go up for auction.

Swedish Television Thursday evening that the 21-year-old had been camped 
outside Berggren's family's home in Gothenburg in western Sweden for two days

MUSEUM DESERVES SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was a trustee of the Laguna Art Museum from 1986 until my resignation in 
1991. During my tenure, I served on several committees, including the search 
committee that hired Charles Desmarais (as director), and the executive 
committee, in charge of the museum's development program. 
</P>
<P>
 I was the primary person responsible for raising approximately $165,000 for 
the most attended, most financially successful and most nationally traveled 
exhibit in the museum's history, "California Light," curated by Dr. Patricia 
Trenton, with a catalogue co-authored with Dr. William H. Gerdts. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit and its funding were already in place when Mr. Desmarais was 
hired. In addition, as Mr. Desmarais was aware from his interviews with the 
board, the museum had a long history of interest in supporting exhibits of 
early California works of art. Nevertheless, my resignation came as a direct 
result of Mr. Desmarais' persistent negativism directed toward the museum's 
focus on California Impressionism and the exhibit "California Light." 
</P>
<P>
 However, I have continued to financially support the museum because I firmly 
believe that the single most important aspect of a museum is the institution 
itself. Sometimes it is easy to forget that while directors and trustees 
change, the institution remains. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly feel that the current board of trustees represents an exceptional 
level of excellence and deserves the community's whole-hearted and continued 
support.

YOUNG REVELATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have read many disturbing things in my seven decades of life, but the other 
day I read the most devastating thing in my lifetime. The daughter of Loretta 
Young, who thought she had been adopted, wrote a book in which she revealed 
that she was the illegitimate child of a love affair between her mother and 
Clark Gable. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me that the Chicago Cubs will win the World Series this year. Tell me 
Gen. Patton was a Russian spy. Tell me that Rush Limbaugh is a registered 
Democrat.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I could believe all those things. Please don't tell me that Loretta 
Young, who played "The Bishop's Wife" and "The Farmer's Daughter," had an 
affair with Clark Gable and produced an illegitimate child. How much can a man 
take? 
</P>
<P>
 Not even wars, depressions, poverty, poor health and death could have 
devastated me as much as learning that Young, who was the symbol of beauty and 
decency, whom I admired and adored all my life, could be guilty of such 
conduct. Say it isn't so, Loretta!

COBAIN WAS MISUNDERSTOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your "Letters on Kurt Cobain" (Calendar, April 16), you printed comments 
from several readers who didn't see Kurt Cobain for who he was -- someone with 
a lack of desire to be anything other than just a musician to his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Letter writer B. Dirk Yarborough denigrates Cobain as an ineffectual 
songwriter who wrote "cool songs" but who was not worthy of being spoken of in 
the same breath as Bob Dylan and John Lennon. Both Dylan and Lennon would have 
disagreed with Yarborough, who doesn't understand that Cobain never thought of 
himself as a rock hero or an icon, but he obviously very reluctantly did affect 
a generation and would have continued to do so had he been able to handle his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Mr. Yarborough reveals his age and generation (obviously not Cobain's), 
by sarcastically contrasting the broad "difference" between Cobain's influence 
against Lennon's and Dylan's, by making Cobain be "Michael Tuck" to Walter 
Cronkite, and the "Shannen Doherty" to Bette Davis and Ava Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a more fitting analogy: To print Yarborough's comments on Kurt Cobain 
would have been like having Richard Nixon discuss the reasons why Jimi Hendrix 
didn't deserve to be symbolized as a revolutionary guitar hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Jeff Le Pere says, "Being 24 years old, I am tired of Cobain being held 
up for the spokesman for my generation." Guess what, Jeff? Kurt was tired, too, 
of being branded with that label -- to the point of suicide. And for Le Pere to 
call Kurt selfish and a coward for his suicide indicates his lack of 
understanding about the physical and emotional reasons for the tremendous 
anguish Cobain endured in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you judge a young man who goes from being a homeless musician to a 
millionaire almost overnight and who writes in his suicide note, "I have tried 
everything . . . to appreciate it and I do, but it's not enough. I still can't 
get out of the frustration, the guilt and the empathy I have for everybody"? 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain was a poet who reached the alienated, the lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who possesses an open mind to new music and who has any type of 
sensitivity and knowledge on how bad life really can be for some people will 
easily see and respect Kurt Cobain's honesty toward his music and his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's ludicrous for The Times to print letters from shielded, pampered and 
older Orange County citizens about what Cobain was, is and forever will be to 
the listener who felt his pain through his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Why listen to the talk of those who don't walk the walk? 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue will continue to be one thing only -- the tragedy of Kurt 
Cobain's inability to see himself as somebody special and the fatal path his 
insecurity pushed him toward.

DESIGN CHANGES CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I note with dismay the new format of your Life & Style and Calendar sections. 
Surely, the author of these typographic disasters works in secret for the 
Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
 The formerly clear and easily read section and feature headings have been 
replaced with hard-to-distinguish red-on-gray and black-on-gray blurs. How 
convenient. To find the features I enjoy and look for in the paper, I now have 
to read the first few lines, since the contrast is too low for me, with aging 
eyes, to distinguish letter forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone fail to notice the simple fact that letter forms in every human 
alphabet or script are patterns of dark on light and depend for legibility on 
high contrast, especially as one gets older? Or is this a high-minded attempt 
to evoke a sympathetic sense of illiteracy in your readership to encourage it 
to support reading programs for the blind? 
</P>
<P>
 From all the demographics I've seen, your older readership is the most loyal 
and likely to subscribe in the first place. Did anyone stop to think what 
effect this silly change might have on them? Did anyone ask? Or was this idea 
dreamed up by someone whose vision is 20/20 and whose idea of fine typography 
was nurtured on Batman graphic novels? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-to-read letter forms and convoluted efforts to bury text within artwork 
belong in experimental comic books, not newspapers.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HARPER OFFERS STRONG CASE FOR THE BLUES AT TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Taj Mahal and Tracy Chapman had a baby boy, he'd be the spitting aural 
image of Ben Harper, the 24-year-old Claremont native whose debut album, 
"Welcome to the Cruel World," is a striking, low-key mixture of mostly acoustic 
blues and unfettered, we-shall-overcome folk earnestness. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's show on Thursday at the Troubadour occasionally took on the tone of a 
progressives' hootenanny, with the singer -- who otherwise seemed quite the 
stage introvert -- exchanging some raised-fist salutes with the audience 
between anti-racism anthems.As a protest lyricist, in songs such as "Like a 
King" (which tries to establish the elusive social connection between Kings 
Rodney, Dr. Martin Luther and the Lord), Harper tends toward lines that are 
blunt and a little clumsy, though, at 24, he's got plenty of time to hone good 
intentions into a more graceful evangelism. Better were his tender love songs 
and spirituals. 
</P>
<P>
 As a guitarist, he's in no need of further seasoning. His picking on several 
vintage hollow-body Weissenborns -- often played as lap-top slide guitars -- 
was exquisite and mesmerizing. And though his rhythm section played loudly 
enough to easily support an electric player, the unusual tension between their 
wallop and Harper's more refined acoustic touch is essential toward the 
excellent case being made for the blues' not being a museum piece yet. CHRIS

'704 HAUSER' AT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re " '704 Hauser' Braces for Race Issue" (April 7): It is wonderful that 
enlightened people have devised a new show that parents will "sit down with 
their kids to watch" -- black parents. Unfortunately, the creators aren't as 
enlightened as I'd prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong Williams, a creative consultant, wants to make black people 
"uncomfortable" enough to re-evaluate their politics and beliefs. To this end, 
a white, Jewish girlfriend is being placed on the show. Unfortunately, Williams 
accepts "conflict" when discussing the effects interracial dating will have on 
story lines instead of its positive possibilities. Williams states that his 
opposition to interracial dating was "embedded" in him by his parents and that 
"even though it's the wrong way to think," this character's presence bothers 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 If a white man had espoused these archaic ideas in an interview, he'd have 
been branded "racist" and the show would have been cast down as another attempt 
to capitalize on racial tensions even before it got started. It need not be. An 
atmosphere of exchange must prevail for our society to get past the abyss that 
racial separatism has carved. Williams' honesty is admirable; his ideas are 
not. Yet, he is willing to admit the possibility of change by introducing it 
into the show. If the show is as honest as Williams, perhaps even he will 
become uncomfortable enough to outgrow his parents.

THEATER BEAT: A WELL-ACTED 'BRAVE' ALTERNATE TO 'PICNIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Credit the Company of Angels for this well-acted and thoughtfully staged 
"Summer Brave," the rarely performed alternate version of "Picnic" actually 
preferred by its author, William Inge. 
</P>
<P>
 Inge claimed his original script had been rushed by schedule constraints and 
he rewrote the ending to give greater self-awareness and independence to Madge 
(Sabrina Hill), the small-town beauty who sacrifices her sensible but 
passionless engagement for a fling with irresponsible drifter Hal (Tomm 
Gillies).  
</P>
<P>
 Other changes were more in the way of streamlining, mostly at the expense of 
Hal's complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the previous version, the older couple (a particularly poignant Carla 
Klein and Lee Magnuson) complement the headstrong youths with their maturity 
and sadder but wiser desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summer Brave" is tighter and arguably more realistic than its ubiquitous 
forebear, but also more deliberate and judgmental in its treatment of Hal and 
Madge's hedonistic abandon. Considerably diminished is the celebration of the 
fragile moment that fueled "Picnic's" call to "Set the world on fire -- to keep 
the nighttime from creepin' on." 
</P>
<P>
 In overworking his play, Inge let some of that fire go out. Director Don Oscar 
Smith hasn't tried to mediate the loss, but succeeds in faithfully rendering 
this little-known variant of a classic. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Summer Brave," Angels Theater, 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 4 p.m. Ends June 18. $12-$15. (213) 
466-1767. 'Mouth to Mouth' Touches a Nerve 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-aging baby boomers do not go gentle into the dark night, at least not 
judging from Carol Schlanger's one-woman show, "Mouth to Mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not dead, we're just not young anymore," Schlanger reflects on the 
maturing process that has replaced her youthful conviction that she was 
destined for great things with a more humble self-concept -- especially 
regarding her unglamorous marriage (to a husband represented by offstage sawing 
sounds). 
</P>
<P>
 Schlanger's free-associative narrative weaves in and out of a pivotal 20-year 
class reunion, where the sight of an old flame soon has her sucking on a bread 
stick and contemplating a momentary lapse. Ultimately, she ends up weighing the 
pros and cons of the path she has chosen -- a boomer version of "It's a 
Wonderful Life," perhaps, but delivered with humor and heartfelt intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlanger adapts the monologue format well to her own blunt objectives. Where 
Spalding Gray, for example, relishes lengthy mental gymnastics in his neurotic 
approach-avoidance conflicts with emotional truths, Schlanger goes for the 
direct emotional bull's-eye -- like her description of suspending life to raise 
a family. "Not raise -- punish," she quickly corrects. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all her insights are strikingly original, but they benefit from a high 
recognition factor as she touches many a collective nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mouth to Mouth," Theatre Geo, 1229 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood, Wednesdays, 
8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends May 8. $15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 
45 minutes. 'From Moscow' Has Campy, Upbeat Spin 
</P>
<P>
 How can you keep 'em down on the farm once they've seen Moscow? Chekhov's 
"Three Sisters" first posed this question amid the quintessential Russian 
trappings of unfulfilled longing and soul-searching despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, we Americans are far more superficial. "We're From Moscow or Life 
Is Trouble," an original musical comedy affectionately adapted by Steven 
Atinsky, puts a campy, upbeat spin on Chekhov's trio of bored rural siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-concept zaniness is appealing but hard to sustain through an extended 
parody -- firm editing is needed. The songs span an amusingly incongruous 
assortment of pop styles (rock, blues, disco, even an a cappella Elvis spoof), 
though they accomplish little in the way of character advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout performance is by Ellen Plummer, who combines impeccable comic 
timing with engaging sympathy as the sister who anguishes over possible escape 
via loveless marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "We're From Moscow or Life Is Trouble," Zephyr Theatre, 7456 Melrose Ave., 
Los Angeles. Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends May 15. $18-$20 
(free if you bring a samovar). (213) 660-8587. Running time: 2 hours, 10 
minutes. Groundlings' Latest Is Right on Target 
</P>
<P>
 "Groundlings Gettin' Some," a new series of comic vignettes centered on those 
timeless rituals of dating and mating, is an ideal showcase for the 
Groundlings' versatile performance skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter rarely subsides during well-aimed shots at known quantities such as 
"The Piano," in which the silent, tuba-playing heroine (Jennifer Joyce) 
communicates with her tattooed suitor (Jim Wise) through charades, or the 
klatch of chattering biddies in a Victoria Principal cosmetics infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
 The best bits, though, are driven by meticulously detailed characterizations 
rather than punch lines or situational concepts -- Mike MacDonald's 
acid-tongued, vein-popping portrait of a snide commercial director lording over 
his untalented performers, Joyce's braying rendition of a decked-out Long 
Island barfly, and Cathy Shambley's ditsy delivery as a Starbuck's employee. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Groundlings Gettin' Some," Groundling Theatre, 7307 Melrose Ave., Los 
Angeles. Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 8 and 10 p.m. Indefinitely. $16.50-$18.50. 
(213) 934-9700. Running time: 2 hours. 'Borderlands' Links Lives of 7 Women 
</P>
<P>
 The Continuum's "Borderlands" is an initially bewildering suite for the 
independent voices of six quirky women coping with life in contemporary L.A., 
and a seventh who speaks from 1869. The fun is in tracing the surprising 
connecting threads that link their parallel scenes and monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-absorbed accountant (Kathryn Miller), a wanna-be movie producer (Dana 
Stevens), a manicurist (Michelle Bonilla), a timid housewife (Miranda Viscoli), 
a hip radio talk-show hostess (April Grace), a piano maker (Heather Ehlers) and 
a loony housebound urban guerrilla (Valerie Spencer) are the nicely rendered, 
seemingly random demographic sample whose stories converge when a household 
financial crisis spirals out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The work's collaborative origins are evident in the well-integrated 
performances, but also in an eventual denouement that proves somewhat arbitrary 
and less than earth-shattering. Director Nancy Keystone compensates with tight 
focus and a tone of simple eloquence in these characters' funny and touching 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Borderlands," 2nd Stage Theatre. 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends May 15. $12. (213) 939-6747. Running time: 1 
hour, 40 minutes.

POP SINGER KENNY LOGGINS RETURNS TO 'POOH CORNER'; FAMILIES: HIS LATEST ALBUM 
OF TUNES FOR CHILDREN WILL KICK OFF A SONY SERIES. NICOLETTE LARSON AND TOM 
CHAPIN ALSO HAVE WORKS DUE OUT ON THE FAMILY ARTIST SERIES.

<P>
 Boomers, take note. The music of your angry adolescence is now music to your 
preschooler's ears: Pop superstar Kenny Loggins -- who just happens to have 
four kids, including an 8-month-old -- is one of many icons of the rock era to 
make a foray into family music. His latest album, "Return to Pooh Corner," 
kicks off Sony Wonder's new Family Artists Series on May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while parents relive their youth, their children can nod off to "St. 
Judy's Comet," Loggins' "Cody's Song," a reworked version of the Loggins and 
Messina hit "House on Pooh Corner" and other familiar, easy-listening 
lullaby-soft tunes, delivered with flowing acoustic guitar and piano 
accompaniment and Loggins' remarkably youthful, breathy vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loggins album will be followed on May 24 by pop-country star Nicolette 
Larson's "Sleep, Baby Sleep," more soft, go-to-sleep songs with a folky feel. 
Lilting highlights are "Appalachian Lullaby," "Irish Lullaby" and "I Bid You 
Goodnight." 
</P>
<P>
 The multitalented actor/folk singer/veteran children's artist Tom Chapin 
offers a change of pace with "Zag Zig," an upbeat giggle of an album, also due 
out on May 24. Chapin's energy, assured phrasings and fatherly familiarity with 
the concerns of childhood infuse such selections as "Mikey Won't Say He's 
Sorry," "Hi Hi I Love Ya" and "Backwards Birthday Party." 
</P>
<P>
 The albums are priced at $9.98 for a cassette and $13.98 for a compact disc 
and will be available at most major record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Real Talk for Teens: Recognizing that teen-agers have more on their minds than 
rock stars and romance, the May schedule of the hip weekly PBS teen magazine 
show "In the Mix" weighs in with reports about an AIDS hot line in Connecticut, 
youths in Bosnian and Croatian refugee camps, how rap music treats women, world 
hunger and binge drinking. The shows air here on KCET-TV Channel 28 at 6:30 
p.m. on Sundays. Times can vary, however; check your local listings for 
specific shows.

THEATRE REVIEW; THE CARICATURES GET OLD FAST IN CAST-AT-CIRCLE'S 'SHOOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You don't have to telegraph how sick you are," admonishes one of the 
characters in Kelly Stuart's "Shoot," at the Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre. Stuart 
might well have listened to this advice when she created the misfits of 
"Shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 At first these people are darkly comic, in the same way an underground comic 
might be. But not many people read the same underground comic for more than an 
hour, and after a while the people of "Shoot" wear out their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart created matched sets of parents and children at one another's throats. 
Nick (Harvey Perr), who runs a low-rent photo studio, is always banning his 
gangly son Hodie (Joe Goodrich) from the premises, but Hodie keeps returning. 
Nick hires Barbara (Pamela Gordon) as an assistant partially to keep Hodie out, 
but instead Barbara brings her own disdainful but dependent daughter, Monette 
(Lola Glaudini), along with her. 
</P>
<P>
 The two offspring are caricatured with bold, sharp details by the actors. 
Goodrich stands and moves like some sort of demented bird. Glaudini flexes her 
snarling muscles and her sneering glances. Although she begins to think of 
herself as a model for Nick, she wears her clothes as if she were a flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 Perr's sleazoid is properly disgusting, and Gordon's shipshape scourge of 
would-be shoplifters is funny. So are some of Stuart's details about these 
paltry people and the way they insult and humiliate one another. 
</P>
<P>
 But any hint of character development is kept resolutely superficial, and the 
narrative's arbitrary quality is largely unengaging. A few hours later, the 
actors are a lot easier to remember than the play itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Shoot," Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre, 804 N. El Centro, Hollywood.

ART REVIEW; 'BREAKDOWN' DEFINES A LESSER MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Breakdown," at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, four artists in 
their 30s confront certain structures and systems currently prevailing in our 
culture and dismantle them. At least, that's what the rhetoric surrounding this 
exhibition vaguely suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 All four -- Michael Joaquin Grey and Rita McBride of New York, Robert Levine 
and Jorge Pardo of Los Angeles -- appear to have a love/hate relationship with 
material culture and have decided to redefine it on their own terms. Grey 
starts at the beginning, recasting the big-bang theory into a mildly amusing, 
self-indulgent series of doodles and sculptures. He has a playful spirit, but 
his works, such as a trio of tetherball posts or a circle of tiny plastic 
stools, fail to transform into anything beyond what they so obviously are. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride takes the familiar route of rendering common, recognizable objects in 
unlikely materials. Her small bronze version of a parking structure has 
surprising elegance. The rest of her work, including orange plastic and green 
velvet cloverleaves, as well as a full-scale sports car fashioned out of 
rattan, is too superficial even to be redeemed by its distant kinship to 
Surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's sculptures in wood, plexiglass, metal and silicone have a clunky, 
self-conscious charm. His is a handmade order imposed on materials more precise 
than their maker. His "Half Knot Painting" is the sleeper of the show, a witty, 
punning mosaic of wood scraps, half with knots and half without. Understated 
and crudely coated with resin, it rips through the posturing of the work 
surrounding it to make a fresh and clever statement about painting's proudly 
confused identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo makes little of his contribution to the show, a set of track lights 
installed in the same configuration as those in his L.A. gallery. If not for 
the way they cut across the museum's skylights, they would be entirely unworthy 
of notice. In her catalogue essay, the show's organizer, assistant curator 
Kathryn Kanjo, allows Pardo to rub shoulders with light and space artists 
Robert Irwin and Dan Flavin, but Pardo's work never rises above Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having broken down the component parts of certain spaces, objects and 
beliefs, the four artists in this show fail to pick up the pieces and make 
something meaningful of them again. All have solid schooling in Minimalist 
aesthetics and Conceptual issues, but the work remains flimsy. The real 
"Breakdown" here is in the museum's curatorial rigor. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; 'ANNIE' WELL-ACTED TUG AT THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pediatric nurse becomes foster mother to an HIV-positive baby, only to have 
the birth mother claim her a year later in "A Place for Annie," a well-acted 
"Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation airing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A tear-jerker? Absolutely.But not a manipulative wallow, thanks to superb 
performances by Oscar-winning Sissy Spacek, in her first network movie in 
nearly two decades, and Mary-Louise Parker ("Naked in New York"). 
</P>
<P>
 Spacek portrays Susan, the nurse who loses her heart to the infant Annie, then 
is outraged when the courts give the child back to Linda (Parker), Annie's 
newly sober, ex-heroin-addict mother with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 How the successful, respected Susan and the abjectly dysfunctional Linda find 
common ground and even a tenuous emotional bond is the heart of the teleplay, 
written by Cathleen Young and Lee Guthrie and directed by John Gray. Everything 
else becomes peripheral: Susan's conflict with a beleaguered social worker (S. 
Epatha Merkerson), her warm relationships with her teen-age son (Jack 
Noseworthy) and Annie's grandmotherly baby-sitter (Joan Plowright) -- even her 
feelings for baby Annie. 
</P>
<P>
 Noseworthy, while pleasant enough, doesn't have much to do other than register 
dismay and support. Surprisingly, the abundantly gifted Plowright, an 
unforgettable presence in any film she's in, comes close to caricature here, 
the victim of an unbelievable role as a Disneyish, dream-come-true baby-sitter 
and maternal confidant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the integrity of the two leads that wards off bathos and transcends 
predictability; Parker's nuanced portrayal of one of life's walking wounded 
discovering a spark of meaning is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Place for Annie" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).

NBC'S 'TONYA AND NANCY' ON VERY THIN ICE; TV REVIEW: THE NETWORK CRITICIZES 
ITSELF IN THE MOVIE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What's next, "Harding and Kerrigan Meet the Menendez Brothers"? 
</P>
<P>
 By sharply criticizing itself for existing, "Tonya and Nancy: The Inside 
Story" is television's first movie in years to have its own out-of-body 
experience. Unfortunately, that in no way enhances the experience of watching 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rewarding to hear NBC publicly acknowledge within the movie that the 
movie it is showing tonight is not only cynical and utterly rubbish but also 
exploitative of both Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're victims of us," proclaims Dennis Boutsikaris as "the writer" who is 
depicted in the movie as being the hack whom NBC has chosen to write the movie 
-- and grind it out ahead of a planned ABC version and in time for the present 
ratings sweeps period. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory here, as mockingly expressed by the Boutsikaris character, is that 
admitting you're being bad makes being bad OK: "So that's when the network 
decided it had to be a movie. Ah! Networks. There was going to be more than 
one. See, everybody was chasing after Nancy's rights. And tabloids were driving 
the story every day, and it was like the whole world had gone crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Including itself, NBC wants you to know. An NBC executive in the movie 
salivates at what lies ahead for the May sweeps: "Nancy vs. Tonya: Beauty and 
the Bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 True to that spirit, Kerrigan (Heather Langenkamp) gets clubbed and thereafter 
is never seen without her blinding halo. In fact, she's rarely seen at all. On 
the other hand, the ever-present Harding (Alexandra Powers) is self-pitying and 
hard-boiled while being driven to behave badly by her then-husband, the 
allegedly jealous, wife-battering Jeff Gillooly (James Wilder). 
</P>
<P>
 The movie uses a "Rashomon" technique to let viewers decide for themselves 
whether she did (his version) or didn't (her version) know in advance of the 
plot to cripple Kerrigan at the national figure skating championships in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual writer of tonight's movie, Philip Penningroth, could skate across 
this thin ice blindfolded, and has, witness his previous quickie scripts for 
"In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco" and "Amy Fisher: My Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculing Gillooly, Shawn Eckhardt (Dan Schneider) and their fellow 
conspirators as clowns, Penningroth and director Larry Shaw try for some of the 
dark comedy deployed in HBO's Emmy-winning docu-parody "The Positively True 
Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story" turns out to be just another dull 
movie about dull people. After squandering two hours on it, you may be asking: 
"Why me? Why anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story" airs at 8 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 
and 39).

TV REVIEWS; 'WIDOW' COOKS UP BANQUET OF A TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All" is a sprawling, exuberant, 
four-hour miniseries that arrives like a bountiful harvest on the TV-movie 
landscape. The experience is virtually akin to curling up with a fat, memorable 
novel that you hate to see come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-starring Donald Sutherland, Diane Lane and Anne Bancroft in multilayered 
roles mined from the rich ore of fiction (in this case a best-selling first 
novel by Allan Gurganus), the tale spans 130 years, from the Civil War to the 
present, with the focus on deceptive Southern gentility in turn-of-the-century 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the production, compellingly directed by Ken Cameron from a 
pungent teleplay by Joyce Eliason, is a kind of American belle epoque. Here is 
a look at the South that is not so much Faulknerian and Gothic as it is darkly 
comic. 
</P>
<P>
 Deftly anchoring the breadth of the piece is a framing device that chronicles 
events through the eyes of the titular matriarch Lucy Marsden (with Lane 
playing the younger Lucy and Bancroft the older Lucy). 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep back and forth in time is artful and full of surprises, beginning 
with Lane's absorbing performance in Sunday's episode as a rebellious 
14-year-old who lives in a big frame house with a veranda. Largely to escape a 
preening, overbearing mother (Blythe Danner), she marries a 50-year-old war 
veteran still painfully living the Civil War. The man, Capt. William Marsden, 
is a larger-than-life figure played to the hilt by Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicely Tyson, in arguably her finest work, is a mother lode of earthy black 
patois, enacting a former Marsden slave turned Marsden housekeeper who grows as 
old as the captain.  
</P>
<P>
 A bejeweled moment is Bancroft's ruminations to the senior citizens around her 
(including a cameo by E.G. Marshall). "I was so young," she says, "I thought 
getting married was like getting a pup at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Later this oldest living Civil War widow reflects that "history ain't so 
historical; it's getting by and hanging on. History's lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 And this TV movie is a feast. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All" airs Sunday and Tuesday at 9 
p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

INTERIORS; HARMONIC CONVERSION; MORE THAN 20 DESIGNERS TRANSFORMED AN ANAHEIM 
HILLS HOUSE INTO A VILLA BY BLENDING CLASSICAL WITH CONTEMPORARY IN TONES OF 
TUSCANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It could have been a decorating disaster on a grand scale: More than 20 Orange 
County interior designers, each with his or her own distinct style, recently 
collaborated on revamping a 17-room estate from floor to ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many decorators on one project, one would expect a hodgepodge of 
clashing decors. Instead, when the 1994 Philharmonic House of Design opens its 
tall, arched doors to the public today, visitors will see a home unified by 
theme and color that looks more like the work of one versatile designer instead 
of two dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate, a 7,500-square-foot Mediterranean-style villa in the Peralta Hills 
area of Anaheim Hills, was transformed by volunteers from the Orange County 
chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers. It will be open for 
tours through May 29 to raise money for the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the home will see a blend of traditional and contemporary styles. 
The designers managed to pull together an eclectic mix of furnishings, window 
treatments, faux finishes and floor coverings to create one harmonious 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the designers, homeowners often must create a cohesive decor by drawing 
from a wide range of styles -- mixing, say, a beloved antique wingback chair 
with a modern iron and glass coffee table. The design house shows how seemingly 
disparate design elements can work together. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve this unity, they worked with committee leaders who decided on the 
decor's theme and color scheme. In keeping with the home's architecture, the 
committee encouraged designers to incorporate the classical elements of an 
Italian villa with contemporary features befitting a modern Southern California 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers responded by painting the walls with faux finishes, murals and 
frescoes in the tradition of Michelangelo. They covered the floors in 
everything from Persian rugs to contemporary Berber carpeting. They picked 
fabrics for draperies, bedding and upholstery that run the gamut from light 
gauze to heavy tapestry. They found artwork and unique accessories that are 
both contemporary and Renaissance-inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Color proved the glue that holds these competing textures and materials 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each room is very different . . . but they all blend," says Mona Clark, ASID 
co-chairwoman of the design house project. "The blending force is the color 
palette." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the Italian theme, the committee chose the warm, rich hues of 
Tuscany for the color palette: a pale, dusty green called "willow," off-white, 
clay, a deep, gun-metal gray called "iron stone," moss, antique gold and terra 
cotta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at colors that were coming into fashion for 1994-95," Clark says. 
"Then we looked at fabrics. The colors all reminded us of frescoes. We thought 
they would fit in with an Italian villa." 
</P>
<P>
 Each designer was assigned a room and came up with a floor plan and concept 
for the decor that was submitted to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee let them know if they were on the right track," Clark says. 
(The owner, who is selling the estate for about $2 million, also approved the 
plans. Although furnishings will be removed after the tour, surface treatments 
and carpeting will remain). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Garcia, the designer in charge of the estate's "great room," a 
flow-through kitchen, kitchen nook, family room and bar, used a mix of colors, 
textures and furnishings to give his area a warm, lived-in look. 
</P>
<P>
 The stainless steel of the kitchen stove and hood and cabinet fixtures, the 
large bronze Thai rain drum in the center of the family room, the mirror and 
glass coffee table, the taupe and black faux leather ottoman, the nubby 
oatmeal-colored carpet and knotty pine floors -- all blend to form "a room that 
looks like it's been put together over many years of traveling and collecting," 
Garcia says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Garcia's first acts was to replace the "busy" hand-painted floral tiles 
in the kitchen with French tile in a subtle bone color with a limestone border. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, less is more. Everything can't be a star in the room," Garcia 
says. "You need control. Let one thing be your highlight and the others support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He painted the walls "the color of chocolate mousse" to give the family room a 
"warm, homey feeling. It's a color that draws you." The light-colored carpet, 
massive windows and a sectional sofa lit from underneath all keep the room airy 
and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Piel, the designer who created the combination home office and den, had a 
different challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to do a stereotypical home office," Piel says. "That's an area 
of the home that really hasn't been addressed. It often looks terrible, but we 
spend a lot of time there." 
</P>
<P>
 Piel's chief obstacle was how to hide unsightly computer equipment and desk 
files. She designed an office center that looks like a china cabinet with a 
faux burl wood finish so that all the equipment could be hidden behind doors 
and drawers. She also covered the walls with 2/3-inch layer of foam and a 
clay-colored damask fabric for sound-proofing and a soft look. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrific to do if you have a small condo where you have to share walls. 
It absolutely deadens the sound," she says. Instead of uncomfortable office 
furniture, Piel used upholstered furniture including a tapestry-covered daybed 
to make this a room for both work and leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 When not staring into a computer, one can relax on the daybed and peer up at a 
trompe l'oeil cloud-covered ceiling painted by artist Lorenzo George. The 
Renaissance-inspired ceiling is one of many frescoes and murals throughout the 
residence. The library, for instance, has cherubs looking down from on high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the Sistine Chapel," Clark says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of the power of the paintbrush are everywhere. Designer Gene Zettle's 
powder room is entirely paneled in wood painted to look knotty and aged. Lana 
Barth and Deanna Rousseau had white doves painted on the walls of the piano 
niche. Bathrooms, stairways and even the baby's room have walls treated with a 
faux finish that make them look dappled or aged. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bedroom designed for a fictitious teen-age girl who dreams of going to 
Paris and studying fashion design, one wall has been painted with a mural of a 
Parisian street scene. Actual pink and white striped awnings above the windows 
and real flower boxes add to the fantasy, and the black wrought iron headboard 
on the bed serves double-duty as the make-believe balcony of a French chateau. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted this room to be very whimsical," says Donna McHale, who designed 
the room with Judi Smolin under the direction of Betty Hyde. "Everything's very 
swirly, very French and very dreamlike." 
</P>
<P>
 In another room decorated for a boy who likes to play with magic, a mural of a 
wizard hovers over the bed, and there's a tree painted in one corner from which 
real puppets dangle like apples. 
</P>
<P>
 Home decorators can learn much about proportion by studying the house. 
Visitors who check out the sitting area of the master bedroom suite will find 
massive artworks by Orlando A.B. on the walls. Designer Bill Kiefer chose the 
4-by-6-foot contemporary paintings because the room has a 19-foot ceiling but 
is not excessively large. The pictures give the room balance, drawing the eye 
upward from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bed, itself a work of art, has a towering canopy of textured iron with a 
"desert" gold finish and fills the space created by the bedroom's high 
ceilings. To complement the hardness of the iron bed, Kiefer chose pale silk 
bedding and sheer cream-colored curtains that wrap loosely around the towering 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just floating," Kiefer says. Other romantic touches: Persian rugs, a 
large leaded glass window, columns and a fireplace with a faux marble finish, a 
hand-painted chest, an antique gold mirror above a built-in desk area and 
Oriental sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to show how you can bring old things in and use them" in a 
contemporary setting, Kiefer says. "We have antique sculpture mixed with ultra 
contemporary art." 
</P>
<P>
 The blending of styles is also evident in the dining room designed by Karen 
Myers Ziccard. She put a contemporary glass table with Lucite sculpture on a 
bronze base atop a traditional needlepoint rug with a floral motif. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything doesn't have to be contemporary or traditional," she says. "It can 
work together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the designers, most home decorators don't have unlimited access to 
original artworks and expensive accessories, yet they can duplicate some of the 
decorating techniques used in the design house. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things you can do yourself (to) make major changes in how you feel 
about a room," Piel says. The faux finishes, for instance, can be done with 
paint and a sponge, rag, tissue paper or even a feather. Fabric slipcovers can 
rejuvenate an old chair or sofa and add softness to a room. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, choosing eclectic furnishings and mixing contemporary and 
traditional styles as the designers did can help a home avoid looking like one 
of those sterile environments seen in some models, Kiefer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mixed textures, tones and pieces," he says. "This is definitely not a 
model home." Philharmonic House of Design

GARDENING; IT'S COLORFUL, IT'S HARDY, IT'S SUPER PETUNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Imagine a plant that thrives in heat and sun, is impervious to smog, tolerates 
water from overhead sprinklers, grows at the phenomenal rate of an inch a day 
and, best of all, covers itself with masses of eye-catching colorful flowers 
almost all year. Sounds too good to be true? Meet super petunia. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which has been captivating Europe for the past five years, was 
introduced to the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
 They look like their petunia cousins but behave much better. Two super petunia 
varieties, 'Sunlover Supertunia' and 'Cascadia,' are available throughout 
Orange County at nurseries and garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can barely keep up with the demand," said Evelyn Weidner, owner of 
Weidner's Gardens in Encinitas, one of the growers introducing 'Sunlover 
Supertunias' to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Sunlover Supertunia' is a wonder plant that loves heat and loves to bloom," 
Weidner said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hybrid with ancestry back to wild South American petunia strains, 'Sunlover 
Supertunia' is the result of hybridizing efforts of Australian breeder Roy 
Rother. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, breeders have also been working with super petunias and a variety 
called 'Cascadia,' which Armstrong Garden Centers is introducing here this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Cascadia' is a further development of 'Supertunias,' " explained John 
Farmer, a spokesman for Armstrong Garden Centers. "The growth habit is the 
same, but the color range is broader." 
</P>
<P>
 Both varieties of the powerful new petunias offer the same advantage of masses 
of color, either in borders or hanging baskets or containers. Unlike regular 
petunias, these powerhouses grow and bloom for two to three years instead of 
behaving as short-lived annuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, 'Sunlover Supertunias' are available in two colors -- Pampas Fire, 
wine-colored blossoms with dark purple centers, and Sweet Victory, 
larger-flowered pink. Weidner reports that additional colors will be available 
by August. Look for Kilkenny Bells, with blue/purple flowers; Sun Snow, white; 
Purple Sunspot, purple, and Velvet Columbine, deep purple. Rother is working on 
more varieties and plans to offer bicolors by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 'Cascadia' is available in midnight blue, dark pink, soft pink, dark purple, 
medium purple and white. The flowers of both varieties are single, and the 
foliage is compact. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner predicts that the super petunias will replace conventional petunias as 
gardeners get to know them. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer has been test growing 'Cascadia' in his garden in Fullerton and also 
gives them rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four plants have filled a 50-square-foot planter bed, and they just keep 
blooming and blooming and blooming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Super petunias provide masses of color in the ground and also are spectacular 
in hanging baskets because of their cascading growth habit. One plant can fill 
a 10-inch container, although Weidner recommends using several plants for a 
fuller look. They can trail for five to six feet. 
</P>
<P>
 These plants like heat and need to be planted in full sun. They don't need 
dead-heading, because they've been hybridized to produce little seed. Regular 
petunias, like all annuals, stop flower production when they set seeds. Super 
petunias are produced by cuttings, not seeds, so they keep growing and 
blooming. 
</P>
<P>
 This vigorous growth habit means they must be fed. "They're like adolescents 
in the plant kingdom, growing rapidly and constantly eating," Weidner said. 
</P>
<P>
 She recommends fertilizing every two weeks and supplementing with iron if the 
leaves start to yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although super petunias are almost work-free, they aren't pest-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other petunias, they attract bud worms, snails and slugs and sometimes 
aphids and whiteflies. Budworms can be combatted with the use of nontoxic BT 
(Bacillus thuringiensis), available in nurseries and garden centers under 
several different brand names.  
</P>
<P>
 Snails can be controlled by snail bait, but if you prefer nontoxic methods, 
try copper barriers around each plant (also sold in nurseries) or snail traps 
baited with beer. The yeasty brew lures the snails and slugs, and they slurp 
and drown. Insecticidal soaps will handle the whitefly and aphid problems, 
which also disappear at the onset of hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Super petunias can also tolerate cold, even some frost, growers say. They 
don't grow and bloom in mid-winter, and a light frost can cause a little 
damage, but they spring back to life with hot weather, pruning and fertilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 What more can you ask of a plant? Growing Tips 
</P>
<P>
 * Select a sunny location and allow plenty of room for growth. To make an 
attractive hanging basket, plant a single one-gallon container plant or two 
four-inch-container plants in a good quality planting mix. In the ground, plant 
one four-inch-container plant per square yard of garden space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fertilize every two weeks with a liquid or granular fertilizer. If you use 
time-release fertilizer, double the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch for insect damage and spray or treat as needed with BT or insecticidal 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bait for slugs and snails or use copper barriers around plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prune lightly to shape plants as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water as needed, according to soil dryness.

A HELPING HAND; WAYS TO RID WALLPAPER OF STRAY PAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. Recently, I painted one of my bathrooms and found that I got a little bit 
of paint on the wallpaper border that cuts across the ceiling. How can I get 
this stray paint off without damaging the paper? 
</P>
<P>
 S.D., San Clemente * 
</P>

 A. If you've used a water-based paint, you may want to try a product called 
Goof Off, says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy Home Decorating Center in Santa Ana. "You 
put some of it on a clean cloth and wipe the paint away. It's not effective on 
oil-based paints, however, and you may want to test it on an inconspicuous part 
of the border to see how it affects the paper. If you did use an oil-based 
paint, you can try using a solvent called Brush Life on the spots, but again, 
try it first in an area that's not easily seen. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent that from happening, you may want to use a 'paper' masking tape, 
available at most hardware and paint stores, which has little adhesive strength 
and won't be as damaging when used to mask wallpaper or any other sensitive 
surface.

 Q. Mice, gophers and rats are getting into the crawl space under my house. 
I've used plywood to block most of the vents to keep them out. Is this going to 
create any problems in that area? 
</P>
<P>
 R.R., Placentia 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 A. It's never a good idea to block those vents, says contractor Keith 
Stillwell of Santa Ana. You need a free exchange of air down there to help 
prevent mold and mildew. A better solution would be to install new screens or 
grates which keep out insects and rodents and yet allow fresh air to get 
inside. Do that and set some traps and you'll probably see a difference in your 
rodent population.

 Q. Last year we painted our master bathroom and some paint fell and went down 
the drain. We washed it out at the time, but ever since it's run fairly slow. 
Any suggestions on fixing it? 
</P>

 A If the dried paint has caused the slowness, you could try a drain cleaning 
product that contains sulfuric acid, says Rod Albright of Albright Plumbing & 
Heating Supply in Los Alamitos. But you'll have to be careful. Keep the area 
well ventilated, use rubber gloves, and pour just a little down the drain with 
a funnel to prevent splashing. If you've used a plumbing snake to try to clear 
it and it doesn't get past the trap, you may have to replace the trap.

 Q Some of my crystal goblets have broken on the stem, just above the base. Can 
they be repaired by reheating and reconnecting the broken parts? 
</P>
<P>
 W.G., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A In that kind of situation, it's best to professionally glue the broken 
pieces together, says Mark Willis of the Crystal Factory in Buena Park. Because 
of the properties of crystal, it has to be evenly heated for it to melt enough 
to make a repair, and it has a tendency to completely melt down.  
</P>

<P>
 Q There is a patch of our pile carpeting that has a five-inch tear from the 
wall. Can this be fixed without sewing? 
</P>
<P>
 W.C., Huntington Beach 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 A You can try using a carpet seaming tape, says Gary Lillge of Crown Hardware 
in Corona del Mar. There are tapes that are adhesive on both sides to attach to 
the floor and carpeting. Then there is the tape that is heat-activated, which 
is a more effective product. You apply the tape to the floor, place the two 
ends of carpeting that you wish to join, then go over the area with a hot iron. 
The tape has an epoxy glue that activates and holds the carpeting in place.

 No bait is needed to lure this "Fish Out of Water," a line of sculptures 
created for the garden by Herbie Webster of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish, made of a mild steel, stand on their tails and sport funky fins and 
gills, bug eyes, teeth and other artsy protrusions. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without a protective coating to preserve the rust patina, these are 
sure to bring tall tales and lively conversation to your garden, patio or 
poolside. Webster also makes water fountains and mailboxes, and he has recently 
begun work on birdbaths. 
</P>

 Anglers can reel in creatures less than a foot for about $275. Larger species 
range in price from $475 to $675. For more information, call (714) 240-1606.

 First, there were jeans, skirts and shirts; now there are sofas, love seats,

GOOD BOOK IS THE GENESIS FOR BIBLICAL GARDEN; GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BRIGGS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Garden of Eden is gone, but home gardeners can grow many of the plants, 
trees and herbs described in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new book, "Plants of the Bible and How to Grow Them" (Birch Lane Press), 
gardening expert Allan A. Swenson tells how to grow, or provide close 
substitutes for, the vegetation described in the Bible, from the cedars of 
Lebanon to the refreshing cucumbers and melons remembered fondly during 
Israel's time in the wilderness after the escape from slavery in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they get started, Swenson says, gardeners may find that tilling the earth 
with these plants can be a spiritual as well as physical exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson, author of some 30 books on gardening, said that as he did his 
research for the book, he was surprised by how much wisdom the Bible contained 
about caring for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said that the biblical command in Exodus to let the land rest 
and lie fallow every seventh year displays an often-ignored understanding of 
the need to let the land rest at various intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the discoveries he unearths in his book is the knowledge that the apple 
may have gotten a bad biblical rap over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Generations of popular portrayals aside, it is more likely that an apricot was 
the fruit of the tree that Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat, according to 
Swenson. There are no common apple trees native to Israel, while apricot trees 
are found abundantly in the Holy Land, Swenson says. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Swenson tells home gardeners how they can grow not only apples 
and apricots, but also figs and grapes, lilies and tulips, cedar and pine 
trees, and many other plants mentioned in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some famous plants, such as the trees that produce frankincense and myrrh, two 
of the famous gifts brought by the Wise Men to the infant Jesus, according to 
the Gospel of Matthew, are not generally available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson said he is hopeful that biblical gardeners will not only look up the 
references to their plants in the Bible, but also be turned on to regularly 
reading the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can get this world growing better together," Swenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some biblical gardens in the United States recommended by Swenson in 
his book on the subject: 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Gregory's Episcopal Church Bible Garden, Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Biblical Garden of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Garden of Our Lord at St. James Lutheran Church in Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rodef Shalom Biblical Botanical Garden at Rodef Shalom Temple in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Other biblical gardens cited in the book include those at the Pleasant Valley 
Baptist Church in Camarillo; Church of the Wayfarer and Church of the Holy 
Spirit in Carmel, and Beth El Bible Gardens in Providence, R.I.

VOLUNTEERS CLEARING THE AIR ON INDOOR HOME POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MCGRATH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend of mine's mother -- I'll call her Jane -- sold her house recently to 
get away from the headache of home repairs. She moved into a nice rental 
apartment in a convenient neighborhood. Two weeks later, she had a headache of 
a different color. 
</P>
<P>
 Something in her new home was making her sick. Actually, she didn't have a 
headache in the literal sense. What she did have were red, itchy eyes, a 
running nose, a chest cough, an itchy scalp and a rash around her neck -- all 
classic symptoms of what has come to be known as sick-building syndrome or 
environmental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane doesn't suffer alone. An estimated 30 million people in the United States 
are made ill by indoor air pollution and dust every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their problems are often caused by volatile chemicals that outgas from 
building materials, finishes, carpets and cleaning products. They are furthered 
by a decrease in time spent in housekeeping that allows more house dust to 
build up inside. And they are greatly exacerbated by a new energy consciousness 
that encourages people to seal up their houses without providing appropriate 
ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency ranks indoor air pollution as one of the 
most urgent environmental problems we face. Unfortunately, it's also one of the 
most ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Master Home Environmentalist Program in Seattle, a pilot program 
that may soon take root elsewhere. The program trains volunteers in the basics 
of how to identify indoor air problems and maintain a healthy home, 
communications skills, cultural sensitivity and just-plain-old sensitivity. It 
is patterned after the now-nationwide Master Gardener program, which gives 
expert training to gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 The home environmentalist training takes about 40 hours (one night a week for 
11 weeks and two Saturday classes). Volunteers make a commitment to work at 
least that many hours again, to help others. And the course is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the volunteers help people like Jane. They make free house calls, 
performing a house-health check called the Home Environmental Assessment List. 
They give presentations to groups. They accompany prospective home buyers and 
renters to help evaluate a place's healthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 And they dream up ways to reach people of different income levels, ethnic 
groups and living situations with the message that homes can be made healthier 
places to live.  
</P>
<P>
 The project was dreamed up by Home Toxics Consultant John Roberts and other 
members of a Seattle group called the Home Toxics Task Force. (The task force 
is made up of the League of Women Voters, the Washington Toxics Coalition, 
Sierra Club and the Washington Environmental Council.) It is funded by a pretty 
forward-thinking group of bureaucracies, including EPA and the state Department 
of Ecology.  
</P>
<P>
 The Master Home Environmentalist Program is still in its infancy, having 
trained 40 volunteers in two groups, but it has ambitious expansion goals.  
</P>
<P>
 One group of volunteers is organizing a program to visit home day-care 
centers, giving workshops for parents. Another group is investigating tenants' 
legal rights, in order to help tenants and landlords sort out whose 
responsibilities are whose.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the program is fielding requests for information from others around 
the country interested in setting up similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information on Seattle's Master Home Environmentalist Program is 
available from Lucy Gaskill-Gaddis, Home Toxics Task Force Coordinator, at 
(206) 938-3040, or John Roberts, at (206) 322-0616.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Couch-potato alert. The High Point, N.C., spring furniture market, which ended 
last week, produced a new upholstery fabric for those who like a cushy seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Polarfleece, that fuzzy stuff popular for lightweight jackets and weekend 
sportswear, is the latest fabric to make the jump from fashion to home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed up on a modern version of a blue wing chair at the Milling Road 
division of Baker Furniture and is available in red, gray, khaki and brown.

ALLOW FOR DRAINAGE IN BUILDING FENCE; DOING IT YOURSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans, since the first settlers, have always been enthusiastic fence 
builders. Early fences contained livestock, while today's fences are used to 
frame the lawn, define boundaries and provide privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 When you consider building a fence, pick a style that will fit its 
surroundings. Then measure the proposed perimeter to see how many sections 
you'll need. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fences are built in six- or eight-foot sections. Posts are commonly 4x4s, 
although 6x6s and 8x8s are sometimes required for corners and gateposts. Rails, 
the horizontal bars, are 2x4s, and fence pickets or vertical boards may be 1x4s 
or 1x6s. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent rust from staining the wood, use aluminum or hot-dipped, galvanized 
nails and hardware. Estimate the amount of gravel you'll need for drainage. If 
you set the posts in concrete, figure that a 90-pound bag of premixed concrete 
occupies about two-thirds of a cubic foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Use wood that has been pressure treated with a preservative to resist rot and 
insects, or wood that resists decay naturally, such as cedar, redwood, cypress 
and locust. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin laying out the fence by locating the corner posts and driving in stakes. 
Then run mason's twine tautly between two corner stakes. Mark the correct 
on-center position of each intermediate fence post on the twine with chalk. A 
plumb line against the mark centers each post on the ground. Drive a stake 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 In loose, sandy soil, it's best to set posts in concrete -- but only in 
frost-free areas or where the concrete will be below the frost line. Generally, 
set one-third of the post in the ground. Start with the corner posts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you set a post in gravel or concrete, dig the hole four to six inches 
deeper than the post bottom for drainage material -- a large flat stone or 
gravel bed. Flare the hole at the bottom for good support. Then stand the post 
in the hole on the drainage material. 
</P>
<P>
 To set the post in earth, fill in with six inches of gravel and tamp it 
solidly before replacing and tamping the excavated soil. Fill several inches at 
a time and tamp each layer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay a level vertically on two sides of the post to make sure it's plumb. Add a 
last layer of rocks at ground level and cap with a tamped-earth cone to drain 
water away from the post. In concrete, make the hole six inches deeper for 
gravel, set the post on the gravel and fill around it with concrete. Slope the 
top for drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 If posts are set in concrete, let them stand several days while the concrete 
sets; otherwise, add the rails immediately. Rails made of 2x4s are sturdy 
enough to hold most vertical fence boards. Thinner stock might bend. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ends can be toe-nailed, cleated or set with metal fasteners. Fence 
boards are generally one-inch stock, three inches or more wide. Most are 
face-nailed to the rails. For easy, even spacing, cut a board to the gap-width 
and insert it as a guide when nailing on face boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateposts are larger and deeper set than the rest of the fence to withstand 
the added stress. If the gate is to swing properly, it must be perfectly plumb. 
Allow for hinge and latch clearance when measuring. A diagonal brace to support 
the rails strengthens the gate section.

PUTTING GREAT STORE IN DUAL USES OF DOLLED-UP ACCESSORIES; COLLECTIBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Old toys and architectural elements such as columns and pediments are finding 
a niche as interesting home accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying both trends to their ultimate conclusion, dollhouses are turning up 
in some very sophisticated living spaces. A dollhouse is, after all, a 
luxurious toy and a complete example of an architectural element. 
</P>
<P>
 Two beverage cabinets are ringers for luxury dollhouses. One is a copy of a 
Georgian mansion, the other based on a traditional New England house. 
</P>
<P>
 In each, the roof lifts and the front opens to expose not miniature rooms but 
shelves and cubbies for decanters and glasses. Shallow drawers at the base 
provide more storage room, and there is a pullout shelf for mixing drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're popular in living rooms and dens and for the corner of a dining room 
as a drink caddy," says Linda Jones, marketing consultant to Masco Home 
Furnishings in High Point, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Both dollhouses-cum-liquor cabinets are from Masco subsidiaries in High Point. 
The Georgian mansion from Maitland-Smith retails for about $2,100, the New 
England style from Lineage sells for about $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Less fanciful is the Manor Bookhouse, a three-shelf storage unit that looks 
like an open dollhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Darneille, who designed the unit for Learning Passport Co. of Bethesda, 
Md., says the shelf is "a starting point for the imagination because it is 
suggestive of a house but could be other things." 
</P>
<P>
 The side and back panels give it the look of a stripped-down, three-story 
manor house. Three steps and four columns form an entrance. Vertical dividers 
can turn the middle shelf into separate rooms, and mantelpieces on the back 
panels of the first and third shelves add to the homeyness. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is priced from $150 to $400, windows and doors are optional features. 
Darneille also designed a game, "Configure," which can be used to decorate the 
shelves -- floors and walls, if you will -- with tiles in different patterns. 
The game is sold in two sizes, which retail for $29.95 and $44.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides its use as a decorative storage piece, the piece can also serve as a 
dollhouse, a puppet theater or a play store. It was singled out for its 
originality by Early Childhood News, a publication for educators of young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollhouse Antics, a specialty shop in New York, occasionally stocks dollhouse 
cabinets made specifically for storage. It occasionally sells a dollhouse to be 
modified for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dollhouses are mostly for children, but we have a number of adult customers 
and collectors," says Katharine Forsyth, co-owner. "The dollhouses are very 
pretty, fashionable with their faux finishing and fancy painting, and kind of 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Robinson and Chip Cordelli, New York designers, recently bought a 
Victorian dollhouse kit from Dollhouse Antics. They are turning it into a 
mailbox for a Victorian Christmas display to be mounted in Hokkaido, Japan, by 
Felissimo, a Japanese mail-order retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth says she has seen dollhouse facades turned into television cabinets 
and used for other decorative custom cabinet fronts. The turnabout is fair 
play. In the 19th Century, storage cabinets were turned into dollhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many were constructed as cupboards without exterior architectural features," 
says Sheila Clark, assistant curator for the toy collection at the Museum of 
the City of New York, where nine dollhouses are on permanent exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, a 19th-Century dollhouse would have a pretty facade, doors and 
windows, but many did not. They had either a flat or a pointed roof and, 
usually, hinged doors that opened like a cupboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The most lavish dollhouses over the years were often commissioned by adults 
for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1920s, Carrie Stettheimer of New York, a grown woman, designed every 
aspect of a dollhouse," Clark says, visualizing one three-story confection in 
the museum. "Each room was a work of art."

UMBRELLA LOVES TO OPEN INDOORS; GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To those who claim a non-green thumb, there is a houseplant that virtually 
anyone can grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common problems with houseplants arise from improper watering. 
</P>
<P>
 Some plants suffer slow death in soil that is constantly waterlogged; others 
slowly expire in soil allowed to go bone dry between waterings. And some plants 
are forced to alternate between these extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant I have in mind is called umbrella plant ( Cyperus alternifolius ) 
and requires no skill in watering. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the umbrella plant is native to shallow waters, you never have to 
decide whether to water. Water is always needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grow this plant by standing its pot in a deep saucer that you always keep 
filled with a couple of inches of water. What could be simpler? One caution, 
though. The top edge of the saucer does have to be below the rim of the pot. 
Umbrella plants like their roots constantly bathed in water, but not their 
stems. 
</P>
<P>
 The umbrella plant is not a homely plant, sacrificing good looks for ease of 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is a graceful clump of bare, slender stems, each stem capped by a 
whorl of leaves radiating out like the ribs of a naked umbrella. The stems are 
two to four feet tall and each leaf four to eight inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 A dwarf form of the plant, botanically C. albostriatus, grows only a foot or 
so high and has grassy leaves growing in among the stems at its base. There is 
also a white-speckled form of umbrella plant and a wispy one with especially 
thin leaves and stems. 
</P>
<P>
 Umbrella plants are not finicky about care other than watering. They grow best 
in sunny windows but will get along in any bright room. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as potting soil, your regular homemade or packaged mix will suffice. 
Umbrella plants like a near-neutral pH, as do most other houseplants. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants do require periodic repotting as they begin to crowd their pots. 
Shift the large plant into a yet larger pot, or make new plants by dividing the 
large clump into smaller clumps and potting each of them separately. 
</P>
<P>
 One way umbrella plants reproduce in the wild is by taking root where their 
stems arch over to touch the ground. You can mimic this technique indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold the leaves down around the stem with a rubber band, as if you were 
closing the umbrella. Cut the stem a few inches below the whorl of leaves and 
poke the umbrella, leaves pointing upward, into some potting soil -- kept 
constantly moist, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you may be unfamiliar with the umbrella plant, you probably have come 
across its near-relatives either in the garden or in literature. 
</P>
<P>
 One relative is yellow nutsedge ( C. esculentum ), a plant usually considered 
a weed and inhabiting wet soils all the way from Maine down to the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
 But esculentum in Latin means "succulent" and refers to the sweet, nutlike 
tubers this plant produces below ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Umbrella plant's other well-known relative is papyrus ( C. papyrus ), a plant 
that once grew wild along the Nile. In ancient times, papyrus was used not only 
to make paper but also to build boats and as food. 
</P>
<P>
 Papyrus looks much like the umbrella plant and, being subtropical, also would 
make a good houseplant. 
</P>
<P>
 But with stems that can soar 15 feet high, this species is too tall for most 
living rooms.

POSTAL WORKER DETAILS HARASSMENT BY HILBUN; GRAND JURY: WOMAN DESCRIBES 
FIXATION, BIZARRE BEHAVIOR BY CO-WORKER ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS MOTHER AND BEST 
FRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Kim Springer says it all began so innocently, at a Fourth of July office 
outing to the Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 But postal worker Mark Hilbun didn't want the evening to end. Within hours, 
the phone calls began. Then the bottled water and other odd gifts on Springer's 
doorstep. Then the love letters, followed by ones more threatening. And 
finally, she says, Hilbun left a message inviting her to bring popcorn and 
watch him commit suicide on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd follow me everywhere I'd go," Springer told the Orange County Grand Jury 
in January. "I mean, at one point it was like three or four times a day he'd 
show up. I told him to go back and do his route and deliver his mail. And once 
I slapped him. I didn't handle it very well."  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it was Hilbun's fixation with Springer that ultimately led 
to the fired postal worker's murderous, two-day rampage across Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, 1993, Hilbun had come looking for Springer at the Dana Point Post 
Office when he shot and killed his best friend and wounded another postal 
worker. And before Hilbun was captured, his mother and her cocker spaniel were 
found killed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the postal facility shootings, Hilbun remained at large for several days 
until customers spotted him at a Huntington Beach bar and called police. He was 
arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was unharmed that day, and has declined to talk publicly about her 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But grand jury transcripts recently unsealed offer the first detailed account 
of Springer's months of fear and hiding as Hilbun pursued her. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer said her torment didn't end with Hilbun's arrest. Shortly after, a 
"weird" letter arrived in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun wrote that "he just found his place, and he saw the light . . . he's 
happy and content, and he'll be shown the way," Springer testified. "I was 
really upset. I couldn't believe he was writing me from jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun, 39, of San Juan Capistrano was eventually indicted and is facing trial 
next February on two counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His attorney, Deputy Public 
Defender Denise Gragg, said she plans to admit to jurors that Hilbun is 
responsible for the crimes. But Gragg said she believes the evidence will prove 
that Hilbun has long suffered from mental illness and was insane when the 
killing spree began. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the grand jury transcript, Hilbun's rampage had begun at the 
Corona del Mar home where his mother, Frances, lived with her dog, Golden. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the dog's throat had been "cut out" and his mother was found 
lying in her bed, beneath blood-soaked blankets. She had been stabbed 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hilbun arrived at the Dana Point Post Office, and investigators say he 
was intent on kidnaping Springer.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Bryan Brown told the grand jury that Hilbun was seeking revenge 
against postal officials who placed him on leave for his harassment of 
Springer, according to the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer said that the harassment had been relentless since July 4, 1992, the 
night she went to the fair with Hilbun. She said she alerted her supervisors at 
the post office right away about Hilbun. 
</P>
<P>
 She changed her phone number twice because of his constant calls and obscene 
messages. Her boyfriend tried to stop Hilbun from bothering her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept doing my job and just kept saying just, 'Mark, you know, just 
leave me alone,' " she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun's escalating harassment and bizarre behavior resulted in his firing, 
according to the grand jury transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 One time, Hilbun had come to work "wide-eyed" and carrying a bag of rabbits. 
He threw the bag and animals at a co-worker, according to the transcript.  
</P>
<P>
 The final incident that led to the firing occurred when postal officials found 
Hilbun wearing his underwear outside his uniform and dancing wildly at his work 
station. When Hilbun was ordered to stop, he put the drawers on his head. He 
was ordered off the premises that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun's stepsister, Jennifer Beneventi, testified that Hilbun told relatives 
he was going to marry Springer. Hilbun told his stepsister that that he wore 
the underwear outside his clothing because he lost a bet with himself that he 
would be dating Springer by a self-imposed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneventi also told jurors that Hilbun was enraged at postal officials and 
blamed them for his firing. Hilbun appealed the firing and but lost his case 
April 19, 1993, just a few days before the shooting, according to the 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer told jurors that postal officials had talked of transferring her and 
put her on leave for her own safety in the days before the shooting because 
they "weren't sure what Mark was up to."  
</P>
<P>
 Two other employees -- including the postmaster -- were so fearful of the 
fired employee they began arming themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many things going on," said Postmaster Donald Lowe, who 
brought a gun for the first time on May 6. "I had gotten to a point where 
everything that could be done was done. Everyone was notified. 
</P>
<P>
 May 6, the day of the shooting, also was Springer's first day back at work. 
</P>
<P>
 That Thursday morning, Springer said, she had just taken a break when a 
startling noise pierced through the music she was listening to on a radio 
headset. 
</P>
<P>
 She heard screaming and turned around to see Hilbun, "with a bandanna around 
his face, waving a gun back and forth coming down the middle of our bay," 
Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dead up against the wall," she said, describing how she tried to hide, 
hoping he had not checked her route assignment for the day. Such information 
would help him track her easily in the large building. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he knew what route I went out on, he would have seen me right away. . . . 
I went under my mail case," she told the grand jury. "He was calling my name." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown asked Springer if she recognized the gunman's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I heard his voice . . . Mark Hilbun's voice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown told jurors the evidence shows he killed fellow postal worker Charles T. 
Barbagallo when he refused to tell Hilbun where Springer was working that 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer testified that she made it clear to Hilbun from the start that she 
was not interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no romantic inclinations," Springer said, adding that when Hilbun 
called her after the July 4 fair outing, she spurned his advances.

O.C. TREASURER THRUST INTO SPOTLIGHT OVER RISK CLAIMS; INVESTMENTS: ROBERT 
CITRON, FACING HIS FIRST CONTESTED ELECTION IN 24 YEARS, POINTS TO HIGH RETURNS 
TO REBUT CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After toiling largely in obscurity for 24 years, Orange County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron uncomfortably finds himself at the center of a 
highly visible and somewhat one-sided debate over the risks he takes with 
billions of dollars in taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for making Wall Street deals that many of his peers cannot, or will not 
make, Citron concedes he takes risks but insists they are prudent ones. To 
rebut his critics, he points to the higher-than-average returns he has earned 
on his investments, returns that even his detractors acknowledge are among the 
best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Gesturing toward the telephone on his desk, Citron says that, despite the 
negative publicity he's received in recent weeks, virtually all of the 185 
cities and government agencies that have entrusted him with their funds have 
called with reassurances. The message, he says, was invariably the same: "We're 
with you, Bob." 
</P>
<P>
 As treasurer, Citron is responsible for investing billions of dollars in 
county tax revenue. Because Citron in recent years has consistently matched or 
outperformed the managers of rival state and county investment pools, 
practically every city and school district in Orange County relies on Citron to 
manage their surplus funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, it was a job that Citron had kept winning, without a 
challenger at the polls, ever since 1970. For the first time in more than two 
decades, however, he has drawn a political opponent this year, and his 
challenger's camp has been the principal source of the criticism that Citron 
has been getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a political situation where my opponent is making aspersions against my 
investment ability, and that's the way politics is," Citron said, adding that 
the "feedback I'm getting from the community is they aren't buying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citron publicly minimizes the political fallout, the much-chronicled 
dispute has shaken the only Democrat holding elective office in county 
government, a man who so loves his job he routinely forgoes vacation to spend 
hours on the phone at work with traders and dealers to talk the talk of Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would dispute that Citron has earned a national reputation as a shrewd, 
assertive money manager who invests big with public funds and, at least so far, 
wins big. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether his luck is about to change, as his political opponents assert, is 
another question. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, Citron's investment strategy relies heavily on using the 
investment pool's U. S. Treasury bills and bonds as collateral to borrow 
short-term at low interest rates, and investing the borrowed funds in mid-term 
corporate bonds and securities that pay a higher rate of return. This kind of 
investment strategy can yield large returns while interest rates remain low and 
stable. But it can also backfire when interest rates rise, as they have since 
the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Citron has received "collateral calls" that forced him to 
pony up an additional $215 million in collateral, because the value of the 
securities he used to borrow money has skidded as interest rates have climbed. 
His assistant, Matthew R. Raabe, said he expects yet more collateral calls, but 
he is not worried because the county's $7.5-billion investment pool has about 
$1 billion in liquid assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citron has averaged a 9.03% return over the past decade -- nearly 
double that of some comparable investment pools -- the last 24 months have seen 
a steady erosion of those returns, which are now approaching 7%. While that is 
still higher than average, his political opponent, accountant John Moorlach and 
his supporters, are sounding the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you borrow short and you invest intermediate in a period of rising 
interest rates, you're going to be hurt and you're going to be hurt bad, for 
the simple reason that the principal value of what you buy goes down 
significantly," said Larry T. Smith, an accountant, investor and Moorlach 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done well because he's been riding a time of sliding interest rates. His 
program is a dream come true in a period of sliding interest rates. But we are 
in a period of rising interest rates. And from everything I've read we're going 
to have that for several years." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron and Raabe disagree. They believe interest rates will inch up for a 
short time and level off. If they are wrong, they say they have a contingency 
or "exit" plan, although they are unwilling to share the particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe said the only way the county could get into trouble is if "short-term 
interest rates are going to continue to go up and . . . we don't react. But 
that's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citron professes to be only mildly annoyed by the unprecedented 
attention being given his first contested election in 24 years, those close to 
him say he is far more troubled by the heightened level of scrutiny than he 
lets on. In addition to news stories in the local media, articles questioning 
Citron's investment tactics have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, which 
rarely covers such local stories, and a pair of trade publications, Derivative 
Week and The Bond Buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like he walked down the street and someone just stepped in front of him 
and punched him in the stomach," said R. A. Scott, the head of the county's 
General Services Agency who has known Citron for 20 years. "This has taken him 
totally by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 When others in the investment field are questioned about Citron's investing 
habits, they, too, point to his past accomplishments, not the possible 
predicament he finds himself in today. They start with the fact that, during 
the 1980s, Citron helped author many of the laws governing what county 
treasurers can and can't invest in. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Citron was singled out by a trade magazine, City & State, as one of 
the best county finance officers in the nation. Last month, the Orange County 
chapter of the American Society for Public Accountants announced that Citron 
had been given an "outstanding public official award" for his "exemplary 
contributions to government and the quality of life in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of him as being unsafe or wild or taking chances, but if you 
divide all of us into being aggressive or less aggressive, then he's among the 
most aggressive," said Donald Merz, treasurer-tax collector in Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Citron's colleagues around the state have declined to take advantage 
of some of the investment strategies Citron has helped to make legal for them, 
most notably an arcane transaction called a "reverse repurchase agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with it," said Tony Andrade, controller and deputy 
treasurer for Garden Grove. "My investment policy here is just a little more 
conservative than what they have there in the county pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Buffington, treasurer-tax collector in San Mateo County, said his $800 
million portfolio has earned rates "right around 5%" without relying on 
higher-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a big pool with a lot of resources you can afford to take some 
gambles other people can't," said Buffington, current president of the 
California Assn. of County Treasurers and Tax Collectors. "Bob is really tuned 
into the marketplace, and that's the secret of this business." 
</P>
<P>
 While Citron is shy and prefers to labor in obscurity, he can be brash and 
outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first came into office as tax collector, he criticized the county's 
data processing department and its director. County supervisors hired an 
outside firm, but a county grand jury rejected Citron's claims that the 
director was guilty of malfeasance, and reprimanded Citron for causing such a 
fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, he took on Sheriff Brad Gates, accusing him of engaging in "a con 
game" by asking for more money in his budget than he actually needed and also 
subjecting the county to costly legal settlements. Gates lashed back at Citron, 
saying he didn't expect "someone who manages a very small operation, performing 
relatively simple and predictable tasks, to understand the dynamics" of running 
the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Citron has appeared petty. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, he accused the county's auditor-controller of shortchanging his 
salary by $12.66 a year. Citron, who was making $42,902 at the time, later 
admitted he was wrong, but only after officials pored over payroll records. 
</P>
<P>
 His self-confidence and occasional defensiveness have sometimes been construed 
as arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 When county activist Shirley Grindle tried to persuade county officials to 
agree on campaign contribution limits, Citron, initially, was the only 
dissenter among department managers, she said. Eventually, he agreed to a limit 
of $1,000 per contributor per election. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of our better administrators and I respect him," Grindle said, "but 
I think he's gotten a little cocky from all those years in office." 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation as a financial wheeler-dealer is hard to reconcile with 
Citron's other characteristics, which paint a man for whom the word stable is 
an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-generation Californian, Citron was born in Los Angeles and grew up in 
Burbank. Because he had asthma as a child, his family moved out of the smog 
into the town of Hemet. His father, Jesse, was a doctor. The elder Citron's 
claim to fame: He treated the liquor-loving W.C. Fields and weaned him off 
Scotch. After a year, Dr. Citron got Fields to drop his consumption of Scotch 
from a quart to a teaspoonful a day. 
</P>
<P>
 When the good doctor billed Fields, Fields sued him. Fields lost and would 
later say Jesse Citron was one of the only men to ever beat him at anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, Citron is a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Terry Citron have been married for nearly 39 years. They met in 
1955 in a parking lot after she admired his gold and white Chrysler. They were 
married inside of three months and have lived in the same home for 22 years. He 
travels less than two miles from home to office and says he has no greater 
ambition than to do what he is doing right now. 
</P>
<P>
 A switch to private industry for more money? He's not interested; he says his 
$100,339-a-year salary is more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
 A run at higher office? Not interested, though he says he has been asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In his position, he could easily justify flying back and forth to Wall Street 
to hobnob, but he has been to New York only once -- to pick up an award as one 
of the five best government investors nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it was his first and only trip, he stayed only a day because, Terry 
Citron said, the "hassles" of travel don't suit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday and Sunday don't suit him either, Terry Citron said, because he can't 
go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can barely stand the weekend at home," Terry Citron said. "He can't wait 
to get back. I think he'd go crazy without that job." 
</P>
<P>
 His only boasts of frivolousness: he collects turquoise Indian jewelry, 
neckties and USC paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes no exotic investments with his own money, Terry Citron said, 
preferring lower-yielding but safer investments, such as savings accounts and 
certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very serious about life and everything else," said Robert Politiski, a 
Santa Ana attorney who has known Citron since their days at the University of 
Southern California. "He dedicates his life to his work and to be criticized is 
very hurtful." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's competitive, and if he returns a greater rate on short term money than 
most people, he considers that winning," said Scott, who as GSA head is one of 
Citron's peers in county government. "It's pride. It's being above average. 
When he's trading, he's all business." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Citron is blaming the entire controversy on the upcoming election. He 
is unequivocal about there being no basis for the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 But it nonetheless has him running slightly scared. For the first time, Citron 
is even spending his campaign money on his own race. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he has run unopposed over the years, he has often diverted his 
campaign funds to other Democratic candidates, according to election records, 
including former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and 
state Assemblyman Tom Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his support of Umberg in 1990 that Citron believes earned him the 
enmity of Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron and Fuentes have been feuding ever since, and Moorlach's campaign 
committee reads like a Who's Who of the local Republican hierarchy: Reps. 
Christopher Cox, Dana Rohrabacher, Robert K. Dornan and Ed Royce; Assembly 
members Mickey Conroy, Gil Ferguson, Doris Allen, Bill Morrow and Curt Pringle, 
as well as state Sens. Marian Bergeson, John Lewis and Rob Hurtt -- although 
Bergeson has subsequently withdrawn her endorsement in anger over some of 
Moorlach's public statements she said might hurt the county's credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such opposition and the controversy, Citron has become 
emotional and defensive of late. Two weeks ago, he said the campaign -- tame by 
most standards -- had taken such an emotional toll on him and his wife that he 
would not run again. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends say he sensitive. His critics say he's overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
 "My golly," said Smith, the investor working on Moorlach's campaign, "this is 
the first time anyone has questioned him in 24 years and these questions are 
very legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is attacking the man's character. No one's saying he's a thief. 
They're only asking if he's being prudent enough." Profile: Robert L. Citron

KOREAN AMERICANS STILL PLAGUED BY RIOTS' EFFECTS; REBUILDING: ONCE ECONOMICALLY 
VIBRANT COMMUNITY IS IN A FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEPRESSION TWO YEARS LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago today, the South-Central market and dreams of a hard-working 
Korean American couple went up in flames during the second day of the Los 
Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, before they had recovered from the riots' fury, Kyu Shup and 
Kyung Sin Lee were roused from sleep in their Cerritos home at 6 a.m. Law 
enforcement officials handcuffed them in front of their tearful children and 
hauled them off to jail. Much to their disbelief, the Lees were accused of 
arson and other crimes in the torching of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-month Kafkaesque journey through the criminal justice system finally 
ended in February when they were acquitted of all charges. The Lees' story is 
among the most traumatic chapters in the saga of the local Korean American 
community, which suffered heavy heavy damage during the rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees may have been vindicated in court, but they remain jobless, nearly 
$200,000 in debt and in poor health. On some mornings they are so depressed, 
the only thing that makes them venture outside is to take their 8-year-old 
daughter to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the riots, which directly affected 10,000 people of Korean 
ancestry, more than a third of the 2,500 Korean-owned businesses that were 
damaged or destroyed remain closed. The combination of the riots and the 
lingering recession has put the once economically vibrant Korean American 
community in a financial and emotional depression. Incidents of alcohol abuse 
and domestic violence are up, according to community social service agencies. 
Cases of bankruptcies and post-traumatic stress disorder are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those hardest hit are market operators with liquor licenses who struggle 
to reopen their businesses in the face of new city restrictions imposed since 
the riots to limit the number of liquor stores in South-Central. Of the 172 
liquor stores wiped out during the riots, only eight have reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 15 liquor store owners have received city permits to rebuild, but they 
have not been able to get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants have given up all together, returning to South Korea or moving 
to Colorado, Washington state and elsewhere in search of a more hospitable 
environment. Others are trying desperately to start over again, but 
bureaucratic obstacles, financial difficulties and health problems have been 
hard to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Korean American community organizations, staffed by well-meaning but 
mostly young college graduates who are not fluent in Korean, have not been much 
help, exasperated victims complain. So, their anguish continues, mostly unseen 
and unheard by the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "The invisible people of the April 29th riots are the Korean immigrant 
victims," said K.W. Lee, retired editor of the Korea Times English Edition. 
"Right after the riots, every luminary under the sun from George Bush to Bill 
Clinton came to Los Angeles. They made all kinds of promises, but they 
delivered absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not guilty!" Fourteen times the jury forewoman repeated those words inside a 
hushed Los Angeles courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fourth "not guilty" verdict, Kyu Shup Lee began to tremble. He 
grabbed his attorney's hand and started to sob. His wife, Kyung Sin Lee, seated 
beside her lawyer, was crying too. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdicts were read in the case against the couple, Kyu Shup Lee got 
up slowly, straightened his tall frame and walked up to the forewoman. He 
hugged her; she reciprocated. "I love America," he said in heavily accented 
English. "There is justice in America. Thank you. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 But the legal victory was only paper-thin. It has neither eased their pain nor 
helped piece together their shattered lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're exhausted from the ordeal," said Kyung Sin Lee, 41, who was a nurse in 
Seoul. "There isn't an ounce of energy left in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Korean American business owners, the Lees lost nearly everything 
inside their store. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike other victims, they say they were victimized twice -- a second time 
by the criminal justice system -- when they were accused of removing 
merchandise from their market, then getting others to burn it down to collect 
insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
 Exonerated by the jury, the Lees are trying to get back the Small Business 
Administration loan that was canceled after their arrest. But two months after 
their acquittal, all they get is the runaround from SBA officials, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's maddening," Kyu Shup Lee said. "I have not even received one letter from 
them. There is no accountability anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Unloading his frustration, Lee, who has a degree in textile engineering from a 
prestigious Seoul university, spoke in Korean, the volume of his voice rising 
with the intensity of his emotion: 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it possible that law enforcement officials could bring such grave 
charges against myself and my children's mother based on remarks of 
disreputable people? If they had done their homework, they would have known 
that those so-called witnesses had lied to cover up the fact that they stole 
from my store during the riots. Yet, they chose to prosecute my wife and me -- 
law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I live I can never forget the humiliation my wife and I were 
subjected to by agents of the law who descended on our home and hauled us to 
jail like common criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees were initially charged with arson, insurance fraud and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses, who claimed to authorities that Kyu Shup Lee had told them 
to help themselves to what was in the store and solicited neighborhood 
residents to torch the place, did not testify in court. One witness who did 
testify contradicted the prosecution.  
</P>
<P>
 The arson charge was dismissed, but when the case was refiled in Superior 
Court, the prosecution tacked on seven counts of falsifying mortgage documents. 
On the day of the trial the prosecution dropped the grand theft and insurance 
fraud counts, so the case was tried only on the allegations of altering 
mortgage papers. 
</P>
<P>
 They were accused of making false financial statements when they bought their 
home. But the Lees, whose English proficiency is limited, testified that they 
had relied on their loan agent and simply signed their names as instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the trial was over, the couple had incurred $85,000 in attorneys' 
fees. To satisfy their $1 million bail, which was reduced to $150,000, Kyu Shup 
Lee's relatives put liens on their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 What hurts Lee more than the pain he and his wife have endured is the 
suffering inflicted on his 82-year-old father and their children. After his 
father, who lives in Seoul, heard the news of his youngest son's arrest, the 
right side of his face became "paralyzed like a stroke victim's," Lee said. "My 
father cannot speak anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Lee came to Los Angeles to be with his son. "Every time my father 
sees me, he points to the right side of his face and then at me," said Lee, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 His children, 13 and 8, are terrified of police officers. "Whenever they see a 
police car, they take cover," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in jail on the eve of Halloween, thinking of my children's unfinished 
costumes," his wife said. "The dream we brought from Korea that made us work so 
hard for all those years is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's attorney, Angela Oh, said the district attorney's office picked the Lees 
to use as an example, emphasizing the widespread publicity generated by the 
district attorney's press office when the couple was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely wanted to send a message that people who cheat and defraud 
our financial institutions would not be tolerated, but they had the wrong 
people," Oh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Cabral called Oh's characterization unfair. "We 
looked at the evidence and we thought there was sufficient evidence to file 
charges," he said. "Sometimes juries agree; sometimes juries don't agree." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees were not provided interpreters when officials began their 
investigation. Oh said the Lees were misunderstood by everyone they dealt with 
-- from the insurance company to agents from the Fire Department, the district 
attorney's office, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and 
members of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapson Yim Lee, editor of the Korea Times English Edition, said she hopes law 
enforcement agencies will learn from this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Korean immigrants the language barrier is a chronic problem," she said. 
"It is a miscarriage of justice that these two industrious immigrants were 
subjected to this ordeal. Who is going to give them back their lost years and 
their health?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many Korean Americans see the plight of the Lees and other riot victims as a 
reflection of their community's political impotence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When two Japanese students were killed (in a San Pedro carjacking), even the 
President of the United States apologized, but when Korean grocers are killed, 
nobody even mentions their name," said Jee Hee Min, a Korean homemaker who 
lives in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 46 Korean Americans in the Los Angeles area were shot during 
robberies and 19 died. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come to America to be cannon fodders," said Young Jin Lee, who runs 
a clothing store in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in the Los Angeles garment district, Arison Kang, 22, whose family 
went from riches to rags after the riots, says the lesson from the civil 
disturbances is getting involved in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we don't vote, the American government won't take us seriously," 
she said. "Koreans living in the U.S. should become citizens and vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Shin Dal Kang, took his life on April 1, unable to get over the 
depression from losing what he had worked for during a quarter-century in the 
United States. His death shocked the Korean American community, a poignant 
reminder of the riots' continuing toll. 
</P>
<P>
 With him gone, Arison dropped out of school temporarily to help her mother, 
Kyung Pun Kang, run a women's clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times during the workday, Kang retreats to her office in the back of the 
store and weeps, thinking of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband would be alive now, if it hadn't been for the riots," she said. "I 
am still upset with the police chief (Daryl Gates) and the mayor (Tom Bradley). 
Why did they let their bad relationship get in the way of protecting citizens 
of Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Kangs' clothing business in a South-Central swap meet was destroyed 
during the riots, they have lost an apartment building and their $1 million 
home in Hancock Park because they fell behind in payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one night, our credit went from excellent to bad," Kyung Pun Kang said. 
"Now, nobody will lend us money to start over." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband fell into a deep depression after they lost their home. 
"We had lived there for 15 years," Kang said. "We had a one-acre home with a 
stream running through the back yard. We had so many happy memories there." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all the trappings of success, including a Mercedes-Benz and Arison's 
horse, are gone. "My only solace is my religion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband killed himself while their son, Donald, was on a solo journey 
around the world in a sailboat. "Our son wanted to become the first Korean to 
go around the world on a boat," she said. "When he left, my husband said he 
would wait for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, she said: "Donald is returning home from 
Samoa. He wants to be at my side right now. I told him to complete his journey, 
but he said he's coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, looking at a picture of her husband, she said she wishes she had not 
quarreled with him. "Things were so difficult after the riots, we exchanged 
harsh words. I wish I had been more patient with him." 
</P>
<P>
 It is only minutes after 10 on a Wednesday morning, and Kumja Park is busily 
packing wild rice with pecans and Peking salad into lunch boxes inside a cafe 
she runs in the Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 With 500 office workers patronizing her place, she is on her feet 13 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Park (not her real name) started the business with the $390,000 
SBA loan she received last year after her Crenshaw district liquor store burned 
to the ground on the first day of the riots. She wanted to go back, but her 
landlady put the lot up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months Park, a widow with no children, looked for a business she could 
run alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running a restaurant -- even if it's small like mine -- is so difficult 
because of hired help," she said. "I can't even go to the bathroom, when my 
cashier doesn't show up." She has four employees -- all non-Korean. "When two 
employees call in sick, the place is paralyzed." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, she and her late husband opened the liquor store with the money they 
had saved for 20 years. Six months later, he was diagnosed with cancer and 
eight months after that he died. Park was still mourning her husband's passing 
when her business was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easier to operate a market because she could get relatives to help, she 
said. "With restaurants, you've got to have people who know how to prepare 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 Business hours are from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, but Park 
spends many hours on evenings and weekends making purchases and preparing 
vegetables and meats. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who is in her mid-50s, said her body aches constantly from the stress of 
the business and working on her feet all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much longer I can continue," she said. Her predicament is 
between a rock and a hard place. "If I quit, I won't get a penny because the 
SBA will get everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering the happier days before the riots when her husband was alive, Park 
looked sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it hadn't been for the riots, I could have retired comfortably in a few 
more years." 
</P>
<P>
 That plan was buried with the ashes of her market. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I have is a 30-year SBA loan to pay off. I won't live another 30 years. 
But I have nothing left, so I have to try -- just to survive," Park said. "The 
last thing I want is to lose my home. I want to die in my house. I have so many 
memories with my late husband in that home."

S. AFRICAN LEADERS CALL VOTE FREE, FAIR; DEMOCRACY: DESPITE FOUL-UPS, MANDELA 
AND DE KLERK SAY THEY ARE SATISFIED AS NATION'S FIRST ALL-RACE ELECTION ENDS 
QUIETLY AFTER ADDED DAY OF POLLING. COUNTING BEGINS TODAY.

 Despite widespread fears of polling violence, this nation's first all-race 
elections for a post-apartheid government drew to a close Friday amid an 
atmosphere of calm and initial assessments by political leaders that the 
long-awaited balloting was substantially free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from the six remote tribal homelands where polling had been extended 
an extra day were similar to those here in the former so-called homeland of 
Lebowa -- a massive turnout of first-time black voters, scattered cases of 
ballots arriving late and a weary sense of satisfaction that the historic week 
was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all quiet," said Nikki Moore, spokeswoman for the Independent Electoral 
Commission, the Johannesburg-based nonpartisan group that has run the elections 
and must determine the validity of the outcome. "No violence, no conflict, no 
intimidation, no irregularities that we know of." 
</P>
<P>
 In this rural township, about 150 miles north of Johannesburg, local elections 
supervisor Edwin Nyatlo finally relaxed as the last locked ballot boxes were 
loaded onto a bus and carted off by armed soldiers for storage overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the majority of people, it was a victory just to vote," he said. 
"Whatever happens afterward, it was a victory. Even if the 
government-in-waiting does not deliver the goods, they're happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the community hall, high school student Martha Maki, 19, sat with a 
dozen other young women awaiting instructions for when counting starts this 
morning. She didn't know the salary, she said, and didn't care. She had come 
"just to help the people," she said shyly. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting starts at 7 a.m. at about 650 sites across the country, with the 
first unofficial, raw results available by about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The official winners of the national and provincial races won't be announced 
before midnight Sunday, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Parliament elected by the black majority is scheduled to convene May 
6 in Cape Town to choose the new president. The inauguration will be May 10 in 
Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela, who is almost certain to be the first black president, and 
Frederik W. de Klerk, who may be the last white president, said they were 
satisfied that the election had been free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised interview, Mandela complained of administrative 
foul-ups in distribution of voting materials to numerous polling stations, 
especially in black areas, but said he believed that the voting overall had not 
been corrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident we will be able to pronounce these elections fair and free," 
Mandela said, in marked contrast to his charge Thursday that "massive sabotage" 
had taken place to discourage voting in black areas. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, who has said he is prepared to become executive vice president under 
Mandela, also was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that we will get good adjudication, and at the end of the day 
that these elections and results will be announced free and fair," he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Johann Kriegler, chairman of the electoral commission, had a similar 
view. Asked by reporters if he believed that the election seemed free and fair, 
he replied: "So far, there is no reason to say it hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Their positive assessment and moral blessing will be crucial for a smooth 
start of the world's newest democracy after four bitter decades of apartheid 
and a four-year bloody transition to legal equality and guaranteed freedoms for 
the long-oppressed black majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting began Tuesday after a wave of bombings that left 21 people dead. Police 
later arrested 33 right-wing whites in a crack-down on the white-supremacist 
groups that had threatened to disrupt the elections rather than submit to black 
majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The police also moved to avert any further trouble from extremists by 
declaring 15 towns west and southwest of Johannesburg "unrest areas." That 
gives police expanded powers to detain people and break up public gatherings in 
the rural towns, all strongholds of the pro-apartheid groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did this to prevent conflict and violence in the area," police Capt. Koos 
Degenaar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The logistic problems that kept voters waiting hours for ballots Tuesday and 
Wednesday were largely overcome Thursday after millions of extra ballots were 
printed and the military was ordered to help distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
 But polling stations were kept open Friday in the remote former homelands of 
KwaZulu, Venda, Transkei, Ciskei, Lebowa and Gazankulu because of widespread 
delays and mix-ups in the distribution of ballots and other voting materials 
earlier in the week by officials unused to mass voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Air force planes and helicopters delivered ballots to polling stations that 
had never opened in several areas; trucks and buses were commandeered to ferry 
rural voters down from the mountains. In some cases, according to local press 
reports, runners were sent out to spread word of the last day of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the distant reaches of Lebowa -- one of the desolate, reservation-like 
homelands set up under apartheid as dumping grounds for blacks -- officials 
complained that scores of voting stations never opened Tuesday, and operated 
only sporadically Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nyatlo ran a "mobile voting station," a roving minivan filled with voting 
materials that stopped in five impoverished villages scattered over 35 dusty 
miles of brooding sandstone buttes, crenelated hills and parched green 
cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters came from everywhere, said Nyatlo, a lecturer at the local teachers' 
college. "Even some people who couldn't walk, they were carried in 
wheelbarrows." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason was to celebrate the end of the homeland -- and of the local 
officials who had enticed voters in bogus local elections with "liquor and a 
bribe." All the homelands were officially reincorporated into South Africa 
under the interim constitution that took effect Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nyatlo finished up his election circuit-riding just before sunset in this 
dusty black township, outside the white farming town of Potgietersrus. Only 41 
people voted here on the last day, but Nyatlo said he was confident most local 
residents already had voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite an experience," he said with a grin. "We enjoyed it, but it was 
very, very, very tiring."

CORONER SAYS BODY PROBABLY EMITTED FUMES 
</P>

 Concluding the most sensational medical investigation in local history, the 
Riverside County coroner's office announced Friday that Gloria Ramirez died of 
kidney failure as a result of cervical cancer -- and the fumes that sickened 
the emergency room staff tending her probably were simply the smell of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy County Coroner Dan Cupido said no "external toxins" were found in 
her body, after an unprecedented autopsy and follow-up testing and analyses by 
some of the most prestigious government medical and science laboratories in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office had speculated that given the bizarre events surrounding 
her death, Ramirez died of other than natural causes. But Friday, County 
Coroner Scotty Hill said Ramirez died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific cause of death, he said, was "cardiac dysrhythmia due to acute 
renal failure due to cervical carcinoma." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said his investigators did not specifically set out to try to find the 
source or nature of the fumes that sickened the hospital staff, and he said 
Friday, "I don't know if we'll ever have that answer." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did rule out the possibility that Ramirez, wittingly or otherwise, may 
have been poisoned by a toxic substance that might have contaminated those who 
tried to keep her alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exhaustive toxicological studies have not identified any external toxic 
substances that would have contributed to her death," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupido said the so-called "mystery fumes" were most likely the residues of a 
dying person. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some mechanisms that occur with the disease process that may cause 
certain odors to be produced," Cupido said. "We feel we have identified a 
source . . . as probably having come from the remains of Gloria Ramirez." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the staff treating Ramirez said the woman's blood, drawn into a 
syringe, smelled of ammonia. Cupido said that odor was consistent with "the 
chemical changes that may occur during a person's dying process, in relation to 
some of the anatomic findings we found." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that such odors could be so strong as to affect so many medical 
personnel so extensively may be unprecedented, Hill acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first (such incident), possibly throughout the entire United 
States or the world," Hill said. "We have received numerous calls of possibly 
similar cases, but none that are specific or identical to the circumstances 
surrounding this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies, including Cal/OSHA -- which investigates workplace injuries 
and other health and safety issues -- have not completed their investigations 
into the incident. A Cal/OSHA spokesman said its report is expected to be 
completed by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the labs that assisted the county in the autopsy were Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the California 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 David Garcia, Ramirez's brother-in-law and spokesman for the family, said he 
did not believe the coroner's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This serves their purpose, so the county won't be responsible for whatever 
happened to Gloria," he said. "This is a travesty of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Schwartz, the attorney for the Ramirez family, said he was confused that 
it took so long -- 10 weeks -- to determine the cause of the death. "This type 
of cause of death would normally be identified within a few days of death," he 
said. "Why it took them 10 weeks to come up with this, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office promised to notify the family of the cause of Ramirez's 
death before public release of the information, and it did -- 10 minutes before 
the Friday afternoon news conference began. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said that if the fumes that apparently sickened the six emergency 
room attendants were nothing more than the organic odors created in the dying 
process, it did little to explain why some of the hospital staff -- most 
notably Dr. Julie Gorchynski -- became so ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people treating Ramirez complained of varying degrees of dizziness after 
smelling a syringe after it was used to draw blood from Ramirez. Gorchynski was 
the most seriously affected; she has been hospitalized for the loss of blood 
circulation to her knees and has undergone surgery to try to correct it. She 
and others have also complained of continuing breathing difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gorchynski nor her family could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who with Cupido answered questions in a curt fashion at Friday's news 
conference, said his office spent "hundreds of thousands of dollars" on the 
investigation. He said it burdened his overworked and understaffed personnel 
who, since Ramirez's death, have had to deal with 1,000 other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hill said the Ramirez case is finally closed as far as he is concerned.

7 ARRESTED IN TIJUANA POLICE CHIEF'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Police on Friday arrested seven suspects in the assassination of the city's 
reformist police chief as investigators tried to determine whether his ambush 
was related to the murder last month of a presidential candidate or to 
escalating drug wars along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Jose Federico Benitez Lopez, 42, director of the Tijuana municipal 
police, and his bodyguard were cut down by gunfire from two four-wheel-drive 
vehicles Thursday night along a busy Tijuana thoroughfare. Neither the 
identities of the seven suspects nor details of their arrests were immediately 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel said at a news conference that the 
killing may be linked to the March 23 assassination of Mexico's leading 
presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, or to a wave of drug-related 
shootouts on Tijuana's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be something having to do with drug trafficking. Perhaps the police 
operations had interfered with criminal activity," he said. "It could be . . . 
that he (Benitez) had provided information on the Colosio case." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo said Benitez had been giving periodic reports on the Colosio case both 
to the governor and to a special prosecutor handling the case for the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not exactly investigating," Ruffo said of the chief. "He was simply 
expanding and specifying the information." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final weeks of his life, Benitez was outspoken about the Colosio case 
and, unlike federal investigators, shared considerable information with the 
press that raised questions about the official account. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with The Times, Benitez was dubious about the federal 
government's handling of the Colosio case and expressed suspicion of a 
cover-up. Although the Colosio case is under investigation by federal 
authorities, Tijuana city police were involved in the initial arrests and 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A knowledgeable U.S. law enforcement source said Benitez also had been 
preparing a report for a Mexican congressional commission on his force's role 
in the investigation of the assassination of Colosio, the candidate of the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The assassination is widely viewed as 
the product of a political conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Tijuana city administration believe Benitez's slaying is 
connected to the Colosio case They say the killing could have been intended to 
silence the chief or to send a warning to authorities to back off their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had fired a lot of cops," the U.S. source said, "but (Mexican authorities 
) don't think anyone would kill him over that. They are looking at the report 
on the Colosio case. They think he might have been shot to shut him up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the slaying of Benitez and his bodyguard, Ramon Alarid 
Cardenas, 41, security was intensified at City Hall, and there was a report 
that bulletproof vests have been requested for Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime and 
other officials. Alarid was an 18-year veteran of the Tijuana department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo, Osuna and state Atty. Gen. Pedro Raul Vidal Rosas were surrounded by 
heavy security during the news conference, and a task force of 150 officers has 
been assigned to investigate the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the violence that has plagued Tijuana recently, Ruffo said: "I can only say 
that we have committed ourselves to eradicating crime. . . . I would tend to 
attribute these incidents to the fact that police are becoming more effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez was hit in the arm, neck and head by a gunman or gunmen who drove 
alongside his official vehicle. Benitez and his aide were driving along Via 
Rapida Poniente after investigating a bomb hoax at Tijuana International 
Airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief was struck with rounds from a shotgun and an AK-47 assault rifle, 
police said. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood-spattered pickup truck in which Benitez and his bodyguard were slain 
was on display Friday at the Baja California State Judicial Police 
Headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to arresting the seven suspects, police said they found three 
vehicles that may be connected to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 A city police report that Benitez had released to the news media increased 
suspicion that a second gunman may have been involved in Colosio's death. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, federal officials in Colosio's entourage had 
contacted city police the night Colosio was slain to say the murder weapon had 
just been recovered and to request an escort to federal police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 That presents a possible contradiction of official accounts that Mario Aburto 
Martinez had identified another gun as the murder weapon during an 
interrogation just hours after the killing. The federal government insists that 
Aburto was the sole gunman in a conspiracy involving three accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 During the frenzy after Colosio was shot, officers of Grupo Tactico -- the 
municipal SWAT team -- were involved in a tense confrontation with federal 
officers hustling Aburto from the scene. People in the crowd appealed to the 
SWAT officers for help, saying they feared that Aburto would be killed or would 
disappear, according to a report provided by Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
 The city officers stopped the federal vehicle at gunpoint, and after a heated 
dispute, escorted the prisoner and his captors to federal police headquarters. 
Also, officers of Grupo Tactico arrested another suspect, an agent of the 
Mexican Interior Ministry, as he ran from the site of the campaign rally 
wearing a bloodstained shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent's hands tested positive for gunpowder residue. And although he has 
been released pending further investigation, his possible involvement has been 
cited by the Baja California governor, who asserted that the issue of whether 
there was a second gunman has not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Benitez expressed doubt during an interview about the authenticity 
of a political diary allegedly written by Aburto and of statements to police 
investigators attributed to a girlfriend of the accused assassin. Benitez said 
the release of that and other information appeared intended to paint a 
misleading picture of the case. . 
</P>
<P>
 Before entering police work, Benitez had been a manager of accounting at a 
fruit-juice plant for 18 years. He joined the state government in 1991 as a 
lawyer handling matters of juvenile delinquency and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez was appointed in late 1992 as the city's first "citizen police chief" 
by Mayor Osuna of the opposition party that rules Baja California, the National 
Action Party (PAN). With his appointment came a mandate to clean up the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez had instituted the department's first internal affairs unit to 
investigate widespread allegations of bribery and brutality. He led a 
corruption purge that resulted in the firing of about 400 of the department's 
1,800 officers, and the Mexican press speculated Friday that his murder was in 
retaliation for the dismissals.  
</P>
<P>
 He created an anti-drug program for Tijuana schools similar to the DARE 
program in the United States, and he was trying to expand and improve the 
police academy.  
</P>
<P>
 He reacted to the problem of violent crime in Tijuana by involving 
neighborhood residents in community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found him very ethical, professional and personable," said San Diego Police 
Chief Jerry Sanders, who had met with Benitez a dozen times to discuss law 
enforcement issues. Benitez's funeral is scheduled for noon today at the Church 
of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Tijuana. The Mass will be followed by a 2 p.m. 
ceremony outside Tijuana City Hall. Burial is to be in the municipal cemetery 
in Tecate, Benitez's hometown. He is survived by a wife and three children.

ISRAEL AND PLO SIGN CRUCIAL ECONOMIC PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, accelerating their drive 
toward Palestinian self-government, agreed Friday on the framework for future 
economic relations between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip as the two 
territories emerge from 27 years of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed in Paris after nearly six months of negotiations, the accord is 
intended to preserve most economic links between Israel and the Palestinian 
territories but assure the Palestinians extensive opportunity to plan and 
manage their own economic development for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact was hailed by both sides as a major step toward the cooperative 
relationship envisioned in the basic accord on Palestinian autonomy reached in 
September. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called it "a major step on the 
road to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking a long stalemate in the talks with a series of compromises reached in 
a final, 48-hour marathon session that ended at 7:30 a.m. Friday, negotiators 
were under pressure from Israeli and PLO leaders to conclude the agreement in 
time for the start of Palestinian autonomy next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the compromises had been painful, said Israeli Finance Minister 
Abraham Shohat, because Israeli agricultural and industrial interests would be 
hurt, but those were necessary costs for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be people in Israel who will be adversely affected by this 
agreement, and there will be Palestinians who will not be completely and fully 
satisfied," Shohat said in Paris. "I call on all of them to give peace a 
chance, to give the economic process the chance to benefit every individual. . 
. . Peace and compromise come at a price, but the alternative is more costly, 
destructive and painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Suleiman Khoury, the PLO chief negotiator also known as Abu Alaa, 
described the economic agreement as a vital underpinning, as necessary as the 
security agreement to be signed next week, for the success of the overall 
accord on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time Palestinians have the possibility to establish their 
own (governmental) institutions, to control their economy, to plan and manage 
the development of what have been occupied territories," Khoury said in Paris. 
"We look forward to a relationship based on common interest and mutual benefit 
rather than dependency through occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental thrust of the new agreement is to maintain a high level of 
economic integration of Israel and the Palestinian autonomous region through 
open markets, allowing continued movement of labor and products between them 
with a minimum of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiators loosened the present linkage, as the PLO had requested, by 
allowing the Palestinian Authority, the region's future government, to set 
lower tax rates for its residents and businesses and to import goods needed for 
economic development there at lower customs duties than in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli negotiators, in turn, won protection for some weak sectors of the 
Israeli economy, notably agriculture, from Palestinian competition. Shohat 
promised government compensation to Israeli farmers and businesses hurt by the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israel's current closure of the territories as a security measure 
prevents most Palestinian workers from getting to jobs here, the agreement 
recognizes that employment in Israel is necessary for the expanding Palestinian 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agreement provides for a Palestinian monetary agency to regulate 
banks on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to manage the region's foreign 
currency reserves, negotiators postponed the politically and economically 
difficult question of creating a Palestinian currency. The Israeli shekel and 
the Jordanian dinar will continue to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy with the result," Shohat said. "I think it is a fair agreement, 
fair to the Israelis and to the Palestinians as well." 
</P>
<P>
 With the PLO's commitment to a "liberal market economy" reiterated in the 
agreement and economic relations with Israel now settled, Western donors are 
expected to begin releasing the $2 billion in assistance for economic 
development that they promised the Palestinians last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic pact will apply initially to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
District on the West Bank. It will cover other West Bank areas after Israeli 
troops withdraw from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are scheduled to begin final discussions 
Sunday in Cairo on the unresolved security aspects of the Gaza-Jericho autonomy 
agreement, which is to be signed in Cairo on Wednesday. Among the open issues 
is control of the beachfront near a group of Israeli settlements in the Gaza 
Strip. A timetable for the release of most of the 9,000 Palestinian security 
prisoners held by Israel was reportedly agreed upon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat themselves 
will discuss the size of the Jericho District -- Israel has proposed 22 square 
miles, the PLO wants 93 -- and whether a Palestinian police officer will be 
stationed on the Allenby Bridge across the Jordan River at the entry to the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still not a complete formula for this agreement," Rabin said Friday. 
"A date has been set (for signing it), but there are still issues needing 
agreement, conclusion and incorporation in the written accord." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the agreement came under sharp attack from the opposition Likud 
Party here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PLO is getting everything it wants," former Foreign Minister David Levy 
said, criticizing the elements of sovereignty contained in the agreement. "For 
us, it is recognition by the Israeli government of the establishment of a 
Palestinian state."

SAY GOODBY TO CHALKBOARD MATH DRILLS; EDUCATION: NEW FOCUS IS ON REAL-LIFE 
PROBLEM SOLVING, NOT COMPUTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER

<P>
 To anyone who last set foot in a math classroom a decade or more ago, a visit 
to Marilyn Mayer's eighth-grade algebra course would reveal little that is 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Desks are arranged so students face each other instead of the chalkboard. The 
walls, window blinds and the hallway outside her room at Long Beach's Bancroft 
Middle School are plastered with artwork reflecting students' use of 
mathematical concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 The room often reverberates with the chatter of students working together to 
solve problems, and Mayer constantly exhorts her budding mathematicians to "use 
your calculators if you need to" and "tell us why you did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Math experts say those are the kinds of things that should be -- and will be 
-- happening in classrooms across America as part of the biggest transformation 
of math teaching in three decades. In this widely heralded new approach -- 
which also has its critics -- work sheets and drills at the chalkboard are out. 
So is an emphasis on complicated paper-and-pencil computations, such as long 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Students still learn how to multiply and divide, but they also work in groups 
to solve problems that touch on their daily lives and talk and write about the 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not enough to get the right answer anymore," said Mary M. Lindquist, 
president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. "We have to be 
able to look at all the possibilities in solving a problem, to understand the 
process and to communicate it. . . . That is what is going on out in the 
workplace today." 
</P>
<P>
 The council helped launch the math revolution in 1989 by spelling out high 
standards for students in an increasingly complex, technology-oriented, rapidly 
changing world. The goal is to move students beyond computational skills -- 
especially those that can be done more efficiently with calculators or 
computers -- and prepare them to tackle problems in new situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want students to make sense of mathematics, to be able to see the uses of 
it and be confident in their ability to do mathematics," Lindquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 states have signed onto the effort to transform how math is 
taught. California is at the forefront after adopting in 1992 a widely 
acclaimed curriculum guide for math teachers from kindergarten through high 
school. It embodies the new approach, introducing youngsters to more advanced 
concepts at an earlier age and training them to understand the logic behind 
basic math principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the first test results from the California Learning Assessment System, 
also part of the math reform movement, found that the new thinking on math has 
yet to take hold in classrooms. Designed to measure how well students 
understand math concepts, the tests discovered that a third or more of the 
students showed little or no understanding of math basics. 
</P>
<P>
 Math educators say they do not expect to see a lot of improvement soon. Many 
expect that it will take several more years for the new methods to reach every 
classroom and to yield results. They estimate that no more than 10% to 15% of 
today's students are receiving significant exposure to the new math curriculum. 
 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons for the delay, including a dearth of textbooks and 
other teaching materials geared to the current thinking on math education. A 
new generation of textbooks is just now coming off the presses, but the books 
are not expected to be in California classrooms before fall, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Other obstacles are the budget pinches most California districts have been 
feeling since the recession began four years ago, leaving them little money to 
buy materials or help teachers learn the new methods.  
</P>
<P>
 "These are quite major changes," said Nicholas Branca, executive director of 
the California Mathematics Project, a state program that taps public colleges 
and universities to help schools make the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking teachers to do things in completely different ways, using 
techniques and tools they didn't have when they were students. We are making 
progress, but it's slow," Branca added. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is a small but vocal group of critics, including some math 
teachers, who believe that the new approach keeps students from learning 
important computational skills. Their message appeals to parents leery of the 
changes, especially those who struggled under the short-lived "new math" trend 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go into some of the classrooms and watch the open-ended activities, and 
you'll find a lot of nothing under way," said Cal State L.A. math professor 
Wayne Bishop, a frequent critic of the new approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop prefers some of the methods espoused by John Saxon, a retired Air Force 
officer who has written a series of textbooks that do not pass muster with many 
state boards but have attracted a following among those who favor more 
familiar, traditional ways.  
</P>
<P>
 Saxon calls for teachers to present methods and concepts in small pieces, 
spending about 10 minutes a day on a lecture, then having students practice in 
repetitive class and homework assignments until the techniques become second 
nature to them. Students who fail to grasp the lesson cannot move on until they 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxon's critics include virtually all the mainstream math education leadership 
and many of the growing numbers of classroom teachers who are sold on the new 
approach. They say his system produces students who do well in computational 
skills and may get good scores on traditional standardized tests but they would 
be hard-pressed to do higher-level mathematical thinking and problem solving. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer, the Long Beach middle school teacher, tries to find ways to relate 
mathematical concepts to her students' everyday experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently began a lesson in her seventh-grade pre-algebra classes with a 
discussion on playing video games and how the outcomes are improved as a 
player's reaction time gets faster with practice. Students then paired off for 
some exercises in reaction time. First, students sat face to face and tested 
their reflexes by slapping each other's palms. Then, one set of students 
repeatedly dropped rulers, and their partners grabbed them as fast as they 
could, keeping score by writing down the centimeter marks closest to their 
thumbs when they caught the rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 The students plotted the results in graphs and answered questions about the 
exercise: Does a higher score represent a faster reaction time? Why? Did the 
score change over 10 trials? How? Would it be likely to change in 100 trials? 
Would the results have been different if a heavier ruler had been used? 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to find something concrete for them to do" in teaching every concept, 
Mayer said, voicing one of the basic tenets of the system. "If they make it 
(or) hold it, they can understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a far cry from the "new math" that held sway for a brief period during 
the 1960s. In trying to teach students math theories without connecting them to 
youngsters' daily lives, the "new math" movement sputtered because it worked 
only for the brightest students and left teachers frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an effort to try to provide students with a fundamental understanding 
of mathematical systems, but what happened was that it had virtually no support 
from anyone other than the people who were promoting it at the time," said 
Lindquist of the math teachers council. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's reformers, armed with a better understanding of how children learn, 
are making a concerted effort to ground the lessons in children's experiences 
and to build consensus on the standards and methods not only among teachers but 
also with parents and business leaders, Lindquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Kansky, associate executive director of the Mathematical Sciences 
Education Board, said the search for a new way of teaching math began in the 
late 1980s because business and industry leaders complained that students were 
not learning what they needed to know on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying: 'Look, it isn't a matter of doing a better job of teaching 
what people used to need. We expect our workers to tackle problems they have 
never seen before, find alternative solutions, to work together and to 
communicate their ideas to others.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the new math approach into practice has moved slowly in part because 
school districts do not have the money to retrain teachers and buy new 
textbooks. Some use federal or state grants to train teachers, while others 
seek help from private organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by an enthusiastic assistant principal, a handful of math teachers 
at Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights began re-crafting their teaching 
methods in 1989 with a grant from the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a 
private, business-funded organization working for school reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "LAEP served as the spark," said Robert C. Ochoa, head of the Roosevelt math 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa said three-fourths of Roosevelt's students, nearly all of whom are 
Latino, now take more than the one math course required for high school 
graduation and he has noticed greater enthusiasm in his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing more writing, working more with technology and losing that 'I 
can't do math' attitude," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that measurable progress has been slow, in part because only 
about half the department's 21 teachers have embraced the new system. And none 
is given time during the school day to plan together, which he said hampers the 
program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers say the new approach to math is most crucial in the earliest years 
of schooling because youngsters need to be familiar with basic mathematical 
concepts to succeed later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergartners in Ann Carlyle's class at Ellwood School in Goleta spend about 
an hour a day on math activities, usually working with one or more partners. 
Students work with tubs containing beads, blocks and other familiar objects 
that help teach numbers, patterns, geometry, sorting and classifying. The math 
teaching tools also include games to hone skills in number recognition, "books" 
to make by arranging nursery tale pictures in sequence, a make-believe store 
and a miniature town the children constructed with boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the activity period, when the children have put away their 
materials and gathered on the rug near the front of the classroom, they tell 
what they have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who has news?" Carlyle asked, ready to write down their answers on a large 
sheet of poster paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrin showed off the object he made using interlocking plastic tiles. "It has 
three rectangles and two triangles, and there is a cube inside," he informed 
his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie held up a large hexagon that she had fashioned from pattern blocks "all 
by myself," while Joshua told about the number game he and Nicky had been 
playing: "I won three times and he won one time." 
</P>
<P>
 Such activities lay the groundwork for children's understanding, enjoyment and 
self-confidence in math, said Carlyle, who has been a leader in creating and 
disseminating the new approach in California. She was honored by the White 
House with the 1993 Presidential Award for Excellence in elementary school math 
teaching and spends summers leading workshops for other teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlyle said her switch 12 years ago to kindergarten after years of teaching 
sixth-graders brought home an important point. 
</P>
<P>
 "With children this young, you can't use grades as a motivator," Carlyle said. 
"What you are doing has to make sense to the children, and it has to be 
engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're not interested, they just turn and walk away."

U.N. LEADER ASKS FOR TROOPS FOR RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With new reports of 250,000 refugees pouring into Tanzania to flee the carnage 
in Rwanda, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali implored the Security 
Council on Friday night to set aside its reluctance and dispatch enough troops 
to the central African nation to halt the sweeping massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 But his plea to end "this humanitarian catastrophe (that) is rightly a matter 
of growing anguish in Africa and the rest of the world" comes at a time when 
the United States and other Security Council members are hesitating to commit 
any more troops to U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week ago, in fact, the Security Council decided to reduce the U.N. 
mission in Rwanda from 2,550 to 270 peacekeepers and ordered them to 
concentrate only on negotiating a cease-fire between government troops and 
rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali, in a letter to the Security Council, said that "as many as 
200,000 people may have died during the last three weeks" in massacres mostly 
"perpetrated by armed groups of civilians taking advantage of the complete 
breakdown of law and order in Kigali and many other parts of Rwanda." He said 
"it has become clear that the horrors for which they are responsible can be 
ended only if law and order is restored." 
</P>
<P>
 To do so, he acknowledged, "would require a commitment of human and material 
resources on a scale which member states have so far proved reluctant to 
contemplate." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I am convinced," he went on, "that the scale of human suffering in Rwanda 
and its implications for the stability of neighboring countries leave the 
Security Council with no alternative but to examine this possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not detail what size force he had in mind. The peacekeeping mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Macedonia now has an authorized strength of 
more than 40,000 troops, the largest in U.N. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours before Boutros-Ghali sent his letter to the Security Council, U.N. 
officials estimated that 250,000 people had fled from Rwanda into Tanzania in 
the last 24 hours -- the biggest, fastest exodus that refugee officials said 
they had seen. Lines at the border stretched for miles. "It's a massive 
crossing, and it's continuing," U.N. worker Maureen Connolly told the 
Associated Press after flying over the border. "Thousands and thousands of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 And while members of the Hutu tribe have been slaughtering Tutsi in Rwanda, 
the Tutsi in neighboring Burundi have been threatening and killing Hutus in 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi-dominated Burundian army trucked hundreds of men, women and children 
out of the Hutu quarter of the capital of Bujumbura on Friday and unloaded them 
at a soccer stadium, promising them protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutus, waving white flags, had surrendered to the soldiers after a night 
of heavy shelling by the army. The troops said their targets were armed Hutu 
militias in the Hutu quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrifying chaos erupted in Rwanda three weeks ago after the presidents of 
Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died in a mysterious plane crash in the capital 
of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 This set off the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army and Hutu toughs in a furious 
frenzy of vengeance against Tutsi. A rebel army, the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan 
Liberation Front, then fought its way to the capital, Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali reported that Kigali is 
now divided between the government and rebel forces, with frequent exchanges of 
artillery and mortar fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The two U.N. leaders on the scene -- Brig. Gen. Romeo A. Dallaire of Canada, 
the military commander, and Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh of Cameroon, the secretary 
general's special representative -- had failed to make headway in negotiating a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Boutros-Ghali said, U.N. officials were reporting continued massacres 
"on a large scale in the countryside" and "strong evidence of preparations for 
further massacres of civilians in the city" of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the city, he said, "there are several large concentrations of civilians 
who fear for their lives but enjoy little effective protection." He said that 
the 270 U.N. troops "would be unable to save them if a new wave of massacres 
were to start." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. refugee agency reported that it has enough food, medicine and other 
supplies along the Tanzanian border for 50,000 people. It planned an emergency 
airlift and overland convoy to send in more help. Private aid organizations 
were already distributing what was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenzied Tutsi-Hutu bloodletting has erupted often in the last 35 years of 
independence. The causes are deep and complex. For centuries, the Tutsi, no 
more than 15% of the population in both Rwanda and Burundi, ruled these 
societies as lords who dominated the lowly Hutu peasant masses. 
</P>
<P>
 During the German and Belgian colonial periods, the Tutsi strengthened their 
hold, for they were the favored and therefore better educated tribe. Shortly 
before independence, the Hutus overthrew the Tutsi king in Rwanda. But this did 
not happen in Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of its independence, Rwanda has been run by a majority Hutu 
government ever fearful of the educated, lordly Tutsi, while Burundi has been 
run by a minority Tutsi government fearful of the Hutu masses. The tribal 
confusion has created volatile ethnic politics. A Hutu was elected president of 
Burundi last year, for example, but was then murdered by Tutsi troops in an 
abortive coup last September.

confrontational evangelism, has a history of provoking Chinese authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Guangzhou (Canton) once detained him for conducting a weekly 
"English class" with only one textbook -- the Bible. Another time, the 
49-year-old American preacher says, he evaded arrest during an illegal outdoor 
prayer meeting by hiding under blankets in a Chinese burial cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Given such brazen acts, it is no wonder that Chinese officials chose Balcombe, 
whose "Donkeys for Jesus" program is one of the biggest Bible-smuggling 
operations in Asia, as the first target for new rules controlling foreign 
religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Balcombe, who runs his Bible project out of a storefront Hong Kong church, is 
clearly on the radical fringe of Christian activists. But his arrest Feb. 11 in 
Henan province focused world attention on a surprising resurgence of Christian 
missionary activity in China. It also revived an old debate over proper 
behavior for Christian foreigners seeking converts and sent a warning to 
Christian teachers here and to their overseas sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five years after Communists under Mao Tse-tung expelled most foreign 
church workers, hundreds of missionaries -- though few dare use that term 
publicly -- are back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist government tolerates some low-key religious activity by 
foreigners because it needs English teachers, especially those willing to take 
on the toughest, most remote assignments. But officials have now drawn certain 
lines, banning missionary work and limiting the religious activities in which 
Christian foreigners can participate. New regulations consolidating rules that 
existed in several provinces were signed by Premier Li Peng on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the new rules were intended as guidelines for thousands of 
foreigners who have flooded into China during the recent era of economic 
reform. Many of these foreigners -- business people, consultants, professionals 
-- brought strong religious beliefs with them. Authorities felt the need to 
codify acceptable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In what officials admit was a test case, Balcombe was arrested 11 days after 
he conducted an all-night mountaintop prayer meeting with peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a warning," Chinese Religious Affairs Bureau official Zhang Weida said 
in a Beijing interview. Zhang heads the policy section of the office that 
drafted the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, there are 12 million Christians in China, 7 million of them 
Protestant and 5 million Roman Catholic. Officially at least, the number of 
Christians falls far below that of Buddhists, estimated officially at 100 
million, and Muslims, at 17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 China now recognizes Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese Church Research Center, a Hong Kong-based group that tracks 
Christian activities in China, estimates that more than 2,000 Christians, 
mostly Americans, work as "foreign experts" teaching English and other subjects 
in remote areas. These teachers account for more than one-fourth of the 
nation's 7,500 foreign advisers and experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some carefully observe laws against proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all knew the restrictions before we came here," said Thom Downing, 32, a 
Quaker teacher from Pittsburgh, Pa., who works in Jiangsu province. He opposes 
overt missionary activity: "Personally, I don't have a lot of respect for 
people who come exclusively to proselytize under the guise of being teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, come to spread their religion, some by clandestinely 
recruiting Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of "bathtub baptisms" and unauthorized Bible classes are common. Lay 
teachers in universities regularly complain that some of their Christian 
colleagues are more interested in "saving souls" than they are in teaching 
grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep a score card," complained a foreign teacher in Nanjing. "Every day 
they come in and say, 'I made another Christian today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many lay foreign experts, the Christian teachers are willing to travel 
to the most remote and primitive settings to work for token salaries paid by 
the government. Missionary teachers can be found in the barren reaches of Inner 
Mongolia and the mountainous terrain of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some places in China that no one would go to unless they were 
convinced God wanted them to go," explained a Hong Kong-based Christian 
publications editor, who asked not to be named because of his organization's 
missionary activity in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, local authorities sometimes prefer the Christian teachers because they 
are less likely to become involved in sexual relations with residents or in 
political activity, both of which officials fear even more than religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, missionary work is still a very sensitive subject. Since Jesuit 
priests arrived in the late 16th Century, Christian missionaries have often 
been at the center of conflict between China and the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, inspired by Christian missionary tracts and convinced he 
was the younger brother of Jesus, charismatic leader Hong Xiuquan led peasants 
in the bloody Taiping Rebellion against the Qing Dynasty. For 11 years, until 
the rebellion was crushed with the help of Western mercenaries in 1864, Hong 
ruled his "Heavenly Kingdom" from a base in Nanjing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Boxer uprising of 1898-1900, Christian missionaries and their 
converts were the main targets of a bloody movement mounted by a mystical 
order, the Righteous and Harmonious Fists, known to foreigners as the Boxers. 
The movement's members, who believed they were immune to gunfire, accused the 
missionaries of plotting to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and obliterate 
traditional Chinese culture, among other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Communist Party defeated the Nationalists in 1949, 6,000 Christian 
missionaries worked on the mainland, many sympathetic to the Nationalists. In 
its literature, the Communist Party still views missionaries as "tools of 
imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite their large numbers at various times (6,000 in 1930, for example), 
foreign missionaries have historically been ineffective in obtaining converts. 
Their main contributions were in the creation of schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent emergence of foreign missionaries largely results from the opening 
of the Chinese economy initiated by senior leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the economic reforms, China desperately needs foreign teachers and 
funding for universities and technical institutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest sponsors of Christian teachers in China, the English 
Language Institute/China, based in San Dimas, has 200 teachers at 60 Chinese 
universities. In a telephone interview, institute Executive Vice President Bill 
Bauer said the organization, whose budget last year topped $4.8 million, has a 
"professional, non-religious focus." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the institute's recruitment brochures, distributed mainly on 
Christian college campuses in the United States, stress "a Christian 
commitment" as the first requirement, followed by an undergraduate or graduate 
degree, an aptitude for teaching and "the ability to build close personal 
friendships." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1982," states one publicity brochure, "the English Language 
Institute/China has had the exciting privilege of sending qualified Christian 
professionals to China. Through E.L.I.C., over 150,000 Chinese students have 
been touched in over 60 of China's most important universities." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he assiduously avoids calling his teachers "missionaries," Bauer said 
they are highly appreciated by their Chinese hosts "because of their Christian, 
moral, ethical standards." 
</P>
<P>
 One man who does not shrink from the missionary title is Balcombe, who is 
affiliated with the Shiloh Christian Fellowship in Oakland. Tall and fair, with 
a talent for language -- gained by studying the Bible in Chinese, he says -- 
Balcombe came to China 25 years ago after serving as an Army cook in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was expelled three days after his arrest in February, Balcombe held a 
news conference in Hong Kong at which he accused Chinese authorities of 
brutality and the theft of more than $14,000 in cash and video equipment. He 
later testified before a U.S. congressional subcommittee investigating possible 
trade sanctions against China. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other Christian groups in China object to Balcombe's guerrilla-style 
tactics. In a manual, "How to Prepare for Possible Arrest in Visiting 
Christians in China," Balcombe advises followers to feign ignorance of Chinese 
and to "speak in tongues" if accosted by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In another section of the six-page manual, he instructs followers to "go on 
the offensive if the Lord tells you to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 "Never use force or violence," wrote Balcombe, who grew up in Southern 
California and attended high school in Pomona, "but make them do something 
against you. Refuse to move without notifying your embassy. Then, when they 
forcibly move you, accuse them of hitting you or hurting you." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview in his Hong Kong church, Balcombe said he sometimes 
invests in Chinese joint-venture businesses, such as local department stores, 
to provide a rationale for his frequent missions. In this age of economic 
development, China looks more kindly on businessmen than on preachers. Most of 
the money for Balcombe's investments comes from contributions by U.S. churches. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, other members of his church practiced speaking Chinese 
in one room. Volunteers in other rooms packed suitcases with Chinese-language 
Bibles and other religious tracts that are smuggled to the mainland on daily 
Donkeys for Jesus runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never use the word smuggle ," he explained. "We just put them in our 
suitcase and we take them. We are not using (shipping) containers or other 
sleazy methods." 
</P>
<P>
 The church has about 20 regular couriers and distributes a brochure urging 
overseas Christians to participate, providing low-cost dormitory housing in 
Hong Kong for those who come. The couriers enter China as tourists, with the 
understanding that authorities will not arrest them for smuggling but may 
confiscate their Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some of us who get involved in this type of work, it's a bit like 007 
(James Bond)," said one courier, a 46-year-old man from Shawnee Mission, Kan. 
"Everyone who gets into this kind of work has a spirit of adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 More than most of the foreign Christians working in China, Balcombe sees 
himself at war with authorities who would block the spread of the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will say that Dennis Balcombe is a troublemaker and that all 
these missionaries should keep out of religion," he said, speaking in staccato 
bursts. "But to us, what is the sense of being a Christian? We don't think that 
just helping a nation learn English or improve the economy is going to do 
anything. We think people need Jesus Christ. They need the Gospel. The problem 
of society is not education, but that there are no morals." 
</P>
<P>
 Balcombe's arrest and the resulting publicity rekindled the debate here about 
the conduct of foreign Christians in China, where governments dating from the 
early dynasties have viewed foreign religions as potential threats to 
stability. Foreign Christians recently worried that Chinese authorities planned 
a general crackdown on missionary work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very minimum, one Hong Kong-based church scholar reported, the new 
regulations give local authorities the power to quash foreign religious 
activity when and if they want. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in Beijing, Religious Affairs Bureau policy director Zhang 
said the new regulations were necessary because of the flood of foreigners 
working in China during the period of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more foreigners are coming to China," Zhang explained. "Most have 
religious beliefs. These foreigners want a religious life." 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations grant foreigners some expanded rights to practice their 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 If invited to China by officially recognized religious bodies, for example, 
foreigners theoretically are permitted to discuss the Scriptures and even 
deliver sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new rules also clearly state what the foreigners are not permitted to 
do, including "establish religious organizations, set up religious offices, 
open places for religious activities or run religious institutes. Nor may they 
develop followers, appoint religious personnel or conduct missionary activity 
among Chinese citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 After the new regulations came out, many foreign Christians acted quickly, 
through letters and articles in church bulletins, to reassure overseas sponsors 
that the Balcombe incident was an isolated case that would not affect most 
Christian teachers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Elyn MacInnis is the pastor of the international congregation of St. Paul's 
Church in Nanjing. Most of her small congregation -- about 50 people attended 
the Palm Sunday service -- are English teachers in the Nanjing area who were 
recruited by Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 MacInnis, an Episcopal priest from Rochester, N.Y., said few feel threatened 
by the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just horrified that people in the West would think that what happened 
to Dennis Balcombe is what is happening in China," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my point of view, the new regulations are beneficial," said Susan 
Stiles, an Episcopal minister working as an English teacher at a technical 
institute near Nanjing. "The regulations tell us where we stand with the 
Chinese and give us legal recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Balcombe incident deeply divided the church community both 
inside China and abroad. The debate is between those who advocate working 
within the rules set by Beijing, and those who favor clandestine church work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the balance are millions of dollars in donations for China missions raised 
in the churches of the United States and Europe, and in the powerful Protestant 
Christian communities of South Korea and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Father Peter Barry, a Roman Catholic priest with the 
Holy Spirit Study Center, a Hong Kong-based research center for Chinese 
religious matters, crystallized the terms of the debate: "Should it be 
Bible-thumping or dialogue? An analysis of missionary method is badly needed at 
this time."

POPE BREAKS LEG, WILL BE IN HOSPITAL SEVERAL WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a commonplace bathroom fall, but it means a long convalescence for the 
century's most physically active Pope: John Paul II is recovering nicely from 
surgery to repair a broken leg and will be hospitalized for several weeks, the 
Vatican said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, for the dynamic, journeying John Paul, recovery will require long 
therapy, and it will be months before he can resume his normal, active daily 
life. Meantime, papal trips are canceled and stand-ins will take the Pope's 
role at Vatican ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul, who will be 74 next month, has now broken bones in falls twice in 
less than six months. But the Vatican sought Friday to defuse concern about his 
general health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a banal accident, unfortunately very common when one has wet feet and 
is getting out of the shower," papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters. 
He said the fall was the result of a slip, not dizziness or any loss of 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope was "his normal, calm self" after the two-hour operation to replace 
the broken thighbone with a metal prosthesis, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Tresalti, director of the Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital and a member of 
the surgical team, described the Pope as "a very strong man" in "excellent 
health." 
</P>
<P>
 "It went very well -- a surgeon always knows," said surgeon Gianfranco 
Fineschi, who inserted the prosthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 After regaining consciousness, the pontiff was wheeled to a top-floor hospital 
suite he knows better than he would like. "I am a music lover, and my advice to 
the Pope now is: 'Andante, ma non troppo' (moderately, but not too)," Fineschi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeons said they replaced the ball and neck of the inverted L-shaped femur 
bone in the Pope's right leg. All postoperative vital signs were normal, 
Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tresalti observed: "Fifteen years ago my mother, who's now 73, had the same 
fracture and was operated on by the same surgeons. She's very well. These are 
breaks which can be easily mended; it's the classic bathroom slip." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's arrival by ambulance marked the Pope's sixth admission to the big 
Catholic teaching hospital on the northern edge of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to admire my loyalty," John Paul said in wry self-disgust as he 
entered the institution where, as of Friday, he had spent 106 days of his 
15-year pontificate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, hospital stays tend to be much longer than in the United States, and 
doctors say John Paul will remain there two to three weeks. He will then need 
months of therapy back home at the Vatican. Swimming, a papal favorite, will 
help. But skiing is out for good. So, at least for this year, is the annual 
week of Alpine hiking that the pontiff treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul fell as he left the shower in his apartment at the Vatican about 11 
p.m. Thursday, Navarro said. In pain, he summoned an aide who called Renato 
Buzzonetti, John Paul's personal physician. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays in a small but well-equipped dispensary in the Apostolic Palace 
confirmed a break close to where the femur turns toward the hip. A "complete 
trans-cervical sub-capital fracture of the right femur with a dislocation," 
doctors would declaim in a statement later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope was told that surgery would be necessary but that there was no 
particular urgency about getting him to the hospital. While John Paul went to 
bed with the aid of painkillers, which Navarro called "generic analgesics," 
Buzzonetti marshaled surgeons in a round of midnight calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, after about four hours of fitful sleep, John Paul 
concelebrated Mass with his two personal secretaries, a Pole and a Vietnamese, 
Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 20-minute ambulance ride to the hospital he recited the rosary, by 
Navarro's account. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not arrive in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in pain, and I am sorrowful," he said, referring to enforced 
cancellation of a scheduled weekend visit to Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
 As his patient was being prepped for the operation, Tresalti noted: "His humor 
is that of someone who should have left town today and has a load of 
appointments which have to be canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fall, John Paul was preparing to leave Friday afternoon for the 
Sicilian city of Catania. Vatican sources said he intended to fire new salvos 
there today in his war against the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 A May visit to Belgium is also being canceled, Navarro said. The Pope will 
also miss a Mass he was to have celebrated closing a monthlong synod of African 
bishops. And neither will he likely be able to participate at a consistory of 
cardinals he has summoned May 9-10 to discuss their church's millennial 
observances. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still too early to know whether John Paul will be able to keep a 
scheduled meeting with a visiting President Clinton in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's love of exercise, honed as a priest and bishop on weekly mountain 
hikes in his native Poland, has survived his illnesses. Twice since breaking 
his arm in a fall last November, John Paul has gone skiing. The first time the 
Vatican didn't announce it because it was against doctor's orders. On the 
second trip, the Pope's Polish secretary broke his collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated setbacks have stalked John Paul in recent months since the November 
fall, when he tripped on the hem of his cassock in the Vatican. He remained 
overnight in the hospital for treatment of a fractured shoulder bone and a 
dislocated right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, history's most traveled Pope has had to scrap a planned June trip 
to Lebanon for security reasons and abandon hopes of visiting the Holy Land 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, at his last public appearance, John Paul addressed pilgrims at 
a general audience on the dignity of suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Preaching from the Beatitudes, he said: "Earthly suffering, when it is 
surrounded with love, is like a bitter shell which encloses the seed of new 
life, the treasure of divine glory which will be conceded to man in eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 Never in modern times had a modern Pope gone to a hospital outside the Vatican 
before John Paul was shot in St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981. He spent six 
hours on a Gemelli operating table that time and was readmitted later that 
summer for treatment of a virus acquired from a blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, the Pope was operated on for removal of a benign intestinal 
tumor. A postoperative checkup there last year showed him to be in robust 
health.

LAPD PINPOINTS VALLEY CRIME ZONES; ANALYSIS: STUDY BLAMES INCREASING GANGS, 
DRUGS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOR TROUBLE IN PATROL AREAS. FINDINGS SHOW A 76.5% 
INCREASE IN DEVONSHIRE DIVISION HOMICIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Friday released detailed reports that identified some of the worst 
pockets of crime in the San Fernando Valley and blamed much of the violence on 
spreading gang activity, increased drug use and a "large victim pool" of 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department reports provided rare detail about crime 
locations but not surprisingly linked many of them to Sepulveda and Van Nuys 
Boulevards, the north-south corridors that bisect the Valley and have long been 
known for drug-trafficking and prostitution. In the Van Nuys Division, for 
example, nine of the 10 toughest neighborhoods bordered those thoroughfares and 
contributed 27% of the patrol area's total crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Other troubling findings included a 76.5% increase in homicides in the 
Devonshire Division between 1992 and 1993; a high concentration of parolees -- 
1,400 -- residing in the Foothill Division; persistent street robberies along 
stretches of Sherman Way and Ventura Boulevard in the West Valley Division, and 
in the North Hollywood Division, three of four hot spots were situated near 
Hollywood Freeway exits, providing convenient getaways. 
</P>
<P>
 A connection between alcohol and crime was also noted in several reports, with 
liquor stores being associated with street crime more than "upscale" 
restaurants and bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on statistics for the past three to four years, the reports concentrate 
on murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults, and outline plans for 
curbing those crimes. The copies made public Friday, however, were edited to 
delete potentially sensitive strategies such as officer deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Martin H. Pomeroy, the Valley's top police official, said 
little in the reports came as a surprise. The documents -- prepared by each of 
the Police Department's 18 police stations -- will be updated quarterly and 
allow police managers to better use their officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for refinement in our deployment, not quantum leaps forward," 
Pomeroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy also said crime analyses are nothing new in the Police Department; the 
department, he said, is just trying a more scientific approach involving 
specialists and computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have for decades analyzed crime statistics," Pomeroy said. "What has 
changed is we have instituted a more sophisticated crime analysis process." 
</P>
<P>
 The reports were prepared separately by each police station, and vary widely 
in their detail, use of statistics and possible causes of crime. Some also 
lacked detailed explanations for sharp changes in the number of crimes 
reported. Devonshire 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most dramatic figures were included in the Devonshire Division 
report, which compared the first 11 months of 1992 and 1993 and found a 76.5% 
increase in homicides. No explanation was offered. Other types of crimes were 
down, with robberies decreasing by 11.5%, sexual assaults (rapes) down by 8.6% 
and aggravated assaults down by 6.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the analysis cited three specific high-crime areas in the Devonshire 
area: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Northridge mall area, which the report said attracted criminals because 
of the high number of pedestrians and heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Roscoe-Schoenborn area, bordered by Lindley Avenue on the east, Zelzah 
Avenue on the west, Roscoe Boulevard on the south and Schoenborn Street on the 
north. The report characterized this as an area of high-density apartments that 
"is a target for gang-related activity." 
</P>
<P>
 * And finally the Sepulveda Corridor, which is "inundated with prostitution 
activity, narcotic trafficking and gang-related activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Also cited as a problem area, but not included in the top three, was the area 
around Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The three main problem areas, according to the report, accounted for more than 
18% of the area's total violent crime activity. But based on the sheer number 
of arrests, the three areas accounted for 49.5% of the total arrests for the 
entire Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also cited a number of successes and set forth strategy for the 
coming year. It noted, for instance, that the North Hills foot patrol 
sub-station had been successful in 1993, making the community more aware of the 
police presence, and the Devonshire bicycle detail increased the number of 
patrol officers on bikes. The uniformed cyclists were credited with giving the 
department more flexibility in battling crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Police Department increased the number of "at risk" juveniles 
enrolled in the Youth Center and Jeopardy programs and continued efforts to 
expand the Neighborhood Watch program, which the report called "a model for the 
rest of the city." It said the number of people participating in the program 
had increased by 75% during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "These efforts were instrumental in achieving marked decreases in three of the 
four violent crime categories being addressed: robberies, rapes and aggravated 
assaults," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one category which increased dramatically, in spite of the aforementioned 
efforts, was homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Devonshire's strategy for the year, it continued, would be 
community-based policing, which emphasizes one-on-one contact between the beat 
officers and residents and a more active community involvement in the fight 
against crime. Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 In the Foothill Division, the most violent area is the Van Nuys Boulevard 
corridor from San Fernando Road to Foothill Boulevard because of "low-income 
housing complexes, gang, and narcotic activities," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of rape, which increased by more than 14%, violent crimes 
were down from Jan. 1 through Nov. 30, 1993, compared with the same time period 
in 1992. During this reporting period, 35 people were killed in the Foothill 
area; in 1992 during the same period, 40 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pocket bordered by Apperson Street to the north, Sunland Boulevard to 
the south and west, and from Hanes Canyon Avenue to Tujunga Canyon Boulevard to 
the east "has experienced a dramatic increase in both calls for service and 
crimes," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, according to the report: an escalation of drug activity combined 
with a high concentration of multiunit dwellings on Commerce, Samoa and 
Pinewood avenues between Apperson Street and Foothill Boulevard, which 
contributed to growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the extreme northwest portion of the division, from the Los Angeles city 
boundary to the north, the Southern Pacific Railroad to the west, Foothill 
Boulevard to the south and Sombrero to the east, there were the fewest violent 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also detailed hour-by-hour, day-by-day activity, when most crimes 
occur. As might be expected, the most violent times in Foothill, the report 
stated, are the weekend nights -- between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. -- except for 
robberies, which occur most frequently on Mondays and on Saturdays from 9 p.m. 
to 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also noted that, according to the Department of Corrections, 1,400 
parolees live in the Foothill area. "Because of their transient habits," the 
report stated, "it is not feasible at this time to track their whereabouts." 
Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Street robberies were identified as a major source of violent crime here, 
largely due to the increasing use of crack cocaine and gang warfare. The report 
also blamed violent crime on the spread of black gangs from south and central 
Los Angeles, and noted that many illegal immigrants are often preyed upon by 
career criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group has become a large 'victim pool' preyed upon by the criminal 
element," the report said. "They are singled out because of their vulnerability 
and their reluctance to report criminal activity to the police for fear of 
being turned into the Immigration and Naturalization Service." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Van Nuys, rapes increased 4% between 1992 and 1993. Analysts found 
that in 62% of the cases, the victims knew their attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although homicide statistics for Van Nuys were not available Friday, the 
report noted that aggressive prosecution of gang members should "send a clear 
message that dire consequences are certain for any gang members who participate 
in murder." West Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Street robberies were cited at the biggest problem in the West Valley 
Division, where analysts singled out stretches of Sherman Way and Ventura 
Boulevard as particularly troublesome corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canoga Park, robberies were blamed on a high concentration of parolees 
coupled with the Canoga Park Alabama gang and alleged drug dealing. Lanark 
Park, Runnymede Park and a motel in the 7400 block of Winnetka Avenue are 
described as "key problem locations." 
</P>
<P>
 In Encino, the stretch of Ventura Boulevard between White Oak Avenue and Van 
Alden Avenue has been plagued by street robberies for three apparent reasons, 
according to the report: low-rent apartments to the north, the nearby Reseda 
Southside gang, and late-night businesses on the boulevard itself that "create 
a victim-rich environment." North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts found the worst section sits just east of the Hollywood Freeway, 
bordered by Burbank Boulevard on the north, Magnolia Boulevard on the south, 
Tujunga Avenue to the west and the city of Burbank on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1992 and 1993, this area had six homicides, the highest number in North 
Hollywood, as well as the highest rate of prostitution arrests and number of 
calls for police service. The area also had the second-highest number of rapes 
and robberies and third most aggravated assaults in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The report stated that the area is home to the North Hollywood Boys gang, 
which it describes as being "very active." 
</P>
<P>
 The report stated that most of the crime here occurred along major streets -- 
Riverside Drive and Lankershim and Magnolia boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contributing to this report were Times staff writers Timothy Williams, 
Abigail Goldman and Hugo Martin. LAPD Report Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire Division 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department analysis within Devonshire Division during 
January-November, 1993, identifies three key locations accounting for nearly 
one-fifth of the area's total violent crime activity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The Northridge Mall area 
</P>
<P>
 Why: It is a high pedestrian and vehicle traffic area "which attracts the 
criminal element." 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Roscoe-Schoenborn area (bordered by Lindley Avenue on the east, 
Zelzah Avenue on the west, Roscoe Boulevard on the south, Schoenborn Street on 
the north) 
</P>
<P>
 Why: It is a high-density apartment area that is "a target for gang-related 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Sepulveda Boulevard corridor (bordered by the San Diego Freeway on 
the west, Lassen Street on the north, Sepulveda Boulevard on the east and 
Roscoe Boulevard on the south) 
</P>
<P>
 Why: The area is "inundated with prostitution, narcotic trafficking and 
gang-related activity." West Valley Division 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD identified these problem areas: 
</P>
<P>
 * What/where: Street robberies, rapes and homicides occurring in Canoga Park 
during the mid-evening concentrated along the Sherman Way corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Why: The area is a Canoga Park Alabama gang stronghold that has high narcotics 
activity. Key robbery problem locations, according to the LAPD, are the Canoga 
House Motor Hotel at 7435 Winnetka Ave. (narcotics and prostitution); Runnymede 
Park at 20200 Runnymede St. (narcotics); and Lanark Park at 21816 Lanark St. 
(narcotics). The area also has a high concentration of parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 * What/where: Street robberies in Encino during the mid-evening, concentrated 
along the Ventura Boulevard corridor from White Oak Avenue on the east to 
Vanalden Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Why: There is a concentration of low-rent apartments to the north. Also the 
area is close to Reseda Southside gang strongholds located to the north. 
Numerous businesses operating at night create a "victim-rich environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * What/where: Aggravated assaults in the northern part of the West Valley in 
the mid-evening, particularly on Thursdays and Saturdays to the north and south 
of the Sherman Way corridor from Canoga Park to Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Why: The Canoga Park Alabama gang threatens Canoga Park. The area around 
Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard is a hangout for the Reseda Westside and 
Bryant Street gangs. Also, the LAPD suggests that a number of liquor stores and 
bars in the area contribute to the problem. Foothill Division 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD studied the division from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peak days for all crimes: Friday-Saturday, 11 p.m.-2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peak day for homicides: Saturday, 8:50-11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peak day for rapes: Saturday, 9-11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peak days for robbery: Monday and Saturday, 9 p.m.-5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peak days for aggravated assault: Saturday and Sunday, 6-11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The Van Nuys Boulevard corridor (San Fernando Road to Foothill 
Boulevard) is the major source of violent crime in the division. State 
Department of Corrections reports 1,400 parolees residing in the Foothill 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Why: The high concentration of low-income housing complexes, gang and narcotic 
activities. North Hollywood Division 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD spotlighted two areas of special concern: 
</P>
<P>
 * What/where: During 1992 and 1993, the area around Lankershim Boulevard 
between Burbank Boulevard and Magnolia had the division's highest number of 
homicides (four in 1993, two in 1992), the third highest number of rapes, the 
second highest number of robberies and the third highest number of aggravated 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Why: The area is home to the North Hollywood Boys gang, which is responsible 
for a large percentage of the crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * What/where: The area east of Tujunga Avenue, west of Clybourn Avenue, north 
of Saticoy Avenue and south of the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks had a high 
number of homicides (one in 1993 but four in 1992), the fourth-highest number 
of aggravated assaults and the third-highest number of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Why: The area is home to the Vineland Boys gang, which is identified as being 
responsible for a large percentage of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1993, most homicides occurred on Tuesdays around 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly one-fifth of the rapes happened on Fridays, and most of those 
happened between 10 and 11 p.m. More than half of all rape victims could name 
their attacker and considered the attacks "date rape." 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1993, the highest number of robberies occurred on Saturdays (17.9%) 
between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. Van Nuys Division 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly 30% of all crime in the division occurs around Van Nuys and Sepulveda 
boulevards.

L.A. DISTRICT GIVES PARENTS OPTION ON TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said Friday that they will allow 
parents to exempt their children from taking state-mandated CLAS performance 
tests, which have been under fire for allegedly being anti-family and 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rivera, spokesman for the state's largest district, said the decision 
came before a Los Angeles Superior Court judge exempted two San Fernando Valley 
students Friday morning from taking the controversial exams. Judge Robert H. 
O'Brien also demanded a copy of the test to determine whether other students 
should be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exams, which were first given last year, are used to compare student 
work in each school against tough statewide performance standards in reading, 
writing, math and other subjects. The students are required to answer essay 
questions and are allowed to discuss material before answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents and religious groups from throughout the state have filed lawsuits 
to prevent the California Learning Assessment System tests from being 
administered. They complain that the exams invade students' privacy rather than 
measure academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to make sure that children are not questioned about their 
personal beliefs or family life," said Bob Levy, a Woodland Hills attorney who 
filed the lawsuit on behalf of two West Hills parents. "Children learn from 
their families, and the school board shouldn't interfere with that." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials, however, reiterated their support for the CLAS 
tests, saying the state has made tremendous progress and will continue to push 
for the expansion of the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded statement, acting State Supt. of Public Instruction 
William D. Dawson said the tests' critics are deceiving the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the tactics being used by those engaged in lawsuits and spreading 
misinformation about the contents of the CLAS exam are, in my view, intended to 
destroy performance-based assessment, and to discredit the public schools, 
rather than to cause any kind of constructive change," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Dawson said his staff will revise the test development and review 
procedures to include the public. In a news release, Dawson said the process 
will be changed to "ensure that the content of the CLAS examination is 
educationally sound and publicly acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 State Education Department officials told districts on Thursday that they 
could allow parents to opt out of the tests. School districts also were told to 
let parents review sample copies of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said the 
L.A. school district's decision was theirs to make and that it is too early to 
tell its effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assume the majority of the kids will take it," Lange said. "The test is 
moving ahead. Hundreds of kids have already taken it. We intend to score them. 
The test is onward." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District late Thursday 
night became the second in the state to refuse to give the controversial tests, 
following the lead of the Antelope Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Orange Unified also agreed to allow parents to remove their 
children from CLAS testing.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles district, board members said they will likely review the 
CLAS tests in a closed session to better understand the parents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard for me to make an informed decision about it until I see 
it," said board member Mark Slavkin. "I don't want to create the impression 
that testing kids is something parents should fear exposing their children to. 
I think the CLAS test is a step in the right direction . . . but it's been 
shrouded in secrecy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange said the tests are available to school board members -- who must review 
them in closed sessions -- but they cannot be released to the public. She said 
the tests are considered a trade secret and that their release could violate 
copyright and other laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said the district understands its obligation under the law to give the 
tests but that parents should have a right to exclude their children. He said 
parents will be allowed to send notes to their local schools or tell school 
principals if they don't want their children tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have complained that the tests, which cost $15 million to develop and 
administer, are inappropriate for young children and do not measure academics 
but rather politically correct thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's to determine what is politically correct -- it's all opinion," said 
Debbie Greenfield, whose son is in the fourth-grade at Justice Street 
Elementary in West Hills and who was named in the lawsuit. "This type of 
testing belongs on the college level. These kids cannot be expected to answer 
these questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Thomason, whose son is in the fifth grade at Justice and who also was 
named in the lawsuit, said the tests "clearly" do not measure students' 
academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with academics and it's not pass-fail," Thomason said 
"You don't have to be a person of any religious following to see that this is 
tracking what's going on in kids' homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members for the 1,850-student district that serves the rural communities 
of Acton and Agua Dulce in north Los Angeles County made their decision after 
hearing concerns from dozens of parents, who expressed unhappiness with the 
secrecy of the test and the questions students are asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the state is saying is, 'Mom and Dad you are no longer a participant in 
education, you are a spectator in education,' " said board member Becky Small. 
"As a trustee I feel accountable to not only my students but to the family."

Antelope Valley.

MIDDLE EAST; DOCTOR MAY HOLD PRESCRIPTION FOR PEACE IN ISRAEL-PLO TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on 
Palestinian self-government broke down after the massacre of about 30 Muslims 
at a West Bank mosque, the telephone at Dr. Ahmad Tibi's office in East 
Jerusalem started ringing -- and has continued to do so almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls came from Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
closest advisers, asking the perpetually harried gynecologist what it would 
take to get the talks going again. 
</P>
<P>
 Other calls came from PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, including from 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, asking Tibi to explain to the Israelis the whys and 
wherefores of the Palestinian conditions for resuming negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 And still more calls came from senior diplomats here and in Europe, from 
would-be mediators and others volunteering ideas or assistance in concluding an 
agreement, now scheduled to be signed Wednesday, on implementing Palestinian 
self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody except extremists . . . wants the peace process to die," Tibi said, 
"but Israelis and Palestinians still have great trouble in talking to each 
other and in understanding the other's point of view and his needs. They don't 
need a translator for language. They need a translator for ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi, 37, one of Israel's 950,000 Arab citizens, has served as such a 
translator behind the scenes for nearly a decade, bringing Israelis into 
contact with Palestinians and the PLO leadership even at a time when Israeli 
contacts with the PLO were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arafat's "special adviser" for Israeli affairs, he is expected to remain a 
key channel of private communication between the PLO leader and Israel as the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip become a self-governing region -- and negotiations 
continue for what Palestinians hope will be full statehood. 
</P>
<P>
 So prominent has he become in recent months that the Israeli press is already 
speculating that he could be Israel's first ambassador to a Palestinian state 
-- or Palestine's "honorary consul" in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi disavows such ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Israeli citizen, I won't have any position in the Palestinian autonomy 
or the Palestinian state that will follow," he said. "This is the very thing 
that makes me effective as an adviser -- I don't want any job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a Palestinian citizen of the state of Israel, and I saw it as my duty to 
help my people and my country." 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi continued: "When I first met Arafat in 1984, he talked of peace with 
Israel. From Arafat and from others in the PLO, I was convinced a solution 
based on two states, Israel and Palestine, could be found. Finally, we are 
accomplishing that vision, though I know we are not through all the problems 
and crises yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a banker in the Arab town of Taiyiba, Tibi graduated from Hebrew 
University and its medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 "With me, politics has been a latent virus," he said. "I really just want to 
be a good doctor, but I have had this passion for politics since high school. 
So when someone calls and asks for help, off I go." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Tibi has arranged visits by Israeli politicians to Tunis, 
introduced such liberal Israeli groups as Peace Now and the Citizens' Rights 
Party to the PLO and advised the PLO at the Madrid Conference that launched the 
Middle East peace negotiations in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi's political activities led several times into conflict with Israeli 
authorities. The military barred him for a time from the occupied territories, 
the government refused him permission to travel abroad, and in 1989, Shin Bet, 
Israel's secret service, taped a call he made from PLO headquarters to Ezer 
Weizman, then Israel's science minister and now president, leading to Weizman's 
exclusion from the Cabinet's security discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, when Arafat and Rabin wondered whether they could trust one 
another in secret negotiations then under way in Oslo, they used Tibi to carry 
messages back and forth.  
</P>
<P>
 "I keep secrets," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi's role as a top-level envoy has drawn questions from both Israelis and 
Palestinians about where his loyalty lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yasser Arafat is the president of my people; Ezer Weizman is the president of 
my state," he replied. "I see no conflict in this."

CENTRAL AMERICA; OLD FOES FORM NEW ALLIANCES IN EL SALVADOR; PRESIDENT-ELECT 
ARMANDO CALDERON SOL STRIKES A CONCILIATORY NOTE. BUT MANY IN HIS RIGHT-WING 
PARTY ARE RESISTANT TO SWEEPING REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the two men wanted nothing more than to kill each other. Yet there 
they sat on a television studio set, arguing over election results and El 
Salvador's journey from war to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafik Handal, the Communist head of El Salvador's former guerrillas, and 
Gen. Mauricio Vargas, a senior army commander until his retirement last year, 
became increasingly animated and heated as the moderator looked on helplessly. 
Vargas scolded Handal, repeatedly slapping him on the knee, and Handal shouted 
back, jabbing his finger in the air inches short of Vargas' face. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just as things seemed ready to escalate out of control, it was over, and 
the two men laughed and shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Salvador that right-wing politician Armando Calderon Sol was elected to 
govern this week is a country where old hatreds often seem close to the 
surface. At the same time, it is a society where old enemies often form new 
alliances and where the two sides may be forced to make concessions to hold the 
country together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the most minimum agreement is struck between the left and the right, 
this country will not be governable," said Rodolfo Cardenal, a Jesuit priest 
and analyst with the liberal University of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol has been careful to strike a conciliatory note since scoring a 
landslide victory in elections Sunday. He immediately sought to allay fears 
about his administration by pledging to respect U.N.-brokered peace accords 
that ended El Salvador's civil war two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And, addressing opponents he had called "terrorists" throughout the bitter and 
divisive campaign, Calderon Sol said he recognized that rival Ruben Zamora and 
the former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or 
FMLN, had earned "undeniable political space" in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol's ties to hard-line members of his Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, or Arena, and the party's history of extremist violence raise 
questions about his commitment to the sweeping political and judicial reforms 
required by the accords. Many in Arena are resisting changes that include the 
formation of a nonpolitical civilian police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite Calderon Sol's moderate tone, Arena continued to send mixed 
signals. Even as Calderon Sol spoke of dialogue and unity, outgoing President 
Alfredo Cristiani took a more belligerent stance during a Sunday night victory 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 He led chants of "D'Aubuisson," in homage to the late Roberto D'Aubuisson, the 
reputed death squad leader who founded Arena, and he defended continued use of 
the party's war-era anthem, which pledges to make the nation "the tomb where 
the reds end up." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue singing the hymn just as it was written, because here in El 
Salvador international communism died," he told a roaring crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftist politicians have greeted Calderon Sol's comments with caution and 
skepticism, saying it is still too early to know the true designs of the new 
government. The left, bitter at its losses, also faces its own crisis. Riven by 
divisions, the FMLN may split into at least two factions, undermining its 
ability to serve as an effective opposition force to balance Arena's power. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora and the FMLN won 22 seats in the 84-member National Assembly, while 
Arena won 39 seats and will have control thanks to support from four 
congressmen who belong to a pro-military party. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be the depth of his country's profound economic and political crisis 
that will force Calderon Sol to work with the opposition. He cannot afford 
strikes and other unrest at a time when he will be struggling to rebuild this 
devastated country with dwindling foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if he has the numbers to run the country without considering the left or 
the center-left, it is not in his interest to do so," U.S. Ambassador Alan 
Flanigan said. "I am persuaded he understands the importance to his 
administration of being able to work with other parts of the political 
spectrum." Final Tally

AMES SAYS HE HAD NO CIA ACCOMPLICES; ESPIONAGE: CONVICTED SPY'S INTERROGATION 
BEGINS. INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING INTO AGENCY SHORTCOMINGS, LAPSES BY ITS 
PERSONNEL.

 Convicted CIA spy Aldrich H. Ames, munching deli sandwiches and sipping 
coffee, reportedly told FBI and CIA officials questioning him for the first 
time Friday that he had no other accomplices and knew of no other moles inside 
the agency where he once worked. 
</P>
<P>
 While government sources would not reveal Ames' initial insights, one 
intelligence official said that the questioning began with "a set of priorities 
that we're working our way through. Obviously our first priority is: 'Who else 
do you know about?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ames reportedly denied working with anyone in the agency. Plato Cacheris, his 
defense attorney, said: "Ames will not disclose other high-level or low-level 
people because he doesn't know of any." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that claim, one skeptical official said that "somebody must have 
inadvertently helped" the man responsible for the most damaging spy case in 
U.S. history. The official said investigators are determined to learn how Ames 
obtained more than 100 classified documents, many of them outside his 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 During 31 years with the agency, Ames rose to become chief of Soviet 
counterintelligence in the CIA's Soviet-East European division. But even after 
he was transferred to anti-narcotics work in the early 1990s, he continued to 
obtain Soviet-related CIA documents in apparent violation of the CIA's 
"need-to-know" regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' interrogation lasted more than five hours Friday in the first of what 
will be several months of debriefings in accordance with his court-approved 
plea agreement of a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested with his wife on Feb. 21, he was sentenced Thursday to life in prison 
without chance of parole after pleading guilty to betraying nearly a dozen 
Soviet officials who were cooperating with the CIA. He also gave the Soviets 
details of super-secret U.S. surveillance of the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said that two FBI officials are heading the 
interrogation team in a sparsely furnished government conference room. It is 
understood that CIA analysts also are involved in the questioning, in which 
Ames has agreed to be tested from time to time on a polygraph. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming days, as Ames is asked about specific documents and other 
information that he gave the Russians, including CIA operations he compromised, 
the agency will compile a confidential "damage assessment" report to determine 
what codes and other espionage techniques need to be altered, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One intelligence official said that Ames' responses to their questions will 
send CIA analysts scurrying through their files to see if they can verify or 
disprove his answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases we might ask the Brits or other intelligence services about 
information that Ames provides or we might query our (CIA) stations overseas to 
check something out," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Ames fulfills his pledge of truthfulness and "full cooperation," the 
government can withdraw its promise to recommend leniency for his wife, 
Rosario, when she appears for sentencing Aug. 26. Ames was motivated to enter 
into a plea agreement to spare his wife a long prison term while their 
5-year-old son is being cared for by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Ames pleaded guilty Thursday to the lesser espionage charge of "aiding, 
advising and encouraging" her husband's spying. Both also admitted evading 
federal income taxes by concealing $2.5 million in cash payments from the 
Russians, more than twice the amount Moscow has given any previously known spy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to pointing up any flaws in CIA operations, the Ames case also 
could lead to discipline of CIA personnel who should have uncovered his actions 
earlier. A separate inquiry at the agency by CIA Inspector General Frederick 
Hitz is trying to determine why the agency failed for eight years to detect 
Ames' spying. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey told a breakfast panel meeting of the American 
Bar Assn. that he intends to punish any CIA officials found to share blame for 
the lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey also said that the CIA had limited Hitz's inquiry before settlement of 
Ames' criminal liabilities so that it would not interfere with his prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there has been frustration in Congress -- I certainly shared it, as 
have the employees of the CIA," Woolsey said. But he added that the Justice 
Department had been correct in its concerns that the internal review would 
jeopardize prosecution of Ames and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, spoke Friday with Ames' lawyer about having the convicted spy as a 
future witness on CIA reforms and budget matters. But officials said that 
nothing was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sheehy, an attorney for the House Intelligence Committee, said that the 
panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), also wants to explore the idea 
but that they realize Ames "will be quite busy for awhile talking to FBI and 
CIA investigators."

CANADA THREATENS ARREST OF NATION OF ISLAM SPEAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The controversy over Nation of Islam member Khalid Abdul Muhammad moved north 
of the border on Friday as Canadian immigration authorities threatened to 
arrest him as an illegal immigrant if he shows up for a scheduled weekend 
speech here. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad -- whose fiery comments in U.S. speaking engagements have been widely 
condemned as anti-Semitic and anti-white -- would be ineligible for entry into 
Canada because of his 1987 fraud conviction and because he potentially violates 
this nation's laws against hate crimes, said Roger White, spokesman for 
Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi. 
</P>
<P>
 If Muhammad eludes detection by border authorities and turns up in Canada, the 
law "would allow immigration officials to arrest and detain him," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sponsors of Muhammad's appearance promised he would speak anyway. Donnie 
X, a Nation of Islam spokesman from Brampton, a Toronto suburb, said 
immigration law was subject to "interpretation" and that to arrest Muhammad 
would be "a miscarriage of justice." He said he had talked with immigration 
lawyers but declined to say if Muhammad was already in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad was to speak tonight at the University of Toronto, sponsored by the 
Black Youth Congress, which apparently is affiliated with the Brampton Nation 
of Islam group. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Canadian Jewish Congress President Irving Abella wrote to Marchi 
calling Muhammad a "hatemonger" and adding that "his criminal record, his 
record as a racist agitator and the real possibility that his scheduled speech 
in Toronto could break Canadian law all combine to make an unassailable case 
that he does not belong here." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials said they would bar Muhammad from entering Canada. The 
university, which had no role in sponsoring the speech, canceled the 
appearance, saying it would be unlawful and that the Black Youth Congress had 
misrepresented itself when renting the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Donnie X told a news conference that the speech had been 
rescheduled for Sunday at a private hall in Toronto. He was joined by Dudley 
Laws, a local black activist not affiliated with the Nation of Islam, and by a 
high school student who identified himself as Little X and said he was a member 
of the Black Youth Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Little X said Muhammad should be allowed to speak in Toronto so Canadians 
could hear and judge him directly, not through media reports. Laws did not 
mention the Canadian Jewish Congress by name but argued a "double standard" was 
at work. He said a black group would be harshly criticized if it called for 
someone to be barred from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad was unavailable for comment Friday but told the Toronto Globe & Mail 
on Thursday that the purpose of his appearance was "not to teach black people 
to hate white people, or Arab people, or Jews, but to get a greater knowledge 
of black culture and history, because a knowledge of self is important to black 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his 1987 conviction in Atlanta for fraudulently obtaining a loan, for 
which he received a three-year prison sentence, should not be grounds for 
keeping him out of Canada because he has paid his debt to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad became controversial after his Nov. 29 speech at New Jersey's Kean 
College, where he referred to Jews as "bloodsuckers of the black nation" who 
control the government, the news media and other black activists. He called 
Pope John Paul II "a cracker" and insulted homosexuals and others. 
</P>
<P>
 He then was a top aide to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Muhammad's 
speech was denounced by the Congressional Black Caucus, Vice President Al Gore, 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 3, Farrakhan demoted and chastised Muhammad for what he called 
"repugnant, malicious, mean-spirited" remarks. But Farrakhan failed to satisfy 
all critics, noting: "While I stand by the truths that he (Muhammad) spoke, I 
must condemn in the strongest terms the manner in which those truths were 
represented."

S. KOREA RULING PARTY RAMRODS PREMIER'S RATIFICATION; ASIA: OPPONENTS BOYCOTT 
VOTE. THEY HINGED COOPERATION ON PRESIDENT'S OK OF A CORRUPTION PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korea's ruling party forced through the appointment of new Prime 
Minister Lee Yung Duk on Friday after opposition forces boycotted the vote amid 
mounting criticism that the Kim Young Sam administration is increasingly 
authoritarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Democratic Party had refused to ratify the Lee appointment 
unless Kim agreed to launch an investigation into allegations that illegal 
campaign contributions from a construction firm were funneled to his 1992 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a week of political paralysis, the two sides failed to agree on 
terms of the investigation -- including who should be called as witnesses. That 
left the ruling Democratic Liberal Party to ram through the appointment on the 
last day of the National Assembly session. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Korean press reports, Kim was impatient with the impasse and 
believed that he could not waste any more time with looming problems such as 
North Korea's nuclear threat and mounting market-access demands. With local 
elections scheduled for next year, Kim reportedly believes that he has only 
this year to complete his programs before he becomes a lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the political confrontation has fueled criticism that Kim, the nation's 
first civilian president after three decades of military dictatorship, is 
losing his moral authority as a reformist figure. Besides the allegations of 
dirty campaign money was Kim's firing last week of the highly popular prime 
minister, Lee Hoi Chang, for challenging presidential authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a former Supreme Court justice nicknamed "Bamboo" for his incorruptible 
adherence to principles, had opposed Kim's order to form a committee on 
unification and national security issues under the president's direct 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim hoped such a committee would cut down on his administration's disarray and 
discord over North Korea policy, but Lee objected to being cut out of the loop 
and balked at implementing the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, outraged by what he reportedly viewed as a close ally's personal 
betrayal, fired him -- and was roundly criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surely, Kim's rash and intolerant dismissal of the popular prime minister has 
dealt a heavy blow to a prestige and popularity that had been enhanced by his 
ambitious reform drive," the Korea Times said in an editorial this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang Dal Joong, a political science professor at Seoul National University, 
said many intellectuals have defected from Kim, whom they initially welcomed as 
the leader who would usher South Korea into a new era of civilian democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last year, he said, Kim has backed off from campaign promises to 
reform business conglomerates, known as chaebols , and has begun to bring back 
many of the old faces of the former military governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his high-profile campaign against corruption, allegations of scandals 
involving him or his close aides are popping up regularly. The opposition 
charges that a construction company diverted millions of dollars into Kim's 
1992 presidential election fund from profits gained from a project to relocate 
the Sangmudae military base from downtown Kwangju to the city's outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of an herb dealer group has said he secretly gave $150,000 in 
lobbying funds to Kim's son, Kim Hyon Chol, which were later siphoned into the 
presidential election campaign. Kim's son has denied the charges and filed a 
libel suit against the herb dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Kim's close allies, the mayor of Inchon and the governor of north 
Chungchong province, were recently caught distributing gifts in violation of 
election laws. And Kim's Home Affairs Ministry is under attack for official 
negligence and abuse of power for failing to stop ruffians from attacking 
Buddhist monks protesting corruption against their leader last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The monks filed a complaint Friday with the Seoul district prosecutor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim's popularity seems to be facing a serious challenge from now on," Chang 
said. "The moral basis of his reform politics seems destroyed quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling party spokesman Ha Soon Bong blamed an internal power struggle between 
opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Lee Ki Taek for prolonging the nation's 
political paralysis. As a power play to show who was tougher, they ended up 
making what they knew were unreasonable demands -- for instance, to call 
President Kim as a witness in the Sangmudae scandal -- leading to the impasse, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, the new prime minister, is regarded as a specialist in North-South 
issues. Appointed deputy prime minister and unification minister last year, Lee 
was chief negotiator in the Red Cross-sponsored talks over family reunification 
in the 1970s. A Pyongyang native, he also served as dean of Myong Ji 
University. He is considered conservative, although he has said he dislikes 
that term. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not expected to show the same independence as his predecessor. A 
political cartoon this week portrayed him prostrating himself before Kim.

BOSNIA FACTIONS REFUSE TO BUDGE IN NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb and government officials refused to budge in negotiations Friday 
despite the first united appeal by U.S., Russian and European envoys to resolve 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslim-led government has threatened to pull out of the talks unless 
Bosnian Serb fighters and heavy weapons are well clear of the battered Muslim 
enclave of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bosnian Serbs, whose leader, Radovan Karadzic, met with the envoys in 
Pale, reiterated their stance that a final territorial settlement hinges on 
lifting the sanctions against the remaining territory of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. envoy Charles Redman said a major issue of the day's meetings was the 
duration of a future cease-fire between government troops and Bosnian Serb 
forces. The government wants it limited to three to four months, while the 
Serbs are seeking a permanent truce. 
</P>
<P>
 The government fears a permanent cease-fire would freeze current front lines. 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he "will accept only a temporary 
cease-fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Following his talks with the negotiators, who were planning to return to 
Sarajevo next Thursday, Izetbegovic insisted the Serbs had not lived up to the 
NATO ultimatum to withdraw soldiers from a 1.9-mile radius and heavy weapons 
from 12 miles around Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly declared they pulled out of the exclusion zones 
even before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's ultimatum expired, and 
U.N. and NATO officials say the Serbs have sufficiently complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs continued to hinder U.N. peacekeepers on Friday, turning back 
reinforcements headed for Gorazde and prohibiting military observers from 
taking pictures of weapons still within the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a British soldier was killed and two others were injured Friday 
when they drove over an antitank mine near Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia, 
Britain's Defense Ministry said. The incident brings the British military death 
toll in the region to five.

ALL-OUT EFFORT OF ELECTION WORKERS, TROOPS SAVES S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 This country's historic elections seemed doomed at 3:30 a.m. one day this week 
when a convoy of trucks carrying thousands of newly printed ballots stopped on 
the outskirts of this volatile black township to ask an army patrol for an 
escort. 
</P>
<P>
 The third and final day of the election, Thursday, was about to dawn. Many of 
the 16 polling stations in Thokoza had yet to see a ballot; tens of thousands 
of angry voters had been turned away. But the soldiers refused, saying they 
needed an order from their commanders in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Weinberg, a retired U.S. Navy officer and logistics consultant for the 
Independent Electoral Commission, punched the number of the Defense Force 
command into his cellular telephone. The army major who answered said he wanted 
to help but his force was stretched too thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major," Weinberg said, "I hate to be melodramatic here, but if you don't want 
this area to burn tomorrow, you had better get me some troops right now." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Weinberg," came the reply, "they'll be there in 45 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's first democratic elections this week came close to collapsing 
when millions of voters flooded under-equipped and, in some cases, unequipped 
polling stations for the first full day of voting Wednesday. But it was rescued 
Thursday and Friday by the army, the air force and the remarkable work of 
almost 300,000 election workers, who, facing a seemingly impossible task, 
refused to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, it was wild," Weinberg said Friday after 54 hours without 
sleep. "People came to the polls that first day as if we were giving out free 
Hershey bars. We never expected so many." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, a host of problems faced election officials, who had just 
four months to launch a voter education drive, print ballots, hire poll 
workers, arrange security and draw up a plan to make the election work. 
</P>
<P>
 The original plan, election officials now acknowledge, was weak and full of 
misjudgments. But, when the Inkatha Freedom Party agreed to participate in the 
elections just a week before the voting was to begin, the plan began to fall 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 9,000 polling stations needed a host of materials, including 
invisible ink to mark voters' hands, pencils, batteries, ultraviolet lamps, 
steel boxes, stamps, ink pads, and, of course, separate ballots for the 
national and provincial elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with Inkatha in the race, election officials now also needed an Inkatha 
sticker for each of the 80 million ballots and nearly 1,000 new polling 
stations in former no-go areas of Inkatha's home base, KwaZulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials had not ordered enough materials for extra polling places, 
and they were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began robbing Peter to pay Paul," admitted one official, who asked not to 
be named. At polling stations in urban areas, such as Thokoza, boxes of 
materials arrived, already opened and missing everything from batteries to ink 
pads. Some presiding officers in remote regions arrived at their polling 
stations to find no materials at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they had 80 million ballots, for an expected 21.7 million voters, the 
distribution system was inadequate (and now is the subject of a police 
investigation). That was complicated by the system that allowed South Africans 
to cast their ballots wherever they chose, resulting in long lines at some 
places and no lines at others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inkatha stickers didn't arrive at dozens, perhaps hundreds, of polling 
places. In some stations, voters were urged to write in the name of Inkatha if 
they wanted to vote for that party. At others, presiding officers wrote the 
name in themselves, at the bottom of the ballot, and hand-drew a square to hold 
the voters' X. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, with just one day of voting remaining, Inkatha President 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi was complaining loudly about the lack of stickers 
for his party and threatening to pull out of the elections. Almost every other 
party, including the African National Congress and President Frederik W. de 
Klerk's National Party, the two most powerful, complained about ballot 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Johann Kriegler -- the election commission chairman, a judge and head of South 
Africa's Lawyers for Human Rights -- battled reporters' questions before 
finally admitting serious inadequacies in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the head of the panel empowered to declare the elections free and 
fair, he pleaded with South Africans not to expect a perfect election. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the electoral commission headquarters the mood was gloomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disaster, it's a disaster," moaned one young white election official. 
"We've failed." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, believing that there was still time to salvage the election, 
stepped forward. "We can't give up yet," Weinberg remembered telling the 
election official. "We can make this work somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 That launched a giant, mid-election effort to rescue the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of printing companies across the country were called to print ballots, 
and their crews worked all night Wednesday to create more than 9 million new 
ballots, each with the Inkatha and party leader Buthelezi's name at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a rush job. When one printer complained that his workers had been on 
the job for 12 straight hours, a logistics officer appealed to his patriotism 
and prevailed. Informed by another printer that it would take an extra hour to 
bind the ballots and number them, Weinberg, who was fielding urgent requests 
from around the country for tens of thousands of ballots, told him not to 
bother. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of extra pens, ink pads and other items were also ordered. And in 
the early hours of Thursday, airplanes and trucks fanned out across the country 
to deliver the new materials and ballots. The South African air force, which 
dispatched 50 planes and helicopters to the remotest reaches of the country, 
called its mission Operation Jamba. It turned out to be the largest peacetime 
mission in the force's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The election rescue succeeded in most of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Bongi Msimang, a 37-year-old primary school principal and presiding officer at 
a voting station in Thokoza, had battled angry voters all day Wednesday when 
the ballots never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I was able to control them by asking them to be patient," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking a working phone, she had to rely on urgent messages delivered 
personally by her voting officers to the election commission headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know what was going on," she said. "Even my superior didn't know 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 But at 4 a.m. Thursday, Msimang was awakened by a phone call at her Thokoza 
home. The ballots, escorted by soldiers, had arrived. "I'm confident everybody 
who wanted to vote got the chance," she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thokoza, and in large sections of the country, the election was saved. But 
it wasn't enough in six former black homelands of South Africa, where voting 
had to be extended to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Gould, a Canadian hired as South Africa's chief election officer, urged 
the country Friday to be patient with the vote count. He said officials at 700 
counting stations would begin tabulating the vote early today and that it might 
take two or three days for the final results to be known. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not running a fast-food operation here, where we would have 
well-organized, well-provisioned franchises," Gould explained. "We already have 
some known problems, and we will have some unknown problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But the electoral commission, and the officials who worked night and day to 
make the election work, were relieved when every polling station finally closed 
its doors late Friday. They expected challenges to the election from various 
political parties. But they were confident that they would be able to call the 
exercise free and fair.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RWANDA VIOLENCE STUMPS WORLD LEADERS; AFRICA: THOUGH CLINTON AND 
BOUTROS BOUTROS-GHALI HAVE MADE GUARDED THREATS, CALLS FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN 
EERILY ABSENT.

 While the world this week toasts what concerted international action has 
helped accomplish in South Africa, a poor and overcrowded country 1,800 miles 
to the north demonstrates the sobering limits of such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 Rwandans -- some estimates put it as high as 200,000 -- have 
perished in ethnic butchery that began April 7, perhaps setting a contemporary 
record for concentrated slaughter. Yet the world's powerful nations, 
preoccupied and uncertain, have taken only limited diplomatic steps to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali made a guarded plea late 
Friday for the United Nations to take some sort of action to halt the Rwandan 
bloodshed, the United Nations -- sponsor of 17 peacekeeping missions -- could 
barely be persuaded last week to maintain a tiny 270-soldier detachment in the 
central African country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has limited its efforts largely to unspecified 
threats to the country's army, while in Congress, the usual calls for U.S. 
action are eerily absent -- even from the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some groups terribly concerned about the gorillas," says Rep. 
Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), whose state is home to a gorilla research 
organization. "But -- it sounds terrible -- people just don't know what can be 
done about the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The muted reaction to Rwanda's tragedy is in part a consequence of its remote 
location and unfamiliar culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the calamity has moved into its fourth week, it has also become clear 
that Rwanda's distress has been little heeded because of accidents of timing 
and because the scale of the strife is now so vast that it actually discourages 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Long portrayed as a sort of equatorial Switzerland, rocky-spined Rwanda has 
been racked in recent years by an exploding population, a soaring HIV infection 
rate and over-cultivation of its terraced farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 The strife between an army run by the majority Hutus and the rebel forces 
dominated by minority Tutsi began April 7 after the mysterious downing April 6 
of a plane carrying the Rwandan president and the president of neighboring 
Burundi, both Hutus. The violence, widely described as genocide, has included 
the systematic slaying of unarmed civilians with machetes, knives, clubs and 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's agonies might have aroused more international reaction during the 
Cold War, when great powers maintained ties to such countries as the former 
Belgian Congo and Angola to offset the influence of their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe that the strife might have attracted more attention 
before last October, when the death of 18 U.S. soldiers in a firefight in 
Somalia brought a sudden shift in Western assessment of the risks in 
peacekeeping ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 This changed attitude was evident recently when the U.S. government sent a 
detachment of Marines to the Burundi-Rwandan border -- but not a step farther 
-- as it considered how best to protect refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so totally gun-shy after Mogadishu, we wouldn't even send the Marines 
in," said Rep. Harry A. Johnston (D-Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign 
Affairs subcommittee on Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has also figured in the Rwandans' ill luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Western leaders are still wrestling with their role in a conflict that seems 
to demonstrate both the high cost of intervention in ethnic fights and perhaps 
also the futility. Closer and with at least some strategic significance for the 
West, Bosnia has first call on their attentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is heavily engaged in other conflicts at the moment," said Rep. Lee 
H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- the 
Rwandans' most likely political allies -- are wrapped up in efforts to change 
the Administration's Haiti policy and influence the U.S. role in South Africa. 
The caucus has been studying the situation in Rwanda but has made no special 
plea for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside world's response to date has consisted largely of turning to other 
African nations and the Organization of African Unity for leadership, while 
waiting for the killing to end. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of some human rights groups, the most important White House 
response has been to suggest that it is keeping track of the identities of Hutu 
military leaders. The announcement was intended to hint that U.S. officials 
might favor some war-crimes tribunal or, at least, that it would not want to 
deal with any government led by those officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But President Clinton "is stumped," said Johnston, who discussed Rwanda with 
him at an Oval Office meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 With reports now of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the violence not 
only in Rwanda but also now in neighboring Burundi, some U.S. analysts predict 
that, in the end, the greatest contribution of the United States to the crisis 
may come in its absorption of immigrants -- legal and illegal -- who are 
fleeing the country. 
</P>
<P>
 King Kigali V, the deposed Tutsi monarch, was granted asylum in the United 
States two years ago and is now trying to organize relief efforts from a small 
apartment outside Washington. He has applied for government food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't come to them, they will come to us anyway," one congressional 
aide said.

KISS FOR CASTRO SPURS DEATH THREATS AGAINST U.S. LAWYER; FLORIDA: THE FORMER 
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE ALSO PRAISES THE CUBAN LEADER ON VIDEOTAPE. TV 
BROADCASTS OF THE FOOTAGE HAVE FED OUTRAGE IN MIAMI.

<P>
 A former Democratic candidate for Congress, who received death threats after 
the telecast of a videotape showing her kissing Cuban President Fidel Castro at 
a Havana reception, was under police protection Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Magda Montiel Davis, a Cuban-born immigration lawyer, was one of about 200 
Cuban Americans who attended a three-day conference called Emigration and the 
Nation, which in itself was controversial. Many Cuban Americans oppose any 
dialogue with the Castro government. 
</P>
<P>
 But a furor erupted after the videotape, which was shot by a Cuban government 
photographer Sunday at the closed-door reception in the Palace of the 
Revolution and then sold to Miami television stations, was widely broadcast 
here, touching off outrage in some parts of the Cuban community. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, Montiel Davis is seen greeting Castro with a kiss on the cheek 
and then is heard saying: "Fidel, I want to tell you something. Thank you for 
all you have done for my people. You have been a great teacher for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) sent a copy of the videotape to Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno and asked her to list those who attended the conference as "foreign 
agents of the Cuban government." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm numb," Montiel Davis said in a telephone interview. "I'm frightened, but 
not to the extent that I'm willing to give up my principles. What I say there I 
say here."  
</P>
<P>
 Montiel Davis said that her comments to Castro were meant only to laud the 
accomplishments of the revolution. She denied being either a Fidelista or a 
Communist and added that she called Castro a great teacher because of the way 
he has stood up to U.S. pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she understands the reaction in Miami. "If I could change my 
body language, I would, because the perception conveyed was the wrong 
perception. But nothing excuses what I am going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel Davis said she is unable to go to her office and is working at home 
with round-the-clock protection. Dozens of Cuban exiles gathered at her home in 
Key Biscayne for a silent protest Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not leaving. Miami is our home," said Montiel Davis' husband, 
immigration attorney Ira Kurzban. "We have no intention of being intimidated. 
We don't think these extremists (responsible for the threats) represent the 
majority of Cuban Americans in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 An organization of Cuban jurists on Friday denounced the threats against 
Montiel Davis as coming from "hystericals and fascists," while a Cuban official 
called the threats "incredible -- actions that only people on the most extreme 
right are capable of carrying out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the subject of the conference, and especially Montiel Davis' actions, 
have been a major topic of conversation over often-strident Spanish-language 
radio here, some broadcasters urged calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am telling people to respect those who went to Cuba," said veteran talk 
show host Tomas Garcia Fuste. "We cannot tolerate bombings in Miami. This is 
what Castro wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Cuban Americans who attended the conference are seen on the 
videotape amiably exchanging words with Castro as they move through a reception 
line. But only Montiel Davis is heard effusively praising the Cuban leader, 
reviled as a dictator by the majority of Cuban exiles here. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by repeated showings of the tape on Miami television stations, the 
outrage has grown through the week. On Wednesday, about 25 demonstrators showed 
up at Montiel Davis' office and screamed threats and insults at her as she got 
into her car. 
</P>
<P>
 That same day, six employees of Montiel Davis' law firm -- all Latinas -- quit 
their jobs to protest her actions in Cuba. Since then, five of the six have 
appeared on local radio stations, been featured in newspaper stories and become 
celebrities. All have been offered others jobs as well as cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel Davis was defeated in her bid for Congress last year by Rep. Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, a Republican who also is Cuban-born.

MASSACHUSETTS SEEKS 60-DAY CAP ON WELFARE PAYMENTS; REFORM: GOV. WELD WANTS 
FEDERAL APPROVAL OF PLAN FORCING RECIPIENTS TO QUICKLY FIND WORK OR LOSE 
BENEFITS. PROPOSAL IS MUCH STRICTER THAN CLINTON'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a plan much more radical than President Clinton's proposed two-year 
limit on welfare benefits, Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld hopes to force 
recipients in his state to go to work within 60 days of receiving their first 
public assistance checks. 
</P>
<P>
 As officials from dozens of states have done, Weld came to Washington on 
Friday hoping to get federal approval to enact his plan even before the Clinton 
Administration puts the final touches on its own welfare overhaul -- a task 
expected to be completed by the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than wait for federal action, Massachusetts and other states are coming 
to the Administration with their own blueprints for achieving the President's 
goal of "ending welfare as we know it." Massachusetts' version is just one of 
20 initiatives now under review by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Before states can enact new welfare programs, the federal government must 
grant waivers that temporarily allow them to circumvent current welfare law. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 1993, the Administration has approved such waivers for welfare 
experiments in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, 
Iowa, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin and 
Wyoming. Others approved by the George Bush Administration are also being 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the waivers have been given with the caveat that they will have to be 
renegotiated after federal reform is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of states are dissatisfied with their welfare systems and they want to 
get started now on something new," said Mary Jo Bane, an assistant secretary in 
the Department of Health and Human Services, who oversees the waiver approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the new state programs include aspects of the 
Administration's evolving package, others are either more lenient or more 
stringent. Occasionally, the Administration has found itself in the awkward 
position of having to live up to Clinton's promise to give states flexibility 
in welfare reform, even when it is less than enthusiastic about some of the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 One popular program among states, for example, called the family cap, denies 
additional cash benefits to mothers who have babies while receiving welfare 
payments. States favor the idea because it saves money but critics argue that 
it hurts children. The provision has been so controversial within the 
Administration that the decision on whether to include it in the federal reform 
plan has been left to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Weld said he was encouraged after his meeting with Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. "She said they do approve waivers they don't 
necessarily agree with." Waiver approvals can take from a few months to a year, 
depending on the complexity of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Massachusetts plan would force able-bodied people to work by ending 
welfare payments after 60 days and eliminating the option of long-term 
dependency. If private-sector jobs cannot be found for welfare recipients, they 
will be offered community service work. Job training and education programs, a 
key aspect of the Administration's plan, would only be available to 
participants who also work at least 25 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Weld's plan would exempt disabled adults, adults caring for disabled children 
or spouses, pregnant women in the third trimester, women who have given birth 
within the previous four months and teen-age parents attending secondary school 
full time. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor rejected the notion that his plan would hurt the children of 
parents who fail to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is a more compassionate approach than the status quo," he said. "It's 
good for kids to see the single parents leaving the house every day to go to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who refuse to work, he said, would have to rely on friends, family or 
charity organizations -- as they did before federal welfare programs were 
enacted. "We do not contemplate people on the (heating) grates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates have criticized the Administration for being too lenient in its 
waiver policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically the federal government has ensured basic safeguards for poor 
families," said Mark Greenberg, senior attorney for the liberal Center for Law 
in Social Policy. "The federal government is no longer playing that role. It's 
allowing experimentation without regard for the reasonableness of the state 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Most state programs are designed to promote work and self-sufficiency. While 
some attempt to do that through incentives, others are resorting to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wisconsin program, for example, will enable the state to impose a two-year 
time limit for welfare benefits without guaranteeing jobs.

PLASTIC SURGEON'S KILLER IS CONVICTED

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Nazi sympathizer was convicted Friday of murdering a plastic surgeon he 
claimed gave patients "fake" Aryan features. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook County Circuit Judge Earl Strayhorn found Jonathan Haynes guilty of 
first-degree murder and burglary, and he ruled Haynes to be eligible for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes, a 35-year-old former chemist who acted as his own lawyer, admitted 
shooting Dr. Martin Sullivan in his suburban Wilmette office last August. 
</P>
<P>
 But he justified the shooting as a defense of "Aryan beauty" and repeatedly 
denounced people who "dilute" such beauty with plastic surgery, hair dye and 
tinted contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A penalty hearing was scheduled for May 4. After the hearing, Strayhorn will 
decide whether Haynes should be executed or sentenced to life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes also faces extradition to California in the 1987 slaying of San 
Francisco hairdresser Frank Ringi.

ITALY SEEKS GRAFT TRIAL FOR BERLUSCONI'S BROTHER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italian magistrates asked Friday that the brother of Prime Minister-designate 
Silvio Berlusconi and 29 others, including former government leader Bettino 
Craxi, be brought to trial on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The request followed a probe into alleged bribes paid on property deals with 
Italy's biggest savings bank, Cariplo. The probe erupted in the midst of Silvio 
Berlusconi's election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior judge must rule whether there is sufficient ground to try the 30 on 
charges of corruption and receiving bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolo Berlusconi, who runs the family property businesses, was briefly 
arrested shortly before his brother's conservative Freedom Alliance won a 
general election held March 27 and 28. He denies any wrongdoing.

STUDY OF GULF VETERANS' ILLNESSES URGED; MILITARY: NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF 
HEALTH SAYS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND UNDERLYING CAUSES. 
20,000 TROOPS REPORTED SYMPTOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A National Institutes of Health panel recommended Friday that extensive 
research be conducted into the mysterious spate of illnesses reported by men 
and women who served in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee concluded that the "complex biological, chemical, physical and 
psychological environment" of the operation produced a range of illnesses "with 
overlapping symptoms and causes" and that collaborative government-supported 
programs should be established to study them. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee "was moved by the extent of suffering among Persian Gulf 
veterans," said Dr. Gareth Green, professor of environmental health at the 
Harvard University School of Public Health, who served as chairman. "There is a 
clear need for continuing and compassionate care for these veterans as well as 
concerted research efforts to understand the underlying causes of these 
illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 700,000 troops served in the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991. The panel 
estimated that 20,000 or more of them have reported an array of debilitating 
symptoms, including fatigue, skin rash, muscle and joint pain, headache, memory 
loss, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 No single substance or organism has been identified as the sole cause of the 
health problems, although many of the troops were exposed to a variety of 
potentially toxic chemicals, such as fumes and smoke from oil well fires, toxic 
pesticides and uranium used in munitions and armor. 
</P>
<P>
 In urging the study, panel member David W. Gorman, deputy national legislative 
director of the Disabled American Veterans, recalled the health consequences of 
Agent Orange, an herbicide used during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 After many years of controversy, exposure to it ultimately was blamed for 
health problems experienced by Vietnam War veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Persian Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board, which includes representatives 
from the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human 
Services, said in a statement that it would "carefully review" the panel's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, established to coordinate interdepartmental activities aimed at 
resolving health concerns of Persian Gulf veterans, said it supports further 
studies and predicted that they "will bring us closer to answers concerning the 
causes and cures for unexplained Gulf War illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The three departments already are engaged in more than 20 research projects 
related to health, environmental effects, chemical agents and depleted uranium 
during the war, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board urged veterans experiencing health problems to contact a VA medical 
center for a free examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also recommended sending a health questionnaire to all of the 
nation's 700,000 veterans, or a representative sample in an effort to uncover 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel attributed cases of leishmaniasis -- a parasitic infection 
transmitted by the bite of sand flies -- and post-traumatic stress disorder to 
service in the Persian Gulf. The committee urged the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to develop "more responsive and effective approaches" for the diagnosis 
and treatment of stress-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Stress-related disorders have been associated in the past with service in 
Vietnam and in the two world wars, although they were identified belatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Persian Gulf service "was an experience of unprecedented stress for our 
military and their families," Green said. "The known threat of chemical or 
biological warfare by the Iraqis had a tremendous psychological impact. . . . 
We must learn more about the influencing effects of the central nervous system 
on immunological, cardiac, respiratory and gastrointestinal function."

GAP IN BLACK, WHITE INFANT DEATHS GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, black babies will be three times more likely to 
die by their first birthdays as white babies, federal health officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1991, the most recent year for which data is available, the rate 
of black infant deaths dropped nearly 21%, from 22.2 to 17.6 per 1,000 births, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The death rate for white babies fell 33%, from 10.9 to 7.3 per 1,000, the CDC 
said in its weekly report. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 8.9 per 1,000 births in 1991, down 
29.4% from 12.6 in 1980, the CDC said. The report did not break the figures 
down into other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 24 years ago, the ratio of black infant mortality to whites was 2 to 1, 
said Dr. David Satcher, the CDC director. Since then, the disparity has grown, 
despite the ongoing drop in the overall rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers must examine housing, income, stress and other factors as 
contributing to very low birth weight, said CDC epidemiologist Dr. Solomon 
Iyasu. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the gap results from an increase in the number of very low birth 
weights among black newborns, Iyasu said. A very low birth weight is 3 pounds, 
4 ounces or less. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the proportion of white babies with very low birth weight was 0.9%, 
compared with 2.5% of black newborns. By 1991, the proportion grew to 0.96% for 
whites and 2.95% for blacks, Iyasu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Thomas, the director of Emory University's Minority Health Research 
Laboratory, said the persistent gap between whites and blacks is a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that cuts in federal public health programs that provided prenatal 
visits for people in the black community were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health officials expect to meet their goal of decreasing the overall 
infant mortality rate to 7 per 1,000 by the year 2000. But the goal of lowering 
the black rate to 11 by the same year most likely will not be met, Iyasu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The white infant mortality rate is expected to decrease to 5 per 1,000 by 
then, with the black rate falling to about 14 per 1,000, officials said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON DOGGED BY ISSUE HE INVOKED: CHARACTER; PRESIDENCY: 
UNDERLYING WHITEWATER IS THE QUESTION OF VALUES THAT HE RAISED HIMSELF AS A 
CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Underlying the controversy over the legal rights and wrongs of the Whitewater 
controversy that is swirling around the Clinton presidency is a more 
fundamental political struggle over character, values and the allegiance of the 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's supporters blame reckless journalists and sore-loser 
Republicans for much of the Whitewater furor. "Republicans have lost some of 
their old reliable issues," such as welfare and crime, says Democratic National 
Chairman David Wilhelm. "So in order to slow the President down and stop the 
progress, they've latched on to Whitewater." 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts contend that Clinton brought the problem on himself by 
stressing traditional middle-class values during his campaign and his 
presidency even though the evidence suggests that he and First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton have not always conformed to those standards. The First Lady 
recently felt compelled to address criticism of her own conduct in an 
unprecedented televised press conference that lasted more than an hour but 
nevertheless, critics maintain, left some questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater allegations -- that the Clintons enjoyed improper financial 
benefits from their investment in an Arkansas resort because of Clinton's 
position as governor -- are only part of the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater aside, last month brought a White House admission that the Clintons 
had failed to report taxable profit on a commodities market deal. And the 
President continues to be dogged by reports that Arkansas state troopers 
ferried him to assignations with women while he was governor. As a result, 
Clinton's presidency now presents an ironic and, some believe, ominous 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has probably suffered more from character issues than any modern 
President," says Everett Carll Ladd, director of the Roper Center for Public 
Opinion Research. "Yet it's hard to find a President who in his public 
utterances has pushed more of the buttons on character and values than he has." 
</P>
<P>
 At nearly every opportunity, Clinton presents himself as the champion of 
middle-class people "who play by the rules," a phrase right out of his 
pollster's lexicon. As a self-proclaimed "different kind of Democrat," he 
frequently uses religious assemblages as forums, stresses religious themes and 
deplores how far national life has strayed from the influence of the Almighty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think God wants us to sit down and talk to one another and see what values 
we share and see how we can put them inside the millions and millions of 
Americans who are living in chaos," Clinton told fellow Yale Law School alumni 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson University political scientist Charles Dunn, editor of the anthology 
"American Political Theology," says of Clinton: "He may well be the greatest 
practitioner of civil religion and of public theology of any President we've 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, author of the best-selling "The Book of Virtues" and a 
potential Republican rival of Clinton's for the presidency in 1996, says: "He 
very much wants to be a leader in moral terms. He thinks of the pantheon of 
great American presidents and wants to be in their company and knows that moral 
leadership is part of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he is drawn to it, he speaks of it," Bennett says. And he warns: "As he 
speaks of it, he will be judged." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion Clinton seems to contradict himself with his own words. Feb. 3, 
addressing inner-city junior high school students here, the President made a 
moving plea for sexual restraint and family values, stressing that sex is not 
"sport" but a "solemn responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 But five days later, addressing auto workers in Shreveport, La., Clinton 
recalled owning a pickup truck that he carpeted with Astroturf in the bed. Amid 
laughter from the audience, Clinton added: "You don't want to know why, but I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after that he tried to explain away the prurient implication of that 
remark. "I carried my luggage back there. It wasn't for what everybody thought 
it was for when I made the comment, I can tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's supporters say that his frequently stated concern for values, far 
from being a cynical attempt to manipulate the electorate, reflects deeply held 
beliefs dating to his Southern Baptist childhood. Besides, they argue, nearly 
all the complaints about Clinton's behavior stem from his years in Arkansas and 
are not relevant to his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we tried to do and what Clinton tried to do with us was articulate 
values which were the underpinning of a public agenda," says Al From, head of 
the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group that Clinton used as a 
springboard for his presidential candidacy. "I think he's changed the agenda 
dramatically in the way he's conducted his office. I'm not going to talk about 
his personal conduct."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's critics contend that whether or not his professions about values are 
sincere, his failure to practice what he preaches undercuts his moral authority 
as chief executive. And they contend that since he became President he has been 
notably evasive and lacking in candor in responses to allegations about his 
past behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, this country is going to find that it's in a lot of trouble 
because there are people in the White House who are untrustworthy and 
unreliable," says Thomas Reeves, a historian at the University of Wisconsin at 
Parkside and a biographer of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over character and values has taken on significance that 
extends beyond its political effect on the Clinton presidency because Americans 
now seem more than usually cynical about politics and anxious about the state 
of morality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you concerned about basic values -- what they are and whether we heed 
them?" retiring Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun recently asked a friend 
in a note published in the Washington Post. "Are you concerned about your 
country. . . ? Are you concerned that many of those to whom we ought to be able 
to look up appear now to have feet of clay?" 
</P>
<P>
 Character, a measure of personal behavior and visceral inclinations, and 
values, the emotion-laden signposts of bedrock beliefs, had been steadily 
growing in importance in presidential politics well before Clinton. The 
expansion of presidential power, the intrusive reach of the mass media and the 
widespread belief that Watergate and Vietnam were rooted in defects in 
presidential mores have all contributed to this effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents and would-be presidents have benefited and suffered. Among the 
Democrats, Jimmy Carter's "born-again" Christian values helped vault him from 
obscurity to the White House. On the other hand, the presidential ambitions of 
Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and former Sen. 
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) collapsed because of presumed flaws in their character and 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 From Republican ranks, Ronald Reagan emerged as something of a values icon. 
The power of Reagan's appeal was recorded in 1985 by Democratic pollster 
Stanley B. Greenberg, now an influential Clinton adviser, in a landmark study 
of Michigan blue-collar workers who had switched to Reagan from the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they disagreed with some of Reagan's policies, his new disciples 
admired the President as "a John Wayne straight shooter" who had "the guts to 
stick to his guns." 
</P>
<P>
 George Bush, although he lacked Reagan's personal magnetism and strong 
convictions, was also able to score well in 1988 against Democratic nominee 
Michael S. Dukakis, then governor of Massachusetts, by taking advantage of 
Dukakis' dweebishness and the Democratic Party's reputation for permissiveness 
and protest. 
</P>
<P>
 As Democrats took stock of their party in the wake of their third successive 
presidential defeat, pollster Greenberg noted a significant contradiction. 
Though Americans had voted for the more conservative candidate, polling data 
showed strong voter sentiment for an activist government that would try to 
tackle the nation's intractable social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 To tap into these liberal impulses, Greenberg argued in an article in American 
Prospect magazine, Democrats needed to win back the middle-class voters who had 
defected to the GOP at the beginning of the Reagan era. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middle class today perceives itself as 'squeezed' between the rich and 
the poor, neither of whom play by the rules but seek their rewards through 
shortcuts and special claims -- tax breaks, windfalls and welfare," Greenberg 
wrote. "Middle-class consciousness deplores the lack of 'values' today . . . , 
the failure to honor work and recognize limits." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Leadership Council, under Clinton and From, was thinking along 
the same lines. It designed its agenda, proclaimed in 1990, to affirm support 
for "the moral and cultural values that most Americans share." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make it clear that Democrats believed in those values," From 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 With this commitment as the foundation of his promises to revive the sagging 
economy, Clinton's presidential candidacy swiftly picked up middle-class 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "He found one line of argument which allowed him to both attack the 
Republicans as the party of greed and privilege and protect himself from claims 
that Democrats just give away money to welfare cheats," says Johns Hopkins 
political scientist Ben Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
 When his candidacy was threatened early in the campaign by allegations of 
marital infidelity and draft avoidance, Clinton dismissed the charges as 
irrelevant to the substantive concerns of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people whose character and patriotism is really an issue in this election 
are those who would divert the attention of the people, who destroy the 
reputations of their opponents and divide the country we love," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he appeared to have overcome these problems about his past behavior, he 
returned to his themes of character and values in highly personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is a testament to the fact that the American dream works . . . ," he 
declared in one campaign speech. "I got to live by the rules that work in 
America, and I wound up here today running for President of the United States 
of America."  
</P>
<P>
 At the Democratic National Convention he accepted the nomination "in the name 
of all those who do the work, pay the taxes, raise the kids and play by the 
rules," a phrase he used no fewer than 70 times in his first year as President. 
</P>
<P>
 Now critics say that Clinton's rhetorical allegiance to values and character 
has been buried under the allegations of improper financial gains from the 
Whitewater real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally troublesome to the Clintons' image, critics argue, is Hillary 
Clinton's $99,000 profit on her $1,000 investment in the commodities markets. 
Ginsberg of Johns Hopkins contends that her profit does not square with the 
President's regular denunciation during the campaign of "cheating and cutting 
corners the way Republicans and their friends do." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Chairman Wilhelm says that the full facts have yet to be divulged. 
When all is known, he says, "I think people will balance whatever judgment they 
make against a career which she has spent fighting for the interests of 
children, reforming the education system of Arkansas and reforming the health 
care system of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead to 1996, Republican strategist William Kristol says: "If Clinton 
can convince people he is doing the right thing in health care and other areas, 
I think that would outweigh a fair amount of character flaws. But to do that a 
President needs trust, because you can never prove your programs will work 
right away, and Clinton does not have anything like that trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, his supporters see no end in sight for this scrutiny. 
Predicts campaign strategist James Carville: "If he is reelected, this will 
continue until Jan. 19 of the year 2001."

INTEREST LOW ON RIOTS' 2ND ANNIVERSARY; AFTERMATH: SCHEDULED OBSERVANCES ARE 
FEW. TURNOUT IS SMALL FOR SERVICE SPONSORED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND KOREAN 
AMERICAN CHURCH GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the tens of thousands of Los Angeles residents physically, emotionally or 
economically crippled by the 1992 riots, the scars may never fully heal. But if 
the turnout at a second anniversary church service was any indication, life, 
for better or worse, has begun to return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen African American and Korean American pastors, 10 journalists and nine 
members of the public showed up at the First Bible Church of Los Angeles Friday 
for a riot commemoration service sponsored by the African American/Korean 
American Christian Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 29 last year, about 200 people attended a first anniversary service 
held by the same group of church leaders, who have distributed college 
scholarships and made joint trips to Seoul with the assistance of a $100,000 
grant from the Council of Korean Christian Leaders in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are starting to put the unrest behind them," said Rev. Robert 
Habersham of Wesley United Methodist Church after the noon prayer meeting. 
"Although, unfortunately, it's not the people in church who are the problem. 
It's the people in the streets that we need to reach." 
</P>
<P>
 During the one-hour service, in which hymns were sung in Korean and English, 
pastors commenting on the impact of the riots invoked the statements and 
actions of world leaders ranging from civil rights leader Martin Luther King 
Jr. to Nelson Mandela to Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 King and Mandela, the head of South Africa's African National Congress, have 
proved that an individual's vision can have a profound impact, said Pastor 
Peter Kim of the Young Nak Presbyterian Church. "One man can change the face of 
the Earth," he said in his sermon. "Each one of us can make Los Angeles a 
different place." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was cited for his reflections on hatred. Paraphrasing the farewell 
address the late President gave upon resigning from office in 1974, Pastor Paul 
Kang said: "We need to always remember that those who hate us don't win, unless 
we hate them -- and then we destroy themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The service, at a small Korean American church in South-Central Los Angeles, 
was one of several events scheduled to commemorate the second anniversary of 
the riots. Others included the opening of a wholesale grocery to serve 
inner-city mom-and-pop convenience stores and an appearance by Deputy Police 
Chief Mark Kroeker before the Los Angeles Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, businessman Peter V. Ueberroth, who served as the first head of 
the riot recovery agency Rebuild L.A. before resigning last year, was honored 
at a luncheon sponsored by business leaders of another ethnic group: the Swiss 
American Chamber of Commerce.

BORDER PATROL STOP BASED SOLELY ON ETHNIC APPEARANCE IS ILLEGAL, COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals panel has found that the U.S. Border Patrol committed a 
"bad-faith, egregious constitutional violation" in stopping a car along a San 
Diego freeway solely because its occupants looked Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a longstanding law holding that 
a car cannot be stopped merely because of its occupants' ethnic appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 ruling, the court Thursday also took the unusual step of barring 
evidence the officers discovered, which showed that a passenger was an illegal 
immigrant. "We should not allow our courts to be used to sanction racism in any 
form," wrote Judge Thomas Tang. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting Judge Herbert Choy said the officers' actions, although improper, 
were not violent or shocking and did not justify excluding the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegally seized evidence is generally barred in criminal cases, but 
deportations are considered civil cases. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 1984 
immigration case that illegally obtained evidence should generally be allowed, 
but might be excluded in cases of egregious violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent case involved Mario Gonzalez Rivera, then 22, who was a passenger 
in a car driven by his father when Border Patrol officers stopped the vehicle 
in January, 1988, on a San Diego freeway. The father was a legal resident, but 
the son was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration authorities moved to deport the son, but he has been allowed to 
stay in the United States while appealing his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Salvador Wilson testified that agents stopped the car for a number of 
reasons: The two men appeared Latino; both looked away from the officers; the 
son's mouth appeared to be dry, he was blinking more than normal, and both men 
looked nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigration judge -- noting a 1975 Supreme Court ruling that ethnic 
appearance alone did not justify a stop -- called the officers' action 
unjustified after discounting all the explanations except the men's appearance. 
But the Board of Immigration Appeals overruled the judge and accepted Wilson's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's appeals court decision overrules the Board of Immigration Appeals 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Dorothy Nelson, in her lead opinion, questioned whether anyone in a 
passing car could tell whether a passenger's mouth was dry, how often he was 
blinking or whether those were symptoms of unusual nervousness.

WILSON WILL SEND MORE GUARDSMEN TO BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson announced Friday that he will more than triple the number of 
California National Guard troops deployed at the California-Mexico border to 
help the Border Patrol fight illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in San Diego to sue the federal government for the cost of jailing 
illegal immigrant felons in California, said he will increase from 49 to 176 
the number of Guard troops assigned to repair roads and staff observation posts 
to free Border Patrol agents to patrol the international boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said two-thirds of those troops will be financed by federal funds for 
fighting drug smuggling. The remainder will be paid for with state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing what we can at the state level," Wilson said in a statement 
released by his office. "The federal government must make a commitment to do 
whatever it takes, even if that means doubling or tripling the Border Patrol, 
to secure our nation's border." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's lawsuit is seeking $377 million for the cost of imprisoning nearly 
17,000 illegal immigrants who he says have been convicted of felonies in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the prison cost lawsuit is the first of three he intends to file 
against the federal government. The other two will focus on emergency health 
services and public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Several legal experts interviewed by The Times have said the lawsuit is on 
shaky ground because of the extraordinary constitutional protection the federal 
government has against such suits.

16 COUNTIES FAIL TO MEET AIR STANDARDS; HEALTH: THE LUNG ASSN. SAYS 9.1% OF 
AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND OTHER PROBLEMS FROM 
POLLUTANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost 23 million Americans live in places that do not meet federal standards 
for pollutants such as soot and acid aerosols, the stuff that produces some of 
that haze in the air, the American Lung Assn. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people -- 9.1% of the population in 16 counties nationwide, including 
smoggy Los Angeles and Denver -- are at risk of respiratory diseases and other 
health problems from the pollutants, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't let our guard down in regard to air quality," said Mary White, an 
epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which 
presented the study in its weekly report. "There's still a great deal that 
needs to be done so that air quality doesn't pose a health risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The report looked at counties and cities that fail to meet U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency regulations, comparing them to communities that meet the 
federal law and those that meet California's standards. That state's standards 
are the nation's strictest for particulate air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources of particulate air pollution include diesel bus and truck emissions, 
factory and utility smokestacks, car exhaust, wood burning, mining and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The lung association said such pollutants can impair lung function and 
seriously threaten the health of individuals with chronic respiratory 
illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. The particulates also 
can shorten life, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lung disease is the third leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA standard for particulates is 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air. 
California's standard is 51 micrograms. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 1.9 million children with asthma, 3.5 million adults 
with asthma and 6.2 million people with chronic pulmonary disease live in the 
country's most polluted areas. Nearly half of those with asthma live in 
counties where the particulate air pollution exceeds California limits, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of Americans, or 115 million, lived in 338 counties and cities that 
did not meet California standards for air pollutants in 1992, the association 
said. About 36%, or 92 million, lived in 322 counties and cities with levels 
below the federal limit but above the California standard.

FINGERPRINT ON BOX OF MARIJUANA FOUND IN ASSEMBLYMAN COSTA'S HOME WAS NOT HIS

<P>
 A fingerprint on a box of marijuana found in Assemblyman Jim Costa's home was 
not his print, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The marijuana was found in the Fresno Democrat's bedroom after he reported a 
burglary at his condominium in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa agreed last week to a police request that he be fingerprinted. Deputy 
Fresno Police Chief L.H. McDaniel announced Thursday that the fingerprints on 
the box did not match Costa's. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said he hopes his Republican opponent for the state Senate, incumbent 
Phil Wyman, now will stop using the marijuana issue in his political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Costa had said he thought the marijuana was either dropped by a 
burglar or planted by a political opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would like to see this crime successfully solved more than I would," 
Costa said. "I will give my utmost support to putting an end to this matter. 
This would allow me to focus more of my energy on the pressing problems 
affecting the people in my district."

POSTAL WORKER RECOUNTS LIFE OF FEAR; VIOLENCE: KIM SPRINGER SAYS WHAT BEGAN AS 
A WORK OUTING LED TO 10 MONTHS OF A CO-WORKER'S UNWANTED ADVANCES AND ENDED IN 
HIS DEADLY RAMPAGE.

 Kim Springer says it all began so innocently, at a July 4th office outing to 
the Orange County Fair.  
</P>
<P>
 But postal worker Mark Hilbun didn't want the evening to end. Within hours, 
the phone calls began. Then bottled water and odd gifts on Springer's doorstep. 
Then love letters, followed by letters containing threats. And finally, she 
says, Hilbun left a message inviting her to bring popcorn and watch him commit 
suicide on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd follow me everywhere I'd go," Springer told the Orange County Grand 
Jury. "I mean, at one point it was like three or four times a day he'd show up. 
I told him to go back and do his route and deliver his mail. And once I slapped 
him. I didn't handle it very well." Investigators say it was Hilbun's fixation 
on Springer, also a postal worker, that ultimately led to his murderous two-day 
rampage across Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, 1993, Hilbun had come looking for Springer at the Dana Point Post 
Office when he shot his best friend and wounded another postal worker. And 
before Hilbun was captured, his mother and her cocker spaniel were found 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was unharmed that day, and has declined to talk publicly about her 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But grand jury transcripts recently unsealed offer the first detailed account 
of Springer's months of fear and hiding as Hilbun pursued her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun, 39, of San Juan Capistrano will face trial in February, 1995, on two 
counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His attorney, Deputy Public 
Defender Denise Gragg, said she plans to concede that Hilbun is responsible for 
the crimes. But Gragg said she believes the evidence will prove Hilbun has long 
suffered from mental illness and was insane when the killings began. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the grand jury transcript, Hilbun's rampage began at the Corona 
del Mar home where his mother, Frances, lived with her dog, Golden. Authorities 
say the dog's throat had been "cut out" and Frances Hilbun was stabbed 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hilbun arrived at the Dana Point Post Office, and investigators say he 
was intent on kidnaping Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Bryan Brown told the grand jury that Hilbun was seeking revenge 
against postal officials who placed him on leave for his harassment of 
Springer, according to the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer said that harassment had been relentless since July 4, 1992, the 
night she went to the fair with him. She said she alerted supervisors at the 
post office right away about Hilbun. 
</P>
<P>
 She changed her phone number twice because of his frequent calls and obscene 
messages. Her boyfriend tried to stop Hilbun from bothering her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept doing my job and just kept saying just, 'Mark, you know, just 
leave me alone,' " she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun's bizarre behavior contributed to his firing, according to the grand 
jury transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, Hilbun brought a bag of rabbits to work, which he threw at a 
co-worker. On another, he wore his underwear outside his uniform and danced 
wildly at his work station, the transcript related. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun's stepsister, Jennifer Beneventi, testified that Hilbun told relatives 
he was going to marry Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneventi also told jurors that Hilbun was enraged at postal officials and 
blamed them for his firing. Hilbun appealed the firing but lost the case April 
19, 1993, just a few days before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer told the grand jurors that postal officials had talked of 
transferring her and put her on leave for her own safety in the days before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other employees, including the postmaster, were so fearful of the fired 
employee that they began arming themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 May 6 was Springer's first day back at work. 
</P>
<P>
 That Thursday morning, Springer said, she had just taken a break when a 
startling noise pierced through the music she was listening to on a radio 
headset. 
</P>
<P>
 She heard screaming and turned around to see Hilbun, "with a bandanna around 
his face, waving a gun back and forth coming down the middle of our bay," 
Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dead up against the wall," she said, describing how she tried to hide, 
hoping he had not checked her route assignment for the day. Such information 
would help him track her in the large building. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he knew what route I went out on, he would have seen me right away. I went 
under my mail case," she told the grand jury. "He was calling my name."POSTAL

SCIENTISTS SAY DISABLED GENE IS A CAUSE OF KIDNEY CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A disabled gene that seems to let cells grow uncontrollably, like a car losing 
its brakes, is responsible for the most common form of kidney cancer, 
scientists reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Identification of the gene may lead to earlier detection of kidney cancer and 
possibly better treatment and prevention, said Dr. W. Marston Linehan of the 
National Cancer Institute, senior author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The gene is one of a growing class of known "tumor suppressor" genes, which 
normally act to prevent cancer. When they are disabled, that control is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a car losing its brakes," Linehan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gene is linked to a form of kidney cancer that accounts for more than 
19,000 cases every year in the United States, Linehan said. This form accounts 
for about 85% of kidney cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute said the gene is responsible for the kidney cancer type. But 
David Smith of the Wayne State University School of Medicine, who studies the 
genetics of kidney cancer, said he did not consider that proven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that it plays a role, how big a role remains to be discerned," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linehan said the work may lead to some form of test to identify disabled 
versions of the gene in cells in the blood or urine, which could greatly 
improve the prospects for early diagnosis of the kidney cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is reported in the May issue of the journal Nature Genetics.

KEVORKIAN JURORS FOCUS ON SUICIDE CONSENT FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors deliberating an assisted-suicide charge against Jack Kevorkian asked to 
see several pieces of evidence Friday, including a suicide consent form signed 
by a terminally ill man. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the jury's requests on its first full day of deliberations centered on 
where the man's death occurred and whether Kevorkian's only intent was to end 
the man's suffering -- not to cause his death -- a loophole in Michigan's law 
banning assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than five hours of deliberating, jurors were sent home for the 
weekend. They are to resume their work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 65, is charged in the Aug. 4 death of Thomas Hyde, who suffered 
from Lou Gehrig's disease, a degenerative nerve disorder that left him barely 
able to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde, 30, died on a mattress in the back of Kevorkian's van by pulling a 
string that released a flow of lethal carbon monoxide through tubing and into a 
plastic face mask. Kevorkian said he placed the mask over Hyde's nose and 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 During deliberations, jurors sent for a consent form that Hyde and Kevorkian 
signed a month before Hyde died. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also asked to see the string and tubing used in Hyde's suicide and were 
given the carbon monoxide canister and face mask. 
</P>
<P>
 They also received photos chronicling the illness that turned Hyde from a 
healthy athlete to a man so weak he could not hold his 15-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 And they reviewed a section of the assisted-suicide law stating that the law 
does not apply to doctors administering medical procedures if the intent is to 
relieve suffering and not cause death.

BAGGAGE SNAFU MAY MAR DENVER AIRPORT OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A computerized baggage system that is supposed to whisk luggage from one 
flight to another at the new Denver International Airport is performing so 
poorly its maker said the airport's opening may have to be postponed for the 
fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wellington Webb briefed Denver business leaders Friday on the status of 
the airport opening and the baggage system test."We haven't made a decision 
about a delay," said Patricia Schwartzberg, the city's manager of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews were to continue testing the system Friday and today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly wasn't a success," Gene Di Fonso, vice president of BAE 
Automated System Inc., said Thursday following a daylong test of the 
$193-million system. "A failure? Yeah, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without declaring defeat we need to be intellectually honest about what we 
saw in today's testing: The May 15 opening is in serious doubt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system consists of 21 miles of tracks and about 4,000 rail cars controlled 
by computers that direct the cars based on readings from bar codes on luggage 
tags.

SOCIAL SECURITY LOBBIED FOR FUNDS AS IT GAVE BONUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Social Security Administration spent $32 million on employee bonuses last 
year at a time it was pressing Congress for millions more to deal with serious 
problems in its disability programs. The largest single award -- $9,256 -- went 
to an executive who had been on the job for less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the agency's 65,000 employees got a cash bonus in 1993, 
according to Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino. 
</P>
<P>
 Records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the biggest 
award went to Lawrence Thompson, who was named the agency's second-ranking 
executive by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala on July 19, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 His bonus, recommended by Social Security Commissioner Shirley Sears Chater 
and approved by Shalala, was for the fiscal year that ended 73 days later, on 
Sept. 30, Gambino said. Thompson's annual salary is $120,594. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security is not unique among federal agencies in awarding employee 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency's decision to spend $32 million is striking because Social 
Security lobbied Congress last year for more money to process a growing backlog 
of disability claims. Some ill and injured workers have died, lost their homes 
or turned to welfare while they waited for their first check. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the senior Republican on a Ways and Means 
subcommittee that oversees a part of Social Security, said an agency that 
admits to problems in its disability programs should not be rewarding "the 
people in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Gambino said the bonuses are meant to reward a work force of 65,000 stretched 
thin by a 20% cut in the number of employees and growing demands for services. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the bonus for Thompson covers both his work at Social Security 
and his last nine months at the General Accounting Office, where he served as 
assistant comptroller general for human resource programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambino said the bonus rewards Thompson for his "outstanding" work at the GAO 
and his "excellent" tenure while serving as acting commissioner of Social 
Security until Chater took over in October, 1993.

CHRISTOPHER, RABIN RENEW EFFORTS FOR PEACE WITH SYRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after a long-awaited breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, 
the United States and Israel on Friday announced a new push for peace on a 
second front with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher will leave Israel today for a meeting 
with President Hafez Assad and other senior Syrian officials in Damascus. 
Christopher will present a set of ideas outlined by Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin at daylong talks here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The completion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement to be signed on Wednesday (by 
Israel and the Palestinians) will be only one step, but an important step, to 
facilitate the progress in the other negotiations that are necessary to achieve 
a comprehensive peace," Christopher said at a news conference with Rabin. "We 
now need to make progress on the Syrian track." 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest step, Israel has clearly emerged as the engine behind the 
broader Mideast peace process. First in secret talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization last year, and now, in a public effort with Syria, 
Rabin government initiatives have injected a sense of urgency -- and brought 
results -- to a process launched almost three years ago in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 But brokering peace with Syria could prove to be as complicated and 
potentially more difficult than the deal with the Palestinians. "We've got a 
lot of hard work ahead of us," Christopher said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official later added: "We're not on the brink of a breakthrough. 
There are a lot of tough decisions that will have to be made by both sides. 
This is a process where you work to build base lines, determine what the 
options are, and then narrow the universe of what the possible solutions are." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and Rabin refused to disclose details of the Israeli proposal. 
Rabin said only that the ideas included "a comprehensive overview, including 
the substance of peace, the principle of withdrawal (from the Golan Heights) . 
. . the stages and a reference to their implementation by each side, and also 
demands of the American side." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli media reported this week that Rabin wants a phased withdrawal to 
culminate in a "full" peace, including open borders, trade and an exchange of 
ambassadors with Syria. One newspaper reported the government is also seeking a 
U.S.-led force of 3,000 troops in a buffer zone between the two longtime 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials denied that Israel had made a specific request but acknowledged 
that the two sides had explored the issues of peacetime security at length. 
</P>
<P>
 In their talks, Rabin also told Christopher that Syria had to undertake 
measures proving to the Israeli public that Damascus wanted peace, according to 
Rabin spokesman Obed Ben-Ami. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to face somebody who says he wants peace but will not talk to you, 
that is, (refuses) substantive, serious talk," Rabin was quoted as telling 
Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on the eve of Christopher's arrival, Syria pledged Friday not to 
succumb to any outside influence intended to win concessions on the pivotal 
issue of the Golan Heights. Damascus has demanded the return of the strategic 
plateau occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is being rumored about the possibility that Syria may be affected by 
pressure and seduction to accept compromises is untrue," wrote Al Baath, the 
newspaper of Assad's ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party. "Syria's firm stand has 
not deviated from the basis of the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Syria is also showing unprecedented interest in pursuing peace with its 
formal archrival, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Damascus has quietly taken steps indicating that it is 
willing to back its rhetoric on peace with action in Lebanon. For more than a 
decade, Lebanon has been a troublesome border for Israel. The tumult is often 
blamed on Syria as more than 30,000 Syrian troops effectively control large 
areas of eastern and southern Lebanon.  
</P>
<P>
 But in hopeful signs for peace: 
</P>
<P>
 * Syria has arrested more than two dozen members of the notorious Abu Nidal 
extremist organization in Lebanon, as well as closing some of its facilities in 
Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Syria has cracked down on Hezbollah operatives linked to extremist actions 
against Israel. The pro-Iranian Party of God has been one of the most 
persistent problems for Israel along its border with Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assad's security forces arrested diplomats accused of murdering an Iraqi 
dissident in Beirut two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * And Damascus has not intervened in the arrest of a key Syrian ally in 
Lebanon, right-wing Christian leader Samir Geagea, who has been tied to the 
bombing of a Maronite church last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In several of these cases, extremists arrested by Syria were turned over to 
Lebanese authorities -- leading Israel to complain that the latest moves are 
inadequate steps to prove new intent and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher said he believes that Syria will listen. "I expect the 
conversations there to be as serious and substantive as the conversations 
here," he said.

L.A. SCHOOLS TO ALLOW STATE TEST EXEMPTIONS; EDUCATION: PARENTS WILL BE GIVEN 
CHOICE ON WHETHER THEIR CHILDREN WILL TAKE PERFORMANCE EXAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said Friday they will allow 
parents to exempt their children from taking state-mandated performance tests 
that have been praised for raising standards but attacked by some who say the 
questions are anti-family and inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rivera, spokesman for the state's largest school district, said the 
decision was reached before a Los Angeles Superior Court judge Friday exempted 
two San Fernando Valley students from taking the exams. Judge Robert H. O'Brien 
also demanded a copy of the tests to determine whether other students should be 
exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and religious groups have filed lawsuits to prevent the California 
Learning Assessment System tests from being administered to nearly all students 
in the fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grades. The critics complain that the 
exams invade students' privacy rather than measure academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to make sure that children are not questioned about their 
personal beliefs or family life," said Bob Levy, a Woodland Hills attorney who 
filed the lawsuit on behalf of two West Hills parents. "Children learn from 
their families and the school board shouldn't interfere with that." 
</P>
<P>
 State education chief William D. Dawson said Friday that some critics are 
deceiving the public about the exams, which he defended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the tactics being used by those engaged in lawsuits and spreading 
misinformation about the contents of the CLAS exam are, in my view, intended to 
destroy performance-based assessment, and to discredit the public schools, 
rather than to cause any kind of constructive change," said Dawson, the acting 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials notified districts Thursday that they could allow 
parents to opt out of the tests. School districts also were told to let parents 
review sample copies of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said the Los 
Angeles school district was free to give parents an option. "We assume the 
majority of the kids will take it," Lange said. "The test is moving ahead. 
Hundreds of kids have already taken it. We intend to score them." 
</P>
<P>
 Districts scattered statewide have been confronted with potential court 
battles from exam critics. The Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District late 
Thursday night became the second in the state, following the lead of the 
Antelope Valley Union High School District, to refuse to give the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Orange Unified also agreed this week to allow parents to 
remove their children from CLAS testing, although a handful of students in 
other districts have skipped the tests this spring because of parental 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles district, board members said they will probably review the 
CLAS tests in a closed session to better understand parents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard for me to make an informed decision about it until I see 
it," board member Mark Slavkin said. "I don't want to create the impression 
that testing kids is something parents should fear exposing their children to. 
I think the CLAS test is a step in the right direction . . . but it's been 
shrouded in secrecy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange said the tests are available to school board members -- who must review 
them in closed sessions -- but cannot be released to the public. She said the 
tests are considered a trade secret and that their release could violate 
copyright and other laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exams, mandated by the state Legislature as part of education reform, 
are used to compare student work in each school against tough statewide 
performance standards in reading, writing, math and other subjects. The 
students are required to answer essay questions and are allowed to discuss 
material before answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have complained that the tests are inappropriate for young children 
and do not measure academics, but rather politically correct thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's to determine what is politically correct -- it's all opinion," said 
Debbie Greenfield, whose son is in the fourth grade at Justice Street 
Elementary in West Hills and who was named in the lawsuit. "This type of 
testing belongs on the college level. These kids cannot be expected to answer 
these questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Thomason, whose son is in the fifth grade at Justice and who also was 
named in the lawsuit, said the tests clearly do not measure students' academic 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with academics and it's not pass-fail," Thomason said. 
"You don't have to be a person of any religious following to see that this is 
tracking what's going on in kids' homes."

 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's practice of having his secretary listen in 
on his phone calls -- sometimes without the knowledge of the person on the 
other end of the line -- was sharply criticized Friday by Riordan's 
predecessor, former Mayor Tom Bradley, who questioned the legality of such 
monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, now a private attorney, was one of a number of prominent political 
figures raising questions about the behind-the-scenes listening and 
note-taking, described in a Times story Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had such a policy or practice," Bradley said. "I dialed my own 
numbers and took direct calls. Certainly my secretary never listened to the 
conversations I had. It seems to me this borders on being illegal, if not 
clearly illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the 15 members of the City Council also criticized the mayor, 
either directly or through aides, although some put their comments off the 
record. One who spoke out is Jackie Goldberg, who urged Riordan to end the 
practice, saying: "I thought we put Watergate to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 "His motives may be as pure as the driven snow," she added. "But you just 
don't listen in to conversations. As parents, we get after kids who do this."  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters and Mike Hernandez also 
complained. "I don't think there are any degrees of ethical behavior," Walters 
said. "It's like being pregnant. You're either ethical or you're not." When she 
has a sensitive matter to discuss with the mayor, she said, she will do it 
face-to-face from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members came to the defense of the mayor. Council President John 
Ferraro said the technique makes sense to him. "I don't do it and I don't plan 
to do it, but that's how Dick did things in private business and it worked 
there," he said. "I don't see anything wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden said the practice does not bother him because he does 
not say "anything to anybody that I wouldn't want on the front page of the L.A. 
Times." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said the mayor's office received 25 calls from the 
public on the matter Friday, which she characterized as a minor response, and 
had not heard any criticism from council members. Still, she said, "to the 
extent that this has bothered anyone, we will try to make it very clear when 
anyone else has joined the mayor's conversations." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan declined comment, and made no mention of the issue during a Town Hall 
Los Angeles luncheon speech. He said he had not read the newspaper article. 
"I'll read it when I get home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Riordan said he usually notifies people that his 
secretary, Carole Guillen, is on the line, and said she is simply helping him 
keep track of the crush of business he conducts over the phone. "The system 
works very well and it's very ethical," the mayor said. "I have nothing to be 
ashamed about." 
</P>
<P>
 He disagreed with sources who said his secretary routinely took down 
conversation summaries without the knowledge of the person on the other end of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts in privacy law questioned the legality of the mayor's practice. 
The law requires that all parties to a "confidential communication" be notified 
if it is being monitored by someone else.  
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office said city officials should notify all parties 
whenever someone is listening in on a call. Officials said they had had no 
plans to contact Riordan directly. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Assistant City Atty. Charles I. Goldenberg, chief of the 
special operations bureau, said he knows of no similar cases that have been 
prosecuted and doubts whether the practice violates the law. "I suspect that 
the mayor's office reads the newspaper. The city attorney's office view is 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of criticism, there were quips. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Griego, executive director of RLA, raised the issue in the form of a 
joke when she introduced the mayor at the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 "During all those conversations where I thought Dick Riordan wasn't listening 
to me, I'm glad to know that Carole was," Griego said, prompting laughter from 
the audience of more than 500 business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In City Hall, conversations began with the query, "Is your secretary listening 
in?" But there were also serious behind-the-scenes discussions about the 
mayor's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they had an inkling in the past that Riordan was not the only one on 
the line. One official said that during a conversation with the mayor, Guillen 
once came on the line unexpectedly and corrected a point that the mayor made. 
"I was really confused," the official said. "I was not notified she was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, representatives of the union representing the city's executive 
secretaries said they oppose the practice and do not know of it occurring 
outside the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any boss that would ask an executive secretary to take notes 
anonymously," said Pat Moore, president of Local 3672 of the American 
Federation of State, Local and Municipal Employees. "I would feel very strange 
having to monitor a conversation without everyone knowing I'm on the line."

CITYSCAPES / JOHN DART: ST. EMYDIUS' NAME WAS INVOKED FOR PROTECTION AGAINST 
EARTHQUAKES FOR CENTURIES IN EUROPE.; FEELING SHAKY? TAKE YOUR PICK OF QUAKES' 
2 PATRON SAINTS 
</P>

<P>
 It seemed like fate to a Tarzana businessman when he picked up a new book 
titled "Saints" and it fell open to a page that described one St. Gregory the 
Wonderworker as the patron saint to protect people against earthquakes. No 
other saint was listed as having such powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nelson, president of the Collector's Mint, saw a way to provide 
quake-skittish Californians with some needed protection. He also saw commercial 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 So Nelson began advertising St. Gregory the Wonderworker pocket medallions and 
silver pendants for $9.95 and $19.95, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he know that Los Angeles-area Catholics have had a patron saint for 
earthquakes for more than 130 years, though his job performance seems open to 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 St. Emydius, the archdiocese's heavenly hedge against quakes, has an honored 
place in its Downtown cathedral and has a Lynwood parish named after him. 
</P>
<P>
 But has the City of Angels been looking to the wrong saint? 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about this possible usurper, Msgr. Francis Weber, archivist for the 
archdiocese and resident priest at the San Fernando Mission, said it was his 
impression that St. Gregory specialized in more than earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a multivolume reference work, popularly known as "Butler's Lives of 
the Saints," notes that St. Gregory the Wonderworker was also invoked in 
southern Italy and Sicily in times of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have cancer you see a specialist, and St. Emydius was specially 
known as the patron saint against earthquakes," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend has it that Emydius, also spelled Emygdius, was a bishop who was 
beheaded during Roman persecution in A.D. 303. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said that Emydius' name was invoked for protection against earthquakes 
for centuries in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Franciscan friars evidently 
continued that tradition during the mission days in California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the disastrous Ft. Tejon earthquake on Jan. 9, 1857, Bishop Thaddeus 
Amat petitioned the Vatican for permission to celebrate St. Emydius' feast day, 
normally Aug. 9, on the Sunday after the anniversary of the temblor instead. 
The Vatican said yes, and in 1863, also granted the request of local priests to 
name Emydius as a patron of what was then known as the Monterey-Los Angeles 
diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Although St. Vibiana is the patroness of the archdiocese and Our Lady of the 
Angels (Mary) is patroness of the city of Los Angeles, Emydius remains 
co-patron of the archdiocese, along with St. Patrick of Irish fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Emydius and Patrick are depicted in life-size statues in lofty niches in the 
altar area of St. Vibiana Cathedral. The Whittier earthquake in October, 1987, 
caused the statues to swivel in their places and they ended up facing one 
another, said David Sutton, a cathedral employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was rather humorous," Sutton said. "St. Patrick was a little worse for 
wear and had almost slipped off his pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
 The statues were later attached to the walls.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps through no fault of his own, however, Emydius has slipped into 
obscurity over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Royale Vadakin, pastor of St. Vibiana from 1984 to 1990, said he never 
saw any reverential cult for St. Emydius. When he identified Emydius' status 
during tours of the cathedral, "I didn't see people's eyes light up," Vadakin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Father Donal O'Connor, pastor of St. Emydius parish in Lynwood for 
20 years, said he receives no inquiries about Emydius -- despite the fact that 
the saint's statue stands in front of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not too much veneration of saints anymore," O'Connor said. Besides 
that, "most of us regard earthquakes as natural phenomena," the priest said. 
Lynwood has been relatively unaffected by recent quakes, but that is because of 
its location, he surmised. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if Gregory the Wonderworker gathers a following, Emydius is in a poor 
position to fight back. Reference books such as the Catholic Almanac do not 
list Emydius but they do include St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, his Latin name. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, no St. Emydius medal or keepsake is found in standard religious 
catalogues, said Nancy Hennelly, manager of the San Fernando Mission Gift Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people pray to saints just as much as ever, but they have their 
favorites, such as St. Joseph, St. Francis of Assisi and especially St. Jude, 
who is prayed to for 'impossible' causes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that might make Jude the best generic candidate for trouble-prone Los 
Angeles.

COUNCIL AWARDS GIRL $4.5 MILLION; POLICE: TEEN-AGER WAS MOLESTED BY OFFICER IN 
1989. SETTLEMENT BRINGS RENEWED CALLS FOR BETTER LAPD TRAINING. CITY ALSO 
AWARDS $125,000 IN ANOTHER 1989 CASE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Friday awarded $4.5 million to a teen-age girl 
who was molested by a uniformed police officer, in a settlement that has 
renewed calls for better police training and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, one of the largest on record for the Police Department, stems from 
a 1989 incident in which veteran officer Stanley Tanabe fondled a 13-year-old 
Hollywood girl while he was ostensibly searching her family's home. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police records and prosecutors, Tanabe demanded entry to the 
girl's Hollywood home at 3 a.m. one January night in 1989. Off duty but in 
uniform, Tanabe told the girl's parents that he was responding to a call about 
someone screaming for help. He went to the teen-ager's bedroom and fondled her 
while pretending to search her. When she resisted, he placed one hand on his 
gun, the girl told police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanabe returned to the girl's home a second time in March of that year -- 
again off duty but in uniform -- but this time the teen-ager fled and called 
police. He was arrested as he left the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanabe, who maintained his innocence, was convicted in 1990 of sexual battery 
and burglary in connection with the case and sentenced to two years in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered the city to pay the girl 
$6.1 million in compensatory damages and ordered Tanabe to pay $3.1 million in 
punitive damages. At the time, an attorney for the girl said she suffered 
post-traumatic stress disorder and had attempted suicide as a result of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreeing to Friday's smaller, $4.5-million settlement, the girl and her 
family will avoid the possibility that the city would appeal the case. About $1 
million of the payment to the girl will go to her attorney, Johnnie L. Cochran 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl is now 18 years old and preparing to enter a community college in the 
fall, Cochran said. "She is going to be protected for the rest of her life," 
Cochran said. "I am really pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council said it will not let the case end there. In another 
action Friday, the council members asked the city attorney to file a lawsuit 
against Tanabe in an effort to recover some or all of the city's payment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Friday also awarded $125,000 in another police case involving 
Salvador Rodriguez, who charged that officers used excessive force when they 
arrested him near his North Hollywood home in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Rodriguez appeared to be intoxicated, although his blood 
alcohol level was never tested, and that he resisted when they responded to a 
disturbance call. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent witnesses said many of approximately a dozen baton blows struck by 
police came "without any resistance" by Rodriguez, according to a city 
attorney's report on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The payouts prompted council members to call for increased efforts to reduce 
litigation involving the Police Department. The council directed the Police 
Commission and a City Council committee to study whether training can improve 
police conduct and reduce the number of suits filed against the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 It also called on the Police Department to automatically launch internal 
investigations when lawsuits are filed. Council members Jackie Goldberg and 
Laura Chick, who proposed the changes, said they were disturbed that no 
internal review was conducted in the Rodriguez case. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said the Police Department would need more information before it 
can comment on the City Council's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office said it has not compiled information yet on total 
police-related litigation payments in 1994. But prior records show that such 
payouts dropped in 1993 after four years of dramatic increases. The city paid 
out an all-time high of $19.7 million on behalf of the department in 1992, but 
that was cut to $10.7 million last year, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said the payments have been devastating to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This larger judgment was more than the budget of the entire Cultural Affairs 
Department," Goldberg said. "We have to do something to make sure we learn from 
these cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said if the council's actions Friday do not accomplish enough, she 
would consider taking further measures, including having departments pay 
judgments out of their own budgets, instead of from city reserves. The change 
could give the Police Department and other city departments even more incentive 
to improve their conduct and reduce litigation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she found it "very ironic" that the large payouts came on the 
second anniversary of the riots, which were triggered by the acquittal of 
officers accused of beating Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave away close to $5 million today," Chick said. "We still have a long 
way to go." She said the only consolation in the cases came because both 
incidents took place in 1989, prior to efforts to reform the Police Department.

FLIMSY EVIDENCE; LEGAL LIGHTS PONDER WHO INVENTED GLOW-IN-THE-DARK LINGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a town where lawyers file unusual briefs in court every day, the case of 
the glow-in-the-dark panties was causing some to view jurisprudence in a 
different light Friday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Joe Hara steal the idea for phosphorescent lingerie? Or was Mark Graham 
the one who staged a panty raid -- swiping the concept from other designers who 
sell garments to Frederick's of Hollywood and Victoria's Secret? 
</P>
<P>
 A jury that has listened to two weeks of arguments and watched luminous teddy 
demonstrations in a darkened Superior Court began deliberations Friday in hopes 
of getting to the bottom of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Lights were repeatedly ordered turned off by Judge Lillian Stevens so a 
nine-woman, three-man jury could see Graham's lace glow and Hara's bras shine. 
Experts explained the mysteries of crotchless panties and pointless bras. Items 
such as luminous condoms and phosphorescent vibrators could sometimes be seen 
on the counsels' table. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, 41, a former Santa Monica actor who works as a Nashville songwriter, 
claims he thought up the glow-in-the-dark lingerie concept in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with my three brothers at a family reunion at my dad's place in Alvin, 
Tex.," he recalled. "We were sitting around one night having a beer, talking 
about girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he refined his idea after admiring a photograph in Playboy 
magazine and deciding that glowing lace would nicely accent lingerie. He said 
he approached garment company owner Hara a few months later to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Hara seemed interested at first, Graham said. But in early 1992 Hara declined 
to get involved, Graham added. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, counters Hara, 43, a Melrose-area resident whose company has produced 
the Desiree line of lingerie since 1988. He said he wanted to manufacture 
Graham's garments, but Graham never called him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hara said he decided to produce his own glow-in-the-dark garments using a 
luminescent-dying process already commonly utilized in the garment trade. Soon, 
Hara was selling them all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were told that the concept was hardly Graham's bright idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 phosphorescent panty product called "Silvery Moons" was introduced as 
evidence. So was a well-established novelty item, a glowing 
undergarment-in-a-rosebud product called Panty Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lights were flicked on and off, Graham's lawyer, Lawrence S. Cohen, 
displayed garments produced by his client. Cohen provoked smiles when he 
mistakenly held one glowing teddy upside down and then crashed into the 
courtroom blackboard as he groped for the light switch. 
</P>
<P>
 After briefly deliberating whether Graham should be paid the $171,000 he 
claims Hara made by selling phosphorescent garments, jurors left both sides in 
the dark Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hara talked glumly of moving his company to Arizona if he loses. Graham talked 
wistfully of having a luminary like Madonna promote his product if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
 When the verdict is returned, however, the winner will be easy to spot. He'll 
be the one who is glowing.

L.A. MOVES TO BROADEN INSPECTORS' JURISDICTIONS; GOVERNMENT: PLAN WOULD GIVE 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS POWER TO ATTACK A WIDE RANGE OF CODE VIOLATIONS. BUILDING 
AND SAFETY, STREET VENDORS WOULD BE AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 That car parked on the neighbors' lawn or that street vendor blocking the 
sidewalk has annoyed many an Angeleno. 
</P>
<P>
 But many find their frustration multiplied when they turn to their city 
government for help, only to have their complaints disappear in a welter of 
competing bureaucracies.  
</P>
<P>
 To untangle some of the mess, the Los Angeles City Council on Friday 
tentatively agreed to simplify the enforcement duties of the city's army of 
inspectors, code enforcement officers and police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of enforcement specialists, previously restricted to narrowly defined 
and segregated tasks, would be empowered to attack a wide range of violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic enforcement officers, now prohibited from working on private property, 
would be able to cite cars parked on front lawns. Building and safety 
inspectors, restricted to private property, would be able to ticket vendors 
illegally selling goods on a sidewalk. And Bureau of Sanitation inspectors 
could crack down on homeowners spraying pesticides, without waiting until the 
poison fouls a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James Hahn was instructed to draft revisions to the municipal code 
that would break down artificial barriers to efficient enforcement of the 
city's laws. The City Council is expected to begin final consideration of the 
proposals in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will simply cut the bureaucracy and let us enforce laws already on the 
books," said City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who asked for the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The enforcement problems came to light as the city tried to devise a strategy 
to crack down on illegal street vending. Council members learned that 
responsibility for the issue has been diffused among the Police Department, 
street use inspectors and building and safety inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some savvy street vendors have taken advantage of the limited jurisdictions of 
the civilian inspectors. They step onto private property when they see street 
use inspectors coming -- knowing they can only be cited by the inspectors on a 
public right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, they can thwart building and safety inspectors, who only enforce 
codes on private property, by stepping onto the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 By being given joint authority in enforcing the city's myriad codes, 
enforcement officers will not be so easily tripped up by jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 A parking enforcement officer from the Department of Transportation will be 
able to issue standard parking tickets and then shift gears to ticket cars 
parked on lawns or blocking driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 A street use inspector will be able to issue a citation to a construction crew 
that has blocked a crosswalk with lumber, and ticket the construction vehicles 
that are parked illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 And when citizens call to complain about illegally posted signs, building and 
safety and street use inspectors will be able to handle the problem, whether 
the signs hang on public or private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get calls on these things all the time and it really affects the ways 
communities look and function," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents have been shocked and angered when they have been referred 
from one city department to another. Such runarounds will be reduced by the 
changes, said James Washington, the city's chief street use inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 "To most people, they feel like they are just getting bounced from the Police 
Department to street use to building and safety," Washington said. "They think 
it's just a shell game. This will make it easier on us too."

BLOCK SQUARES OFF AS A FORMIDABLE POLITICAL FORCE; ELECTION: THE THREE-TERM 
SHERIFF PUTS AGE AND ILLNESS BEHIND HIM, AND IS LIKELY TO DO THE SAME TO FIVE 
CAMPAIGN RIVALS. HIS FOES HOPE TO FORCE A RUNOFF WITH CLAIMS THAT THE 
DEPARTMENT IS POORLY ADMINISTERED AND SUFFERING FROM LOW MORALE.

 At 69, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block is beyond the usual retirement 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite this, two bouts with cancer and the retirement or defeat in the 
last two years of numerous other veteran officeholders, Block appears to be on 
the road to reelection to a fourth term without a runoff in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sheriff's five opponents can hold Block to less than a majority of 
votes cast, it will require a November runoff election between the top two 
finishers. But none of the five have widespread name identification, and it 
remains uncertain whether any of them will muster much of an advertising 
campaign against Block. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the sheriff's opponents are active-duty officers, three in the 
Sheriff's Department and one with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
None of them are above the rank of sergeant, nor do they have appreciable 
political experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five, Tab Rhodes, 26, has spent the most money -- $17,000, which is a 
pittance in a countywide race. Another, Sgt. John R. Stites II, has campaigned 
actively, but said he has virtually no funds for ads. An elaborate fund-raiser 
recently produced but $5,000, he said, and the gun lobby, while supportive, has 
contributed little in funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the ethnic-minority candidates in the race, Sheriff's Deputy Gil 
Carrillo, a Latino, and MTA Sgt. Robert H. Lewis Jr., an African American, has 
sufficient funds to get a message out widely to potential voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth Block opponent, Robert J. Irmas, a lawyer and businessman in private 
life and a reserve captain in the Sheriff's Department, says he has personal 
resources to finance a costly campaign. With less than six weeks left before 
the primary, he promises to launch advertising on radio and television "later 
next month." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Irmas' Virginia-based advertising consultant, Joe Trippi, said in an 
interview that he remains uncertain "if we ever can get on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't got a handle on how much he (Irmas) can put together now, so we 
don't know when he's going on," Trippi said. But, he said, a private poll taken 
for Irmas indicated that "if someone out there can get a message going . . . 
(Block) can be held under 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 Block, by contrast, said in an interview that he has committed $300,000 to his 
campaign, using the slogan "Tough job, tough sheriff." He has advertised on 
billboards and bus placards, has reserved spots on paid slate mailers and is 
considering buying time on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now in "very good health," the sheriff said, and fully expects to serve 
out a new four-year term. He underwent chemotherapy last year for lymphatic 
cancer and earlier in his present term had surgery for prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for Irmas, Block displayed a letter Irmas wrote him last Aug. 20, in which 
Irmas vowed not to run against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no desire to even attempt to unseat you, inasmuch as I feel that your 
stewardship of the department is and always has been outstanding," Irmas told 
Block, adding that he was impressed by "the fine tradition that you have set as 
a high-water mark for anybody who may follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about this, Irmas said that upon later reconsideration he had decided 
that "my particular personal agenda cannot be secondary to Sherm Block's on 
when he wants to leave the department. My loyalty is to the Sheriff's 
Department and the people of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Irmas' father, Beverly Hills businessman and philanthropist Sydney 
Irmas, is a friend of Block. The senior Irmas' charitable foundation, on which 
Robert Irmas serves as administrator, last year contributed $500,000 for a 
Sheriff's Youth Activity Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, it was Block who, when he was a sheriff's captain teaching a 
class at Santa Monica City College more than 20 years ago, personally recruited 
Irmas, then only 20, to join the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Block maintains that in a time of fiscal constraints, when the budget of the 
Sheriff's Department is threatened with annual cuts, he has successfully kept 
the agency together and has set high standards of quality. 
</P>
<P>
 But his opponents characterize the department as poorly administered and say 
that staff morale is low. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, for example, said he decided to run "to represent the line staff," 
which he said has become so demoralized by internal Sheriff's Department 
policies that many deputies are afraid to make arrests and lack respect for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Stites has been critical of reforms in the use of force, saying they have 
hobbled deputies in what he characterizes as a time of frequent gang and 
criminal confrontation. At a recent fund-raiser, he warned that budget cutbacks 
this year could devastate the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is supportive of the reforms that he claims could result in less 
litigation against the department and more justice for the African American and 
Latino communities. He added that he believes that "the administration of the 
department is out of touch with the needs of the employees" and "especially the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo remarks, "The critical issue is crime. . . . I believe people are 
looking for a change because of all the crime. Whatever we're doing is not 
working and we need to try something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Irmas agreed that crime is the key issue, and that new blood is needed in the 
department to fight it. Besides, he said, Block four years ago said the present 
term would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never said that," responded Block, who has been sheriff since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Block is running for reelection, numerous Los Angeles officials have 
left public office. The city has changed its mayor, its police chief and 
several City Council members, and the county has a new district attorney and 
two new supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Block's opponents all claim the rank-and-file is disenchanted, the 
sheriff has said he does not believe that, and refers to hundreds of good 
wishes he received from deputies in his fight last year against cancer. He 
defends reforms designed to curtail excess use of force as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he has been told by many people that his opponents don't have 
the resources to threaten him, the sheriff said he is taking nothing for 
granted in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pursuing this reelection as if there's no contest," he said. "I'd be 
making a terrible mistake if I didn't tell people I'd appreciate their vote."

CONTRADICTIONS MARKED NIXON'S RELIGIOUS LIFE; PRESIDENCY: HE HAD BOTH DEFENDERS 
AND CRITICS AMONG THE CLERGY. HIS QUAKER UPBRINGING SHAPED HIS PERSONALITY, 
BIOGRAPHERS SAY, BUT NOT NECESSARILY HIS ACTIONS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon viewed the American religious community in much the same way he 
did other groups and institutions: some as friends, some as foes. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends included evangelist Billy Graham, who professed disappointment in 
Nixon after Watergate but who persistently called the 37th President, who died 
last week at age 81, a friend he could never forsake and for whom he often 
prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, in fact, was the first speaker at the White House worship services 
Nixon initiated on the Sunday after his first inauguration in 1969. Twenty-six 
such services were held during the first two years of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, a Quaker, said he wanted the services to remind the Administration that 
"we feel God's presence here, and that we seek his guidance here." 
</P>
<P>
 The late Norman Vincent Peale was also a frequent preacher at the worship 
services and performed the marriage of Julie Nixon and David Eisenhower in 
December, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's most outspoken defenders toward the end of his scandal-ridden 
presidency were Rabbi Baruch Korff and the Rev. John McLaughlin, the Jesuit 
priest and presidential aide who has since become a television host and 
commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious community also was the source of some of Nixon's most persistent 
critics, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Quakers in Milwaukee and Minneapolis, citing Nixon's abuse of power, called 
for his impeachment a full six months before he finally resigned in August, 
1974. The National Council of Churches, the nation's largest ecumenical 
organization, also called for his impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he introduced articles of impeachment against Nixon, the Rev. 
Robert Drinan, the former Massachusetts congressman and member of the House 
Judiciary Committee, made the infamous White House "enemies list" for his 
outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other clergymen also made the list: the Rev. Eugene Carson Blake, who was 
general secretary of the World Council of Churches, and the Rev. Ralph 
Abernathy, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And though he did not make the list, the American ethicist and theologian 
Reinhold Niebuhr raised the ire of the White House when, in one of his last 
major articles, he warned against the White House worship services as an 
inappropriate mixing of religion and secular power. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Nixon has turned the East Room into a kind of sanctuary and, by a 
curious combination of innocence and guile, has circumvented the Bill of 
Rights' first article," Niebuhr wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The man at the receiving end of Niebuhr's criticism was only the second Quaker 
to serve as a U.S. president. Herbert Hoover was the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's father, Frank, came from a conservative Methodist background, but 
after marrying Hannah Milhous, joined a Quaker congregation. According to 
Richard V. Pierard and Robert D. Linder, in their book "Civil Religion and the 
Presidency," she saw to it that the Nixon children "received a common religious 
upbringing in the Friends Sunday school." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon attended Quaker-affiliated Whittier College and, when World War II 
began, volunteered to work for the Office of Price Administration. Although as 
a Quaker he received a religious exemption from military service, he waived it 
and took a commission in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pierard and Linder, "religious observance was a central feature 
of his youth" and had "a profound impact" on the shaping of his personality. 
They argue that Nixon's Quaker experience resulted in "a blending of private 
reserve and public confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon included in his 1978 book "RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon" a 1930 
paper written for a class at Whittier that he described as still reflecting his 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President noted that he had given up some of his childhood beliefs 
in such things as the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible but still 
believed God was the Creator and that Jesus was the son of God -- but not in 
the physical sense of the term. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he also maintained in the paper that, in effect, "Jesus and God are one, 
because Jesus set the great example which is forever pulling men upward to the 
ideal life. His life was so perfect that he 'mingled' his soul with God's." 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed confusion about Nixon's statements of faith. Carl F.H. Henry, 
then editor of the evangelical magazine Christianity Today, interviewed Nixon 
during the 1968 presidential campaign and found him "remarkably imprecise about 
spiritual realities and enduring ethical concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelicals would later express disappointment and shock at the Nixon 
portrayed in the White House tapes: a profane and vindictive man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Pat Robertson, for example, demanded that Nixon apologize to 
America's Christians who, he said in 1974, were "the victims of a cruel hoax." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the private Nixon was totally at variance with his public image as a 
man of probity and piety. 
</P>
<P>
 As one example, Robertson said: "We can surmise that Dr. Billy Graham has been 
used for political image-building." 
</P>
<P>
 However, such a contradiction did not surprise the Rev. Wallace Henley, a 
Southern Baptist preacher and onetime White House aide who wrote a book in the 
wake of the Watergate scandal entitled, "The White House Mystique." 
</P>
<P>
 He said fellow evangelicals would not have been so shocked had they not "been 
so eager to adopt Nixon as one of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 "God could be worshiped in the East Room on Sunday, and lies be told in the 
press room on Monday," Henley wrote. "Pragmatism permitted no questions about 
contradictions. It dictated that whatever had to be done to maintain power -- 
be it in the worship of God or the twisting of information -- it should be 
done."

RABBIS DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE; MORALS: PASTORAL LETTER 
FROM A CONSERVATIVE PANEL IS CALLED THE FIRST MODERN ATTEMPT BY ANY BRANCH OF 
JUDAISM TO FORMULATE A SEXUAL ETHIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Jewish singles unable to wait until marriage, sex can still be a holy 
experience if religious moral standards are followed, according to a report on 
developing a contemporary sexual ethic for the nation's largest branch of 
Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Committed, loving relationships between mature people who strive to conduct 
their sexual lives according to the concepts and values described (in the 
document) can embody a measure of holiness, even if not the full portion 
available in marriage," says the report, "This Is My Beloved, This Is My 
Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage is still the "appropriate place" for sexual relations, but the report 
released Wednesday encourages Jewish leaders to reconsider whether even 
homosexual relations can be part of God's gift of sexuality if other moral 
standards are obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastoral letter from a commission of Conservative rabbis is called the 
first modern attempt to draft a sexual ethic by any branch of Judaism. Among 
its recommendations: Jews have a particular responsibility to avoid AIDS by 
disclosing their sexual history to their partners, by undergoing HIV testing 
and by abstaining if either partner is infected. 
</P>
<P>
 The report from the Rabbinical Assembly's Commission on Human Sexuality will 
be presented Tuesday to the group's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. The 
law committee, which sets official policy for the assembly, is expected to 
begin deliberations on the recommendations in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembly represents 1,500 Conservative rabbis who serve 1.5 million 
congregational members. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 
representing Reform Judaism, has approximately 1.3 million members in North 
America. An estimated 1 million American Jews are affiliated with Orthodox 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Gerald L. Zelizer, president of the Rabbinical Assembly, said the report 
represents the "first time that a major Rabbinic group in the United States has 
crafted the beginnings of a sexual ethic for the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
 Zelizer, a rabbi from Metuchen, N.J., said the committee attempted to apply a 
kind of moral hierarchy to the many kinds of sexual relationships today, with 
marriage as the ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its traditional teachings, the report not only upholds the importance of 
marriage, but condemns adultery as a gross violation of Jewish law. The report 
also condemns casual and promiscuous sex and encourages adherence to the Jewish 
law forbidding sex during a woman's menstrual period. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recognition of changing sexual practices, the report offers guidelines 
for sex outside of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The values the commission upholds include avoiding coercive sex and advocating 
modesty in speech, dress and sexual activities, honesty about each partner's 
commitment to the other, and fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are not married, these norms are still valid," said Arnold 
Goodman, an Atlanta rabbi and the commission's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent AIDS, the rabbis urge both partners to disclose their sexual 
history since the start of the AIDS epidemic in 1980 and to have HIV testing 
before sex is considered. If one partner is infected, the couple should abstain 
from sex, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission did not take a definitive stand on homosexuality, but is asking 
the law committee to examine the tension between the traditional teaching that 
considers same-sex relations an abomination and Conservative Judaism's 
commitment to civil rights for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our day, when we have many people who are single and others who are openly 
homosexual, we affirm their values as human beings and as Jews and earnestly 
want to involve them in the Conservative Movement," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's trying to imbue those relationships with Jewish values where people are 
doing it anyway to make those relationships more holy," Zelizer said.

 There was reason for jubilation at the annual meeting of the National 
Federation of Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers Inc., held April 23-26 in 
Arrowhead Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the organization mark a decade of providing non-medical care to 
incapacitated and chronically ill people, but it also announced a $23-million 
grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to a Faith in Action campaign to 
add 900 local care-giver programs to the 400 in existence across the country, 
including eight in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kenneth Johnson, a Kingston, N.Y., physician who persuaded the 
foundation to fund an initial grant to launch the program 10 years ago, "The 
point is to make it possible for frail and disabled people and those who love 
and look after them to live their lives to the fullest. Who can better make 
that a reality than the faith community?" 
</P>
<P>
 Local care-giver programs are independent and autonomous, although affiliated 
with the federation, which provides training in interfaith outreach, volunteer 
supervision and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Meredith is the executive director of Caregivers: Volunteers 
Assisting the Elderly in Ventura County, one of the first programs in the 
nation. It became self-sufficient three years after receiving a start-up grant 
from the foundation in 1984, and now runs on assistance from individuals, 
businesses, religious organizations and United Way. It has volunteers from 22 
churches and synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our society does not provide very good services for frail elderly people," 
Meredith said. "It is better not to let the inability to buy groceries or get 
to the doctor land them in a board and care facility or nursing home. That is 
both bad for them and a burden to society. Our program is the first line of 
defense for people who want to stay in their own homes." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, most but not all volunteers are retirees. "We do have 
younger people," Meredith said, "but our clients need help mostly during 
working hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Churches, synagogues, mosques, Buddhist temples and other organizations 
interested in starting a care-giver organization are encouraged to apply to the 
Faith in Action program for start-up grants of $25,000 to $40,000. Contact 
Faith in Action, P.O. Box 290, 368 Broadway, Suite 105, Kingston, N.Y. 12401. 
Phone: (914) 331-3867.

WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE; KEEPER OF SEPULVEDA DAM RETIRES AMID SURGING PRIDE, 
MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 City folks can only dream of working in the kind of pastoral setting that Fred 
Bermel came to every workday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was surrounded by open fields and farmland. There was a smooth-flowing 
stream where white egrets and Canada geese gather. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd never guess it's in the middle of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For 23 years, Bermel has been the keeper at Sepulveda Dam, the centerpiece of 
the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. Every day he inspected the floodgates, 
checked the rain gauges and kicked over the generators that run the hydraulic 
lifts inside the mammoth concrete structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all cornfields when I came," said the soft-spoken Bermel. "Woodley and 
Burbank didn't come through the basin and there was no park here." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of those years Bermel, now 60, lived on the property in a small house 
on a sloping green meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good living here," he said of the now-demolished house. "Except it 
meant I was on duty 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Bermel left this oasis. He retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the prettiest dams of them all," he said, standing on the bridge 
overlooking the concrete basin ankle-deep with water. 
</P>
<P>
 He listened to the water thrash against the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Southern California, we don't have the big lakes, but if this dam weren't 
here, most of Los Angeles, from Mulholland to the ocean, would be under water," 
he said as he peered over at the cross-currents formed by the concrete fans 
that jut out from the dam's gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda Dam is the last sentinel in a network of catch basins and 
streams that drain the San Fernando Valley, Bermel explained. The dam catches 
every ounce of water that lands within 152 square miles of the Valley, from 
creeks, small streams and the Los Angeles River, which starts about seven miles 
upstream from the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the water rarely climbs above a few inches deep, Bermel remembers a day 
in February, 1992, when the media reported that the water was 25 feet above sea 
level. While that claim is suspect in his mind, floodwaters did submerge 
Burbank Avenue and Woodley Boulevard, traditionally one of the first areas to 
flood in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how high the water was, but I know there was a lot of it, 
because many cars were under water," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bermel is as familiar with the concrete basin known as the Los Angeles 
River just about as well as anyone in the city. He's driven his service truck 
through the man-made channel from the dam to Glendale, South Gate and the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the dam facility are the controls that operate the hydraulic engines 
used to raise and lower the iron gates, depending on the amount of water 
rushing toward the channel. On rainy spring days, white-water currents can 
blast through the gates at speeds approaching 60 m.p.h., Bermel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran dam keeper said he could operate everything manually in case of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my baby, I'm the only one here," he said. "I operate the generators 
and gates so they'll work when the time comes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bermel's colleagues describe him as a quiet, private man who gets along well 
with the visitors and is as dedicated to his job as anyone can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the first man on the job in a disaster or emergency," said Billy Thomas, 
the chief of the reservoir regulations section for the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, which operates the regional dam system. "We're losing a good man." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people believe, although no one seems to really know, that Bermel is the 
dean of dam keepers at the Sepulveda Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has been here longer than Fred, so no one really knows," said Thomas, 
who's worked there since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is retired, Bermel will head for Southern Utah, where he has 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll like it," he said hopefully. "Or maybe I'll find another 
location." 
</P>
<P>
 After all these years, perhaps Bermel will flow like the water he's tended so 
long until he finds the place where the water goes to rest.

ELECTIONS / 43RD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; WU, ROGAN TAKE OFF THE GLOVES AS VOTE NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The once-polite 43rd Assembly District race turned hostile Friday with one top 
Republican contender charging that another allowed an accused murderer to go 
free while herself being accused of voting to double her salary as a school 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruckus started with a mailer Los Angeles Community College District 
Trustee Julia Wu sent to voters Thursday that accused her main GOP rival, James 
Rogan, of letting gang murderers go free when he was a prosecutor and, as a 
judge, of giving no jail time to a man convicted of sexual battery against a 
teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "So how many cases has Rogan plea bargained and who are the violent thugs 
walking the streets because of Jim Rogan?" the Wu mailer, sent to thousands of 
GOP-registered households, asks at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rogan campaign quickly put together a detailed fact sheet and list of 
witnesses to refute the charges. "It's an outrage, politics on the cheap," 
Rogan complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Rogan forces blazed away in a mailer entitled "Republicans 
Beware" that called Wu a "liberal" who as a college trustee had voted to double 
her salary and set up a slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu's camp denied the charges but the candidate could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The squabbling comes at the close of what has been a tame race to elect a 
candidate to serve the remaining months of former Assemblyman Pat Nolan's term. 
Nolan resigned Feb. 18 after pleading guilty to political racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 If any of the seven candidates for the seat draw more than 50% of the vote, he 
or she will take office immediately and serve until Dec. 5, when the remainder 
of Nolan's term expires. If no candidate gets a majority Tuesday, the top 
vote-getters from each party will face off June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the candidates for the seat that includes Burbank, Glendale and the Los 
Feliz and Silver Lake areas of Los Angeles are four Republicans, two Democrats 
and a Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu and Rogan are viewed as the top GOP contenders in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wu mailer, entitled "The Secret Files on James Rogan," features an 
illustration of a sinister, gun-wielding figure in a ski mask on its cover. It 
quotes Rogan from a 1991 newspaper interview as saying: "I stood up and 
dismissed murder cases." The quote was taken from a profile of the judge 
published in the Daily Journal, a legal affairs paper. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rogan charged that the quote was taken out of context from an interview in 
which he described the complex duties and ethical challenges facing 
prosecutors, among these being the obligation to drop charges against an 
accused murderer if they believe the person is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the case to which he was referring in the interview, Rogan claimed, 
involved murder charges wrongly brought against a young man. Arnold Klein, the 
defense attorney involved in the disputed 1988 murder case, said in an 
interview that Rogan, a deputy district attorney at the time, acted properly to 
dismiss the murder charge after police determined that his client was not 
involved and had arrested other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rogan was a prince of a guy," Klein said. "If I lived in his district, I'd 
vote for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wu mailer also accused Rogan, as a judge, of letting a man who pleaded no 
contest to sexual battery against a 17-year-old girl get by without jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Hennigan, who handled the case, said she had 
recommended that the man be given probation instead because he was a 
93-year-old Cuban immigrant who "exercised poor judgment" by trying to kiss the 
girl on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was no sex offender," Hennigan said of the defendant as she praised Rogan 
for showing judicial compassion in not seeking to punish the man further. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Wu camp accused the district attorney's office of protecting 
Rogan by refusing to release records of the cases he had handled as a 
prosecutor. Wu had requested the records but was told by the D.A.'s office that 
retrieving them would require the costly development of special software to 
access its computer files. "There's something strange about them stonewalling 
us," said Wu campaign manager Jot Condie. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan sent out a mailer himself Friday that seeks to paint Wu as a liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing newspaper accounts and the minutes of school board records, the Rogan 
piece accused Wu of voting in 1987 to double the salaries for all seven 
trustees -- including Wu. The vote bumped Wu's salary from $12,000 to $24,000 
annually. The Rogan piece did not mention the numbers involved. The pay hike 
came at a time of budget cutbacks but was justified by Wu and other supporters 
because board members had not had a raise in 10 years and their workload was 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan also charged that Wu had supported setting up a $100,000 "slush fund" to 
be spent at the discretion of the seven college trustees. Critics predicted the 
fund would be used to finance trustees' pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fund was never established, Wu, the board's president at the 
time, told reporters she intended to use her share to buy books and magazine 
subscriptions for the college library. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Rogan's charges, Wu's campaign consultant, Steve Presson, would 
only say: "We're going to have to give no comment on that."

HEAVENLY DEBATE OVER QUAKE PROTECTION; RELIGION: ST. GREGORY THE WONDERWORKER 
IS CHALLENGING ST. EMYDIUS AS A HEDGE AGAINST TEMBLORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has the City of Angels been looking to the wrong saint for protection against 
earthquakes? 
</P>
<P>
 The powers of St. Emydius, the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese's official 
heavenly hedge against quakes, are being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a new book on saints and the enterprise of a San Fernando Valley 
businessman, Emydius has a rival: St. Gregory the Wonderworker, a 3rd Century 
figure in church lore to whom Italians have looked for protection for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Gregory the Wonderworker pocket medallion and a silver pendant are 
selling for $9.95 and $19.95, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that all Californians who live with the danger of earthquakes will 
find comfort in having the Patron Saint and Protector Against Earthquakes with 
them at all times," according to a flyer from The Collector's Mint in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's president, Richard Nelson, who normally makes commemorative 
coins for collectors, discovered while browsing through Elizabeth Hallam's 
"Saints," a book that categorizes saints according to their areas of patronage, 
that only Gregory the Wonderworker was listed under earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Catholic himself, Nelson decided nevertheless that such a keepsake was 
just what quake-skittish Californians needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about this usurper, Msgr. Francis J. Weber, archivist for the 
archdiocese and resident priest at the San Fernando Mission, said it was his 
impression that St. Gregory was known for other roles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a multi-volume reference work popularly known as "Butler's Lives of 
the Saints" notes that St. Gregory the Wonderworker was invoked in southern 
Italy and Sicily in times of flooding as well as earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have cancer you see a specialist, and St. Emydius was specially 
known as the patron saint against earthquakes," Weber said. Legend has it that 
Emydius, also spelled Emygdius, was a bishop who was beheaded during Roman 
persecution in AD 303. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said Emydius' name has been invoked for protection against earthquakes 
for centuries in Europe. Franciscan friars evidently continued that tradition 
during the mission days in California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the disastrous Fort Tejon earthquake on Jan. 9, 1857, Bishop 
Thaddeus Amat petitioned the Vatican for permission to celebrate St. Emydius' 
feast day, normally on Aug. 9, on the Sunday after the anniversary of the 
temblor instead. The Vatican said yes, and in 1863 also granted the request of 
local priests to name Emydius as a patron of what was then known as the 
Monterey-Los Angeles diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Although St. Vibiana, a 3rd Century martyr, is the patroness of the 
archdiocese and Our Lady of the Angels (Mary) is patroness of the city of Los 
Angeles, Emydius remains co-patron of the archdiocese along with St. Patrick of 
Irish fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Emydius and Patrick are depicted in life-size statues placed into lofty niches 
in the altar area of St. Vibiana Cathedral in Los Angeles. The Whittier 
earthquake in October, 1987, caused the statues to swivel and end up facing one 
another, said David Sutton, a cathedral employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was rather humorous," Sutton said. "St. Patrick was a little worse for 
wear and had almost slipped off his pedestal." The statues later were attached 
to the walls to prevent them from falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps through no fault of his own, however, Emydius has slipped into 
obscurity over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Royale Vadakin, pastor of St. Vibiana from 1984 to 1990, said he never 
saw any reverential cult for St. Emydius. When he identified Emydius' status 
during tours of the cathedral, "I didn't see people's eyes light up when I said 
that," Vadakin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Father Donal O'Connor, pastor of St. Emydius parish in Lynwood for 
20 years, said he receives no inquiries about Emydius -- despite the fact that 
the saint's statue stands in front of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not too much veneration of saints anymore," O'Connor said. Besides 
that, "most of us regard earthquakes as natural phenomena," the priest said. 
Lynwood has been relatively unaffected by recent quakes, but that is due to its 
location, he surmised. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if Gregory the Wonderworker gathers a following, Emydius is in a poor 
position to fight back. Reference books such as the Catholic Almanac do not 
list Emydius but they do include St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, his Latin name. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, no St. Emydius medal or keepsake is found in standard religious 
catalogues, said Nancy Hennelly, manager of the San Fernando Mission Gift Shop, 
who said she has no immediate plans to order the Gregory the Wonderworker 
medals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people pray to saints just as much as ever, but they have their 
favorites such as St. Joseph, St. Francis of Assisi and especially St. Jude, 
who is prayed to for 'impossible' causes." 
</P>
<P>
 Making Jude perhaps the best generic candidate lately for trouble-prone Los 
Angeles.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; VOLUNTEERS CALLED TO L.A. RIVER CLEANUP 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles River, which through flood-control projects during the past 50 
years has become mostly a river of concrete, will have up to 2,000 friends 
today caring for the parts of the river that remain in a natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Schlageter, executive director for the Friends of the Los Angeles 
River, who will be joining volunteers in a spot along the river in Burbank, 
said the group has pulled junked cars and motorcycles out of the water and 
found mattresses hanging in trees overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mattresses are swept away from homeless encampments during flooding," 
said Schlageter, explaining that during a rain the river rises high enough and 
the trees bend low enough for trash to end up in the branches. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fifth year the Friends of the Los Angeles River has held the 
cleanup. The event has become more popular in the past two years, attracting 
more attention and volunteers, Schlageter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there were 1,100 volunteers, and Schlageter said he expects between 
1,500 and 2,000 today, working on six different spots on the river between the 
Sepulveda Basin and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the homeless living along the banks of the river have come out to help 
with the cleanup, picking up trash such as plastic bottles, men-at-work signs 
and shopping carts, he said. Last year, 35 tons of trash was collected. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent rains will not affect the cleanup, he said. The river was already 
back to normal levels on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-mile-long river begins in front of Canoga Park High School and runs to 
Long Beach. It was a natural river until the 1930s, when channel projects were 
started to control flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Los Angeles River was founded in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone needed to start thinking about the river as a river," Schlageter 
said. "Someone needed to concern itself with the needs of the ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to volunteer Saturday morning -- the cleanup is between 9 a.m. 
and noon -- can call the group at 213-223-0585. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; COMPANY GIVES COMPUTERS TO LANGDON PUPILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES

<TEXT>
<P>
 To a defense and electronics company, a 5-year-old computer is a clumsy 
dinosaur nearing the end of its useful life. 
</P>
<P>
 To a poor child, it is a treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the thinking that led Victor Rios, president of ITT Gilfillan, a Van 
Nuys company that makes radar for commercial and military uses, to start a 
computer-training program for children from Langdon Avenue Elementary School in 
North Hills. When the five-week pilot program is finished, 10 children will 
take their computers home to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to cry," said Soledad Campa, a single mother who has six children 
between the ages of 11 and 21, including a 12-year-old daughter who 
participated in the program. "This will help all of my children. I would never 
be able to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is one that Rios said he hopes will spread across the city, perhaps 
even the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know companies face the same dilemma I do about what to do with older 
computers," Rios said. "We can put them to better use. We can plant a seed for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the bulk of the company's computers no longer needed were sold to 
surplus dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, through a partnership with an after-school enrichment program at Langdon 
called L.A.'s BEST, or Better Educated Students for Tomorrow, the company will 
eventually donate about 100 computers to the school and to individual children 
there. "The only thing we have is our kids," Rios said. "What better way of 
helping them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The children will not be presented with the computers they have been using in 
classes taught by ITT volunteers until graduation from the program May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a presentation at ITT on Thursday, company representatives told the 
children's parents so they could make space for the computers in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a beautiful surprise," said Lourdes Cortez, whose 10-year-old son, 
Bryan Quijano, is in the program. "I am so proud of my son."  
</P>
<P>
 After being told of the computer gift, the parents joined their children in a 
narrow training room and gathered around an island of computers as the students 
showed off their word-processing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning computers is very interesting," said 11-year-old Linda Briones, 
swinging her legs excitedly under her chair when the lesson was finished. "It 
will help me a whole bunch in school." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; QUAKE JOLTS LIBRARY DONORS INTO ACTION

 The Northridge earthquake that hit Los Angeles left Burbank largely untouched, 
but the shaker that sent books flying off the shelves has created a boon for 
the Burbank Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that donations are up about 15% after the earthquake," said 
Sharon Cohen, library coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Friends of the Burbank Public Library has been running a sale of 
used books as part of a fund-raiser held twice a year. About 10,000 books -- 
donated by residents -- are on sale at the Burbank Central Library, 110 N. 
Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will end today, when all books will be sold for $1 a bag. The event 
typically raises about $5,000 for the library. 
</P>
<P>
 One Burbank woman donated thousands of paperback books, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she got tired of bending down to pick them up after the earthquake," 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after the earthquake we got quite a few donations," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the used books are donated throughout the year by residents cleaning 
out shelves, closets and garages. Many of the books had been sent by book clubs 
and were no longer wanted, or were textbooks donated by students who did not 
need them any more, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the donations are up this year because many more found old books while 
cleaning up after the quake. Some did not want to reshelve them, and others did 
not want to have to face having the books flying off the shelves in a future 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised from the sale is used to pay for programs such as summer reading 
programs for children as well as computer equipment. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; 4 FACE CHARGES IN COCKFIGHTING CASES

<P>
 Criminal charges were filed this week against two men accused of holding a 
cockfight in Sylmar and two other men accused of training fighting cocks that 
they planned to ship to Arizona and Mexico for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office charged Juan Munoz, 43, and Vincente 
Gudino, 35, both of Sylmar, each with a single count of permitting 
cockfighting.Munoz also faces a count of possessing fighting cocks, and Gudino 
also faces a charge of possessing gaffs and slashers, devices attached to cocks 
for fighting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives and city animal control officers said they 
arrested Munoz and Gudino on April 23 after finding as many as 70 people 
watching a cockfight at a Sylmar residence. Officers reported seizing 10 dead 
birds, eight injured birds and cockfighting devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are scheduled to be arraigned May 9 in San Fernando Municipal Court. 
If convicted, Munoz and Gudino face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine 
for each count. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, authorities have charged Ricardo Fernandez, 28, of Arleta, 
and Efren Viramontes, 32, of Sylmar, with a count each of training birds for 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers arrested the two men April 13 after they received a tip that cocks 
were being trained to fight at a Sylmar location. More than 100 fighting cocks 
-- valued at between $40,000 and $60,000 -- were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez and Viramontes are scheduled for arraignment May 27 in San Fernando 
Municipal Court and face the same penalties as Munoz and Gudino. JULIE TAMAKI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: QUAKE CLEANUP BY PRIVATE FIRM URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, after a community meeting in 
Pacoima with public works officials, said he will ask the council to reconsider 
the idea of having a private contractor take over management of earthquake 
debris removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make a decision as to whether we are moving in the right 
direction," said Alarcon, chairman of the public works committee."I feel 
strongly that there's a lot of money to be saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, whose proposal is to be considered during Tuesday's council meeting, 
has complained about the pace of the debris removal. At the community meeting 
Thursday, Alarcon pointed to statistics that show only 46% of businesses 
involved in the cleanup are within the city of Los Angeles, while in the 
cleanup after the 1992 riots -- managed by a private contractor -- 80% of 
businesses were in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a private contractor could be less costly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, the City Council had considered 
and rejected using private contractors to manage the cleanup. Alarcon said he 
would like to reconsider the idea, especially because the city had put out 
requests for proposals without seeking cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the city has a better idea of what the cleanup is costing, a less 
expensive solution might be found in the private sector. Alarcon said the move 
would also save the city from having to use 78 city employees to manage the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was using six crews for earthquake debris cleanup earlier this month. 
But as of this week, money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency allowed 
the city to bring that number up to 100 crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Each crew includes four or five workers, two dump trucks and a skip-loader to 
scoop the rubble into the trucks. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; LANDLORD FINED FOR SLUM CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ordered a Chatsworth man to pay more than $13,000 in fines Friday 
stemming from his conviction on charges of permitting slum conditions at a 
Hollywood apartment house he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Veronica Simmons McBeth also sentenced Bernard Gross, 48, to 
three years summary probation and imposed a June 21 deadline for Gross to 
repair the slum conditions or face more penalties, according to the city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 A June 29 compliance hearing has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross was convicted earlier this month of 36 violations of fire, health and 
building safety codes at his apartment complex in the 5400 block of Virginia 
Avenue, including cockroach and rat infestation and exposed live electrical 
wiring.  
</P>
<P>
 McBeth also found Gross in violation of his probation from his conviction in a 
fraud foreclosure case last year, a city attorney spokesman said. Gross was 
convicted of charges stemming from an incident involving a Huntington Park 
woman he persuaded to sign over the deed to her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and given credit for 77 
days of jail he had already served. JULIE TAMAKI

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BOOK HELPS CHILDREN COPE WITH QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Wende felt helpless from Fort Worth as she watched news reports of the 
January earthquake that had shattered the San Fernando Valley, her former home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt isolated here and so out of touch with my friends and wanting so much 
to be there for them," she said from her new Texas home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wende's desire to ease her friends' pain has since translated into an 
earthquake activity book that has helped thousands of area children cope with 
their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days after the earthquake, when Wende finally got through to the 
home of longtime friends in Sherman Oaks, the couple's child answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her little voice was just full of hopelessness. It just really broke me up 
and I just wanted to put a smile back on her face," said Wende, 38, who still 
remembers the terror she felt as a youngster during the Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The fright in the 7-year-old's voice prompted Wende, an illustrator, to put 
together a colorful activity book to help the child deal with the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "My motivation was really to cheer her up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That book drawn for little Shanelle Lambert has now, in its newer, more 
polished form, found its way into the hands of 150,000 children, many in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanelle's mother, Tami Lambert, showed the book to colleagues at Healthnet, 
where she worked at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shanelle was so touched by it and I was so touched that Julie took the time 
to do this," Lambert said. "Psychologically it was just very thought-provoking. 
It's very hard for children to formulate what they're feeling. Julie's book 
helped Shanelle focus in on 'No, I didn't like the lights being out and yes, I 
was scared.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert decided other children could also learn to address their fears with 
the book, which includes pages to color, and lines to write "what Shanelle 
thinks about earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The next morning I thought, I've got to share this book with somebody. This 
book needs to be shared with just more than my daughter," Lambert said. "At 
this point I'm thinking I'll go to Kinko's and have some copies made." 
</P>
<P>
 But Healthnet officials were so impressed they contacted Wende and asked her 
to help produce the book on a larger scale with Healthnet's supervisor of 
communications, Melissa Stephan, who wrote the text. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the idea and thought it was so cute and worked so well with 
Shanelle," said Cindy Keitel, director of wellness for Healthnet. 
</P>
<P>
 The company published and distributed the book through the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and counseling and relief centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is available in Spanish and English and can be requested by calling 
(800) 955-6066. REBECCA BRYANT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 'QUAKE LADY' TRIES TO CALM RATTLED NERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing a discussion Friday morning by a Caltech seismologist known as 
the "Earthquake Lady," some in the audience felt better, some felt worse and 
some still seemed to be feeling anxiety from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least Caltech staff seismologist Kate Hutton taught them it was still 
important to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep our sense of humor," said Hutton, who earned her nickname for 
being frequently quoted in the press on the subject of temblors. She gave a 
slide show and talk at the Sportsman's Lodge in Studio City as part of a 
community breakfast organized by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton gave a lay person's talk on earthquakes, explaining the movements of 
the Earth's plates, discussing various fault systems and describing how she 
does her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton's talk was attended by property owners, insurance experts and amateur 
earthquake researchers, all hanging on every word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of you are here to be reassured," Katz said before the talk. "The other 
half are convinced that afterwards you'll be more scared than you were before." 
</P>
<P>
 A few in the audience of about 300 people had theories about why earthquakes 
happen, pointing out that major quakes seem to occur close to sunrise or 
sunset, or during certain phases of the moon. Hutton dismissed those ideas 
because they only show statistical coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people learn too fast from just one instance," said Hutton, who was 
asked if the Northridge earthquake was as terrifying to her as is was to people 
in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, no, because I don't live in the San Fernando Valley," Hutton said. 
"Plus, the anxiety I had was to say the right thing to the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the back of the room was the owner of several apartment buildings 
who was considering buying the services of a Pasadena company that he said 
claimed to have a listing -- by address -- of the earthquake threat to 
properties for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring such knowledge -- at $200 a property -- seemed tempting to the man, 
who lost four buildings in Sherman Oaks during the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. But he was having second thoughts. He declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I really want to know that, to be honest," he said. But from 
what he learned from Hutton on Friday, he was skeptical of the company's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that it would be accurate enough to stand up in court," said 
Hutton, who explained to the group why earthquake prediction is not possible 
now. Some recent earthquakes -- including the Northridge temblor -- were 
generated by faults that had not been discovered or plotted out. 
</P>
<P>
 After the talk, about 20 people gathered to ask more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see the woman of earthquakes," said Nancy Gannon, who was worried 
about the fate of her one-story wood-frame house in Canoga Park. It survived 
the Northridge earthquake, but she feared she would lose it if the "Big One," a 
major quake on the San Andreas fault, were to hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would probably be OK," said Hutton, explaining that a San Andreas quake 
would probably not hit her home with much more force than the Northridge quake. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so much better," Gannon said. "Not tremendously, I still feel a little 
anxiety." ED BOND

FIRE FAILS TO HIDE THE EVIDENCE: HOT CARS 
</P>

<P>
 The three men ran from a garage where thick black smoke rose against the night 
sky and told the police passing by that everything was under control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before they could persuade them, however, two of the cars in the garage burst 
into flames. And here was the second bit of bad fortune for the two men: Enough 
of the cars was left to allow police to check them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the vehicles belonged to the men. They were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven men, including the owner of the auto repair shop and his mechanics, were 
arrested, police said Friday at Dependable Auto Hyundai Specialists repair shop 
at the 6000 block of Lankershim Boulevard. Three stolen cars were found in the 
garage, where they were being dismantled for parts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Uriel Terrazas Giron, 34, was arrested along with his brother, Alfonso 
Terrazas Giron, 31. Pedro S. Villanueva, 24; Jose G. Rojas, 22; Carlos H. Diaz, 
23; Benito F. Valencia, 24, and Eligio L. Rojas, 33, were also arrested in 
connection with the illegal chop shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, police said, started when sparks flew from a torch light and ignited 
a car's interior, said Graybill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew someone was doing it (stripping cars) in the area, but we didn't know 
who," Graybill said. "If it wasn't for the uniformed officers, we would never 
be able to catch these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said stolen cars were stored in the building next to Giron's repair 
shop and the parts were used to restore his customers' cars, said Graybill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pays someone a couple hundred dollars to steal cars and he doesn't have to 
pay thousands of dollars for the parts," Graybill said. "Then he charges his 
customers full price for them. He's making a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, other mechanics working in the same mall said they were surprised 
by the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys -- they were working very hard and I never suspected anything," said 
Miguel Campos, who works for an auto repair shop next door to Dependable Auto. 
"I never saw anything illegal."

HUSBAND GETS 11-YEAR TERM FOR KILLING WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man who claimed spousal abuse as the reason he killed his 
wife was sentenced Friday to 11 years in prison, the maximum term on his 
voluntary manslaughter conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz cited the brutality of the 
killing in her sentencing of Moosa Hanoukai for the March 29, 1993, bludgeoning 
of Manijeh Hanoukai. 
</P>
<P>
 Moosa Hanoukai, 55, claimed he attacked his 45-year-old wife after a 
quarter-century of emotional abuse boiled over. He said he lashed out in a 
blind rage, saying his wife had constantly berated him and forced him to sleep 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 His trial, which ended when a jury determined he acted in the heat of passion 
and was not guilty of murder, was dominated by his claim that he suffered from 
"Battered Husband Syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 Although disappointed by the stiff sentence, defense attorney James E. Blatt 
of Encino maintained that the voluntary manslaughter verdict was a "tremendous 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Moosa Hanoukai will be eligible for parole in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, there was testimony that his wife had been beaten more than 
50 times with a wrench and her corpse left to rot for five days in the garage 
of the couple's home. A half-dozen lengthy letters written by her relatives and 
submitted by prosecutors in a "victim impact statement," chronicled alleged 
improprieties made by Moosa Hanoukai in his native Iran and eulogized his wife 
as a caring woman who in no way abused her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid heavy security, the courtroom was packed with friends and relatives split 
between those who believe his story of emotional abuse and those who believe he 
senselessly killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sentencing hearing was a quiet affair, punctuated only by the emotion 
of Ebrahim Houshanian, Manijeh's 77-year-old father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only want you to visualize the scene . . . how she was struggling under 
this guy and there was no one there to save her," a hysterical Houshanian said 
to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stoltz passed judgment, she noted that Manijeh Hanoukai "must have suffered 
a great deal before her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beat her over and over again for an extensive period of time until he was 
exhausted," the judge said as she overlooked a defense plea to sentence Moosa 
Hanoukai either to probation or the minimum prison term of three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Delaram Hanoukai, the couple's daughter, said Stoltz's comments 
showed "the real truth, the real justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it will never bring my mother back," she said, describing pride for her 
mother and how much she will miss her on Friday, when Delaram graduates from 
USC as a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old said she continues to find herself in the bitter situation of 
grieving for her mother, but unable to seek vengeance against the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 While still expressing respect for her father, Delaram said he lied about his 
domestic life while he testified. Hanoukai was "definitely not" a battered 
husband, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't approve of what he did, but he is my father," she said. "I can't say 
that I love him, but he is my father." 
</P>
<P>
 The architect of the unique defense strategy which argued Hanoukai was 
emotionally abused -- and that this was exacerbated by his Persian Jewish 
heritage -- said the 11-year sentence may have been designed to send a message 
to those who rely on a psychological defense in a homicide case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Blatt went on to wonder if a wife who kills her husband would 
receive the same stiff sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're much more inclined to think this only happens to a woman," Blatt said, 
"and when it happens to a man perhaps we're much less understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said they may appeal Stoltz's sentencing decision.

COUNCIL DELAYS ACTION ON MANURE PICKUP; SANITATION: CITY DECIDES IT CAN'T START

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council was voting on zoning issues and awarding 
commendations to local citizens Friday when the discussion turned to a less 
savory topic: horse manure. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was raised by Councilman Joel Wachs, whose northeast San Fernando 
Valley district includes hundreds of horse owners who would like the city to 
provide curbside manure collection. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a few jokes and some other refuse-related discussions, sanitation 
officials concluded the city could not start a citywide manure pickup program 
until the council adopts a collection fee for the added refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs expressed some frustration because the city already provides free manure 
collection for about 600 horse owners throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is how can we treat all horse owners the same?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Sones, manager of the city's recycling and waste reduction division, 
explained that the 600 horse owners had been putting horse manure in bags and 
setting it on the curb for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city automated its trash-collection program in 1990, sanitation 
officials decided to provide the horse owners and other longtime customers with 
extra refuse containers, Sones said. The extra containers are collected at no 
extra charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sones said the council cannot extend the collection program throughout the 
city without instituting a fee to pay for manure pickup. With about 8,000 
registered horse owners in the city, he said a citywide collection program 
could cost about $60,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to impose a fee for residents requesting extra refuse containers is now 
making its way through the city's approval process. City officials could not 
estimate when the fee would be considered by the entire council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the Hollywood area, suggested 
that for the sake of fairness the city eliminate the collection program for the 
600 horse owners until a citywide program is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wachs asked that the entire topic be reviewed further by a council 
committee on waste and environmental quality before further action is taken. 
The rest of the council concurred.

WESTLAKE TO SHUT DOWN TRAUMA CENTER JUNE 30; EMERGENCIES: OFFICIALS SAY THE END 
OF THE 24-HOUR SERVICE WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE SURVIVAL RATES OF THE 
CRITICALLY INJURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village plans to close its trauma center 
June 30, eliminating the only 24-hour-a-day emergency surgical team in the 
immediate area.  
</P>
<P>
 But emergency-medical experts and county health officials said Friday the 
shutdown will have little or no effect on survival rates of those who are 
critically injured in the area, which straddles Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials could not be reached for comment, but a Los Angeles County 
health official confirmed that Westlake has notified the county it will drop 
out of the trauma network for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake will become the 11th hospital to leave the county's controversial 
trauma care system since its 1983 inception. Last year, the 13 hospitals still 
in the network treated 12,080 people with gunshot or other severe head, neck or 
chest wounds requiring immediate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center handled 3,105 trauma victims in 1993, 
more than any other hospital in the system. By contrast, Westlake treated 70, 
according to county figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Isbell, the county's assistant chief of emergency medical services, 
said there are a number of hospitals in the area with well-equipped emergency 
rooms, and she does not expect the loss of Westlake's trauma center to 
significantly endanger seriously injured patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel fairly confident that we'll be able to move those patients 
elsewhere," she said. "That's not to say we wouldn't like to keep the hospital 
in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients with extremely critical injuries, she said, could be airlifted to 
other nearby trauma units. In the San Fernando Valley, the closest trauma 
center is at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, about 25 miles. Ventura County 
has no trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Brodfuehrer, head of emergency medical services for Ventura County, 
agreed with Isbell's assessment, saying local hospitals could handle badly 
injured patients in their regular emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would guess it will have little or no effect on patients in Ventura 
County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marshall Morgan, director of emergency services at UCLA Medical Center, 
said that losing Westlake's trauma unit is likely to produce delays in getting 
some critical patients into surgery, but most would not be endangered by that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a trauma victim that needs to go straight to the operating room, 
there may be a 30- to 45-minute delay," he said. "In most cases, that's not a 
problem. But occasionally it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Brian Johnston, an emergency room physician at White Memorial Hospital in 
East Los Angeles, said Westlake's pullout will make little difference to the 
county's trauma network, which he said has already collapsed because so many 
other hospitals have departed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trauma system in Los Angeles has been nonfunctional and a non-system for 
a number of years," Johnston said. "The only reason it is reputedly maintained 
is the Board of Supervisors would find it politically embarrassing to 
officially allow it to disband." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, he said, a recent study concluded that even when the system was 
more complete, it did not significantly improve survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike regular emergency rooms, which may not have a surgeon on duty, trauma 
centers are required to have a surgeon and other specialists either on the 
premises or quickly available around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, trauma hospitals must keep one operating room empty at all times 
to receive badly injured patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Isbell said that paying to keep such specialists on call at all hours has 
proven an impossible burden for a number of hospitals that have closed trauma 
centers.

TAFT TEAM IS CHEERED LIKE A CHAMPION; EDUCATION: STUDENT BODY HONORS THE 
NATIONAL ACADEMIC DECATHLON WINNERS WITH A RALLY USUALLY RESERVED FOR ATHLETES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Academic Decathlon team at Taft High School has received all kinds of 
praise since it won the national title in New Jersey two weeks ago. There have 
been laudatory words on the U.S. Senate floor, commentaries by newspaper 
editorial writers and admiration from educators throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the team was honored again -- this time when fellow students at 
Taft honored them with the type of rally usually reserved for championship 
athletic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've achieved something extraordinary," said Arthur Berchin, the coach who 
led them to victory. "What better acknowledgment is there than the kind that 
comes from your peers?" 
</P>
<P>
 While the 2,700-member Taft student body cheered and the pep band, drill teams 
and school chorus roused the crowd, speakers talked about the importance of the 
achievement, given a demoralized school district and an underappreciated public 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "All 640,000 young people and 200,000 adults in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District . . . are feeling like champions because Taft has made us champions," 
said school board President Leticia Quezada. "To hear that the Taft team won 
the academic decathlon championship said to me -- and gave us all hope -- that 
if we continue to work hard and continue to fight against all odds, we will be 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
 The cheering students shared the dignitaries' enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft junior Gelareh Zargaraff, 16, said the title was an affirmation of her 
school's educational superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one school in the Valley, which people put down, and we've shown 
that we can win in the whole U.S.," she said. "Everyone knows about us now and 
it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The team -- Daniel Berdichevsky, 17; Chris Huie, 17; Michael Michrowski, 17; 
Sheldon Peregrino, 18; Rebecca Rissman, 17; Andrew Salter, 17; Kimberly 
Shapiro, 16; Stephen Shaw, 16, and Sage Vaughn, 17 -- thanked their peers for 
their support. "Victory is temporary," said Sage, while students in the 
grandstands chanted his name. "The best reward is your friends and the people 
you love and they've been there to keep me sane." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long haul for the Taft team. The group, eight of whom will leave 
for college in the fall, toiled hundreds of hours to first win a spot on the 
team, then take the LAUSD title, win the state finals in Stockton last month 
and, finally, be crowned national champions at the competition in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 And out of an estimated 30,000 students who competed this school year in their 
respective local, state and national competitions, the nine Taft teen-agers 
continuously garnered the highest scores in speech, math, fine arts, economics, 
science, literature, social studies, interview, essay writing and the oral 
Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
 At the national finals, Daniel won the top overall score and the group claimed 
more than half of the $30,000 in individual scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This came at a time when disappointing California Learning Assessment Scores 
were dogging the district and parents and legislators throughout the state 
renewed questions about the effectiveness of a public school education. 
</P>
<P>
 LAUSD Supt. Sid Thompson, speaking as much about the boon to his school 
district as about the Taft win, was the most succinct in his praise.  
</P>
<P>
 "How sweet it is," he told the crowd. "How sweet it is."

CITY TEMPORARILY WAIVES PERMIT FEES FOR EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than three months after a 6.8-magnitude quake ravaged homes and 
businesses, the Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to waive for 18 months 
the permit fees normally charged to rebuild the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the waiver is not expected to cost the city anything because the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency has agreed to reimburse the city for the lost fees, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners who have paid an estimated $1.7 million in fees for about 
15,000 permits issued so far by the city for quake repairs can be reimbursed by 
submitting a form available at all city Building and Safety Department offices, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the waiver, building owners must prove that the damage was 
caused by the Jan. 17 quake, said Walter Krukow, chief management analyst for 
the Building and Safety Department. The waiver will not extend to improvements, 
such as added rooms, made to quake-damaged buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already waived fees for permits needed to rebuild block walls and 
chimneys. In addition, it is providing free demolition of severely damaged 
structures and free cleanup of quake debris. FEMA is expected to reimburse the 
city for all such quake-related recovery programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to waive the fees was made by Los Angeles Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, who said she hopes the waiver will help ease the burden on property 
owners trying to rebuild after the quake.

ASTRONAUT HAS TROUBLE LAUNCHING HIS BUSINESS; RELOCATION: LANCASTER GAVE L. 
GORDON COOPER $300,000 TO MOVE PLANE MODIFICATION FIRM TO FOX FIELD. HE MAY BE 
EVICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 L. Gordon Cooper, who made history by orbiting Earth as a Mercury astronaut, 
is having trouble getting his airplane modification business off the ground in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's landlord at Fox Field in Lancaster has posted an eviction notice at 
the office building and hangar where Cooper hopes to refit twin-engine 
propeller planes with more powerful turbine engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster city officials are worried about the $300,000 they gave Cooper's 
company, Galaxy Group Inc., to encourage the firm to relocate to Lancaster from 
Van Nuys. The City Council will meet with its attorney behind closed doors 
Monday night to discuss legal options regarding the relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Cooper, a 67-year-old Encino resident, was still working out of his 
old offices near Van Nuys Airport, trying to raise more money for his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some delays in getting up there (to Lancaster)," he said in an 
interview. "In order to go at full speed, we needed to get a certain amount of 
financing in place. It's been very slow in coming in. That's caused us some 
delays in our timetable." 
</P>
<P>
 Before his company can begin installing the new turbine engines, the project 
must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The certification 
process has taken longer and required more money than expected, the former 
astronaut said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said he must raise another $1 million from investors to complete the 
certification process and begin production work in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he acknowledged that his company has had trouble making rent 
payments on its Lancaster hangar and offices, which the firm has rarely used. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord's eviction notice triggered alarm at Lancaster City Hall. City 
officials fear that without the buildings at Fox Field, Cooper's company will 
not be able to live up to the terms of its relocation agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal doesn't allow him to be evicted," said Steven H. Dukett, the city's 
redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, the city's redevelopment agency agreed to give $300,000 to 
Cooper's company, providing he moved it to Lancaster and offered 25 local jobs 
for at least five years. The city also expected to reap sales tax revenue when 
the firm sold its costly aircraft engines locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper predicted that his firm would retrofit three planes per month, at a 
cost of about $700,000 per plane. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the relocation money, Galaxy Group gave a 17% stake in the 
company to the foundation that supports the Lancaster Performing Arts Center. 
At the time, city officials said this stake was worth as much as $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the deal was approved, the city of Lancaster hired an aviation 
consultant, who gave Galaxy a favorable review, Dukett said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Galaxy's anticipated move was announced, Lancaster officials hailed the 
relocation agreement as the launch of a business incentive program aimed at 
luring new industrial employers to town. Now, the Galaxy project's future is 
uncertain. "The eternal optimist within me is certainly hopeful that the 
project will be able to go forth," Dukett said. "But I don't know whether it 
will or not." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little premature to know exactly what we can and can't do," Mayor 
Frank Roberts said Friday. "Obviously the city is very anxious to protect its 
interests and its investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said it has been tough attracting investors to aviation projects, 
partly because of the potential for costly lawsuits if an accident occurs. 
Nevertheless, he said Friday that his company is "pretty optimistic about 
getting some investment in." 
</P>
<P>
 The former astronaut said he hopes Lancaster officials will give him more 
time. "I think they need to have a little patience," Cooper said. "We're doing 
the best we can."

 EASTERN ORTHODOX: Thousands of Eastern Orthodox Christians will go to church 
tonight in the San Fernando Valley area to begin midnight observances of 
Easter, or "Pascha," as it is known in congregations with roots in Greece, the 
Slavic countries and the Eastern Mediterranean lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, which observed Easter April 3 this 
year, calculate differently the date for the holiday celebrating the biblical 
accounts of Jesus' resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 Orthodox Christians traditionally begin the service with a candlelight 
procession around their churches, then go into the church for liturgies that 
often last until 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A fellowship meal follows at many churches; some congregations celebrate an 
additional Pascha service in the late morning or early afternoon.

the 7:30 p.m. program at the Shepherd of the Hills Church, 19700 Rinaldi St., 
Porter Ranch. Associate Pastor Patrick Moody will emcee. 
</P>
<P>

RELIGION / JOHN DART; RELIGIOUS RIGHT OFTEN DOMINATE ANNUAL VALLEY PRAYER 
BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Day of Prayer, held the first Thursday in May, is mostly a 
conservative evangelical affair around the country, especially the annual San 
Fernando Valley Prayer Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 But an ex-Californian who chairs the sponsoring National Prayer Committee says 
the observance is not intended to be dominated by the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not seek to make the Day of Prayer in any sense political toward a 
particular persuasion," said Dick Eastman, whose Every Home for Christ 
missionary organization moved from Chatsworth to Colorado Springs in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually instruct people to use caution to not make it a political 
pulpit," Eastman said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, because local gatherings are autonomous observances organized by 
volunteers, they are free to pick the themes and speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21st annual Valley Prayer Breakfast at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio 
City has featured such vocal conservatives as Patrick Buchanan and Jerry 
Falwell. This year, the two speakers -- singer Gianna Jessen and lawyer Brad W. 
Dacus of the Rutherford Institute -- are involved with antiabortion issues. 
Matt Fong, Republican aspirant for the state treasurer's job, will read 
Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be commenting on the political aspects of our nation today that are 
disturbing and in need of prayer and political action, which I would call good 
citizenship . . . " said Gerald Christian Nordskog of North Hills, the 
breakfast chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our nation and civilization is crumbling and the L.A. and San Fernando Valley 
areas are evidence of the moral decline in many aspects," said Nordskog, who 
has organized all 21 prayer breakfasts in the Valley. This the last for 
Nordskog, who has moved his businesses to the Ventura area. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious and ideological flavor of prayer breakfasts vary from region to 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a prayer breakfast at the Crescenta Valley High School cafeteria 
Thursday has primarily a community flavor, said Sharon Beauchamp of the 
Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce. The event will feature a talk by John 
Goffredo, the school's basketball coach, and a minister from the Unity Church 
of the Valley will lead prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster Mayor's Prayer Breakfast at the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds, 
organized by business and professional people, will feature Tim Philibosian of 
Aurora, Colo., president of an organization that defends the Christian world 
view, according to a breakfast spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman, who became the National Prayer Committee chairman in 1989, said the 
official all-day observances Thursday on Washington's Capitol Hill will involve 
both liberals and conservatives whose common denominator is faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
 Days of prayer have been proclaimed intermittently in the country's past, but 
the practice was revived by President Dwight Eisenhower as an annual 
observance. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1970s and early 1980s, a group of evangelicals began promoting the 
day as an opportunity to spotlight conservative Judeo-Christian perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the National Prayer Committee, a private, non-governmental group then 
chaired by Vonette Bright, wife of Campus Crusade for Christ's Bill Bright, 
began "spiritual lobbying" of Congress for a fixed date for the National Day of 
Prayer, according to Eastman. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Eastman, Vonette Bright and Shirley Dobson, who heads the task 
force that deals directly with National Day of Prayer activities, are all 
associated with ministries that have moved out of Southern California in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brights moved Campus Crusade from San Bernardino to Orlando, Fla. Shirley 
Dobson is the wife of author-radio psychologist James Dobson, who relocated his 
Focus on the Family ministries from Pomona to Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman and his wife, Dee, who lived in Valencia for 15 years, had more than 
70 staff members at their Chatsworth offices when they decided in 1990 to join 
a burgeoning number of evangelical organizations relocating to Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 That move was cited by Eastman as an unusual example of the power of prayer.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Eastman said his Chatsworth office was sold in early 1991 in the 
kind of coincidence that often strengthens the confidence of believers in 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Eastman related in his recently published book, "The Jericho Hour, the 
Church's Final Offensive," the ministry had had no offer on its building for 
the many months it was listed for sale. One day in February, 1991, a person 
participating in the ministry's monthly day of prayer accurately foretold that 
a buyer was headed their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Voicing her prayers aloud, the unnamed person first addressed God, then a 
buyer, describing a would-be purchaser driving in the area. Next, she startled 
the group by saying: "I command you to come forth now. Not tomorrow, not next 
week, not next month, but today." 
</P>
<P>
 In an awkward period that followed, Eastman said, a staff member left the 
room, but re-entered moments later and tapped Eastman on the shoulder. The 
staffer said that an older man with his daughter had been looking for available 
buildings when he saw the 'for sale' sign. The man, who wanted to expand his 
business, made an offer and it was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say that such things are coincidences," Eastman said, after 
relating the story to a recent Christian seminar. "But all I know is that the 
more I pray, the more wonderful 'coincidences' seem to happen."

TEAMSTERS LEADER CAREY FACED WITH NEW PRESSURES; LABOR: TENTATIVE FOUR-YEAR 
CONTRACT HAMMERED OUT WITH TRUCKING COMPANIES DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH RIVALS 
INSIDE HIS UNION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamsters President Ron Carey, already battered by criticism from rivals 
inside the union, is coming under further pressure due to frustrations over a 
tentative four-year contract his negotiators crafted this week with major 
trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carey, the growing difficulties could undermine what had been his rising 
influence in the labor movement. Likewise, his union, which has lost half a 
million members since the late 1970s, could see its power dwindle even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning the presidency of the Teamsters in 1991 on a pledge to clean up 
the corruption-plagued union, the 58-year-old Carey has styled himself as a 
strong new voice for the downtrodden American worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with restoring his union's ties to the Democratic Party, Carey has used 
his role as the head of the nation's second-largest and most diverse union as a 
pulpit. He emerged as one of the labor movement's major voices for such causes 
as legislation barring the permanent replacement of striking workers and, in an 
unsuccessful lobbying effort, against the North American Freed Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Carey portrayed the newly negotiated freight contract as having 
far-reaching consequences. "We drew the line -- not just for Teamster members, 
but for all American workers," he said. "We said to the companies, 'You're not 
going to destroy more full-time jobs in this country.' And we made that stick." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's vocal opponents in the union signaled, however, that he will face a 
firestorm of criticism over the proposed contract agreed to Thursday night by 
Teamsters and trucking company negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 delegates from union locals nationwide voted Friday to suspend 
the 3 1/2-week trucking strike as of 11 p.m. Friday, clearing the way for more 
than 70,000 drivers and dockworkers to return to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a snub of Carey's leadership, the local delegates refused to endorse 
the contract, instead simply passing it along for a membership vote without 
taking an official position on whether it should be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics accused Carey and his negotiators of caving in to management, he 
attributed the uproar to "political games" by his opponents and declared the 
contract a major victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey boasted that the agreement would prevent companies from replacing 
full-time workers with a new category of lower-paid part-timers. But observers 
noted that the pact would allow greater use of another type of contingent 
employee paid less than the standard Teamsters wage of $17 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Those employees, known as "casual workers," are brought in intermittently by 
employers to help out on loading docks and work anywhere from four to eight 
hours a day.  
</P>
<P>
 The casual workers' pay, at $14.45 an hour, is far higher than the $8 to $10 
an hour that was proposed by management for the part-timers, and many casual 
workers receive benefits. Still, "the distinction between a casual worker and a 
part-time worker escapes me," said Matthew Tallmer, editor of the 
Washington-based newsletter Labor Trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carey may face serious, serious problems within the union because of this 
contract," Tallmer added. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went out on strike primarily on the issue of part-timers, and they might 
try to sell this contact on the basis of not giving in on the part-timers, but 
the distinction between part-timers and casuals is semantic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a victory," said Chuck Mack, president of the Teamsters Joint 
Council for the San Francisco Bay Area. "This is a concessionary agreement with 
a lot of pain associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mack said, members are likely to approve the pact because they are 
worried that if it is defeated, the union's negotiators "could come back with 
something worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also faulted Carey's negotiators for giving up the right to strike 
over grievances and for allowing more freight to be shipped by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Trucking Management Inc., representing most of the 22 companies struck by 
the Teamsters, acknowledged the unfavorable reaction of "certain local unions." 
Still, a TMI news release said that "we know that we negotiated a fair and 
reasonable agreement, and we are confident that when the employees review it 
they will ratify it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carey won't have to face a reelection battle anytime soon -- his term 
runs into 1996 -- he could suffer if his popularity keeps falling. For 
instance, last month a dues increase he proposed to shore up the union's nearly 
depleted strike fund was voted down by more than 90% of the membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Carey has delayed one of his major initiatives: his bid to 
dismantle the union's four major regional offices, run by officials tied to the 
Teamsters' old-guard leadership and which Carey has branded "fertile grounds 
for corruption and mob influence." Three times he has delayed an executive 
board meeting to decide on the issue, and he suggested it will be put off until 
the freight contract is officially settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Carey headache has come from recently published reports raising 
questions about where, after years as a modestly paid union local official in 
Queens, New York, he found the money to invest in expensive beachfront property 
in Florida. Union in Decline 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters membership has fallen sharply since deregulation of the trucking 
industry began in 1980, even though the share of U.S. transportation handled by 
trucking companies has remained relatively stable. The problem for the 
Teamsters is that nonunion trucking companies have taken market share from the 
unionized firms.

FED STEPS IN TO BOLSTER DOLLAR; STOCKS GAIN, BUT BONDS WEAKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The battered dollar plunged toward its post-World War II low against the 
Japanese yen Friday before the federal government unexpectedly intervened and 
carried the greenback to a small gain by the end of the day. But the dollar 
still fell against major European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stocks closed mostly higher, helped by the government's 
intervention in currency markets and Ford Motor Co.'s strong quarterly earnings 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 However, concern about the dollar helped drive Treasury bond yields up, as 
some traders worried that a weak U.S. currency would lead to greater inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's decision to buy dollars, announced in a 
brief statement by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, marks the first time since 
August that the government has intervened to prop up the dollar against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, which had been threatening to fall below 100 Japanese yen for the 
first time, closed in New York at 101.50 yen Friday, up 0.15 yen for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 It had fallen to 100.65 yen earlier in the day, just above a postwar low of 
100.35 set in August. A week ago, the greenback was at 103.26 yen, and it began 
the year at 111.85. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar had been pushed lower Thursday after the government reported 
slower-than-expected first-quarter economic growth. A weak economy generally 
leads to a weaker currency, in part because slow growth usually means lower 
interest rates, which make a nation's bonds less attractive to foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, however, short- and long-term U.S. interest rates have been 
rising, not falling. Yet that has failed to bolster the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the currency's weakness has been exacerbated by the selloff 
in stock and bond markets this year, leading both foreign and domestic 
investors to question the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Treasury's decision to intervene Friday, via the Fed, was aimed in 
part at calming investors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Treasury wanted to show investors that it's still safe to invest in U.S. 
stocks and bonds," said Ezra Zask, head of Ezra Zask Associates, a hedge fund 
in Norfolk, Conn.  
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said the decision to halt the dollar's decline signaled a 
change in the Clinton Administration's trade policy toward Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, the Administration has allowed the dollar to decline versus 
the yen to make U.S. exports cheaper in Japan and Japanese exports more 
expensive here, an effort to force open Japan's markets and shrink its trade 
surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dollar poised to fall below 100 yen, however, the psychological 
impact on U.S. investors and on Japan may have been judged too extreme by the 
White House, some experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Fed buys dollars for yen again, the market will get the message that 
the Administration isn't being as tough on Japan," said Earl Johnson, foreign 
exchange adviser at Harris Trust & Savings. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the Fed's intervention failed to stop the dollar's fall against 
the German mark Friday. The greenback closed at 1.654 marks in New York, down 
from Thursday's 1.663. At the start of the year, a dollar bought 1.738 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed broke the dollar's free fall, that's all," said David De Rosa, trader 
at Swiss Bank Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said today that the Bank of Japan will 
step up efforts to boost the dollar against the yen. The bank will buy about $3 
billion in the market a day, compared to $1 billion currently, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. stock market, meanwhile, appeared to take heart from the government's 
support for the dollar. The Dow Jones industrials added 13.38 points to 
3,681.69 on Friday, and broader market indexes generally posted bigger gains. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Big Board, winners topped losers by 13 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a market that is trying to stabilize," said Jonathan Dodd, analyst at 
Dean Witter. The Dow rose 33.01 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks' gains Friday were all the more remarkable given another bad day in the 
bond market. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which had shot 
from 7.10% to 7.26% on Thursday, rose Friday to 7.30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market had been spooked Thursday when the government reported that a 
key measure of inflation had risen in the first quarter, even as the economy 
slowed. Rising inflation causes bond investors to demand higher yields to 
compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 The weak dollar added fuel to the fire on Thursday and Friday, because a 
falling currency raises the risk of more inflation by boosting prices of 
imported goods. Strength in gold, oil, lumber and other commodities also hurt 
bonds. The Commodity Research Bureau's price index rose nearly 1% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's stock highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford Motor's healthy earnings report boosted its shares and helped sentiment 
toward other industrial shares. Ford gained 7/8 to 58 3/8, Illinois Tool Works 
added 1 to 41 3/8, ITT jumped 1 3/8 to 89 3/4, Scott Paper surged 1 5/8 to 42 
7/8 and machine tool builder Acme Cleveland leaped 2 7/8 to 15 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation issues also jumped on reports of a tentative settlement in 
the Teamsters strike and renewed interest in airlines. Consolidated Freightways 
rose 1 1/4 to 27 1/2, Union Pacific gained 1 1/8 to 59 and Delta Air Lines 
soared 2 1/4 to 47 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other strong stock groups included electric utilities, retailers and 
golf-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index ended the week at 3,125.3, off 4.6 points. 
Frankfurt's DAX index eased 5.24 points to 2,245.98. Mexico City's Bolsa index 
fell 27.13 points to 2,294.1. The Tokyo market was closed for a holiday.

Q & A; WHAT EFFECT THE WEAK DOLLAR HAS ON AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar's recent fall against the Japanese yen could affect everything from 
what you pay for goods to what you earn at work. Here are some answers to 
questions about the dollar's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q So what does all this mean to me, the U.S. consumer? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A As the dollar falls, it means you have to bring more money with you when you 
travel overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means you might see prices of foreign goods go up, if manufacturers 
are worried about falling profits. Already this year, Japanese car prices have 
risen far more quickly than those of Detroit's auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a benefit from a falling dollar, if you own overseas stocks and 
bonds. When foreign currencies rise, your overseas investments translate into 
more dollars. And if you work for a company with foreign operations, the 
company will generate more profits from abroad, fueling profit-sharing plans 
and even pay raises for workers at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How long has the dollar been falling? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A The dollar has been in a general decline since early 1985, when it was at 
the 260-yen level. At that time, the major industrial nations agreed to lower 
the value of the dollar to help correct the U.S. trade deficit, especially with 
Japan. A weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper and more competitive on 
world markets, and the move was supposed to help cut the trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q So the dollar is dropping solely because of the trade conflict? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Trade is just one factor. The dollar also fell because the U.S. economy 
weakened more quickly in the late-1980s recession than other countries' did, 
and interest rates here fell more steeply and stayed lower than our trading 
partners' rates. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, U.S. stocks and bonds have been declining, scaring off foreign 
investors. As they liquidate American stocks and bonds, they will also sell off 
the proceeds -- dollars -- in order to buy other currencies to invest in other 
countries. Big institutional investors, so-called hedge funds, have been known 
to be selling the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Is the U.S. government comfortable with how the markets are reacting and the 
dollar's recent fall? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Apparently not. On Friday, as the dollar dropped toward that postwar low of 
100.40 yen, the Federal Reserve Board stepped in and bought dollars for German 
marks and Japanese yen. It made its presence known, and the currency market 
reacted by pushing the battered dollar back up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Why did the government intervene? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States wants to promote 
currency stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say Washington might be fearful that a further fall in the dollar 
would scare off foreign investors and hurt the stock and bond markets even 
more.

STOCKS, BOND YIELDS RISE AS FED STEPS IN TO STOP DOLLAR'S FALL

 The battered dollar plunged toward its post-World War II low against the 
Japanese yen Friday before the Federal Reserve Board unexpectedly intervened 
and carried the greenback to a small gain by the end of the day. But the dollar 
still fell against major European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stocks rebounded after the Fed's intervention in the currency 
markets and better-than-expected earnings were reported by Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the falling dollar drove Treasury bond yields higher amid concern 
that a weak U.S. currency would lead to inflation, thus eroding the value of 
fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's action, announced in a brief statement from Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, marks the first time the central bank has intervened to prop up the 
dollar against the Japanese yen since August. 
</P>
<P>
 After ending mixed in Europe, the dollar fell sharply in early domestic 
trading on what market analysts said was carry-over from Thursday's dip on 
lower-than-expected figures for U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury bond market selloff Thursday may also have contributed to the 
dollar's weakness, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Data showing economic growth generally supports the dollar because it tends to 
make dollar-denominated investments more attractive and thus brings capital 
into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent declines in American stock and bond markets have overshadowed 
evidence of economic strength and have hurt the U.S. currency, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, which had been threatening to fall below 100 Japanese yen for the 
first time, bounded higher on the Fed's move. The dollar closed in New York at 
101.50 yen, up 0.15 after having fallen to 100.65 earlier in the day, just 
above a post-World War II low of 100.35 yen set in August. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the greenback closed lower against the German mark, ending at 1.654 
marks, down from Thursday's 1.663. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts questioned how long the rally would last and said further action may 
be needed to prop up the currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed broke the dollar's free fall, that's all," said David De Rosa, 
director of foreign exchange trading at Swiss Bank Corp. "People are still 
eager to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed probably bought dollars to calm the stock and bond markets, traders 
said. Bonds plunged Thursday amid concern that the weak dollar would cheapen 
U.S. assets and exacerbate inflation by making imports more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Treasury wanted to show investors that it's still safe to invest in U.S. 
stocks and bonds," said Ezra Zask, president of Ezra Zask Associates, a hedge 
fund in Norfolk, Conn., with $180 million under its management. "They want the 
dollar stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.38 to 3,681.69, 
adding 33.01 for the week. In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 293.98 
million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds swung widely throughout Friday's session. After a drop of nearly two 
points Thursday, the price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was trading down 
almost another point Friday when Bentsen announced the government's 
intervention in the currency market. Yields then recovered somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yield ended the week at 7.30%, up from 
7.26% the day before. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 
7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the currency pressure, the bond market has been weakened by 
heavy supply. Demand was light for $28 billion in new two- and five-year notes 
issued earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals and small-portfolio bondholders led the early-morning selloff, 
after Thursday's retreat by large investors, which had been spurred by data on 
the nation's gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks surprised some analysts by outperforming bonds for the first time in 
many sessions. Friday's performance indicates there is fundamental strength 
underlying the equities market, said Alfred Goldman, vice president at A.G. 
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If stocks were really vulnerable, the bond selloff would have given us an 
excuse to take it down further," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation issues rose as reports of a tentative settlement in the 
Teamsters strike pushed trucking company shares higher. Consolidated 
Freightways rose 1 1/4 to 27 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transports were also supported by airline stocks, including Delta, which 
extended Thursday's gains after saying it will lay off about 20% of its staff. 
Delta rose 2 1/4 to 47 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones transportation index rose 24.50, or 1.5%, to 1,660.13. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market was able to turn its focus away from rising interest rates 
and to good earnings reports. Ford Motor rose 7/8 to 58 3/8 after reporting 
sharply higher earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scientific-Atlanta jumped 4 3/8 to 33 1/2 after reporting strong 
first-quarter earnings late Thursday that prompted Goldman Sachs to upgrade its 
rating on the stock. 
</P>

FORD TO PROPOSE COMPROMISE ON POLLUTION-FREE VEHICLE MANDATE; ENVIRONMENT: THE 
AUTO MAKER SAYS IT WILL TEST ELECTRIC FLEETS IF THE STATE EASES ITS QUOTA FOR 
THE SALE OF ZERO-EMISSION CARS IN 1998. 
</P>

 Hoping to win a relaxation of California's 1998 zero-emission vehicle mandate, 
Ford Motor Co. will offer to put electric demonstration fleets on the road and 
sell partially built cars to electric-car conversion companies, the auto maker 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will be made to the California Air Resources Board on May 12, 
when the agency begins a two-day review of its zero-emissions regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is considered crucial because auto makers must make production 
plans this year for the 1998 model year. Unless the ARB rolls back its 
requirement, 2% of the vehicles offered for sale in California by major auto 
makers will have to be non-polluting that year. Only electric vehicles now meet 
that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Ford reported first-quarter earnings Friday of $904 million, or 
$1.66 a share -- its best three-month profit in nearly five years -- as sales 
surged at home and a recovery began in Europe. A year ago in the first quarter, 
the company earned $572 million, or $1.02 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiterating the big car makers' stance, Peter Pestillo, executive vice 
president of corporate affairs, said Ford does not believe that affordable 
electric vehicles with an adequate traveling range can be produced in volume by 
the state's 1998 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not opposed to electric vehicles," Pestillo said in an interview 
Friday. "We want to find a way to do them intelligently and not chill the idea 
with an inferior product." 
</P>
<P>
 By setting up demonstration projects, Ford said, it hopes to put a large 
number of fleet vehicles on the road from which it can gather important data 
for the retail market. It said it is discussing such projects with several 
electric utilities, United Parcel Service, Federal Express and the U.S. Postal 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said it is also willing to sell "gliders" to conversion companies. 
Gliders are cars missing the powertrain and fuel system. Their availability 
would make conversion easier and cheaper, since converters now must buy 
vehicles in the retail market, remove the internal combustion engine and 
replace it with an electric powertrain. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pestillo said significant warranty issues would have to be resolved 
before gliders could be sold. One concern is safety, because putting a 
different powertrain in a chassis changes its crashworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is hoping its offer will provide a political solution to a sticky issue. 
The resource board, for instance, could uphold the mandate but reduce the 
number of electric vehicles auto makers must build by 1998. That could be 
accomplished by providing extra credits for building demonstration fleets or 
selling gliders. 
</P>
<P>
 ARB spokesman Bill Sessa declined to comment on the Ford proposal. But he said 
auto makers can already gain emissions credits through production agreements 
with converters and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest concern for the auto makers is batteries; viable ones, they argue, 
won't be available until at least 2000. The ARB staff, however, believes better 
batteries will be available by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's 58% increase in net profit came despite a $440-million charge related 
to the sale of First Nationwide Bank. The troubled San Francisco-based thrift 
was sold two weeks ago to First Madison Bank for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's first-quarter earnings tracked close to those of its U.S. 
competitors. Chrysler Corp. earned $938 million and General Motors Co. netted 
$854 million. The Big Three's collective $2.8-billion profit is the most since 
the second quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings results were in line with Wall Street expectations. Ford shares 
gained 87.5 cents Friday to close at $58.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Treasurer David McCammon said profits have been driven by a sales wave, 
itself powered by pent-up demand and growing confidence in the economy. He 
projected that sales will continue to grow in both the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "In baseball terms, we are in the first inning of European growth and in the 
third or fourth inning of U.S. growth," McCammon said.

COMMUNITY CHEST FOR THE CREDIT-STARVED; FINANCE: A CONSORTIUM OF 52 BANKS WILL 
ESTABLISH A $100-MILLION DEVELOPMENT FUND TO MAKE LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what is believed to be the largest effort of its kind, a consortium of 52 
California banks has agreed to establish a $100-million community development 
fund to make loans to small businesses that have been unable to get credit 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Economic Development Lending Initiative, or CEDLI, is intended 
to address one of the nagging problems of small businesses statewide: the lack 
of readily available capital, particularly for companies with limited cash flow 
or equity. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's member banks -- including such giants as Bank of America, 
Wells Fargo and First Interstate -- agreed Thursday to go forward with 
implementation of the project, which has been in the planning stages since 
September, the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the state slowly lifts itself from a long recession, this lending 
partnership will arrive at a crucial time by helping to expand small business 
and community economic development and create more jobs," said Robert T. Parry, 
president of the San Francisco Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the project hope to begin accepting applications in early 1995. 
The goal for the first year is to make 175 loans, said Jerry Bowman, a Los 
Angeles-based Bank of America executive vice president and vice chairman of 
CEDLI. 
</P>
<P>
 CEDLI is modeled on a similar program that has been making loans to 
rehabilitate low-income housing. "It's the largest program of this type ever 
created . . . " said W. Gordon Smith, a vice president with the Fed in San 
Francisco. "And the complexity of this is also unprecedented."  
</P>
<P>
 There have been other efforts to develop so-called multi-bank community 
development corporations, or CDCs, in the past, particularly in the wake of the 
Los Angeles riots. Most have been capitalized at between $1 million and $5 
million, Smith said. In Los Angeles, banks funded a $10-million Southern 
California Business Development Corp. after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some of CEDLI's programs will be targeted at minority businesses and 
inner-city or impoverished communities, its overall goal is broader: boosting 
the entire state's lackluster economy, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the announcement of the program came on the eve of the second 
anniversary of the riots, that unrest had nothing to do with the project's 
inception, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from its size, CEDLI will be distinctive in the types of programs it 
offers. "We hope to . . . take the $100-million loan pool and leverage it into 
$300 million to $400 million in credit availability," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be four major initiatives: 
</P>
<P>
 * Co-lending. Participating banks will bring CEDLI their marginal loan 
applicants -- those who don't qualify under normal credit criteria. The bank 
will finance half the loan, and CEDLI will put up money for the other half 
under more favorable terms and with longer payout periods. The program reduces 
the risk to the bank and allows the applicant to get a larger loan than 
otherwise possible. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing the program will not do is lend money to would-be entrepreneurs for 
start-up companies. "That would be venture capital, and that's something 
entirely different," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loans to lenders. CEDLI will lend money to other community development 
corporations or nonprofit organizations, enabling them to make more loans 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loan purchase program. CEDLI will buy loans held by such community groups, 
again freeing them to make further loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct lending. CEDLI will lend to community organizations such as 
child-care centers, churches and food banks that don't have access to 
traditional bank credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is the brainchild of Parry and John Trauth, executive director of 
the San Francisco-based Development Fund, a nonprofit group that has worked on 
affordable-housing issues. Richard Hartnack, vice chairman of San 
Francisco-based Union Bank, chairs the task force developing CEDLI. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks will kick in various amounts, depending mainly on their size. The 
largest chunk, $30 million, will come from Bank of America. In addition to the 
$100-million loan pool, CEDLI has been capitalized at $10 million in the form 
of foundation grants and other money. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is modeled in part on the California Community Reinvestment Corp., 
a $225-million loan pool to finance affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 James Johnson, outgoing director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Urban 
Poverty, viewed the announcement with skepticism, noting that other lending 
programs have yet to produce substantial economic development in impoverished 
communities such as the riot-affected parts of Los Angeles.

TACO BELL ERASES FT. WORTH FROM ITS LIST OF NEW HEADQUARTERS; BUSINESS: ONLY 
ONE SITE IN TEXAS REMAINS A CONTENDER. THE COMPANY HAS MISSED THREE 
SELF-IMPOSED DEADLINES FOR A FINAL DECISION. 
</P>

 Taco Bell Corp. moved a bit closer Friday to deciding where to put its new 
headquarters, ruling out downtown Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 But that only added to the frustration among business leaders over the 
continuing delay of the fast-food company's long-awaited announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas and Dallas-area officials and business leaders have been competing with 
their counterparts in California and Orange County to garner Taco Bell's 
headquarters. With 1,000 employees and full-time contract workers at its 
corporate offices in Irvine and plans to expand, the company is looking for a 
bigger building. 
</P>
<P>
 The headquarters fight has become a symbol of California's efforts to show 
that it is becoming a more business-friendly state and is stemming its eroding 
corporate tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taco Bell has missed three self-imposed deadlines to announce a new site, 
and both Texas and local business leaders and officials are wondering how 
indecisive management is. "The lid's going to come off real fast if Taco Bell 
doesn't do something fast," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell notified Ft. Worth officials and business leaders this week that it 
would not move to a four- to five-block site north of the Bass family's City 
Center complex, Bill Thornton, a Ft. Worth Chamber of Commerce executive, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed that we lost them because we thought they were a real 
natural fit for our community," said Thornton, the chamber's vice president for 
economic development. The location previously was not thought to be high on the 
company's list of possible sites anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides rejecting downtown Ft. Worth, Taco Bell has eliminated downtown Dallas 
and H. Ross Perot Jr.'s Circle T Ranch outside Ft. Worth as possible sites, 
said Texas and Dallas leaders. But a spokesman for Perot's company said it has 
not received any notice that Circle T has been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in Orange County, Taco Bell has reconsidered locations in the past 
month that it had previously rejected. One proposed project that has gone on 
the roller coaster ride, sources said, is the idea for a campus-like 
headquarters next to UC Irvine in the university's planned $150-million 
corporate and residential park. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Texas site that clearly remains on Taco Bell's list is the Legacy 
business park in the North Dallas suburb of Plano, where sister company 
Frito-Lay Inc. is based. Both are owned by PepsiCo Inc. in Purchase, N.Y.

 OPEC's Subroto Sees Coal Use Overtaking Oil: Crude oil's share of the global 
energy mix is declining steadily, and coal will probably overtake it as the 
world's top energy source by 2020, the secretary general of the cartel told an 
energy conference in Dallas. "This is a bitter pill for us in OPEC to swallow, 
as a grouping of 12 Third World oil-producing nations, most of which have 
single-product economies . . . ," he said Thursday.Subroto said oil accounted 
for 41% of the world's fuels in 1992 and is expected to fall to 39% by 2000 and 
36% by 2010, while coal demand keeps rising. By 2020, coal is expected to grow 
to about 34% of the world energy market while oil shrinks to about 33%, he 
said.

 Consumer Confidence Gain Reported: The University of Michigan's consumer 
sentiment index rose in April to 92.6 from the 91.5 reading in March, according 
to professional money managers who have seen the data.The managers spoke on 
condition of anonymity because the survey is made available only to paying 
subscribers. The index is a composite of how consumers feel about current and 
future economic conditions. It is considered by some economists to be a useful 
tool for gauging consumer willingness to borrow and spend. The university's 
reading on current conditions for April rose to 108.1 from 101.4 in March, the 
sources said. The index for consumer expectations about the future was said to 
have fallen to 82.6 from 85.1.

L.A. TIMES CIRCULATION UP IN 2 AREAS; OVERALL FIGURE DROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times continued to post circulation gains in the key 
competitive markets of Orange County, the San Fernando Valley and Ventura 
County, while the newspaper's total circulation declined slightly as expected, 
newly released figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures filed with the Audit Bureau of Circulations for the six 
months ended March 31, Times daily circulation in Orange County grew by 5,849 
copies, or 3%, to 203,975, compared to the same period a year ago. Sunday 
circulation grew by 6,068 copies, or 2.1%, to 297,391. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily circulation for the combined San Fernando Valley/Ventura County Edition 
increased by 100 copies, or 0.4%, to 233,415, compared to the same period a 
year ago. Sunday circulation grew by 3,536 copies, or 1.1%, to 339,722, 
according to Times records. 
</P>
<P>
 Total daily circulation for The Times, the largest newspaper in the West and 
the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily, declined by 33,702, or 3%, to 
1,104,651. Sunday circulation declined by 19,077, or 1.3%, to 1,502,120. The 
declines are largely the result of planned strategic cutbacks in unprofitable 
circulation outside the newspaper's core market and of soft street sales that 
have affected newspapers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Times' competitive position in its key markets has never been stronger," 
said Richard T. Schlosberg III, Times publisher and chief executive. "These 
latest numbers underscore the value of our paper to readers as well as the 
success of our strategy to concentrate resources in our core market." 
</P>
<P>
 Times circulation gains outpaced the Orange County Register's performance 
during the reporting period. In Orange County, the Register posted weekday 
circulation gains of 1,030 copies, or 0.3%, to 323,829, compared to the same 
six-month period a year ago. Its Sunday circulation grew by 1,395, or 0.4%, to 
374,720. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily circulation for the Los Angeles Daily News in its primary market area 
declined 3,079 copies, or 1.7%, to 183,058, compared to the comparable period a 
year ago. Sunday circulation fell 7,870 copies, or 3.7%, to 202,294. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has posted significant circulation gains in its key regional markets 
since 1989 as a result of more aggressive marketing, expanded local and 
regional coverage and the newspaper's cable-system-specific TV Times magazine 
that is included in the Sunday paper across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Times circulation in Orange County has increased 22.4% weekdays 
and 42.6% on Sunday; circulation in the combined San Fernando Valley/Ventura 
County area has grown 12.4% daily and 23.2% on Sunday.

 Mortgage Rates Dip: Mortgage rates, seesawing recently, declined this week 
after rising the week before.Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.32%, 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said, down from last week's 8.49% but 
higher than the 8.26% rate two weeks ago. The current rate is about 1 1/2 
percentage points above the 25-year low of 6.74% last October. On one-year, 
adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 
5.15%, up from 5.06% last week. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for 
those refinancing mortgages, averaged 7.85% this week, down from 7.97% a week 
earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

 Commodore International Ltd. Folds: The company, a pioneer in the personal 
computer industry, said it is going out of business.The West Chester, Pa., firm 
plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees "for the benefit of its 
creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Ltd., in 
voluntary liquidation. "This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary 
liquidation of both companies," Commodore said in a brief statement. Company 
executives could not be reached for comment. Commodore started 40 years ago as 
a typewriter repair company in the Bronx. Its extension to the adding machine 
business paved the way for it to make calculators and then personal computers 
by the mid-1970s.

<P>
 According to figures filed with the Audit Bureau of Circulations for the six 
months ended March 31, Times daily circulation in Orange County grew by 5,849 
copies, or 3%, to 203,975, compared to the same period a year ago. Sunday 
circulation grew by 6,068 copies, or 2.1%, to 297,391. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily circulation for the combined San Fernando Valley/Ventura County Edition 
increased by 100 copies, or 0.4%, to 233,415, compared to the same period a 
year ago. Sunday circulation grew by 3,536 copies, or 1.1%, to 339,722, 
according to Times records. 
</P>
<P>
 Total daily circulation for The Times, the largest newspaper in the West and 
the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily, declined by 33,702, or 3%, to 
1,104,651. Sunday circulation declined by 19,077, or 1.3%, to 1,502,120. The 
declines are largely the result of planned strategic cutbacks in unprofitable 
circulation outside the newspaper's core market and of soft street sales that 
have affected newspapers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Times' competitive position in its key markets has never been stronger," 
said Richard T. Schlosberg III, Times publisher and chief executive. "These 
latest numbers underscore the value of our paper to readers as well as the 
success of our strategy to concentrate resources in our core market." 
</P>
<P>
 Times circulation gains outpaced the Orange County Register's performance 
during the reporting period. In Orange County, the Register posted weekday 
circulation gains of 1,030 copies, or 0.3%, to 323,829, compared to the same 
six-month period a year ago. Its Sunday circulation grew by 1,395, or 0.4%, to 
374,720. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily circulation for the Los Angeles Daily News in its primary market area 
declined 3,079 copies, or 1.7%, to 183,058, compared to the comparable period a 
year ago. Sunday circulation fell 7,870 copies, or 3.7%, to 202,294.

INCOME, SPENDING RISE; NEW HOME SALES TAKE OFF

 Americans were earning more and spending more last month, but only at a 
moderately quicker pace after unusually sharp increases in February. Meanwhile, 
the housing industry shook off winter doldrums and took off in March despite 
climbing interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest set of data suggests that the economy is emerging from its winter 
hibernation, but at a much slower pace than that witnessed in the fourth 
quarter of last year," said economist Jose Rasco of Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported Friday that personal income rose 0.6% in 
March and consumer spending nearly kept pace, rising 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The department revised estimates upward for February as unusual factors sent 
incomes up 1.8% and spending up 1.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The February income jump was the biggest since it soared 5.1% in December, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The February rise in consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the 
nation's economic activity, was the largest since September, 1992, when it 
increased 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending has risen in 11 of the past 12 months, declining only in January, 
when it slipped 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said sales of new homes jumped 11.1% in March, the biggest 
increase in six months, as the housing industry rebounded from winter storms 
and frigid cold. 
</P>
<P>
 All regions participated in the gain except for the Midwest, where sales 
slipped slightly. The Northeast experienced a double-digit advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales totaled 739,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from a revised 
665,000 in February. The original February estimate was 649,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 7.68% in March, compared to 7.15% a 
month earlier. Rates were at 8.32% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the latest government statistics buttress reports that the 
economy is expanding at a moderate rate and that inflation, while increasing, 
is well in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said incomes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of $5.63 trillion in March from $5.60 trillion in February. Spending was up to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.58 trillion from $4.56 trillion in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp February advances were due to higher farm subsidies and a rebound 
from the depressing effects of the Northridge earthquake on rental income. 
</P>
<P>
 Disposable income -- income after taxes -- also rose 0.6% in March, the 
seventh advance in eight months. It jumped 2% in February after dipping 1.1% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of incomes and spending means that Americans' savings rate -- 
savings as a percentage of disposable income -- climbed to 4.1% in March from 
3.9% in February. The savings rate was the highest since 4.3% in December. 
</P>
<P>
 A key component of the income category, wages and salaries, totaled $3.21 
trillion, up from $3.20 trillion a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the spending increase was for durable goods -- those expected to 
last at least three years -- with car sales leading the way.

 Arco Ponders New Cost-Cutting Moves: : Atlantic Richfield Co., under the 
guidance of new Chief Executive Mike R. Bowlin, is looking at ways to reduce 
expenses in an era of low crude oil prices, analysts said. Arco, which holds 
its annual meeting Monday, is considering a shake-up that could include 
layoffs, capital spending cuts and a stock buyback, they said. An Arco 
spokesman said the company has made no secret of the fact that it is looking at 
ways to reduce costs, probably including "work force reductions," but he said 
it will not make any decisions until summer.

 Oxy to Trim Costs: Occidental Petroleum Corp. will cut $150 million from its 
operating costs in 1994 by merging departments, eliminating managers and 
streamlining procedures, Chairman Ray R. Irani said at the annual shareholders 
meeting in Santa Monica.The Los Angeles-based oil company said net 
international production rose 18% during 1993 and is expected to increase more 
than 25% during 1994. Occidental reported a first-quarter loss of $40 million 
last week, blaming depressed oil and chemical prices. It took a $7-million 
charge to cover severance pay and related costs for workers laid off under the 
cost-cutting program.

 Number of Employment Ads Grows: Help-wanted advertising in U.S. newspapers 
increased in March, a reflection of rising demand for workers in much of the 
country, the Conference Board business research group said. Its Help-Wanted 
Advertising Index, which measures the monthly volume of employment ads in 51 
major newspaper markets, rose to 117, compared to 115 in February and 105 in 
January.A year ago, the index was at 96. "The labor market recovery is 
continuing," Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said Thursday. 
The expansion in the economy is enough to "open up new jobs as well as 
encourage employers to step up their recruitment efforts," he said. The 
increase in job advertising has coincided with a large increase in new jobs in 
recent months, the board said.

MELODIC TOAST TO 100 YEARS OF SLONIMSKY; MUSIC: THE CENTENARIAN -- A 
MUSICOLOGIST, CONDUCTOR, COMPOSER, AUTHOR AND PROVOCATEUR -- WAS HONORED AT A 
BIRTHDAY PARTY AT MOCA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to 100-year-old hyphenates of cultural import who call Los 
Angeles home, Nicolas Slonimsky may well have a corner on the market. The 
musicologist-author-conductor-composer-provocateur-watchdog-cat 
lover-and-walking encyclopedia turned 100 on Wednesday and was feted with a 
birthday party at the Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 While Slonimsky's frail health of late prevented him from leaving his home in 
West Los Angeles, the Ahmanson Auditorium was filled with his presence by 
proxy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's safe to say that everyone in the audience was well-aware of Slonimsky's 
unique contributions to music. But a burning question on the street might be: 
Who or what, exactly, is Nicolas Slonimsky? 
</P>
<P>
 If not exactly a household name, Slonimsky has played a critical role in 
spreading the gospel of and attending to the details of music. And the scope of 
his influence has extended beyond the classical world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the self-deprecating Slonimsky would say that he backed into 
musicology by default, he has produced an unparalleled body of published works. 
The classic "Lexicon of Critical Invective" is an amusing anthology of scathing 
critiques of music that later gained international notoriety. The exhaustively 
researched and often cleverly written "Music Since 1900" and "Baker's 
Biographical Dictionary of Musicians" (now in its eighth edition) give 
scholarly research a good name. His "Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns" 
is a practical tome whose devotees have included John Coltrane and Frank Zappa, 
whom Slonimsky befriended. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Slonimsky came to the United States in 1923 
and began his musical career here by drawing on his considerable piano skills. 
He has been an ardent champion of 20th-Century music, conducting premieres of 
important works by Charles Ives and Edgard Varese. His stubborn penchant for 
presenting new music doomed his conducting career from the outset -- a demise 
he traces to a disastrous, aborted stint at the Hollywood Bowl in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades spent in Boston, he returned here in the mid-'60s, after the 
death of his wife, art critic Dorothy Adlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Freeman, the new-music patron, photographer and confidante, organized 
the MOCA celebration and opened the show with a welcome. "My message to him is, 
'Good gracious, I can't believe you're 100, and I think it's one of your famous 
biographical fabrications,' " she teased. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Boulez, in the midst of his visit here with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, stopped by to offer his own toast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erik Satie told this story: When I was young, people told me, 'You will see 
when you are 50.' Satie was over 50 at the time and he said, 'I became 50, and 
I have not seen anything.' With Nicolas, he's so fresh and so full of naivete, 
I expect him to say, 'I am 100 and I still have seen nothing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At Slonimsky's home, his daughter, Electra, was directing the traffic of 
well-wishers paying respects. To an inquiry of "How are you?," he replied 
emphatically, "Well, I exist." 
</P>
<P>
 "The birthday was terrific. Everybody came -- my daughter, my granddaughter, 
various descendants, just wonderful people around. And I got a special telegram 
from the White House. It said that the Library of Congress was glad to remember 
me for the several years that I worked with them. At one time, I was very 
connected to the libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was also mention of the fact that I contributed so much to the Library 
of Congress. I donated a number of works and manuscripts to the Library of 
Congress. So there was a connection there." 
</P>
<P>
 Slonimsky has often used the term "quaquaversal," meaning "every which way." 
Does the word define his life in music? "It defines something or other. The 
word actually exists, but I promoted it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the MOCA program, a group of college students, directed by Ann Gresham, 
performed several of Slonimsky's musical settings with text taken from ads in 
the Saturday Evening Post. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also readings from his book "Perfect Pitch" (which he had wanted to 
call "Failed Wunderkind: A Rueful Autopsy"). Noted film composer David Raksin 
reprised his musical party favor, titled simply "Nicolas Slonimsky" and set to 
the tune of Gershwin's "Fascinating Rhythm." Performed at Slonimsky's 90th and 
95th birthday celebrations, Raksin's romp will now, presumably, go back on the 
shelf until the 105th birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's musical apogee came at the end with William Kraft's new piece 
dubbed, with fitting extravagance, "Birthday Greetings to Nicolas for the First 
One Hundred Years of Posterity: Heptatonic Phantasmagorical Configurations 
After Fata Morgana." 
</P>
<P>
 Sopranos Phyllis Bryn-Julson and Lucy Shelton did the honors in this 
seriocomic opus, with its musical materials lifted out of Slonimsky's 
"Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns" and its text from Slonimsky's own 
entry on himself in the "Baker's Dictionary of Musicians." Mad, merry tonal -- 
and atonal -- convolutions eventually dovetailed into a rousing chorus of the 
conventional "Happy Birthday" by all in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a characteristic Slonimsky-esque moment -- sophisticated manners, giddy 
humor and an ever-popular ditty woven into a happy quaquaversal convergence.

A FESTIVE SUNDAY OF LATIN POP; POP BEAT: MORE THAN 100 PERFORMERS ARE SET FOR 
'L.A. FIESTA BROADWAY,' 'PRIMERO DE MAYO' FEST AND A CINCO DE MAYO FIESTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It may or may not be the best, but in terms of sheer size Sunday's musical 
triple-header will undoubtedly qualify as the largest showcase of Latin pop 
ever staged in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect more than 750,000 people to see more than 100 performers -- 
including such big names as La Mafia, Los Tigres del Norte and Ricky Martin -- 
in performances stretching from downtown Los Angeles to South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual edition of "L.A. Fiesta Broadway," rivaled in scope only by 
Miami's annual "Gran Festival de la Calle Ocho" ("Eighth Street Fiesta"), will 
take place on nine stages on the portion of Broadway between First Street and 
Olympic Boulevard, with 60 artists performing before an expected crowd of 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other major celebrations will take place at the same time: The banda and 
nortena showcase "Primero de Mayo" festival on the grounds of the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena, sponsored by radio station KLAX (97.9 FM) and Fonovisa Records, 
is expected to draw 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Cinco de Mayo fiesta at Whittier Narrows in South El Monte, sponsored 
by sister radio stations KLVE (107.5 FM) and KTNQ (1020 AM), is hoping for a 
crowd of anywhere from 35,000 to 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduling of the three events on the same day was a coincidence, 
according to organizers, but all parties involved are confident that each 
event's uniqueness will ensure the expected success. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are three different events targeted to three specific types of 
audiences," said Tom Castro, president of El Dorado, a company that is a major 
sponsor of "L.A. Fiesta Broadway." Other major sponsors are All Access 
Entertainment, Miracle on Broadway, AT&T and the City of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami-based television network Univision, which sponsored the four previous 
editions, this time will film the event and produce two separate programs for 
national and local airing later in the year. El Dorado owns Los Angeles' new 
Spanish-language radio station KMQA (98.3 FM), known as La Maquina. 
</P>
<P>
 While "L.A. Fiesta Broadway" has the more eclectic lineup -- banda , romantic 
ballads, salsa, pop, folkloric ballets and even rock en espanol -- the fiesta 
at Whittier Narrows has a more limited musical range, emphasizing solo singers 
and pop groups. 
</P>
<P>
 KLAX's event at the Sports Arena concentrates on the banda and nortena sound 
that has kept the station in the No. 1 spot in the Arbitron ratings since the 
fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "L.A. Fiesta Broadway" and KLVE's Whittier Narrows show are free events, 
but don't count the Sports Arena out: Despite the $7 ticket price, last year 
the event's 16 bandas attracted an estimated 200,000. This year there will be 
21 bandas . 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a similar or even greater turnout, but even if 50,000 show up it 
will be a tremendous success," said Alfredo Rodriguez, KLAX's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 How do the talent rosters compare artistically? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to see a sample of the finest Latin artists in any one of the 
three events. But mixed among good sellers, hot new faces and local unknowns 
are some truly significant artists. None of the organizers can claim to have 
the strongest lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Fiesta Broadway's" bill offers salseros Marc Anthony and Colombia's 
exciting Grupo Niche, arguably the best of a long list that also includes the 
legendary Cruz Lizarraga's traditional Banda del Recodo, among others, 
performing from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sports Arena event has nortena heroes Los Tigres del Norte as its main 
headliners, but the act to watch is up-and-coming nortena group Los Tiranos del 
Norte. The event will take place on the outdoor grounds of the Sports Arena, 
with the performances also being shown on a giant TV screen inside the arena. 
The music starts at 9 a.m. and will last until 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiesta at Whittier Narrows, the smallest of the three, has booked such 
major stars as Venezuelan Jose Luis Rodriguez, Ricky Martin, Los Mier and 
Pandora. The event, scheduled to run between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., also offers 
free parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the music, some are looking to the triple-header to prove that the 
Latino market in Los Angeles is even larger than assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will show the incredible potential of our market," said Humberto 
Hernandez, station manager of La Maquina. "Only in Los Angeles can you have 
three events like these, and you can rest assured all three will be packed."

CONFEREES DEBATE WOMEN'S ROLE IN ENTERTAINMENT; PANEL: WOMEN, MEN & MEDIA SAY 
WOMEN SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHOICE OF PROJECTS, BUT SOME 
QUESTION WHY FEMALES MUST ENFORCE CODE OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject at this year's Women, Men & Media conference was "Sex, Violence or 
Love Between Equals 1994," and while the judgment was that sex and violence are 
still quite prevalent in Hollywood movies, something else emerged: Women, who 
increasingly are coming into positions of power, have to take responsibility 
for what they do -- and for what they allegedly want to watch. In Thursday's 
morning session, at the Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood, on "Trashing, Bashing 
and Flashing," ABC News superstar Diane Sawyer came under fire for doing her 
debut "Turning Point" program on "The (Charles) Manson Women." No one mentioned 
that later Thursday night on "PrimeTime Live," and again Friday on "Good 
Morning America," the peripatetic anchor would be seen interviewing Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Diane Sawyers have to think about what they're doing," said John 
Terenzio, an independent TV producer and former producer of "A Current Affair," 
"because their male bosses aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 "She can do anything she wants to do," chimed in Linda Ellman, co-executive 
producer of "Hard Copy," adding: "The interesting thing about Diane -- she's 
making all this money. What money does it leave for hiring other people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Next Barbra Streisand was criticized by film columnist Ella Taylor of 
Mirabella and Atlantic Monthly for choosing to direct and star in a movie about 
"a psychiatrist who spent a good deal of time having carnal interchange with 
her patient (Nick Nolte) by a roaring fire -- hardly a feminist film, or even 
an ethical film in many ways." That movie, "The Prince of Tides," was based on 
male author Pat Conroy's acclaimed novel. 
</P>
<P>
 And the reason for heavy network interest in the stories of Olympic skaters 
Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, and of Amy Fisher, the 16-year-old Long 
Island teen-ager who shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco, wife of her married lover? 
</P>
<P>
 It's "woman against woman," claimed Jim Bellows, Los Angeles bureau chief for 
TV Guide, explaining that prime-time audiences are dominated by women 18-49, 
and such stories "draw a bigger woman audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, screenwriter Callie Khouri, who won an Oscar for "Thelma & Louise," her 
first movie, put the issue of blaming women in some perspective when she noted 
that "a lot of times the onus is on women and minorities" to "enforce this code 
of so-called political correctness." 
</P>
<P>
 Khouri rebuked criticisms of men who saw "Thelma & Louise" as "male bashing" 
and of some women who saw the female leads as "outlaws." Did anyone criticize 
Al Pacino for "Scarface," Clint Eastwood for his "Dirty Harry" movies or Robert 
De Niro in "Taxi Driver"? she asked. "These male careers have been built on 
outlaws." 
</P>
<P>
 When "Malcolm X" came out at the same time as "Hoffa" last year, Khouri added, 
there was "this outcry" about the role model presented to young black men, 
while nobody was concerned about the role model "this Teamster boss with mob 
ties" might give to young white men. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Betty Friedan ("The Feminine Mystique"; "The Fountain of Age"), who 
co-founded Women, Men & Media as a research and outreach project at the USC 
School of Journalism, led off the conference by saying it was designed to "take 
the temperature" of the representation of women vs. men in the news and 
entertainment media. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch she presented one of the organization's "Breakthrough" awards to 
David E. Kelley, creator and executive producer of CBS' "Picket Fences" -- the 
1993 Emmy winner for outstanding dramatic series -- for casting aside "the 
stereotype of women as decoration" and presenting "women and men (as) peers."  
</P>
<P>
 But at the conference close, comparing movies and TV, Friedan said that while 
Women, Men & Media had no trouble presenting a TV award, it could not find a 
suitable American movie to honor this year. "Fried Green Tomatoes" and "Thelma 
& Louise" previously have won the organization's awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Khouri, Friedan concluded there are no on-screen portrayals of 
male/female relationships today like Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. "Is 
it too difficult to do?" she asked with bite. 
</P>
<P>
 On a somewhat brighter note, Women, Men & Media released a study that showed 
the percentage of female correspondents reporting the news on CBS, ABC and NBC 
was the highest the organization has recorded, 21% -- up from 14% the previous 
two years. The increase was attributed primarily to CBS, where women reporting 
nightly newscast stories are now at 32%.

FRESH OUT OF THE '50S, THEY DO FLY-RITE; POP MUSIC: ROBERT (BIG SANDY) 
WILLIAMS' BAND SOUNDS LESS LIKE REHASHERS OF PAST MUSIC THAN DISCOVERERS OF 
SOME ETERNAL WELLSPRING OF HIGH SPIRITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If they had a time machine, the two co-founders of Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite 
Boys know where they would end up -- back in the 1950s, when the world was just 
learning to rock. 
</P>
<P>
 With time travel unlikely, bassist Wally Hersom, 25, bandleader Robert (Big 
Sandy) Williams and the three other members of the Orange County-based group 
have done the next best thing. Their live shows and their just-released album, 
"Jumping From 6 to 6," retrieve some of the best aspects of the roots-music 
past and pull them alive and gleefully kicking into the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting together elements of the rockabilly of Elvis Presley and Gene Vincent, 
the Western swing of Bob Wills and the honky-tonk music of Hank Williams and 
George Jones, Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys, who play tonight at Jacks Sugar 
Shack, sound as if they themselves had just stepped out of a time machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sound is an authentic representation of its period-piece inspirations, 
yet the delivery is so infectious and brimming with vitality, native enthusiasm 
and assurance that they sound less like rehashers of past music than 
discoverers of some eternal wellspring of high spirits. (Drummer Bobby Trimble, 
guitarist Ashley Kingman and steel guitar player Lee Jeffriess round out the 
lineup.) 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 29, is the key to the band's ability to sound fresh while sounding 
old. His singing is smooth, rich and creamy, full of unstudied, unforced 
pleasure. He never strains for an effect, but sounds natural and completely at 
home with everything he sings. Much of it is original material with simple, 
innocent lyrics about the pleasures of rocking or the human comedy of falling 
in love, getting dumped, then starting the cycle all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether his band is creating something fresh or just exhuming 
the past "only comes up in interviews," Williams said recently during lunch in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is a genial, soft-spoken man who forms his thoughts slowly and 
deliberately, then unleashes them in staccato bursts. "People can be into any 
new band, (yet) they can come and see us and enjoy it. To these kids, it's new 
music. Our point of view is (to play) as if this is all new music." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Hersom both began playing 10 years ago in bands on Orange 
County's rockabilly revival scene. They launched Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys 
in 1988. There followed two albums on tiny labels, several trips to England and 
Europe, and a monthlong stint in 1992 as Morrissey's opening act on a U.S. 
tour. Dave Alvin, the respected Los Angeles singer-songwriter, became a fan, 
helped the band land a deal with HighTone Records, and produced the 
live-in-the-studio sessions for "Jumping From 6 to 6." 
</P>
<P>
 "The recording was four days in a row, 11-hour days, cutting live," Alvin 
said. "Most singers I've known and worked with or seen in the studio, as 
professional as some of them are, will bitch or lose it after several hours. 
Sandy never complained, and maybe once or twice hit a flat note." 
</P>
<P>
 If that time machine did exist, Big Sandy and company could go back to the 
mid-'50s and stand a very good chance of making it big with songs like 
"Hi-Billy Music," a thoroughly engaging and catchy Williams original. 
</P>
<P>
 But as things stand, Hersom acknowledges, "there's no set niche they can fit 
us into" in marketing the album. So tireless touring, not time travel, is in 
the offing. Said Hersom, "If we can get it out there in the stores, and we're 
out there playing and in people's faces, they'll hear it and like it and it'll 
create a market." 
</P>
<P>
 * Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys play tonight at Jacks Sugar Shack, 8751 W. 
Pico Blvd., 9:30 p.m. $5 cover. (310) 271-7887.

DANCE REVEIW; 'WEEPING WOMEN' GO SOLO AT LACMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEWIS SEGAL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program titled "Weeping Women in Dance" brought to the L.A. County Museum of 
Art on Thursday a selection of near-legendary modern dance solos matching the 
premise of the museum's current "Picasso and the Weeping Women" exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Depicting suffering, rage and resilience, these solos offered the newly 
reconstituted Los Angeles Dance Theatre an opportunity to show the stylistic 
range of early modern dance -- and what the idiom can uniquely accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on intensity of expression and innovative movement design reached 
maximum purity in Martha Graham's "Lamentation" (1930), though the performance 
by Janet Eilber subordinated emotional values to sculptural spectacle. Eilber 
looked far more involved in Graham's "Deep Song" (1937), another bench solo 
full of startling redefinitions of space and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced fervently by Michele Simmons, "Strange Fruit" (1943) showed 
choreographer Pearl Primus many decades ahead of her time in linking a spoken 
text and a gestural, non-dance vocabulary to a social theme: murderous racism. 
</P>
<P>
 The two least celebrated choreographers Thursday received performances of 
great immediacy and detail from company founder Bonnie Oda Homsey. Indeed the 
pride, defiance and nobility of Jane Dudley's "Cante Flamenco" (1944) seemed 
defined by a different body -- taller, rounder, more classically proportioned 
-- than the tiny, shrunken figure stamping and flailing so hopelessly in 
Eleanor King's "Road to Hell: Wrath" (1941). 
</P>
<P>
 Risa Steinberg connected more with the heroic rebellion in Isadora Duncan's 
"Dance of the Furies" (c. 1907) than with the solo's demonic anger, which 
appeared conventionalized here. Later on, she found all the dignity and pliancy 
of Anna Sokolow's "Kaddish" (1948) -- but projected them at a very small scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending their talents to this special event, guitarist Allen Krantz 
contributed a sensitive interpretation of Antonio Jose's "Pavana Triste" and 
actor Ron Glass read the Lewis Allan poem accompanying the Primus solo. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Dance Theatre's "Weeping Women in Dance" repeats at the Bing Theater, 
L.A. County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd., today at 3 p.m. Tickets: 
$15-$18. Call (213) 857-6010. LEWIS SEGAL

ANGELS FALL TO RED SOX ONCE AGAIN; BASEBALL: AFTER SWEEPING CALIFORNIA LAST 
WEEKEND, BOSTON SCORES FOUR RUNS IN THE FIRST INNING TO WIN, 6-4. LEFTWICH 
LOSES HIS FOURTH GAME OF THE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Phil Leftwich wasn't around to see the finish Friday mainly because his start 
was so awful. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers simply got fed up, spoke his mind and got the rest of the night 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went for the Angels, who lost to the Boston Red Sox, 6-4, in front 
of 30,178 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, swept in three forgettable games at Fenway Park last weekend, 
couldn't handle Boston again, losing their fourth consecutive game to the Red 
Sox and their third straight on this homestand. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, the Angel starter, couldn't overcome a horrible start, losing his 
fourth game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, the Angels held a brief team meeting. But Rodgers, ejected 
by plate umpire John Hirschbeck for arguing a called third-strike call on Chad 
Curtis in the fifth inning, revealed nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his ejection, Rodgers said: "I'm not against a 'strike' umpire, but here's 
a guy (Hirschbeck) who's calling them wide, giving six inches on each side of 
the plate. Don't get me wrong, I like a strike umpire, but that was 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 He would recover to pitch 7 2/3 solid innings, but Leftwich looked as if he 
wouldn't survive the first. Four batters into the game and the Red Sox had a 
4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a leadoff walk to Otis Nixon, Leftwich gave up singles to Mike Greenwell 
and Tim Naehring. Naehring's hard-hit single to left-center scored Nixon for 
the game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
 Mo Vaughn then slammed a 1-and-2 pitch 10 rows deep into the right-field 
stands for a three-run homer and a 4-0 Boston lead before Leftwich recorded an 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers wouldn't say Leftwich's future with the Angels rested with this start. 
But a 4-0 deficit after four batters clearly wasn't what he had in mind, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for him," Rodgers said. "It's important for us. It's not a 
make-or-break start. We're not going to ship him to Siberia. It's important in 
the grand scheme of things." 
</P>
<P>
 With injured starters Joe Magrane and Mark Langston due back next month and 
rookie Brian Anderson, 3-0 and starting Sunday, pitching so well, Leftwich 
needed to impress Friday in order to stay in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a bad outing, but even if he had overwhelmed Boston it might not 
have been enough to keep him from being sent to triple-A Vancouver when Magrane 
and Langston are sound again. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the second, he pitched super," Rodgers said of Leftwich, who gave up 
eight hits and five runs with four strikeouts and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just in such a hole we couldn't make it back. I think obviously after 
the first it was a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it serves as a kick in the butt for him, it's a good performance. If it 
just means he can pitch better when he's down, 4-0, it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston starter Aaron Sele (3-0) held the Angels to a single by rookie catcher 
Jorge Fabregas in the first four innings. He kept the Angels scoreless until 
the seventh, when Chili Davis ruined his shutout bid with a leadoff homer over 
the 386-foot sign on the right-center field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sele didn't make it out of the inning, giving way to reliever Scott Bankhead 
after walking the next batter, Eduardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a good fastball for five innings," Boston Manager Butch Hobson said. 
"Then he hung a fastball to Chili and he lost it for a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 6-1, entering the bottom of the eighth, the Angels rallied. Boston third 
baseman Scott Cooper, hitting .436 in the 11 games before Friday, had hit the 
first pitch from reliever Bob Patterson for a two-run homer to right field in 
the top half of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Damion Easley followed with a two-run homer off Bankhead and Dwight Smith 
later scored when Perez grounded into a double play with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Hobson went with Ken Ryan rather than standout closer Jeff 
Russell, who saved victories against Oakland Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who picked up his first save, was in immediate trouble through no fault 
of his own. Fabregas reached base on an infield single. Harold Reynolds 
grounded into what should have been a double play, but Cooper threw the ball 
into right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina sacrificed Fabregas to third and Reynolds to second. But Ryan 
struck out Easley and got Smith to ground out to end the game.

ANALYSIS; RAIDERS WILL STAY PUT IF COLISEUM IS READY; PRO FOOTBALL: DAVIS 
SIMPLY WANTS THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HE WAS PROMISED WHEN THE TEAM MOVED SOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They are not going to be the Orlando Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor the Baltimore Raiders. Nor the St. Louis Raiders. Nor the Memphis Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And not as long as owner Al Davis believes he can work with the Coliseum 
Commission to get the 71-year-old stadium not only back to where it was before 
it was damaged by the January earthquake, but up to where it is eventually 
supposed to be in terms of long-sought renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the Raiders, perhaps leaving an escape route to Oakland open, 
are going to remain in Los Angeles despite rumors that have them heading east. 
None of the talks with any of those interested cities have ever reached the 
serious stage. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coliseum spokeswoman said she was told that Raider season-ticket renewal 
applications will be mailed this weekend, a sign that the club is staying. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders would not confirm that report. 
</P>
<P>
 Don C. Webb, project manager of the Coliseum rebuilding operation, an 
enterprise that will cost nearly $35 million, has assured the team that the 
stadium will open Sept. 1, 11 days before the Raiders' first home game. 
Capacity will probably be scaled down from last season's 67,800 to about 50,000 
at first. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coliseum official also has assured the Raiders that the seismic reinforcing 
work now going on will be of sufficient strength to support luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So at least some of that $35 million will go toward improving the Coliseum, 
rather than merely bringing it back to where it was before 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, only a major problem in the rebuilding of the Coliseum would 
keep the Raiders out. And in that case, they would would search for a one-year, 
stop-gap home somewhere in Southern California or in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Amy Trask, in charge of legal affairs for the Raiders: "When we were in 
Orlando (for league meetings) in March, Mr. Davis said we were still in Los 
Angeles and we want to stay in Los Angeles, but there is a tremendous cloud of 
uncertainty with respect to the Coliseum. Our position has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that concern over the condition of the Coliseum that has kept the 
Raiders from signing a new lease with stadium officials and has kept the team 
from sending out season-ticket renewals. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis also wants the improvements he says have long been promised to him, but 
he is in a difficult position. It would look bad for him to be demanding luxury 
boxes when $35 million is being spent on repairing the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he believes he is entitled to those improvements, which were used to 
lure him from Oakland 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that commitments were made to create a state-of-the-art 
facility within the confines of the historic Coliseum," Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect and we believe that everyone understands that there is to be a 
program to create that state-of-the-art facility, but we also realize the 
community has suffered from a natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has not used the earthquake damage as an excuse to leave. He hasn't been 
traveling the country in search of a new home for his team. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he wants to stay in Los Angeles, ideally in a new stadium but 
practically in the Coliseum, with the improvements he says were promised long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the governor of Maryland, William Schaefer, an old friend and a man in 
search of a team for Baltimore, called Davis and tried to interest him in a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, city officials in Orlando, where Davis was attending league meetings, 
asked him to tour their stadium and made him offers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's old news. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis listened. He certainly didn't mind if the Coliseum Commission knew he 
was listening, and he didn't care if newspaper stories chronicled the comments 
and offers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a man who deals in intimidation, who respects power. He needs a few 
cards in his hand when he sits down at the table with Coliseum officials. 
</P>
<P>
 They once laughed at Jack Kent Cooke when he threatened to pull his Lakers out 
of the Sports Arena if his terms weren't met. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't laughing when the Forum went up. 
</P>
<P>
 And at some point, if Davis doesn't get what he wants, he figures to do the 
same as Cooke, here or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But this doesn't appear to be that point. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, at least, the Raiders understand the tough situation the Coliseum 
Commission and the entire region is in. But don't expect them to sign any 
long-term deals or stop listening to lucrative offers or stop looking at land 
until those luxury boxes and the rest of the renovations have been completed.

A DREAM OF THEIR OWN; BARNSTORMING TOUR BY COLORADO TEAM MIGHT PUT WOMEN'S

 She attended UC Davis and Pepperdine law school, but this spring she has 
focused on education of a different kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Niekro has been teaching her the knuckleball. Joe Niekro has been showing 
her how to scuff it a little. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been classes in how to chew sunflower seeds and on autographing a 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Satriano, an assistant district attorney in Los Angeles on leave from the 
Compton office, is one of 24 women -- there were 48 at the start -- who have 
survived cuts during seven weeks of spring training in Orlando and Winter 
Haven, Fla., and will open the season with the Colorado Silver Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is awesome," said Satriano, 28, the daughter of former Angel and Boston 
Red Sox catcher Tom Satriano and the first female to play Little League in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day that I walk on this field I ask myself, 'How did I get here?' I'm 
having the time of my life and I can't believe it's happening at this stage of 
my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball has been in my blood since I was a kid, but I had to think that it

 Coors Brewing Company is investing $3 million-plus to provide some of the best

 Under the direction of Manager Phil Niekro and coaches Joe Niekro, Paul Blair 
and Joe Pignatano -- all former major leaguers -- the Bullets will be paid 
$20,000 each for a summer of barnstorming against male opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 They will play the first of 32 games -- the schedule is still being expanded 
-- in Charlotte, N.C., on May 8 against the Northern League All-Stars. ESPN2 
will televise the game. They will also play in Candlestick Park, the Oakland 
Coliseum, Denver's Mile High Stadium and Seattle's Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stay competitive or we lose our credibility," General Manager 
Shereen Samonds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samonds gave up a promising front-office career in the Chicago Cub 
organization only when convinced by Coors that this was not a "fly-by-night 
promotional gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range hope, she said, is that the Bullets will help open the door to 
the major leagues, that eventually there will be a woman "good enough to play 
at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro and staff have been sorting it out seven days a week, five hours a day, 
with only a five-day break in training since March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing anyone thinks about when they think about women in baseball 
is the major leagues," Niekro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can they hit 90-m.p.h. pitching? Well, how many guys in the big leagues can? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can they reach the relay man from dead center? Well, how many guys in the big 
leagues can -- or do it accurately? 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these women have had only softball experience, and they walked in 
scared to death -- smaller ball, smaller bat, larger field. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they've progressed a lot more than I would have imagined, and they're far 
more coachable than the guys, most of whom think they know everything there is 
to know about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls can't get enough, and some of them can knock your eyes out with 
the way they catch and throw. The big adjustment for them is with the heavier 
wooden bats and larger field. Do they have the speed to cover it defensively 
against a men's team? Can they pitch it with enough finesse considering they're 
not going to blow hitters away? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling we're going to be beaten bad in some games, but that's not 
my concern. I'm more interested in how we develop over the course of the year. 
We're going to be in a spring training and conditioning mode while we try to 
compete. It's going to take patience, but this is not just a one-year project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of the top female athletes, but I think some of them will 
watch us play this year and run to the batting cages to get on board next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets held tryouts in a dozen cities. Major league scouts were brought 
in to help judge the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 K.C. Clark of Costa Mesa gave up her job at a deli counter and made the team. 
So did Missy Cress, who had been loading UPS trucks in Simi Valley and 
attending Cal State Northridge. So did teachers Melissa Coombes of Arcadia and 
Michele McAnany of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Satriano said she weighed the risks and took half a second to decide. Her 
supervisors at work have been supportive, she said, but if the budget for the 
voluntary leave program is cut, she could lose her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little kid won out over the mature adult," she said of her decision. "I 
felt it was something I had to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 She is a pitcher-infielder who has always felt that way. Her parents divorced, 
but she was raised in a baseball environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Satriano, now a partner in a Los Angeles accounting firm, spent parts of 
10 seasons in the major leagues. Nick Satriano, her brother, played at UC Santa 
Barbara and is the baseball coach at Malibu High. Lisa Satriano, a sister and 
assistant movie director, is helping support Gina financially in this venture. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Sherry Satriano, her mother, who threatened the lawsuits that 
enabled Gina to play in the Woodland Hills Little League, resulting in phone 
threats against the family and the burning of trees in their front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina was not dissuaded. 
</P>
<P>
 She put up with hassles from coaches and teammates through Pony and Colt 
leagues, was forced to play softball at Santa Monica High, was cut at the end 
-- "they placated me as long as they could" -- of fall baseball practice at UC 
Davis, and put the dream on hold while completing her education, although she 
spent three years with a men's semipro team in Los Angeles, the New York 
Heartbreakers, and was occasionally joined in those games by her father and 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an addiction, she said, and it didn't die when she was hired by the 
district attorney's office, another dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 She would make the long drive from her home in Malibu to the office in 
Compton, then, three or four nights a week, she would drive to Burbank to work 
out with a women's semipro team, the L.A. Gatekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get home at about 10 and have to sit at the computer for another hour or 
two, working on whatever trial I was involved with," she said. "That's how 
badly I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the Gatekeepers are largely a team in name only. Many times 
there were only three or four players working out in the dark. In Satriano's 
nine months with the team, she said, they played in only two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while competing in a Florida tournament in January that a reporter told 
her about the Silver Bullets. She called from California on a Monday and had a 
ticket back to Florida on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was the intent of the movie, but I bawled when I saw 'A 
League of Their Own,' " Satriano said. "Here these women got the opportunity I 
always wished I had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so envious, and now here I am getting that same opportunity. It's hard 
to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Two women from the era portrayed in the movie, Ynez Voyles and Anita Foss, 
held a send-off dinner for Satriano, sharing their scrapbooks and experiences 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also, of course, leaned on her father over the years, gaining insight 
into strategy, positioning, setting up hitters, and she recently boned up at 
the Geoff Zahn pitching school, but she calls it an incredible experience to be 
receiving individual attention from the Niekro brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time any of us have gone through something like this on a 
daily basis, and the toughest part has been maintaining my concentration, 
attempting to be at my best every day," she said. "Fortunately, my body has 
been holding up very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity represents a victory for the women of the Silver Bullets, but 
they face an itinerary of mental games, including ridicule from those who don't 
think women should play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Satriano smiled and said she has been exposed to it before. 
</P>
<P>
 "That experience should help me now, knowing it does not have to affect me if 
I don't want it to," she said. "There will be individuals who support us and 
others who put us down, but they can say what they want. I'm out here to play 
baseball."

KINGS' MCNALL RESIGNS NHL POST; HOCKEY: HE QUITS AS HEAD OF THE LEAGUE'S BOARD 
OF GOVERNORS AMID A FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION OF FINANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King owner Bruce McNall resigned Friday from one of the most powerful 
positions in the National Hockey League amid a federal grand jury investigation 
of whether he falsified loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL announcement that McNall is resigning as chairman of the league's 
board of governors -- the top position among hockey owners -- followed a report 
in The Times revealing the ongoing federal investigation. McNall officials have 
confirmed that the investigation has started but said that McNall believes no 
action will be taken when it is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation -- which the NHL attributed to "personal reasons" -- comes 
amid growing turmoil in McNall's business operations and developments that have 
clouded his plan to sell a majority interest in the team to ease his growing 
financial strain, notably a $92-million debt to Bank of America. On Friday, 
sources confirmed that an undisclosed number of employees were laid off from 
McNall's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Creditor sources confirmed that bankruptcy has been discussed as a possibility 
for McNall's operations should the deal fall through to sell the majority stake 
in the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyer Kenneth N. Klee, who is one of the nation's top bankruptcy 
specialists and has been working with McNall on his financial matters, said: 
"There are no bankruptcy papers being prepared, or that have been prepared, for 
Bruce McNall or McNall Sports and Entertainment Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NHL officials are getting involved in trying to salvage the deal 
and keep the Kings out of any bankruptcy action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bankruptcy would be the last resort, and we believe we can work things out to 
avoid that," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a provision in the NHL bylaws for the league to step in and take over 
the team if there was a bankruptcy or considerable financial problems. During 
the 1970-71 season, the unwillingness of Pittsburgh Penguin owner Donald Parson 
to take further financial losses forced the NHL to take over operation of the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman said that Jeffrey Pash, NHL senior vice president and general counsel, 
is in Los Angeles speaking with all the parties and doing fact-finding. At this 
point, Bettman is not planning to come to Los Angeles, but will if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen have been on 
the verge of buying 65% of the team for $60 million in a deal that sources 
confirm was to have been financed by insurance giants Cigna and Allstate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Sudikoff and Cohen said that news of the investigation 
alarmed the two lenders, causing them to shelve their participation in the 
deal. Sudikoff and Cohen are scheduled to hold talks during the weekend with 
Bank of America in an effort to persuade the bank to finance the transaction 
temporarily until the extent of McNall's legal and financial problems is known. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source close to the deal, one scenario involves Sudikoff and 
Cohen buying a larger percentage than the 65% previously planned, with whatever 
percentage McNall retains being put into a trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman credited McNall with helping hockey expand -- it was during McNall's 
tenure as chairman of the NHL board that Walt Disney's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 
and Blockbuster Entertainment Chief Executive H. Wayne Huizenga's Florida 
Panthers entered the league -- and helping hockey return to network television. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said in a statement that Bettman reluctantly accepted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a personal level, obviously I hope everything works out for Bruce," 
Bettman said. "On a professional level, I need to do everything I can to ensure 
the Los Angeles Kings franchise is healthy and stable." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall was elected chairman in June of 1992. His term was to have expired in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible successors to McNall include progressive governors such as Ronald L. 
Corey of Montreal or Howard L. Baldwin of Pittsburgh. The board thinks highly 
of Disney's Michael Eisner, but he is somewhat removed from day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Helene Elliott and Robyn Norwood contributed to this 
story.

UNDER SIEGE; AS COACH OF ITALY'S WORLD CUP TEAM, SACCHI ACCUSTOMED TO 
SECOND-GUESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a quiet street in one of this rich city's richest neighborhoods, beyond a 
security guard, up two flights of marble stairs and behind an iron gate, waits 
one of the most besieged men in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 As he greets his visitors, appearing tanned, trim and in gentle good humor, it 
is difficult to imagine the powerful social forces that are churning outside 
the doors of this tasteful apartment. Detractors would like to take his job, at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is Arrigo Sacchi smiling? The coach of the Italian World Cup team is at 
the center of a predictable public hysteria -- traceable every four years to 
this desperate period of weeks when the Azzurri are in their final preparations 
for the World Cup finals, soccer's world championships, which begin June 17 in 
nine American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where soccer ranks alongside religion in public debate, a good 
many of the citizens consider themselves to be highly qualified to coach the 
Italian national team, one of the World Cup favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Sacchi has been scalding since he took the job in 1991. It has 
increased dramatically with the national side's three losses this year. The 
first two, in international "friendlies" against France and Germany, were no 
great shame. The latest, though, was too much. The national team was beaten two 
weeks ago by Pontedera, a lowly fourth-division Italian club team, 2-1. The 
soccer world tittered.  
</P>
<P>
 Italian-language newspapers in New York called for Sacchi's sacking, and one 
even editorialized that the coach should be exiled to an island in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, the reaction was more strident. There is even some sentiment for the 
Pontedera coach taking over the World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 An Italian soccer magazine recently mocked Sacchi for calling up 73 players in 
two years to play with the team, but not yet settling on any. Running under a 
headline that read, "Arrigo, have you forgotten anyone?," the magazine 
displayed a full page of mug shots of the players Sacchi has used, sprinkling 
in photographs of Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, Robin Williams as Popeye and 
even Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 But the way most Italian fans feel about Sacchi's methods, not even the Pope 
can help this team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi has been criticized for calling up too many players, too few players 
from the south of the country, for using players in the wrong positions, for 
using bizarre tactics and for being an odd guy who reads too many books. But 
through it all, Sacchi, 48, has maintained a Zen-like peace, a philosophy he 
might have borrowed from his team's star player, Roberto Baggio, a Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 In 21 years as a soccer coach in Italy, Sacchi has fashioned an American-style 
success story. Growing up in a small town near Ravenna, Sacchi played in a 
nearby farmer's fields. He began his coaching career in the lowest professional 
division and worked his way up to the coaching job at AC Milan, one of Europe's 
premier teams. He left Milan to become national coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "Mr. Nobody" by Italian journalists, he has come from nowhere to the 
most important sports job in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a lucky man," Sacchi said last week. "I am doing the work I choose. I 
never even dreamed of this. It is beyond a dream, it is Utopia. I was in Milan 
with two years to go on my contract. I told them, 'Stop!' Why? I'd hadn't any 
more enthusiasm. Every day I was no longer going to work, I was going to a job. 
It was time to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "(As a coach) I began in the second category. I am accustomed to suffering and 
I am accustomed to criticism. I am accustomed to hearing people say, 'You can't 
do that. It can't happen.' I have always been a dreamer. But it's also 
important for my players to have dreams. If everyone dreams the same dream 
together, it will become reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi's dream involves changing the style of the Italian national team, which 
is sacred territory for fans who have been resistant to change. Even the 
national team players have been slow to adopt Sacchi's system, a reluctance 
Sacchi explains is part of the very Italian trait that prizes winning, but 
fears losing more. 
</P>
<P>
 This has bred a conservative, suffocating style, he said. Italy's gift to the 
soccer world has been fast, scrappy and shrewd defensive players and an 
effective zone defense. In the past, few goals have been scored against Italy, 
but neither have Italian teams scored many goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi is dedicated to the concept of attacking soccer, and his players are 
asked to be constantly on the move, making quick decisions. Because he doesn't 
adhere to a strict distinction among his forward players, Sacchi has been open 
to criticism about Baggio, in particular, whom he has played both in the 
midfield and as a forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to have a team where it is difficult to know who is the forward, who 
is the defender," he said, emphasizing the importance of confusing opposing 
players. "If the situation would be clear, the game would not go well. I want 
11 players who attack and 11 players who defend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not come to the United States promising victory. But we promise a great 
will and dedication to the job. We would like to play a style of soccer that is 
very pleasing to the fans, a soccer that takes great risks, a dynamic and very 
fast game. If we succeed at this, then the results will be unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi's philosophical outlook does not sit well with Italian fans who expect 
victories, not style points. The constant demands on his time and sharp 
criticism in the media often drive Sacchi to his childhood home in the country, 
where it is possible, he said, to ride his mountain bike for two hours and see 
only two farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi told a story of a bike ride he took in the country this week. He was 
riding along a lane and came across on old farmer, one he had known since he 
was a child. They discussed the recent controversies and public outcry against 
Sacchi. The farmer reminded Sacchi of all that he had already accomplished in 
guiding Italy through World Cup qualifying. He deserved to be proud of what he 
had done, the farmer told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'Life is like a piece of cake. Everyone pushes around the table 
to get a piece of the cake. The big ones first and the not-so-important ones 
last. Now, you have a place at the table,' " Sacchi said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see? Mr. Nobody now does not have to fight for a place at the table!"

GARY REPRISES HIS ROLE OF NO-SHOW AT MINICAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' minicamp roll call Friday was a long one, with one noticeable 
omission. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young? Check. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Roman Phifer? He's here. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Cleveland Gary? A no-show, again. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, a contract holdout for most of training camp last summer, didn't 
participate in the Rams' minicamp workouts, which began Friday and continue 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had indicated last week that he would be here," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. 
"But we want to dwell on the people who are here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a number of unsigned players here, and they realize the importance of 
this camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsigned players such as Gary aren't required to attend minicamp, but several 
of his teammates signed a waiver agreeing to join workouts. Among them were 
three restricted free agents -- Young, Phifer and Bailey -- and offensive 
tackle Jackie Slater, an unrestricted free agent who has come to terms on a 
one-year deal but has yet to sign a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a done deal," Slater said. "I expect to sign sometime this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary worked out at Pittsburgh last week, but he won't be able to sign with the 
Steelers because the fine print of his contract limits his options to that of a 
restricted free agent, and the April 18 for extending offer sheets has passed. 
That leaves Gary with two options -- sign with the Rams or sit out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and his agent, Jordan Woy, couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Young, who says he is recovered from arthroscopic knee surgery last season, 
considered skipping camp while his agent, Steve Feldman, continues contract 
negotiations with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little question about whether or not I would (participate)," 
Young said. "But I talked to the coaches and we thought it was a good idea. I'm 
only going through drills, and I'm holding out of the serious stuff because I 
don't want to get injured and hurt my bargaining power." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh had showed some interest in Young during the restricted free-agent 
signing period, but the deadline passed without him signing an offer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said the Young's minicamp workout was a "goodwill gesture" in contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization has made it clear that it wants him," Feldman said. "He has 
an agreement with the coaches that if there is any drill during minicamp that 
he feels isn't safe, he can step out and not participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Young was optimistic that a deal could be done as early as the end of camp. He 
earned a league-minimum $150,000 last season and is looking for a raise that 
could make him a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had seven sacks in the first four games last season before injuring his 
knee in Week 5 against New Orleans. He said the knee "feels great" after Friday 
morning's workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medical report: Backup tailback David Lang, who underwent arthroscopic surgery 
last week, lifted weights Friday but did not participate in workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver and punt return specialist Todd Kinchen attended minicamp but 
participated only in light receiving drills because he's still recovering from 
surgery on his left knee last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be healed by training camp," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Clark, the former San Francisco Giant standout, now plays for the Texas 
Rangers and is, of course, wearing a new uniform -- including red shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "First time I put those things on," Clark told Bruce Jenkins of the San 
Francisco Chronicle, "I felt like clicking my heels and yelling (high voice), 
'We're going back to Kansas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Toto isn't with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What was Michael Jordan's scoring average in NBA playoff games? 
</P>
<P>
 Clip and save: The 100-yard dash, which is seldom contested now in the metric 
age, is on the program for the Penn Relays today.  
</P>
<P>
 Charley Greene, now 50, was asked by USA Today if his world record of 9.21 
seconds, which he shares with Johnny Johnson, will be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll need a hurricane to get my stuff," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rat pack: On the prospect of the Raiders moving to Orlando, Fla., Brian 
Schmitz of the Orlando Sentinel has this vision:  
</P>
<P>
 "I can see it now. The mascot is the new Mickey Mouse, wearing an eye patch 
and an earring: The Raider Rat." 
</P>
<P>
 Shrinking net: The New York Islanders scored only three goals against the New 
York Rangers while being swept in four games in an NHL Eastern Conference 
quarterfinal series. Mark Messier of the Rangers saluted his teammate, goalie 
Mike Richter:  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, it was like everyone was shooting BBs at him and he was trying to 
guard a soccer net," Messier told Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe. "Now 
the Islanders are trying to shoot a beach ball inside a net the size of a phone 
booth." 
</P>
<P>
 Case closed: Jerome Holtzman of the Chicago Tribune reports, "The first 
rhubarb of the new (baseball) season is upon us. Should umpires wear 
sunglasses?" 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Eddie Vargo, supervisor of National League umpires: "No. We want them 
to look like umpires, not like Hollywood producers." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Springstead, Vargo's American League counterpart, agrees: "If an umpire 
can't handle the glare of the sun, he should get a job in a bank." 
</P>
<P>
 New rules: After striking out the Giants' Barry Bonds in a recent game, 
Florida Marlin relief pitcher Yorkis Perez was so excited that he pumped his 
fist and sprinted to the dugout. Embarrassingly, it was only the first out of 
the inning.

<P>
 Said first baseman Orestes Destrade: "I was dumbfounded. I guess he figured 
striking out Barry Bonds is worth three outs."

SOCCER; U.S. TO TEST PROGRESS AGAINST TOP CHILEAN SQUAD

 The United States plays Chile today in a soccer "friendly" at University 
Stadium in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bora Milutinovic has taken an 18-member team to the University of New 
Mexico, choosing to leave behind defender Jeff Agoos, midfielder Brian Quinn 
and forward Joe-Max Moore. Moore is recovering from injury, but the absence of 
Agoos and Quinn was not explained.Forward Peter Vermes was cut this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile, which was barred from competing in the 1994 World Cup because it 
cheated by feigning injury and walking off the field during a qualifying match 
against Brazil for the 1990 tournament, has brought a strong team to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chileans' 16-man roster includes 10 players who were on Chile's Copa 
America, or South American Championship, squad in Ecuador last year. However, 
Chile's most dangerous player, striker Ivan Zamorano, could not gain release to 
play in the match from his Spanish club team, Real Madrid. GRAHAME L. JONES

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; NORRIS PROMISES HE WILL RETURN TO OLD STYLE IN BROWN 
REMATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The tape tells the story, and, although he is an embarrassed viewer, Terry 
Norris does not flinch as it plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris' body leans away from the television, but his eyes barely blink, frozen 
on the fighters, and the pounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Whomp-whomp-whomp! As if delivered to him as one more test of faith, one more 
swallow of humility, while Norris awaits the start of a news conference, 20 
feet away the tape of his devastating fourth-round knockout by Simon Brown is 
loud and luminous. 
</P>
<P>
 Whomp-whomp-whomp! He cannot look away. Maybe he wants to, but he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when Brown walks past the television into the hotel ballroom, Norris does 
not turn. Only when the tape shows him lurching crazily back to his corner at 
the end of a round does Norris' face break into a grimace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can watch it and kind of critique myself now," Norris says moments after 
the tape is over. "It still hurts, but I can get through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I see most of all is the points where I kept dropping my hands, letting 
him catch me with that right hand. Watching the fight now, that's all I see -- 
me making all the mistakes and him capitalizing on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris entered the ring last Dec. 18 at Puebla, Mexico, swaggering and 
declaring himself the best fighter, pound for pound, in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a fight planned against Pernell Whitaker; he was considering moving up 
to middleweight. He was 36-3 and coming off six consecutive knockout victories 
as he went into the 11th defense of his World Boxing Council 
junior-middleweight title against Brown, an opponent who had canceled bouts 
with Norris twice previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris charged Brown as if the former two-time welterweight champion was 
another Joe Gatti or Pat Lawlor. Norris blasted Brown, who took the blows and 
punched right back, with obvious effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 When Norris went down for good, all the questions about his shaky chin and his 
all-or-nothing style and his discipline in training poured over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pound for pound the best? Not after the second knockout defeat of his career, 
and fourth loss overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris says now that he realizes he might never be mentioned as one of 
boxing's elite again. But as he prepares for a rematch against Brown next 
Saturday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on a card featuring four rematches, 
Norris understands that this might be his last chance to regain much of what he 
has lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gotten myself into a mode where I was walking in, knocking fighters 
down," the 26-year-old Norris says. "That's not Terry Norris. I'm into boxing 
my opponent. If a knockout comes, it comes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can change, I can adapt. I've always been a boxer (and a) puncher, so I can 
change my styles up." 
</P>
<P>
 It took some time, Norris acknowledges, to accept the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things go through your mind when something like that happens to 
you," he says. "You wonder about your chin, you wonder about your talents, you 
wonder about a lot of things. But I'm over that. I'm confident in knowing that 
I wasn't fighting the way I should, the way that made me who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Norris listened to his friends and advisers -- and to what the 
tape of the Brown fight told him. He had to go back to basics and start working 
on how not to get hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's embarrassing to watch the fight, but I know deep down inside that it 
wasn't me," Norris says. "Now, I have to overcome that and win the next fight 
and I can prove to the world that it wasn't Terry Norris then. This is Terry." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Norris' manager, Joe Sayatovich: "They're learning experiences. He 
learned from this, just like he did from the first (knockout) with Julian 
Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris says he has reverted to his old style, the one he used in beating Sugar 
Ray Leonard in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last fight, against Armando Campas in March, Norris took a more relaxed 
approach, firing away from the outside without moving in for the immediate 
knockout, slowing Campas in the early going, then knocking him out in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is concentrating on defense, picking off shots with his gloves, 
moving in and out, not focusing only on the knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get hit, I do have a tendency to go down," Norris says. "But it's not 
because I don't have a chin. It's because I get caught with too many clean, 
solid shots. Any man, you get hit with too many clean, solid shots, you go 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I won't get back into that kill mode. I want to come out there and 
box. I don't have to knock out people to impress myself, impress anybody else. 
I think a lot of people like to see pure boxing, and that's what I'm going to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my name being out there," he adds, "I miss being talked about." 
</P>

THE SEA TEACHES HER A PAINFUL LESSON; SAILBOARDING: SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT DECISION 
TO JOIN 125-MILE YACHT RACE TURNS INTO A NIGHT OF AGONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a good idea, Lanee Butler thought. She would jump on her sailboard and 
join the 47th Newport-Ensenada International Yacht Race to promote her Olympic 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A noble idea. She would donate some of the proceeds to the Surfrider 
Foundation for cleaner oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lanee had known then what she knows now. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't what I expected," she said. "I expected -- gosh, I don't know. It 
was much harder than I'd ever dreamed of, and not only for me but for the guys 
in my support boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it turned out all right. She did it. All 125 miles. All 29 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't quite sure how long it was going to take me, but when I got to San 
Diego about 8 o'clock that night I thought, 'Oh, that's great, I've already 
sailed halfway and I'll be in Ensenada in the morning.' By the time I got to 
Tijuana, about 11 o'clock, the wind just died and it took me about seven hours 
to go two miles." 
</P>
<P>
 By that time her hands were raw from holding onto the boom, her legs and back 
were in agony. 
</P>
<P>
 "My arms were just like Jell-O," she said. "I was in a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lanee (pronounced LAY-nee) Butler is 23, a native of Dana Point and the only 
woman ever to represent the United States in sailboarding in the Olympics. 
Barcelona in 1992 was the first Olympics including such an event. Butler placed 
fifth. She wants to go again -- to Atlanta in '96. That's how all this started. 
</P>
<P>
 She found some sponsors and solicited pledges for miles sailed to finance her 
campaign through the nonprofit California International Sailing Assn. She sold 
T-shirts to pay for the gas for her escort boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I got too many people pledging because a lot of people were 
really negative, saying I'd never be able to do it," said Butler, 5 feet 4 and 
125 pounds. "And, I'm a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were the skeptics impressed by the sight of Butler's escort vessel: a 
20-foot open runabout with an outboard motor manned by her Australian 
boyfriend, Adrian Finglas, and friends Jason Vaught of Dana Point and Bernard 
Dunayevich of San Francisco. It was a craft in which no prudent mariner would 
take to the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I was sailing out of the harbor, some of the guys (on the race 
boats) were laughing (and saying), 'Oh, you're not going to be able to stand up 
the whole way,' " she said. "It only made me more determined to prove I could 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some cheers with the jeers, and some concern from well-wishers who 
reminded her of the recent death of a woman in a rare shark attack near San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody kept asking me if I was worried about (sharks), which, of course, 
was in the back of my mind (and) the last thing I wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 The race started at noon April 22. As Butler sailed, her mother and sister 
drove down I-5. They tried to stay in contact via cellular phone, but lost 
contact around Tijuana, leaving anxious hours at both ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler could not officially enter the race. There is no sailboard class, and 
the rules permit only boats a minimum of 24 feet overall or 20 feet at the 
waterline. Butler's Olympic-class Mistral One-Design board is 12 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't want to cause any trouble, so leaving the bay, instead of turning 
right up the beach toward the starting line, she turned left and simply kept 
going. It was a sunny, breezy day, and when the sun went down, a bright moon 
rose to light the way. Butler had only positive thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 But then clouds blotted out the moon. Some of the race boats passed her 
silently and darkly -- some as close as 20 feet. Did they even see her? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary," she said. "You start imagining things. I would sail over 
schools and schools of fish, and at night they become phosphorescent, so I 
could see everything in the water. Instead of looking at the waves, you're 
looking right through them because the fish glow. When you can see what's 
underneath you, that's when it's scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pictured maybe 50 sharks around me. I remembered the movie 'Jaws' where you 
see the shark looking up at the girl. I pictured what I looked like underneath 
the water to a shark. It gets a little scary even when you're sailing next to 
dolphins because you don't know what they're going to do. We saw dolphins, some 
seals, a lot of fish, manta rays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there were sharks, but I didn't see any fins. I imagined a bunch, 
but I don't know if I actually saw any. You're out there in someone else's 
water, so you just never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was never more than 10 miles from shore, it was so dark she might 
as well have been in the middle of the Pacific. Her muscles protested with 
every bob of the board, and her ears strained for the sound of a coastal 
freighter about to run her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, she was unable to lean back, relax and use her harness to support the 
sail for more than about five hours because she was sailing downwind, with the 
sail too far out or the wind too light. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like working at a job where you have to stand all the time," she said. 
"I figured I'd be hooked in the whole way. After the 10th hour, after dark, is 
when I was really getting challenged. I was sailing around in, like, no wind. 
It's hard to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Four times she got off the board and into the boat, for a total of about an 
hour and 15 minutes. Occasionally, she tried to keep up her energy by nibbling 
energy bars and sipping a carbohydrate drink from a pack on her back. She ate a 
peanut butter sandwich at the halfway point and later gulped down a cola "just 
for the caffeine." 
</P>
<P>
 She had second thoughts about someday perhaps sailing in the Whitbread 
Round-the-World Race. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a taste of how tough mentally you have to be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest miles . . . we had a Loran (navigation) counter on the boat that 
was counting the distance backward. From the 40th mile to the 30th mile was the 
toughest time because it took me forever." 
</P>
<P>
 At daybreak, as the goal seemed within reach, she was made aware of one 
purpose of her effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had noticed that off the coast of California the water looked really clean, 
but as soon as we got into the Mexican waters it got brown . . . really dirty 
(from) the factories on the coast. Their standards are different. When I go to 
Europe and all over the world, the water's getting worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Near Ensenada, the wind picked up briskly. But Butler was so weak that she 
wasn't sure she could handle it, even after switching to a smaller sail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got me there quicker, but I was going dead downwind at about 20 knots and 
I wasn't using the harness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I fell was inside Ensenada Bay. I ran over seaweed on my 
(board's fin). You have to reverse backward and the waves were really big. I'd 
never got wet until then." 
</P>
<P>
 She sailed through the finish line at 5:20 p.m. -- by then not at all an 
intruder. The race committee was glad to see her, unofficial or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me a horn and clapped and yelled, so it was great," she said. "A 
lot of the other boats were great. They'd come by to wave and cheer, and down 
to the finish that kept me going." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day she was introduced at the awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, next year 20 guys may show up, but it's really dangerous," she 
said. "Looking back, I should have been a lot more prepared. I did it just on 
the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have sat down and really thought about it and listened to what 
everyone said, I wouldn't have done it. I was lucky with the conditions we got, 
and I was lucky that I had the guys on the boat I did. But now when people say, 
'Ah, you won't be able to do it,' I can say, 'I've already done it.' We'll see 
if anyone's crazy enough to do it next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanee Butler, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe. You might see me out there again."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; JACKSON LAUNCHES MEMORABLE BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a handful of people were there to witness it, but Bo Jackson made history 
Friday when he slammed a batting-practice pitch into the third row of seats in 
the second deck in left field at Anaheim Stadium. According to the Angel public 
relations staff, Jackson is the first to reach the second deck, either in a 
game or batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers' estimates ranged from 460 to 500 feet. His memorable blast to the 
tarp that covers the football seats in center field in the 1989 All-Star game 
measured 448 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ball was hit, the Angels all seemed to stop and watch its flight. 
"They all said, 'Oh, my God,' " said Angel coach Sam Suplizio, who pitched 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw my best heat with this 61-year-old arm," Suplizio said with a laugh. 
"He supplied all his own power. He's giving me a terrible complex hitting all 
those rockets off me. I think he hit it so hard it knocked part of the stadium 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the earthquake-damaged upper deck and laughed again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that amazing?" Tim Salmon said. "Unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gary DiSarcina: "It was ridiculous. Pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson downplayed the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's BP," he said. "I don't think anything of it. If I hit one like 
that in a game, come see me. We can talk for three days. I didn't try to hit it 
up there. It just went." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds, still feeling the effects of the concussion he suffered Tuesday 
in New York, took batting practice and fielded ground balls. He couldn't make 
it through Thursday's pregame workout, complaining of dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting to see how far I can go every day," Edmonds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers said Edmonds probably won't play until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers believes he has found a leadoff hitter in third baseman Damion Easley, 
who was inserted into the spot April 19. "I think right now Damion is a better 
leadoff hitter (than Chad Curtis)," Rodgers said. "A month from now, I don't 
know." Easley went into Friday batting .272 to Curtis' .237. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Thigpen, who had a major league record 57 saves in 1990, was given his 
unconditional release by the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigpen, 30, who was signed by the Mariners as a free agent in January, made 
the team as a nonroster invitee out of spring training.But he struggled to an 
0-2 record and a 9.39 earned-run average in seven appearances with the 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most recent outing on Wednesday night against the New York Yankees, 
Thigpen gave up three earned runs and a grand slam in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Phillies put relief pitcher Larry Andersen on the disabled list and bought 
the contract of left-hander Andy Carter from Scranton-Wilkes-Barre. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen, 40, was put on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Thursday 
because of torn cartilage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "His knee is physically sound, but he is feeling enough discomfort to make him 
think about it, and that in turn is throwing off his mechanics," team physician 
Phillip J. Marone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen, who had arthroscopic surgery performed on the knee on March 28, said 
he was favoring the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably rushed back a little soo soon," he said. "I don't feel right. My 
mechanics aren't right. I think it's best for me and the club to get myself 
straightened out. It'll help everyone in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen will be sent to the Red Barons for a rehabilitation assignment, the 
team said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 25, joined the Phillies Friday night. It is the Philadelphia native's 
first stint in the majors.

TRACK AND FIELD; MEET BRINGS TOGETHER BEST IN CALIFORNIA, NEVADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA discus thrower John Godina, USC hammer thrower Balazs Kiss and Fresno 
State javelin thrower Todd Reich are among the national collegiate leaders 
expected to compete in the first California-Nevada Collegiate track 
championship meet this weekend at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Godina, the defending Pacific 10 Conference champion in the shotput and 
discus, has the nation's second-best collegiate mark in the shot this season, 
64 feet 5 3/4 inches, and is the national leader in the discus at 204-2. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has three other shotputters who have surpassed the 60-foot mark this 
season -- senior Joe Bailey, sophomore Jonathan Ogden and sophomore Mark Palin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiss, the defending NCAA hammer champion, has a season best of 248-10, 
although he regularly throws beyond 260 feet in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's trying too hard," USC Coach Jim Bush said. "If he can just break 
the national record (257), then I think he'll start relaxing. He's capable of 
approaching 270. I think he's going to be one of the world's great throwers by 
1996." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich is the national leader in the javelin at 258-5. 
</P>
<P>
 USC sprinter Inger Miller, the national collegiate leader at 100 and 200 
meters, and UCLA high jumper Amy Acuff, the national collegiate leader, are 
expected to compete among the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who suffered a season-ending foot injury in the Pac-10 meet last 
season, has a wind-aided best of 10.99 in the 100 and a wind-aided best of 
22.47 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuff, who cleared 6-2 1/4 to win the NCAA indoor championship last month at 
Indianapolis, hopes to clear 6-6 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Every men's and women's track team in the state will compete at Drake Stadium. 
Field events begin today at 10 a.m., with the first running event at 11:15. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Bob Larsen hopes the meet will revive local interest in the sport. 
UCLA regularly drew large crowds 15 years ago for dual meets, but interest has 
waned in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a concept that will appeal to people because it's a 
meaningful championship where you win a collegiate championship and you can say 
you're the best in this two-state region," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition today will consist mostly of preliminary heats, except for the 
men's and women's 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, field events begin at 10:45 a.m., with the first running event at 
12:15. Team and individual championships will be determined, with awards to the 
top three teams and finishers in each event.

TROUT ABUNDANT AS '94 SEASON OPENS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air horns were set to sound at dawn today throughout the Eastern Sierra, 
signaling the beginning of the general trout fishing season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, a 184-day affair that ends at sunset Oct. 31, will be different 
from others in that most of the hatchery-raised fish have already been stocked 
by the state, leaving some wondering how the fishing might be, say, in August 
or September, when trout plants are lighter than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are angry, others concerned about the new stocking schedule. But there 
are those who prefer to be philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here in the summer rely heavily on the plants," says Rick Rockel of 
Ken's Sporting Goods in Bridgeport. "They put the plants in at the launch ramps 
so they can go down there and absolutely annihilate the (trout). That is not a 
sporting proposition, and that is not what fishing is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 What Rockel means is, you might still be able to catch a limit. You'll just 
have to work a little harder at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Department of Fish and Game says it has little choice in the 
matter, citing a lack of cash necessary to keep so many trout in its hatcheries 
for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing is generally allowed 24 hours a day in Inyo County, and from one hour 
before sunrise to one hour after sunset in Mono County. Bag limit is five trout 
daily, 10 in possession after two or more days' fishing.  
</P>
<P>
 Special limits and restrictions apply in some areas and the DFG says it is the 
angler's responsibility to "know before you go." PETE THOMAS

'NORTH'S DISQUALIFICATION IS UPHELD; BIG 'CAP: RACING BOARD SUPPORTS STEWARDS' 
RULING GIVING STUKA THE VICTORY. HORSE OWNER, DESORMEAUX SAY THEY WILL GO TO 
COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Horse Racing Board has ruled that Stuka is the winner of the 
Santa Anita Handicap, but Phil Hersh, the owner of The Wicked North, is going 
to take the battle to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh, whose horse beat Stuka by 1 1/2 lengths in the $1-million race on March 
5 only to be disqualified by the three Santa Anita stewards, said Friday night 
that his attorneys are preparing an appeal of the racing board's decision. The 
board's commissioners announced earlier Friday that they had accepted hearing 
officer Steven Schwartz's recommendation that Hersh's original appeal be 
disallowed. Schwartz presided over a 6 1/2-hour hearing into the race on March 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 In another decision announced Friday, the racing board disallowed Kent 
Desormeaux's appeal of a five-day suspension resulting from his ride on The 
Wicked North. 
</P>
<P>
 The first four finishers in the Big 'Cap were The Wicked North, Stuka, Bien 
Bien and Myrakalu. After reviewing the race for 11 minutes, the stewards 
disqualified The Wicked North to fourth place for interfering with Myrakalu and 
moved each of the other horses up one place. The winner of the race will 
receive $550,000 with the next three horses earning $200,000, $150,000 and 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hollywood Park on Friday night, steward Pete Pedersen said that a ruling 
regarding Desormeaux's suspension would be issued today. The earliest day for 
the start of the suspension would be Wednesday, and theoretically that would 
disqualify Desormeaux from riding Soul Of The Matter on Saturday in the 
Kentucky Derby. States have a reciprocity rule regarding suspensions. Unlike 
California, Kentucky doesn't have a designated-race rule, which permits 
suspended jockeys to ride in important races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the owner of The Wicked North, I'm prepared to go all the way with 
this if necessary," Desormeaux said Friday night. He indicated that if the 
suspension takes effect next week, he will seek a court order that would allow 
him to ride in the Derby. Desormeaux also is scheduled to ride the undefeated 
Lakeway on Friday in the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs.

COMMENTARY; KENTUCKY DERBY SHAPING UP AS ONE FOR THE AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outset, the group of male thoroughbreds now age 3 was extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere began turning heads in the East last summer, the season in which 
2-year-olds begin sorting themselves and the advance toward the next year's 
Kentucky Derby begins. Since then, each development has complicated the puzzle; 
one by one, talented, physically impressive horses were introduced in 
remarkable numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no better place than Saratoga for a 2-year-old to make a reputation 
and Dehere made the most of that stage. Then, Holy Bull showed up and, in only 
his third start, upset Dehere in the Futurity at Belmont Park. In the West, 
Brocco came on in late autumn and won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. He was, in 
turn, upset by Valiant Nature in the Hollywood Futurity. Back in New York, Go 
For Gin reeled off three impressive wins, the last over 9 furlongs in the 
Remsen. 
</P>
<P>
 At year's end, with Dehere having won the divisional championship in a split 
decision, this group had established itself as the deepest in years. The field 
that will assemble next week in Louisville for the Kentucky Derby supports the 
original impression. This division is strong enough to withstand the loss of 
Dehere, who was injured early in the season, and Irgun, the late-developing but 
rising star who emerged in the Gotham Stakes and Wood Memorial, but stubbed his 
toe late and will not race in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, Holy Bull, Valiant Nature and Blumin Affair -- four of the top six 
horses on the experimental handicap of last season's 2-year-olds -- are at 
Churchill Downs. Had Polar Expedition's people not opted for the easy money in 
the Illinois Derby, only Dehere would be missing from the top six. Also at 
Churchill: Go For Gin and Tabasco Cat, who were weighted within 10 pounds of 
the highweight on the experimental, a trait common to many winners of the 
Kentucky Derby. Any of these might win the Derby without being an implausible 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Good horses in big races is what this is about. The hype may surround the 
animals, but it is orchestrated by people -- and this Kentucky Derby is as rich 
in colorful humans as in pedigree and performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing is unique among sports. Its legends almost never retire and they get 
more dangerous with age. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their animals, the humans connected to these horses have been rich in 
color from the outset. Robert Brennan, who owns Dehere, set the tone last 
summer, when he first began to field questions concerning possible ill effects 
of a long and busy juvenile season. Secretariat and Affirmed, Brennan often 
said, were heavily campaigned at age 2. Most others, meanwhile, were thinking 
of Dehere in terms of horses not named Secretariat or Affirmed, both of whom 
won the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of horsemen that ultimately has jelled in Kentucky is precious. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next 10 days, Jimmy Croll, who is 74, will be interviewed by 
hundreds of people holding microphones and notebooks next week and no one will 
understand a sentence. Croll and elocution are strangers. But he owns and 
trains Holy Bull, the favorite he inherited from Rachel Carpenter, a long-time 
client, when she died last year. Croll is also up for election to the Hall of 
Fame this year. If elected, his plaque in the shrine in Saratoga Springs might 
read: Trained Mr. Prospector, Housebuster and Holy Bull throughout their 
careers without uttering a single intelligible sentence. Gave new meaning to 
the term, "sound bite," Kentucky Derby, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 If Croll makes the Hall of Fame, Charlie Whittingham, Jack Van Berg and Ron 
McAnally will be waiting. At the moment, however, they're waiting in 
Louisville, Whittingham with Strodes Creek and Numerous, Van Berg with Blumin 
Affair, McAnally with Valiant Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The wry Whittingham is 81 and a legend with a proper title: The Bald Eagle. 
There are many bald trainers, but only one eagle. His biography is in the 
bookstores and it's a good read; his name is already on two Kentucky Derby 
trophies. He remembers Phar Lap. Whittingham will talk to hundreds of people 
next week and they will learn nothing whatsoever about what is really going on 
with Strodes Creek and Numerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Berg, 57, the down-home denim curmudgeon, is a legend in the making and 
the son of a legend, Marion Van Berg. His roots are in the midwest and he has 
one Kentucky Derby trophy bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham has a taste for the dry martini and is comfortable around the 
movie crowd. Van Berg is a no-nonsense workaholic in jeans and boots with 
horses scattered all over the country and more frequent-flyer mileage than 
he'll ever use. The affable, mild-mannered McAnally has no hardware from the 
Derby, but he trained John Henry, Bayakoa, Paseana and Tight Spot. McAnally, 
unlike almost all horse trainers, actually will say what's really on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The imagination bends in the attempt to envision four characters more 
dissimilar than Croll, Whittingham, Van Berg and McAnally. And the supporting 
cast is almost as good: Dick Mandella, the hottest hand in California; Randy 
Winick, son of Arnold Winick, who dominated Chicago racing for decades but is 
best known for his deal making; colorful, Brooklyn-born Nick Zito, trainer of 
1991 Derby winner Strike the Gold and no stranger to controversy; D. Wayne 
Lukas, once dominant, now struggling, without a Grade I victory in more than 2 
1/2 years and in Kentucky with Tabasco Cat, the horse who broke free from its 
handler in December at Santa Anita and ran over his son and assistant, Jeff, 
who still is recovering from nearly fatal head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblage of owners is unusually diverse. Brocco is owned by 84-year-old 
Albert Broccoli, who is actually called "Cubby." He is the producer of, among 
other things, the James Bond movies and a direct descendant of the botanist who 
invented broccoli by crossing Italian rabe with cauliflower. Soul of the Matter 
is owned by songwriter Burt Bacharach. Powis Castle's owner is Berry Gordy, 
founder of Motown Records. Verne Winchell, owner of Valiant Nature, made his 
money in doughnuts. Art Vogel, 72, of Hamburg, Iowa, made his in the popcorn 
business. His partner in Blumin Affair, 37-year-old Leroy Bowman, is a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 If this fails to materialize as a Derby for the ages -- and most do -- the 
week leading up to that two minutes May 7 surely will be one for a time 
capsule.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; A LONG, DIFFICULT DERBY JOURNEY MIGHT 
FACE THIS FRONT-RUNNER 
</P>

<P>
 At last one horseman might send his horse against Holy Bull for the lead in 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a 90% chance," owner Robert Perez said when asked about the tactics 
jockey Jorge Chavez will use with Ulises next Saturday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, a retired construction executive who was born in Argentina and has 
lived in New York for 35 years, has run two other horses in the Derby, both of 
them front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Cupecoy's Joy, running two years after another filly, Genuine Risk, 
had won the Derby, loped along on an easy lead. She was ahead by four lengths 
after six furlongs and was still on top at the quarter pole. That's when Gato 
Del Sol was circling the field. He made up 18 1/2 lengths and won by 2 1/2, 
Cupecoy's Joy fading to 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupecoy's Joy had sprinted in all but one of her 14 pre-Derby starts and 
rightfully was part of the parimutuel field at Churchill. That's the track 
handicapper's way of designating horses with the least chance of winning. A 
field horse hasn't won the Derby since Canonero II in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Perez had El Bakan, another field horse, in the Derby. El Bakan was 
undefeated in seven starts in Panama, but only one of the races was beyond 
seven furlongs. In his only race in the United States, two weeks before the 
Derby, he came within half a length of winning the Lexington Stakes at 
Keeneland before being caught by Grand Jewel. 
</P>
<P>
 El Bakan drew No. 19 for the Derby. His starting position was closer to the 
paddock than the inside rail, and he didn't fire leaving the gate. He finished 
next to last. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no shot with the post position," Perez said. "We lost the race at the 
draw. Then during the race he swallowed his tongue and choked on it. He also 
bled a little. The vet said he probably popped a blood vessel when he swallowed 
his tongue." 
</P>
<P>
 Equipped with a tongue tie, El Bakan stalked Personal Hope in the Preakness 
two weeks later and hung on for third, behind Prairie Bayou and Cherokee Run. 
At 51-1, he paid $14.60 to show, the best price from that pool in 12 years. 
Three weeks after that, El Bakan was set to run in the Belmont Stakes, but a 
fever prompted trainer Alfredo Callejas to scratch him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Perez will pay $26,000 -- $20,000 in entry and starting fees, and $6,000 
because his was a late nomination -- to run Ulises in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning four consecutive sprints by 24 1/2 lengths in Panama, Ulises 
made his U.S. debut the same way El Bakan did, in the Lexington at Keeneland a 
week ago. He battled Able Buck for the lead for three-quarters of a mile, then 
after they had worn each other out, Southern Rhythm rallied from next to last 
to win. Ulises wound up third, beaten by 7 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a bad race, actually, for a horse who had gone from five furlongs to 
1 1/16 miles, had two months between races and endured a grueling trip from 
Panama that required a week's stay in quarantine in Miami. Ulises didn't arrive 
at Callejas' Belmont Park barn until two weeks before the Keeneland race, then 
was shipped to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez bought Ulises for a price he wants to keep private. Ulises is a 
Kentucky-bred son of Temperence Hill and Jol'ski Too, a Bold Bidder mare, who 
was first sold at a yearling auction for $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "His pedigree gives him a right to win at a distance," said Perez, who has a 
large group of broodmares at his 80-acre farm in Otisville, N.Y. "Temperence 
Hill won the Belmont and the Travers (in 1980). The Lexington was a good prep 
race for him. He got tired, but that was to be expected, because it was his 
first race around two turns, and he had to fight Able Buck all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez does most of the talking for the stable, because Callejas, the son of a 
famous Argentine trainer, speaks little English. Callejas has been training in 
the United States since the late 1970s. He nearly swept the New York filly 
triple with Cupecoy's Joy, finishing second to Christmas Past in the Coaching 
Club American Oaks, the finale in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering El Bakan's fate in the draw a year ago, Perez is concerned about 
this year's draw. Post positions will be drawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Post positions will be a big factor," Perez said. "I don't want to wish 
anybody any bad luck, but it would be nice if Holy Bull drew the outside post. 
That might hurt his speed the way it did my horse last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The field for the 120th Derby seems to be settling in at 15. That means one 
horse will have to start from the auxiliary gate, which puts a horse even 
farther to the outside than his post position would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the number gets over 14, it doesn't make much difference, because the 
extra gate's got to be used," said Tom Wagoner, the Churchill Downs starter. "I 
would like to always have a field with just one gate, but that doesn't happen 
much anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The first year Wagoner worked as the Churchill starter, in 1974, it was the 
100th anniversary of the Derby, and owners believed it was an honor running a 
horse in the centennial. There were a record 23 starters, which prompted 
Churchill Downs to limit fields to 20, with preference given to horses with the 
highest earnings.

BRAHMAS STATE CASE PERFECTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the state volleyball championships next weekend at Santa Barbara City 
College, the Pierce College Brahmas will try to prove they are California's 
best for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City College is already convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce swept the Vikings, 15-13, 15-7, 15-9, in a Western State Conference 
match Friday night at Valley College to conclude a perfect regular season -- 
19-0, 18-0 in conference play. The conference title qualifies the Brahmas for 
the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's success this season has been no small feat. The Brahmas played home 
matches at Valley because the Pierce gym was condemned because of the Jan. 17 
earthquake. At one point they were holding early morning practices at three 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 It obviously didn't bother them much on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Vikings (12-6, 12-6), Pierce thrived behind the hitting of Gabe 
Higa, Jason Ring and Felipe Placencia and showcased a quick defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pierce took us out of our rhythm," said Ken Gregory, the Long Beach coach. 
"They served well and we couldn't pick up any blocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Higa, a freshman opposite hitter who played basketball at UC Irvine and Irvine 
Valley College before transferring to Pierce, repeatedly broke through the Long 
Beach defense and finished with 27 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring, a freshman outside hitter, contributed 17 kills and Placencia, a 
freshman outside hitter from Ventura High, had 14 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, Gabe Higa puts a lot of pressure on the other teams," Pierce Coach 
Ken Stanley said. "They have to overload on him and it keeps them off balance 
against our other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 After a tight first game, the Brahmas cruised in the second game after jumping 
to an 11-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach opened the third game with a 5-0 blitz, but Pierce went on an 11-1 
run before Higa's spike ended the match.

 Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands High took another two steps up the 
all-time state list in the girls shotput in the Ventura County track and field 
championships at Camarillo High Friday, but she has some climbing to do in 
order to reach her ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau improved her seasonal state lead in the shotput to 49 feet 2 inches 
and moved into a tie for seventh on the all-time state list, but she figures 
she has a legitimate chance much farther before the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, I think I can hit 55 feet," Tuimoloau said. "I think that's 
realistic once I get past 50." 
</P>
<P>
 If Tuimoloau reaches her goal, she will destroy the national high school 
record of 53-7 3/4 set my Natalie Kaaiawahia of Fullerton in 1983, but that 
fact doesn't seem to faze her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, I wasn't expecting 49 feet today," she said. "I'm kind of looking 
toward the bigger meets down the road, but I got out here and relaxed and 
things come together." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, whose previous best was 48-10 last week, had a series of throws 
that went 47-0, 49-2, 47-7 3/4 and 48-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 She also won her second consecutive title in the discus with a meet record of 
136-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kim Mortensen and junior Jeff Fischer of Thousand Oaks won the boys' 
and girls' 1,600 meters with impressive wire-to-wire victories and Jeremy 
Fischer of Camarillo won the long jump with a personal best of 23-0, but 
cleared a paltry -- for him -- 6-8 to win the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen did not set a blistering pace, coming through the first 400 in 73.2 
seconds, but she slowed little as the race progressed, passing 800 meters in 
2:30.1 and 1200 in 3:48.5, before finishing in a region-leading time of 5 
minutes 1.27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fischer, the third-place finisher in last fall's state Division I 
cross-country championships, looked like he was on the verge of being overtaken 
with 200 meters left in the 1,600, but he held off Javier Ramirez of Nordhoff 
and Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo in a personal-best of 4:20.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was second in a school-record 4:20.91 with Hernandez third in a 
personal-best of 4:21.63.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was not having a good time there on that last lap," Fischer said. "I 
actually could see their shadows coming up on me, but I decided I couldn't let 
them take me down after leading the whole race." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer was sky-high when he added eight inches to his personal best in 
the long jump, but he came back to earth when he failed to clear seven feet in 
the high jump for the second consecutive meet. He holds the region record at 
7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really disappointed," he said. "This is not the way I'm supposed to be 
jumping. I'm just being very sloppy on top of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I don't know what to do with myself and that shouldn't be happening 
at this time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey Jay of Ventura set a meet-record of 48.73 seconds in the boys' 400 and 
Cathy Trater of Agoura did likewise on the girls' 300 low hurdles.  
</P>
<P>
 Noah Walsh of Ventura won the 110 high hurdles with a wind-aided time of 14.87 
seconds and Ted Rust of Rio Mesa won the 300 intermediates in 39.13.

COLLEGES TO HOLD THEIR VERSION OF ALL-COMERS MEET

 A meet conceived two years ago will spring to life today when the 
California-Nevada collegiate track and field championships begin at UCLA's 
Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day meet that features teams from 22 colleges, including Cal State 
Northridge, is the brainchild of the California-Nevada Track & Field Assn., an 
organization of collegiate track coaches and promoters that was formed in 
December 1992 with the intent of reviving interest in college track in the 
adjoining states. 
</P>
<P>
 A meet pitting teams from the NCAA Division I, II and III levels -- as well as 
NAIA schools -- was viewed as a way of reaching that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that we needed to have something that is a marquee event for 
collegiate track and field in this state," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. 
"We felt that college track and field deserved a better shake than it was 
getting in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches such as Jim Bush of USC and Bob Larsen of UCLA characterize Strametz 
as the driving force behind the meet, but Strametz says that it would not have 
been possible without the help of Fresno State's Bob Fraley and Red Estes. Now 
that the meet has arrived, Strametz is delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every coach that I have talked to has said that their teams are totally 
pumped up about this meet," he said. "I think the kids are excited about it 
because it's the first time it's ever been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge junior Teresa Stricklin, who will compete in the women's shotput 
and discus, summarized the athletes' sentiments best during a press conference 
at UCLA on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love (the whole idea)," she said. "It's intense. It's going to have 
everyone there going against each other, head to head." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she was excited about the meet, Stricklin said simply, "I'm beyond 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Stricklin, Joe Hicks (men's shotput and hammer), Kristin Dunn (women's 
javelin) and Tannel House (women's long jump and triple jump) are some of the 
top performers from Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, USC, Fresno State and Stanford appear to have the strongest men's teams 
with UCLA, Fresno State and Stanford leading the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Five athletes who lead the yearly NCAA list will compete in the meet -- John 
Godina of UCLA in the discus (204 feet 2 inches), Balazs Kiss of Hungary and 
USC in the hammer (248-10), Todd Reich of Fresno State in the javelin (258-5), 
Sau-Ying Chan of China and USC in the 100-meter high hurdles (13.14 seconds) 
and Amy Acuff of UCLA in the high jump (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Inger Miller has wind-aided times of 10.99 in the 100 and 22.47 in the 
200 this year, is out with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's competition, which begins with field events at 10 a.m. and running 
events at 11:15, consists primarily of qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 The finals are scheduled for Sunday, starting with the women's javelin at 
10:45. Track events begin at 12:30 with the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase.

AS PITCHER, GASPAR FINDS HIS CALLING; BASEBALL: CAPISTRANO VALLEY GRADUATE 
STARTED AS AN INFIELD BUT NOW IS PEPPERDINE'S NO. 1 STARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Cade Gaspar held out as long as he could. He knew he had the arm of a 
potential pitching great, but from age 13 to 18 he ignored the call of the 
mound and played infield instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't stand pitching," Gaspar, 20, said. "Everyone else loved being the 
pitcher, but I thought it was boring just throwing the ball. I'd rather be part 
of the action, be in plays, hit." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of a few innings as a relief pitcher, Gaspar avoided the 
mound during his Capistrano Valley High School career. But when he reached 
Saddleback College, the forces of nature -- and reason -- began whittling away 
at his immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saddleback Coach Jack Hodges saw the arm strength, the smooth throwing 
motion, the tall, lanky build, it was as if Gaspar's body was crying out: Pitch 
me.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every scout who saw him said his future was on the hill -- Cade even knew 
that," Hodges said. "When he came here he told me, 'I know I'm going to be a 
pitcher, but this may be my last year to play a position. Give me a shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges did, and Gaspar earned the starting shortstop job in 1993. He hit .330 
with a team-leading five home runs and also pitched 40 innings, mostly in 
relief, going 2-1 with a 1.67 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Gaspar reached Pepperdine this season, he knew he had to yield to 
common sense. The Houston Astros had offered a six-figure signing bonus in 
1993, and not because they thought he'd be the next Cal Ripken Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from his first full season on the mound, his pitching career won't be 
ending soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, a 6-foot-3, 175-pound right-hander, began the season as a middle 
reliever but is now the Waves' No. 1 starter. The sophomore is 5-1 with a 2.33 
ERA and 60 strikeouts in 73 1/3 innings. Opponents are batting .192 against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Most impressed have been the pro scouts, who line the backstop with radar guns 
and marvel at his 90-m.p.h. fastball, sharp-breaking curve, and a lean frame 
they believe will fill out -- and become even 
</P>
<P>
 stronger -- in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe Gaspar has the best arm on the West Coast, and Baseball America 
recently projected Gaspar as the eighth pick in the upcoming draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they say, and I agree," said Rod Gaspar, Cade's father. "He's one 
of the best in the country. Maybe I'm prejudiced, but I can't imagine many kids 
having the stuff he has." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Gaspar knows more about baseball than your average dad. He played 10 years 
professionally, four in the major leagues, and was a reserve outfielder on the 
New York Mets' 1969 World Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod ordered his son not to throw breaking balls when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen too many kids hurt their arms because they threw curveballs at an 
early age," Gaspar said. "I wanted him to save his arm until he was older and 
stronger. He has a real fresh arm now, and that's one thing the scouts like a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Cade didn't turn many scouts' heads in high school. He was a good defensive 
player on a very good Capistrano Valley team, which won the Southern Section 
4-A championship in 1991, but he hit in the low .200s as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrible," Cade said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't drafted after high school, and his only college offers were from Cal 
State Los Angeles and UC Irvine, which dropped baseball after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted was to play baseball, and I was real concerned after having such 
a bad year," Gaspar said. "I went to Saddleback just hoping something would 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Something did. It wasn't good. On Jan. 30, 1992 -- the day before Gaspar was 
to pitch his first game at Saddleback -- Cade's 9-year-old brother, David, was 
diagnosed with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar pitched the next day but lasted only 2 1/3 innings. His heart wasn't in 
it. He quit the team to spend more time with his brother, who was confined to a 
bed in the UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 David had a rare, adult form of leukemia, and the disease virtually stormed 
his body. On April 11, only 2 1/2 months after the diagnosis, David died. 
</P>
<P>
 Cade still gets depressed when he thinks of David, whom he described as "the 
best athlete I've ever seen." When David was 8, he was good enough to play in 
the highest Little League division, against 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds. But Cade 
has also tried to find strength in David's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of my main motivations -- I've dedicated the rest of my life to 
him," Gaspar said. "I put his initials and number (3) in my hat. When I think 
of him, I think of how tough the kid was. He never complained, ever. I want to 
do the best I can for him, because he was the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he pitched only 2 1/3 innings and wound up as a redshirt for the 1992 
season, Gaspar was selected by the Astros in the 15th round in '92. The Astros 
retained his rights until the 1993 draft, and toward the end of the '93 season, 
Gaspar's stock soared to the point that Houston was offering a 
first-round-caliber signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pepperdine was Gaspar's dream school -- he followed the Waves' run to the 
1992 national championship -- and when Coach Andy Lopez offered a scholarship, 
he jumped at it. 
</P>
<P>
 He told scouts he was going to college, but that didn't stop the Yankees from 
using a late-round pick on him in 1993. Gaspar's mind was made up, though, and 
it was off to Malibu, where early control problems relegated him to a middle 
relief role when this season started. 
</P>
<P>
 About a month into the season, Gaspar asked Lopez if he could start. He got a 
chance in a game March 9 against Cal State Fullerton, and responded with two 
innings of no-hit ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think, just three years ago Gaspar couldn't stand the thought of 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm glad to be pitching now," Gaspar said. "I think I could have played 
a position in the pros, but I have a better future pitching. Hopefully I'll get 
drafted by a National League team. It would be fun to be able to hit again."

BLUE ANGELS BACK IN THE ACT; MILITARY: PREVIEW OF EL TORO AIR SHOW DRAWS 55,000 
TO SEE HIGHFLIERS, PARACHUTESTUNTS, GROUND EXERCISES AND DISPLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The skies over this Marine base roared Friday as an appreciative crowd of 
55,000 received a special preview of the 44th annual El Toro Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
 The base is expecting about 700,000 people today for a spectacular display of 
aerobatics by the Blue Angel precision-flying team and other stunt pilots and 
parachutists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air show is designed to promote aviation, both civil and military, and it 
gives a chance to those who want to learn more about it," said Marine Capt. 
Margaret Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's air show might be the last at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which 
is scheduled to close by 1997.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday's performance included a mock assault, in which dozens of Marines armed 
with M-16 rifles slid down ropes from hovering transport helicopters to attack 
an imaginary foe. A light armored vehicle sped across the 
airstrip-turned-battlefield, followed by several F/A-18 Hornet jets and a Huey 
assault helicopter that "fired" at the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlled explosions away from the airstrip and the grandstand simulated bomb 
blasts and gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crowd reacted with the most enthusiasm when, at 3 p.m., the Navy's 
Blue Angels took off in front of the grandstand. The six blue-and-yellow F/A-18 
Hornet jets sparkled as the crowd let out "oohs" and "ahhs" at the precision 
turns, geometric formations and high-speed antics. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, two jets flying side by side headed straight for the grandstand. 
At the last second, they deftly crossed paths and veered from the spectators in 
a chest-thumping roar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come every year for the last six years," said Frank Balough, 42, of 
Huntington Beach, sitting under a blue tent with friends and his 4-year-old 
son. "For us, it's a big social event, and we begin talking about it in January 
and February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because it lets me see just where our tax dollars are going." 
</P>
<P>
 As a special promotion on Friday, air show organizers set aside 5,000 VIP 
seats in the front row for disabled children, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, 
senior citizens and law enforcement employees throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so amazing what a chunk of metal can do the air," said Victor Pineda, 
15, of Newport Beach. "It's kind of scary too, because they fly so close 
together."  
</P>
<P>
 John Logan, 76, was amazed for different reasons. Logan, who assembled B-17s 
for Lockheed at its Burbank production plant in the 1940s, watched as the blur 
of a jet reached speeds of 400 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, our planes get better and better. I am so proud of our military 
and the Marines," he said from a front-row seat in the VIP section. He was one 
of a dozen residents from the Royale Health Care Center in Santa Ana who took 
advantage of the military's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this whole experience," Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's clear, sunny skies provided a perfect backdrop for the aerial antics. 
But for those tired of looking into the sky, there were other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Within walking distance from the grandstand were a display of civilian and 
military aircraft, food booths, rides and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn said the air show is important for many reasons, among them fostering 
better relations with the base's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community puts up with a lot of noise from us during the year. At the air 
show, they can come and see what we do and why the noise is necessary."

D.A. FINDS NO CRIMINAL INTENT BY FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office said Friday that an investigation 
into allegations that Westminster firefighters improperly accrued overtime pay 
determined there is "insufficient evidence" of any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson, who conducted the inquiry, declined to 
elaborate on the investigation other than to say that it "was pretty extensive. 
We covered all areas, including a wide-ranging review of payroll practices 
within the Westminster Fire Department. Considering that what we were looking 
for is proof of criminal wrongdoing, I can't discuss specifics. . . . I don't 
want to hurt anybody's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was launched after city officials charged in September that 
firefighters used loopholes in the payroll system, including lax reporting 
policies, to run up overtime charges of nearly $5 million since 1986. The 
allegation was based on a review done by the auditing firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
 A final report submitted April 12 by the accounting firm said that part of the 
overtime expenses from 1986 to 1993 were caused in part by poor management, 
faulty record-keeping and inherent flaws in the department payroll system. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said in a statement that it reviewed overtime 
pay, shift trades and other areas related to Fire Department staffing and 
payroll and concluded that "insufficient evidence exists to prove criminal 
intent on the part of any member of the Fire Department. Accordingly, criminal 
charges will not be filed in connection with this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that finding, the rancorous battle between the City Council and the 
firefighters showed no signs of ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Firefighters Assn. President Paul Gilbrook said that the district 
attorney's announcement was a vindication for the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very relieved," said Gilbrook, who was fired in February for allegedly 
exchanging sick leave for cash improperly and driving a firetruck with a 
suspended driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A. has come up with something that we have been telling everyone off 
and on for the past year. We knew all along we're honest people," Gilbrook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook said that city officials engaged in a "witch hunt" and retribution 
for firefighters' political activities, including supporting a candidate who 
opposed Mayor Charles V. Smith in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been exonerated," Gilbrook said. "This is good for the firefighters who 
have had very low morale." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, the firefighters union attorney, said that the district 
attorney's findings will enhance the firefighters' federal civil rights lawsuit 
filed last month against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still a sad day, because the Westminster firefighters firmly believe 
that the City Council will continue their vicious attacks on the firefighters," 
he said. "The mayor and City Council should resign now and allow citizens to 
replace them with people who are concerned with the safety of the city of 
Westminster." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, one of four council members targeted by the firefighters union for 
recall, said he was disappointed by the district attorney's finding. He said he 
will consider asking the Orange County Grand Jury to consider the same material 
submitted to the district attorney's office for criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard Jones, before Friday's announcement, had said that the city 
could file a civil lawsuit to recover the overtime pay that the firefighters 
may have taken improperly. Jones could not be reached Friday, but the mayor 
said the city would move forward with a civil lawsuit to recover overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major reason I'm disappointed is it's been a massive fraud by the 
firefighters union perpetrated on the taxpayers," Smith said. "And even though 
the district attorney didn't find sufficient evidence to prove their case in 
court, that doesn't absolve them. . . . That just blows my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's announcement came just as city officials completed 
dismissal hearings against two battalion chiefs, two captains and a paramedic 
over some of the same allegations that prosecutors were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that the city planned to continue with its effort to fire the 
firefighters it believes improperly took overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to have any impact on dismissals," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, city and union officials will face off in yet another arena, this 
one the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles over civil rights lawsuits filed by 
the firefighters union against several municipal officials, including Smith and 
three council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the firefighters union attorney, said that the suit before Judge Ronald 
S. Lew seeks the reinstatement of Gilbrook and another dismissed firefighter 
and payment of damages to the reputation of the two union officials as a result 
of the city action. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's decision also came just as the campaigning began for 
the June 7 election to recall Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, 
Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters union is supporting the recall drive, stemming from last 
year's cuts in the Fire Department budget that firefighters have alleged 
reduced the city's fire protection capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the cuts were part of the reorganization of the Fire 
Department and have led to an increase of paramedic services to residents 
living around Fire Station 3 on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not optimistic, Smith said he would continue to resist the 
recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to fight right to the end," he said. "It's going to end in a recall 
of four of us, and the takeover of the city of Westminster by the firefighters 
union, which is what they're trying to do."

GEAR UP FOR EASIER WAYS TO MARINE BASE; EVENT: OFFICIALS HOPE TO COUNTER THE 
AIR SHOW TRAFFIC JAM WITH ALTERNATIVE ROUTES, ROAD CLOSURES AND SHUTTLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Local law enforcement and transportation officials are preparing for 
monumental traffic jams when an expected 1 million spectators converge on this 
Orange County Marine base for the annual El Toro Air Show, one of the most 
popular military aviation shows in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials at the California Department of Transportation, the 
1994 El Toro Air Show will be the largest free event staged in California this 
year. California Highway Patrol and Caltrans officials said they expect up to 
500,000 vehicles to line the highways and byways leading to El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance is expected to swell this year because the Blue Angels, the Navy's 
precision-flying acrobatic team, are back after missing last year's show. This 
will be the 44th year of the El Toro Air Show, and it is not known if more 
shows are planned for the future. The base is expected to close by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be a pretty sight. People are going to have to leave early 
and bring along lots of patience if they're going to the air show this 
weekend," said Officer Angel Johnson, CHP spokeswoman in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police advise local residents and others who plan to drive on surface 
streets to check for road closures. Most thoroughfares leading to and from the 
base will be closed this weekend so that the CHP and Irvine police can manage 
the expected traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police said Barranca Parkway will be closed between 7 a.m. and 4:30 
p.m. from Ada to Alton Parkway in each direction today and Sunday. In addition, 
Irvine Boulevard from Alton Parkway to Jeffrey Road will be closed in both 
directions between 2:30 and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Road will be closed from Yale Avenue to Sand Canyon Avenue between 3 
and 6 p.m. during the weekend to eastbound traffic. Jeffrey Road will be closed 
from Walnut Avenue to Trabuco Road to northbound traffic during the same 
period, Irvine police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans announced that the Sand Canyon Avenue off-ramps from the Santa Ana 
Freeway will be closed intermittently or for extended periods in order to 
alleviate traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sand Canyon off-ramp from the southbound Santa Ana Freeway will be closed 
between 3 and 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and intermittently at other times as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sand Canyon off-ramp from the northbound Santa Ana Freeway will also be 
closed intermittently when traffic begins to back up on the street, Caltrans 
said. The closures will occur without notice, officials added. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Sand Canyon off-ramp from the San Diego Freeway will remain open. 
Just follow the signs to the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP is advising motorists going north on the Santa Ana Freeway to exit at 
Alton Parkway. Southbound motorists should exit at Jamboree or Jeffrey roads or 
Culver Drive, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators lucky enough to have VIP parking passes should exit at Jeffrey Road 
from the San Diego or Santa Ana freeways to Trabuco Road and follow the signs 
to the VIP parking area. All others will have to compete for parking on the 
4,500-acre base. Those who arrive late should be prepared for walks of up to 
one hour from their car to the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the parking lots will be wherever we can fit a car," said a Marine 
corporal answering a constantly ringing phone Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority recommends that spectators ride 
shuttles to the base. Buses will leave every 15 minutes between 8:30 a.m. and 
noon from the Santa Ana Transit Terminal at 1000 E. Santa Ana Blvd. and the 
Laguna Hills Transportation Center at Paseo de Valencia and Calle de los 
Caballeros. The fare is $2 each way. Getting Around The highway advisory radio 
station, AM 530, will update traffic conditions for the El Toro Air Show. Air 
show coordinators suggest the following routes to the base: Road Closures The 
following roads will be closed today and Sunday during the times indicated. 7 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Barranca Parkway: Ada to Alton Parkway, both directions. 2:30 
to 6 pm. Sand Canyon Avenue: At Burt Road, northbound. Irvine Boulevard: Alton 
Parkway to Jeffrey Road, both directions. 3 to 6 p.m. Trabuco Road: Yale Avenue 
to Sand Canyon, eastbound. Jeffrey Road: Walnut Avenue to Trabuco Road, 
northbound. Santa Ana Freeway: Sand Canyon , north and southbound off-ramps.

ORANGE DISTRICT TO NOTIFY PARENTS TEST IS OPTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN and BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Joining a growing statewide controversy over California's new educational 
testing system, the Orange Unified School District will send notices home next 
week telling parents they can pull their children out of the tests if they 
want.  
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from conservative and religious groups who charge that CLAS 
examines emotions instead of intellect and promotes anti-family values, Orange 
joined the Saddleback Unified School District and several others throughout the 
state in allowing parents to opt out.  
</P>
<P>
 The state's largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, also decided Friday 
to give parents that option. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires districts to administer the tests, but whether officials 
can require all students to take the tests is currently at issue in various 
pending court fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before Orange Unified trustees voted 5-2 late Thursday night to send 
home the notices, the State Department of Education notified school officials 
across California that such actions are permitted. In addition, state officials 
said Thursday that districts should make sample exam questions available to 
parents for scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exams, mandated by the state Legislature as part of education reform, 
are used to compare student work in each school against tough statewide 
performance standards in reading, writing, math and other subjects. The 
students are required to answer essay questions and are allowed to discuss 
material before answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have complained that the tests are inappropriate for young children 
and do not measure academics but rather politically correct thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to make sure that children are not questioned about their 
personal beliefs or family life," said Bob Levy, a Woodland Hills attorney who 
filed a lawsuit on behalf of two West Hills parents. "Children learn from their 
families, and the school board shouldn't interfere with that." 
</P>
<P>
 State education chief William D. Dawson said Friday that some critics are 
deceiving the public about the exams, which he defended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the tactics being used by those engaged in lawsuits and spreading 
misinformation about the contents of the clas exam are, in my view, intended to 
destroy performance-based assessment, and to discredit the public schools, 
rather than to cause any kind of constructive change," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Jacobson, the Orange school board member who sponsored the resolution 
Thursday night, said he believes parents should have a right to see tests their 
children take and that if the tests remain secret, children should not have to 
take them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything against the test. I haven't seen it so I can't really 
render a judgment," Jacobson said Friday. "If a parent wants to preview a test, 
they should have the right to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson and other board members who voted for the resolution, however, 
admitted that if many parents opt out, the tests' ability to measure 
performance of a school or district will be skewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not out to destroy the test, I'm just out to be fair to parents," he 
said. "That's a higher priority. If in the process the test is not accepted, 
well, the first priority is giving the parents the say-so they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is scheduled to begin administering the California Learning 
Assessment System tests to fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Thomason, who also was named in the lawsuit, said the tests "clearly" do 
not measure students' academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with academics and it's not pass-fail," Thomason said. 
"You don't have to be a person of any religious following to see that this is 
tracking what's going on in kids' homes."

BOY'S DEATH PUTS FOCUS ON BUS SAFETY; PRECAUTION: SOME ROUTES ARE RECHECKED AND 
POLICIES ARE RESTATED, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CHILDREN CROSSING STREETS. 
</P>

 The death of 7-year-old Thomas E. Lanni, hit by a pickup truck after he got 
off of a school bus here last week, has served as a wake-up call for Orange 
County school districts, many of which are giving their bus drivers special 
safety reminders, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wakes everybody up," said Francoise Deighan, bus driver supervisor for the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District. "It's a school bus driver's nightmare. . 
. . None of us wants it to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni was hit by a pickup truck on April 22 as he crossed Aliso Niguel, and 
died after being taken to the hospital. He was riding the school bus for the 
first time and had just begun attending Marian Bergeson Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 In many districts, newspaper accounts of the accident have been posted on 
bulletin boards to serve as a grim reminder to bus drivers of how quickly 
tragedy can strike along their routes. Some districts plan to include a special 
safety reminder in their next bus driver newsletter, while others have already 
held impromptu safety discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just reminding drivers of what they already know," said Ron Suttle, 
director of transportation for the Garden Grove School District, which 
transports about 7,000 students by bus to and from school each day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Saddleback Valley School District, where more than 2,200 students are 
bused daily, transportation officials this week physically reviewed all of 
their bus stops -- paying special attention to those where students disembark 
and have to cross a street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have redoubled our efforts and drivers are really on the alert for any 
potential problems," said Virginia Barnes, director of operations for Santa 
Barbara Transportation, which provides bus service to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Capistrano Unified School District, the school district in which the 
accident occurred, supervisors have had formal and informal safety discussions 
with drivers, said spokeswoman Jacqueline Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said that a training session on Tuesday, which had already been 
scheduled before the accident, will focus on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything related to safety on school buses will be discussed," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident has been on the minds of many bus drivers and supervisors this 
week, said Rita Finen, director of transportation for the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District and secretary for the California Assn. of School Transportation 
Officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's being heavily talked about amongst drivers," Finen said. "Every school 
bus driver who has driven for more than a half-hour has some kind of situation 
in the loading zone that causes them to miss a heartbeat or two. Loading and 
unloading is the most precarious part of school transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni, whose family had just moved to Orange County from New York, apparently 
got off the bus at the wrong stop. He was the first child off, and was hit when 
the pickup truck pulled around the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's parents contend that the accident could have been avoided if the 
district had followed safety procedures, and are angry over several major 
discrepancies in the school district's initial account of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the district was not intentionally inaccurate, but initially had 
very limited information. The district had originally stated that the child had 
darted into traffic to greet friends across the street, a statement Price said 
this week "was probably conjecture." 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires school buses to display flashing lights to stop traffic in 
both directions "when children are unloading from the school bus to cross a 
highway," except where traffic is operated by a traffic officer or traffic 
signal, according to the California Vehicle Code. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no traffic signal or traffic officer at the location where the child 
crossed. The driver of the pickup truck, whose name was not released, was not 
cited in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said that the school bus had not been displaying flashing lights to warn 
of children disembarking, because the bus has normally pulled away by the time 
the four children who live across the street cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has come to our attention that some students were crossing the street 
after the bus left, unbeknownst to us," said Price, who added that the district 
reassigned the four students to bus stops on the same side of the street as 
their residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the four students should have been assigned to stops on the other 
side of the road in the first place, making crossing unnecessary. She said in 
two cases, the error was made by parents who requested the wrong stops, and in 
two cases the fault was the district's. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman could not confirm whether Lanni had specifically asked the bus 
driver whether he was at the right stop and had been told to exit the bus. The 
boy's mother, Barbara Lanni, said she had spoken with the bus driver the 
morning of the accident and informed him that her son was unfamiliar with the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas W. Lanni, the dead boy's father, said Friday he was "horrified that 
lights don't flash when buses stop as a matter of course. To question whether 
they should is ludicrous. Common sense would dictate that they would, whether 
or not it's state law."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; MERLE HAGGARD JOINS FUND-RAISER CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Folks in this city are banking on country star Merle Haggard to draw a sellout 
crowd at a May 12 fund-raising performance to help fulfill their vision of 
building a community cultural arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Nemcik,a volunteer for the Buena Park Cultural Arts Foundation, which is 
sponsoring the concert with the support of the city's Fine Arts Commission, 
said tickets are available. Sponsors are also needed to make the fund-raising 
event a success, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggard, who will appear with his band "The Strangers," will perform two, 
45-minute sets beginning at 8 p.m. at Knott's Berry Farm's Good Time Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets range from $20 to $35 and all proceeds go to the foundation's building 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the third year that the foundation, formed in 1987 for the 
purpose of raising money for the cultural arts project, has put on a celebrity 
concert.  
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has raised about $35,000, a result of the success of the 
first-year concert in which entertainer Victor Borgeplayed to a sellout 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the foundation broke even after a concert by singer Mitzi Gaynor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to go back to our first success and have a sellout event," said 
foundation chair Bea Botelho. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nemcik also said that it has been tough for the foundation to find 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy these days," she said. "There's not a whole lot of donation 
money out there." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have no current plans to build a cultural arts 
center. A proposal to build a center on the campus of Buena Park Junior High 
School fell through last year because the estimated cost for a building that 
would meet the needs of both the city and the school district was more than the 
city could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have the vision of having a cultural arts facility in Buena Park, 
but where and when is yet to be determined," said Mayor Donald L. Bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Morgan,director of Recreation, Parks and Community Services, said that a 
cultural arts center at City Hall site could be built whenever the Civic Center 
is revamped. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Haggard concert are priced at $20, $25, $30 and $35. There are 
also a limited number of $100 patron tickets, which includes a reception with 
Haggard and his band after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets can be purchased at Buena Park Recreation Center, 8150 Knott Ave., or 
by calling (714) 562-3844.Tickets are also available by calling Knott's Berry 
Farm, (714) 220-5249.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CARTOONIST'S PULITZER DRAWS NEW ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's called the inverse law of political cartooning: the more hate mail and 
protests provoked, the better a cartoonist is doing his or her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, former South County resident and UC Irvine graduate 
Michael Ramirez won the Pulitzer Prize for his political cartoons in the 
Memphis Commercial Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ramirez's editor said, a local gay and lesbian group is planning to 
picket his newspaper office in protest of the conservative cartoonist receiving 
his profession's top prize. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes Ramirez very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You relish the negative letters and phone calls," said Ramirez, sitting on a 
terrace at the Ritz-Carlton hotel while on vacation in his home county this 
week. "People either love you or hate you, but that's OK, as long as you make 
them think." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a recent cartoon featuring President Clinton bowing to a sumo wrestler 
representing Japanese attitudes toward the United States. Wonders Clinton as he 
stares at the wrestler's massive backside: "Shouldn't he be facing us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ed and Fumiko Ramirez raised four doctors "and one black sheep" in Mission 
Viejo, says Michael Ramirez, now 32, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez attended UC Irvine and joined the campus newspaper as a writer. One 
day, the editor asked him to draw a cartoon about a student government 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Ramirez found himself apologizing to a group of university 
officials, thinking all the while: "These people are really hostile. This is 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, he knocked on the doors of major newspapers and cartoon 
syndicates while working for a series of weekly publications in Orange County. 
His break came shortly after he was hired by a San Clemente daily newspaper, 
the Sun Post, which was then owned by Howard Publications but was recently 
acquired by Freedom Newspapers Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 An editor of the Copley newspaper chain, who lived in San Clemente, saw 
Ramirez's cartoons and began to syndicate them nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pulitzer "came as a real shock," he said. "I've been in a coma the last 
few weeks. I had pretty much written it off, me being the antithesis of 
liberal, politically correct cartooning." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I'd get the Pulitzer. You have to have the kind of 
confidence as a political cartoonist," he said. "But I always thought I'd get 
it posthumorously ." 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, Ramirez's grin and sly asides are constant. Jets pass loudly 
overhead, preparing for the El Toro Air Show: Ramirez wonders if they're 
practicing strafing runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his work, Ramirez is the same, full of observations and dark humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to view myself as a cynical optimist," he said. "We want to fight the 
injustices, but we want to do it with a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Tennessee state legislators approved a bill at 2 a.m. giving 
themselves 43% pay raises at a time when the state was running a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ramirez cartoon depicted Gov. Ned McWhorter as a large, corpulent pig 
feeding from the public trough. Public outcry soon forced the Legislature to 
repeal the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best ideas just cut right to the core," Ramirez said. "If people can't 
get the point by looking at a cartoon right away, you haven't done your job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Political cartoons are a very powerful tool, and I think politicians know 
that."FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: A REAL-LIFE TEST FOR FOSTER CARE TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An office building in Orange will be transformed into a mall of reality today 
as 50 teen-agers in foster care get a taste of what life will be like when they 
set out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual program will feature real-life bankers, grocers, furniture sales 
people and others who will staff mock businesses throughout the building. The 
teen-agers will spend the day visiting each office in an effort to understand 
what it takes to create households of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers who organized the program said that foster children sometimes 
have difficulty adjusting to adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They often don't have parents to fall back on, so they need the survival 
skills," said social worker Robert Munoz. "It's been my experience that these 
(teen-agers) are more likely to fall into something, whether it's welfare, some 
illegal activity or homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers are forced to leave the foster care system on their 18th 
birthday or after they've graduated from high school, whichever comes last. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's program, sponsored by Lions Club, Orangewood Children's Foundation and 
Orange County Social Services Agency, is aimed at "providing some reality-based 
training in a nurturing environment," Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each teen-ager will receive an "identity" for the day, including a job, income 
and savings. For the most part, they will be prescribed service-level jobs that 
pay the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they will go to the various "offices" to open checking accounts, buy 
groceries, rent apartments, find bus routes, get telephone service and buy 
furniture. Volunteers from various Orange County banks, apartment-location 
services and utilities will guide the teen-agers through the process. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, the participants will be able to open real-life bank 
accounts and learn about receiving low-cost utility service. Instruction also 
will be offered in how to select compatible roommates and resolve conflicts 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 During the program, the each teen-ager's fictional circumstances will change. 
One participant, for example, might be told that he was fired from his job and 
must talk with a social services representative about finding new employment, 
Munoz said. Another participant might learn he fathered a child and is required 
to go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unique about this is the volunteers," Munoz said. "We've really 
created a community-based city." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY OKS TALL HOME; SUIT IS THREATENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite objections from residents, the City Council this week approved the 
construction of a 29 1/2-foot-tall French country chateau on Santiago 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 People who live around the 29,500-square-foot property, where the proposed 
6,788-square-foot luxury mansion will be built, objected to the home's 
height.They pointed out that no nearby homes exceed 24 feet in height and 
threatened to fight the council's decision with legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 City codes permit the construction of homes up to 25 feet in height. Since 
Thomas Q. Nicholson proposed building a taller house on his property, he needed 
approval from the City Council, which he received unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council meeting Tuesday night, Nicholson asked to be allowed to build a 
home 32 feet in height. But after neighbors complained and Mayor Barry L. Denes 
asked him to compromise, Nicholson said he would be willing to shave off 2 1/2 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a year of doing battle with neighbors over the design of his 
home, Nicholson, who twice redesigned the proposed million-dollar mansion, said 
he will begin construction in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his neighbors, Charles B. Davis, said the city made a mistake in 
allowing Nicholson to build his home. "Now, we'll have to go to court and I 
think we'll prevail," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and eight of his neighbors hired an attorney who told the council that 
the chateau "does not fit in the neighborhood" and will obstruct neighbors' 
views.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA/YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL DAY EXTENDED TO SATISFY 
STATE RULES 
</P>

<P>
 Kindergarten classes in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District will 
be lengthened starting next week to compensate for the time lost Wednesday when 
the funeral of former President Richard Nixon prompted the district to close 
its schools.  
</P>
<P>
 School officials are asking the state Board of Education to waive the minimum 
number of minutes of class instruction.If the waiver is granted when the state 
board meets on May 23, kindergarten will resume its regular schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 All other grade levels have accumulated enough minutes of class time, and are 
not affected by the canceled school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Assistant Supt. Sharon McHolland said she was confident the waiver 
would be granted, the district opted to lengthen the kindergarten schedule as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires kindergarten students to be in school a total of 36,000 
minutes in an academic year. One kindergarten school day is 200 minutes long. 
If the minimum number is not met, the district loses a share of its lottery 
proceeds as well as other state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school affected will determine how to make up the lost 200 minutes. 
According to McHolland the schools have two options: to lengthen the school day 
by seven minutes through the rest of the year or add 40 minutes to the day for 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools, such as Rose Drive, Brookhaven and Glenview elementary schools, 
have already notified parents that the school day will be lengthened by seven 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. James O. Fleming decided to suspend school Wednesday because several 
funeral-related street closures, including portions of Yorba Linda Boulevard 
and Imperial Highway, would have made safe bus transportation difficult.

 The Vietnamese Community of Southern California has planned two ceremonies 
today in Little Saigon to mark the 19th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the 
former capital city of South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's events will start with a flag salute ceremony, a memorial for those 
who died fighting the communists, and a series of political speeches condemning 
the Vietnamese communist government's record on human rights and democracy, 
according to a statement from the Vietnamese Community of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 to 1,000 people are expected to attend the morning event, which will 
be held at the group's headquarters, 15361 Brookhurst St. between Bolsa and 
McFadden avenues, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui Binh Ban, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, 
and four other prominent figures in the local community will speak. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a rally at 11 a.m. at 9321 Bolsa Ave. Several groups of 
political detainees and representatives of the Vietnamese Women's Community of 
Southern California will speak, said Chau The Phung, chairwoman of that 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, songs will be presented by some of those who were held in 
communist prison camps. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; YACHT-MAKER HOISTS BOAT ATOP BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local yacht-maker hoisted a 65-foot sailboat atop his two-story office 
building Friday, attracting the attention of people walking and driving by. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger MacGregor said he designed a recent remodel of his building to 
accommodate the 10,000-pound boat."I just figure it's time to jazz the place up 
a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The yacht rests on top of the two-story MacGregor Yacht Corp. building, at 
1631 Placentia Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, still under construction, was designed with a rolling roof line 
and blue-glass windows to look like huge waves. MacGregor, the company's 
president, said the heavy boat is bolted on to the roof and fully braced in 
case of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat is real, not a model, although there is no mast or rigging. MacGregor 
said the company has to keep one copy of every boat it makes in case the molds 
used to make the hulls become damaged or broken. If that happens, the roof-top 
yacht will come down and MacGregor will create a new mold from the hull, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And someday I'm going to finish that boat and then off I'll go," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGregor said his company builds one of the 65-foot cruising yachts about 
every three weeks. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TUSTIN BASE LAND SOUGHT FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scrambling for space to build schools without condemning developed properties, 
the Santa Ana Unified School District Board of Education has approved a plan to 
ask the federal government for a portion of the Tustin Marine Corps Air 
Station, which is scheduled to close in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to petition the 
federal government for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposal, the district would seek 75 of the 150 acres of land 
that lies within district boundaries. The district would build a high school 
there that could accommodate about 2,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Audrey Yamagata-Noji noted that the Base Reuse Committee opposes the 
plan, but pointed out that "we're basically looking at our best interests." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The only other possibility is to condemn acres of developed 
property."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL BOARD ADOPTS TRUSTEE ETHICS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District Board of Education has approved a new 
code of ethics for trustees that among other things requires members to honor 
restrictions on releasing confidential material to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The board this week unanimously approved the code, which members proposed last 
month after Trustee Rosemarie Avila allegedly leaked confidential documents to 
the press regarding two land deals. 
</P>
<P>
 After members pointed out that such leaks violate the California Education 
Code and could have resulted in a lawsuit against the district, the board 
majority voted 3-2 to censure Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 The code is the board's first, said district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy states that board members "shall not disclose confidential 
information acquired or available to them in the course of their service." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically the issue of confidentiality, which has sparked heated debate in 
past meetings, was largely ignored by the board as it tinkered with other 
wording in the ethics document. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those portions now state that trustees should consider issues without 
regard to partisan biases, abide by decisions made by the majority of the board 
and respect the views of all board members. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FINALISTS NAMED FOR UCI VICE CHANCELLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four people have made the final cut for the executive vice chancellor post at 
UC Irvine, the second-highest position at the university, officials said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 A screening committee has narrowed the list from 150 down to one woman and 
three men, a UCI spokeswoman said. The candidates will visit the campus this 
spring to meet publicly with students, faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members -- 10 faculty, two students, one staff member and one 
administrator -- plan to pick the new executive vice chancellor by June, UCI 
spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Executive Vice Chancellor Spencer Olin -- who filled the opening 
created by the departure of L. Dennis Smith late last year -- is not one of the 
final four candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin withdrew his name from consideration at the beginning of the search 
process in December, Young said. He will return to his former post as dean of 
humanities at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 A job description includes: filling in for Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening in 
her absence, acting as chief academic and budget officer on campus, 
coordinating the activities of vice chancellors, and acting as liaison between 
Wilkening and UC President Jack Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-member search committee, led by chemistry professor F. Sherwood 
Rowland, has trimmed the final list of candidates to Sidney Harris Golub, 
Wallace D. Loh, Michael A. Olivas and Myra Strober. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've handled a search this way," Young said, 
referring to how final candidates were announced publicly. "The chancellor is 
striving for as open a search process for senior-level positions as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Golub is the interim dean and provost of medical sciences at the UCLA School 
of Medicine, Young said. He specializes in immunology and has won prizes for 
cancer research. At UCLA, he heads the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Advisory 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Washington is home for Loh, who is dean of the Law School. 
He was also a visiting professor at the University of Texas as well as 
Vanderbilt, Emory and Beijing universities. 
</P>
<P>
 During Loh's stint as dean, enrollment of underrepresented students tripled, 
the number of female students in the school increased to equal that of men, and 
the caliber of entering students climbed into the top 10th of students 
nationwide, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivas teaches law at the University of Houston, is director of the 
university's Institute for Higher Education Law and Governance and heads the 
Law Center as associate dean. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivas also served as visiting professor and special counsel to 
then-Chancellor Donna Shalala at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1989 
and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Strober is a professor and associate dean for academic affairs at the Stanford 
University School of Education, Young said.  
</P>
<P>
 She was also founding director of the Center for Research on Women at 
Stanford, Young said, and headed a provost's committee to recruit and retain 
female faculty at the university. ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BUILDING ON SPIRIT OF VOLUNTEERISM

<P>
 More than 600 volunteers are scheduled to do renovation work on 11 homes and 
three buildings in Costa Mesa today as part of a nationwide building drive. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a nationwide program called Christmas in April, volunteers will 
repair the homes of the poor and elderly and also buildings used by nonprofit 
organizations. The Junior League of Orange County is the local program sponsor. 
The program has set a national goal to repair 3,500 homes and buildings today 
with the help of more than 125,000 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult day-care center at a community center at 661 W. Hamilton St. will be 
one such building. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot lumber salesman Scott Whitacre said he will lead co-workers from 
the Santa Ana store in painting and carpeting the five rooms occupied by the 
Harbor Area Adult Day Care Center. The group also plans to install blinds, 
fluorescent lights, raised planters and a garden box. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre said his store is donating most of the materials, and about 40 
members of the staff are volunteering. He said the store takes part yearly in 
the Christmas in April project. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Prather, director of the day care center, said the repair work comes at 
a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are kind of a shoestring operation," Prather said. "We put all our money 
into the program rather than the facility. We are really, really excited about 
what they are going to be doing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Prather said his organization rents the building from the city and that the 
day-care center serves frail people older than 55. It is open Monday through 
Saturday and offers exercise classes, educational talks, music therapy, pet 
therapy and a place for people to socialize, Prather said. 
</P>
<P>
 All Christmas in April volunteers will gather at the Costa Mesa Senior Center 
before going to various sites to do the work.WILLSON CUMMER

 UC Irvine is hosting the fourth annual Southern California Women's Studies 
conference today to address the Tailhook scandal, violence against women and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This conference is called "Feminist Dialogues Across Disciplines: Students and 
Teachers Learning Together" and is sponsored by 10 Southland college and 
university groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone may attend any of more than 20 workshops on topics such as feminism and 
religion, and women as mothers and scholars, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghana-born writer, actress and educator Akuyoe will perform "Spirit 
Awakening," a one-act narrative play. Akuyoe, a former African princess, uses 
poetry, monologue and drums to tell her story, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her transformation from a woman trying to repress her black identity to fit in 
a white world to finally rediscovering her identity in Hollywood is at the 
heart of her performance. Akuyoe has performed at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The conference is at the UCI campus and costs $30. Registration begins at 8:30 
a.m., and the conference lasts from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Akuyoe's performance is 
free and begins at 7 p.m. at the UCI Social Science Laboratory and Hall, Nelson 
said. Information: (714) 856-4234.ALICIA DE RADO

NON-TEACHING WORKERS IN ORANGE OK STRIKE; LABOR: SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS AND FOOD 
AND CLERICAL EMPLOYEES WILL BE AFFECTED BY JOB ACTION MONDAY. DISPUTE IS OVER 
CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Angered over their new contract, the union representing non-teaching employees 
of the Orange Unified School District -- including bus drivers, food service 
and clerical workers -- will strike beginning Monday, officials announced 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, who persevered through a massive union sickout earlier 
this week, said schools will maintain regular hours during the walkout.The 
district is urging parents to drive students to school during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are preparing for a strike Monday," Gretchen Hanson said Friday night. 
Hanson will assume duties as interim superintendent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Employees Assn., which represents 1,160 employees, has 
accused the district of unfair labor practices. The district has steadfastly 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said a canceled meeting with district officials Friday 
afternoon led to the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they were rubbing our noses in the fact we want to sit down and 
talk," said union President Becky Mayers. "The anger is building with the 
troops, and it really peaked this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 About 900 classified employees staged a one-day sickout Tuesday, causing 
considerable delays in student bus transportation, changing cafeteria menus and 
closing down some school child-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The union wants to renegotiate a controversial board-imposed contract that 
cuts health benefits, imposes furloughs and empowers the district to reduce 
hours or lay off workers without notice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, district officials say negotiations on the contract, which took 
effect April 10, are over. But district officials said they were willing to 
talk about resolving the dispute over unfair-labor charges. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials defend the contract with classified employees, arguing that 
the $485,000 in savings it provided helped close a $2.2-million shortfall in 
the district's $107-million budget.

ATM HEIST PREVENTED BY DEPUTY, OFFICIALS BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County sheriff's deputy may have prevented a robbery when he chased 
and caught a man he spotted hiding in the bushes between two banks, a sheriff's 
spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The man might have been waiting for a chance to rob someone at the nearby bank 
teller machines, Lt. Dan Martini said.The suspect, identified as Arthur William 
Bedford III, 33, was in custody Friday on suspicion of grand theft. The 
arresting officer found a pawn shop ticket in Bedford's pocket for jewelry that 
had been reported stolen, Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 11 p.m. Thursday when Deputy E. Macias spotted a man 
in dark clothing lurking near the bushes between the Bank of America and the 
Crown Valley Bank. Macias focused his patrol car's spotlight on the man, who 
ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the deputy ran after the man, who might have dropped an unloaded, 
.40-caliber semiautomatic handgun during the chase. Authorities recovered a 
gun, but because deputy Macias did not seem him drop it, authorities cannot 
charge him with unlawful possession of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that when the deputy caught the man at the bottom of a hill near 
Crown Valley Parkway and Puerta Real he found one .40-caliber round in the 
suspect's pocket. The deputy also found the pawn shop ticket, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of robbery based on 
the jewelry, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the deputy might have saved someone from being mugged at the 
teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really feel deputy Macias thwarted a robbery," Martini said. "This is a 
(warning) for South County."

CHANGES AT JUVENILE COURT SCHOOLS URGED; EDUCATION: THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 
SAYS MANY OF THE GRAND JURY'S REQUESTS FOR THE FACILITIES ARE NOT FINANCIALLY 
FEASIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury on Friday called for major changes in the 
county's 11 juvenile court schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most significant suggestions, however, were immediately rejected 
by the county school superintendent as financially unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that has to do with money is a killer," Superintendent John F. Dean 
said. "There's a bottom of the financial well, and we've hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's major recommendations were that full-time principals and 
counselors be hired for each of the schools, that the number of instructional 
aides be increased and that various safety measures be implemented, including 
training teachers in crisis and violence management and the installation of 
alarm systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are saying they're doing a hell of a job with what materials and resources 
they have, but that improvements need to be made," said Jim Cooper, chairman of 
the grand jury's juvenile services/education committee, which spent six months 
preparing the report. "These schools make up one of the most unique school 
systems that most people will ever experience, and we felt that this was a 
particular area of education in Orange County that needed to be given a hard 
look." 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,000 students pass annually through the 11 juvenile court schools 
operated by the Orange County school district. While 85% of them are juvenile 
offenders charged with serious crimes, the report said, 15% are victims of 
child abuse ordered into the system for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make up a very interesting body of students," Cooper said. While some of 
the juvenile court schools are institutions at which the students live around 
the clock, he said, others are daytime facilities to which they commute. 
Whatever the case, Cooper said, "this is extremely important because these are 
their schools of last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 In reacting to the report, Dean said some of the schools have too few teachers 
and students to support the expense of a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to justify a principal for four teachers and 60 kids," he said. "If 
the public looked at that, I think they would say, 'Come on, you don't need 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the idea of hiring more counselors and teachers' aides, Dean 
said, "I would love to have more help, and we will put those people in as soon 
as we can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding training teachers to cope with violence, as the crimes for which 
youthful offenders are convicted become more violent, Dean said the district 
already does that. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, funding is being sought to equip each teacher in a juvenile 
court school with a walkie-talkie to report any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buzzer alarms are not as effective as walkie-talkies," said John Peshkoff, 
director of the juvenile court schools system, regarding the report's 
recommendation. "We're more interested in having a good communications system." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report inspired at least one political response from a 
candidate planning to challenge Dean in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It validates my concerns about the problems in the leadership down there," 
said Darrell Opp, chief educational officer of the Central County Regional 
Occupational Program. "If we had sufficient (financial) reserves, it would" pay 
for all this.

 6 ARRESTED IN HIJACKING OF TRUCK WITH GOODS FOR ROBINSONS-MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six men were arrested after stealing a tractor-trailer at gunpoint near South 
Coast Plaza Shopping Center, Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rig, driven by a Pomona man, was hauling two trailers to Robinsons-May 
department store when two men jumped into the cab at the Bristol Street exit of 
the San Diego Freeway at 10:50 p.m. Thursday, Detective Frank Rudisill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Manuel Marquez, 33, told police that when he stopped for a traffic 
light, the men, at least one of whom was armed with a handgun, approached from 
both sides of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering Marquez to the floor, the hijackers transferred him to a car 
and drove him to Anaheim Hills, where he was released unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez then called Anaheim police, who contacted Costa Mesa police and 
Robinsons-May security and broadcast a description of the tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police located the trailers in the 700 block of 61st Street, and 
the tractor about half a mile away. In addition to the $50,000 tractor-trailer, 
police recovered all $500,000 worth of missing merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 The six Los Angeles County men arrested were identified as Carlos Nimrod Gomez 
Moreira, 35; Alfonso Garrea Garcia, 30; Braullio Diaz, 26; Jesus Lopez, 43; 
Martin Aguilar Meras, 28; and Jose Guadalupe Villanueva, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 All six men were returned to Costa Mesa, where they are being held on $50,000 
bail each, according to Rudisill. The tractor-trailer and merchandise also were 
returned to Orange County.

LAGUNA NURSE GETS JURY AWARD IN CRASH CASE; COURTS: WOMAN WHO CONTENDED SHE 
SUFFERED FROM MEMORY LOSS, LACK OF CONCENTRATION AFTER 1990 COLLISION IS GIVEN 
$504,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury awarded $630,000 Friday to a Laguna Beach nurse who contended she 
suffered brain damage stemming from a collision with another motorist at a 
Laguna Hills intersection four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury also found that Rosemary Palmer was 20% 
responsible for the crash, which means that her award will be reduced by that 
amount, to $504,000. The money is to be paid by the other driver's insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the accident, Palmer's nose was fractured and she subsequently suffered 
from memory loss and lack of concentration, her attorney James Traut said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Betty Cooper, now 84, of Laguna Hills, declined to discuss the 
jury's decision. Palmer, 30, also declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traut said Palmer had been northbound on Moulton Parkway in Laguna Hills on 
July 13, 1990. Cooper, who was traveling west on La Paz Road, failed to yield 
the right of way and attempted to make a left turn in front of Palmer, he said. 
Palmer's car then collided into Cooper's car in the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither driver was cited in the accident, in which Cooper suffered seven 
broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the nine-day trial, Palmer contended that she was traveling within the 
55-m.p.h. speed limit, but Cooper estimated Palmer's speed at 72 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the testimony centered on whether Palmer's documented brain damage was 
due to the accident. The defense contended her problems were psychologically 
troubles tied to changes in her personal life immediately after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer had worked as a registered nurse at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo until a year before the accident but quit when she 
became engaged to a neurosurgeon on staff at the hospital. She had been 
accepted to law school. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the trial, Traut argued that because of the accident his client 
could no longer work as a nurse and was forced to drop plans for law school. 
Traut said that after the accident, Palmer began suffering from memory loss and 
a lack of concentration, making it impossible for her to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for her to even comprehend a book now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Tom Mei, who represented Cooper, argued that the lapses could 
likely be the result of vast changes in Palmer's personal life. "We think it's 
a psychological disorder brought about by things not connected to the 
accident," Mei said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffery Schaeffer, a neuropsychologist called by the defense to testify during 
the trial, said that Palmer could be suffering from "psychological overlay" 
brought on by changes in her life, including getting married two days after the 
accident and having three children in three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palmer's attorney refused those contentions and introduced testimony from 
a neurologist and a neuropsychologist, who said Palmer's memory losses and lack 
of concentration were linked to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors awarded Palmer $380,000 for future loss of wages and $250,000 for other 
damages including medical bills.

THE PACE REMAINS BRISK AT NIXON LIBRARY; TOURISM: EVEN THE GIFT SHOP HAS A 
20-MINUTE WAIT. CAMPAIGN SOUVENIRS AND MEMORABILIA OF THE LATE FORMER PRESIDENT 
ARE HOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The hour-long wait Friday to sign the guest book at the Richard Nixon Library 
& Birthplace was too long for Carol Sullivan to face. So was the wait to file 
past the site where the former President was buried Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 So Sullivan, 43, a tourist from Atlanta, went to the library's tiny gift shop, 
thinking she could at least get in there easily. 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck. There was a 20-minute wait there too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to buy some postcards for my kids," Sullivan, 43, said as she 
stood in line in the flower-filled museum lobby. "Nixon's time was an important 
one for us baby boomers." 
</P>
<P>
 Business at the gift shop has been brisk since Nixon's funeral, said gift shop 
manager Bobbie Way, who was letting just 10 people into the shop at a time. 
"The Elvis postage stamp day was big, but nothing compared to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the ubiquitous postcards, other hot gift shop items were old campaign 
buttons -- from both the 1952 and 1968 elections -- and birdhouses modeled 
after the simple, white-frame house that Nixon lived in as a child, Way said. 
</P>
<P>
 Videotape sales were also up, with "Nixon About Nixon" being particularly 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Many visitors, some from as far away as New York, were happy with the tried 
and true: refrigerator magnets sporting a color photo of Nixon, and Nixon 
library baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Items with a higher collector value, such as campaign posters and memorabilia 
from earlier Nixon visits to the library, had for the most part already sold 
out on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been just a little slower today," store employee Michelle Shelton said, 
as she moved from the cash register to customers who needed help to the 
constantly ringing telephone. "People came in here yesterday the minute we 
opened up, trying to get their hands on collectibles." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop carries several T-shirts, including one with a picture of a smiling 
Nixon giving the thumbs-up sign and the words: "Nixon in '96: Tan, Rested and 
Ready." It wasn't too popular among Friday's visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon library isn't the only outlet for T-shirts of the 37th President. 
Part-time entrepreneurs are marketing their own Nixon mementos, just as people 
did with "I survived" shirts after the 1992 Los Angeles riots and January's 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny Hastings, a paralegal, is one of them. He and a buddy drove all the way 
from Medford, Ore., to sell their $18 homemade T-shirts that say, "Richard M. 
Nixon, you made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said he thought selling the T-shirts around the library during the 
public viewing of Nixon's casket and the funeral later would be in bad taste, 
so he hit small, independent clothing stores in the area, who bought more than 
100 of the shirts for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very big Nixon fan," Hastings said. "The idea was to pay for my trip 
down here to see the funeral. I missed the viewing because I was running 
around, but I did pay for the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The employees at the library gift shop said they don't expect the crowds to 
thin out for several months. Even then, they expect sales to still remain high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe before people didn't know (the library) was here," shop manager Way 
said. "Now they do.

SUMMIT CONSIDERS COUNTYWIDE TOURISM AD PLAN; INDUSTRY: PARTICIPANTS TOSS OUT 
PROMOTION IDEAS. A PANEL WILL EXAMINE WHETHER ANY ARE FEASIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tourism executives and top political leaders in Orange County agreed Friday 
that the region has much to offer visitors but isn't doing enough to market 
itself as a destination. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether to proceed with a countywide promotion plan, and how to pay for 
it, were left undecided at the county's first "Tourism Summit." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which drew about 100 executives to the Anaheim Convention Center, 
was organized by two county supervisors and Anaheim's mayor to try to build 
consensus on an overall marketing strategy in the $4.8-billion vacation and 
travel industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas floated were whether to ask cities to turn over a portion of 
their hotel room taxes, or try to find funding from John Wayne Airport or the 
transit bus system. They were turned over to panel of seven to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 While cities like San Diego and Las Vegas have unified advertising promotions 
to lure billions of dollars in tourist spending, Orange County's efforts have 
been largely fragmented among individual attractions and convention bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Summit participants appeared to favor a campaign to create a separate, 
distinct identity for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make Los Angeles a suburb. Stay here and maybe you'll get into 
L.A.," said retired Disneyland President Jack Lindquist, one of the panel 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The separatist movement has been steadily gaining strength amid the string of 
misfortune that has hit Los Angeles -- from riots and wildfires to floods and 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry picked up steam with the killings last month of two Japanese 
students in San Pedro, heavily publicized in Japan as another example of 
rampant gun violence in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orange County has been largely untouched by the streak of calamities, 
executives complain that Los Angeles' bad publicity has hurt tourist attendance 
at Disneyland and Orange County's myriad other visitor hot spots, particularly 
among the big-spending Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, other cities have backed their convention and vacation 
businesses with major advertising campaigns. Las Vegas' visitor bureau, for 
instance, is spending $16.4 million to promote a family-friendly image, 
compared to Anaheim's promotion budget of $250,000, according to the Anaheim 
Area Visitor & Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, said Anaheim Marriott General Manager Ned Snavely, is that the 
region lacks "marquee value" compared to those. Visitors know Disneyland, but 
don't know Orange County and all it has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, participants agreed, is to find a way to market the county as a 
whole. "We need to sell the county and look at it as a collective," said 
Anaheim convention bureau President Charles Ahlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just where to find the money for such a program, however, was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the core of this is the need for more funding, both from the public and 
private sectors," said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, who co-chaired the event with 
Supervisors William G. Steiner and Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he wants to explore whether the county's 31 cities that already 
tax hotel stays -- Anaheim's "transient occupancy tax" rate is 13%, for 
instance -- would be willing to dedicate part of it to overall promotion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am proposing that, as a matter of consistent policy, that a portion of the 
existing tax be dedicated to marketing the county as a whole," Steiner said. "I 
am not proposing that cities have a bed tax or (that it) be increased. I think 
we can do this job with our existing resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner added that he wants to investigate whether funds might be available 
from John Wayne Airport, the Orange County Transit Authority or tidelands 
sources.  
</P>
<P>
 He and Vasquez said they are inclined to support a county tourism office, 
similar to the state's. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ahlers said he favors funneling any money into countywide promotion and 
advertising instead of creating a new tourism office. Luring Tourism How

SEAL BEACH; SEAL BEACH SAND-REPLENISHMENT PROGRAM DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-awaited sand-replenishment program aimed at strengthening the city's 
eroded coastline has been delayed by several weeks and will probably begin in 
early May, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to dump up to 150,000 cubic yards of sand from a Santa Ana 
River flood-control project onto a narrow beach between Seal Beach Pier and 
Anaheim Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials stressed that the project remains on track. The delay was caused 
because a contractor working on the flood-control project had a prior 
obligation to deliver sand to a concrete manufacturer. That delivery must be 
completed before sand can be trucked into Seal Beach, Mayor Gwen Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All indicators still look good," she said. "We are just trying to satisfy all 
the hurdles." 
</P>
<P>
 The city still needs approval from the Army Corps of Engineers for the 
sand-replenishment program. The California Coastal Commission and the 
Department of Fish and Game have already approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend as much as $500,000 on the project. Most of that money 
will go to transport the sand from the Santa Ana River to Seal Beach, which is 
expected to take several days.

AGENCY SEEKS TO REVOKE LICENSES OF 6 INSURANCE AGENTS; CONTRACTS: STATE 
OFFICIALS CITE THEIR ASSOCIATIONS WITH 2 FIRMS ACCUSED OF SELLING DECEPTIVE 
HOME-COMPANION PLANS TO SENIOR CITIZENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The California Department of Insurance recommended Friday that six insurance 
agents, including four in Orange County, have their licenses revoked because of 
their connection with two companies accused of marketing deceptive home-care 
companion contracts to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contracts, Vanguard Assisted Care Inc. of Lake Forest and Retired 
Home Owner Assn. Inc. of Simi Valley provided companions to take care of 
seniors in their homes for a flat fee of $5,900 to $8,000, plus annual fees of 
$400 to $600, as an alternative to nursing homes, which can cost as much as 
$4,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency said contracts were marketed deceptively to 600 senior 
citizens in Southern California, and that the service provided was more like 
maid service than in-home medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "These contracts were marketed in such a way to prey on the fears of senior 
citizens who do not want to move into a nursing home, should some disability 
affect them," Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said. "Unfortunately, these 
glorified maid contracts were compared to long-term care policies and 
nursing-home policies that provide skilled care." 
</P>
<P>
 The agents named are Stanley Norman of Lake Forest; his son, Jeffrey Norman of 
Aliso Viejo; Barbara Bufty, formerly of Fountain Valley; Gary Cuccia of San 
Clemente; his brother, Stephen Cuccia of Menifee; and Jim Cravens of Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents said the contracts were not insurance policies, according to 
Garamendi, but the state ruled that the six agents were, in effect, selling 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents say they simply provided non-medical custodial care to compete with 
nursing homes at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most ridiculous situation that anyone could ever see," Jeffrey 
Norman said. "It's a joke. We provided a better service and better quality of 
life, and we're getting penalized for it. The Department of Insurance is trying 
to protect big insurance companies at the expense of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cravens also denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name is coming out in the papers, and I've never been in front of a judge 
on this," he said. "We were just trying to give an alternative to these rising 
home-care costs that the insurance companies aren't covering." 
</P>
<P>
 Bufty, reached at her home in Huntington Beach, said she believes the plans 
were the best alternative to nursing homes that seniors could get. She said she 
was unsure why Vanguard filed for bankruptcy but said the state's actions may 
have helped cause the collapse.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mother is 83 and unable to care for herself," she said. "If this plan were 
available to her, it would have saved my family a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The other agents could not be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, state officials filed a lawsuit against Retired Home Owner Assn. 
The company has since sought bankruptcy court protection, leaving its contract 
holders with apparently worthless agreements, the Department of Insurance said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Vanguard also was ordered to cease its marketing. But Jeffrey Norman, who said 
he disassociated himself from Retired Home Owner Assn. before becoming 
president of Vanguard, said it is still providing non-medical custodial care to 
its 39 contract holders. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations against the six agents will be heard in an administrative 
hearing, when it will be determined whether their insurance licenses should be 
suspended or revoked.

FUGITIVE JAILED IN DRUG CASE INVOLVING RAMS CORNERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal authorities arrested a fugitive suspect Friday in the cocaine 
possession and conspiracy case involving Los Angeles Rams cornerback Darryl 
Henley and three others. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. marshals detained Willie Haghey McGowan, 30, in San Diego, where he is 
being held until a court appearance Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Deidre Z. Eliot would not comment on exactly how McGowan 
was tracked down or where he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be divulging some of the investigative techniques in the case," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGowan of Duarte was indicted in December along with Henley, former Rams 
cheerleader Tracy Donaho and two others in a conspiracy to transfer cocaine 
shipments from Henley's Brea home to drop-off points in Atlanta and Memphis, 
Tenn., using Donaho as a courier. Until Friday, McGowan had been a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the indictment, prosecutors alleged that McGowan worked with Henley to 
distribute the cocaine, contending that he met with Donaho last July at 
Henley's home and asked her to carry a suitcase of cocaine on a flight from 
Burbank to Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 McGowan also instructed Donaho to bring a suitcase full of cocaine on a plane 
from Ontario International Airport to Atlanta, the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaho has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and is 
expected to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against the other defendant 
in a trial scheduled Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 McGowan's arrest is good news for prosecutors, who wanted all the defendants 
tried together, Eliot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always pleased when we can try everyone at once," she said. "It makes 
things easier." 
</P>
<P>
 In cases with multiple defendants, prosecutors are normally hampered if one is 
missing because the others usually try to mount a defense that blames the 
defendant absent from the courtroom.

CAMP EVICTEES TO GET TEMPORARY HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have decided to provide temporary housing to a group of 
homeless people who were among those evicted last month from an encampment 
among thick bushes at a Beach Boulevard exit from the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency decided this weekto spend some $10,000 to rent a 
three-bedroom house and a two-bedroom apartment that will be available to the 
homeless people -- nine men and one woman -- by next month.The money will come 
from the city's fund for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to help as long as they want to help themselves," Mayor Charles V. 
Smith said. "If they can turn their lives around, that will be a good 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will run for three months and be limited to the 10 from the 
encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned that this will become a precedent," Smith said. "But this 
will be only for a short time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster-based Shelter for the Homeless will donate an additional 
$4,300 and will manage the program, said Jim Miller, the nonprofit group's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful decision," Miller said. "Other cities would have simply 
asked the homeless people to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The group will also receive food, furniture, utilities and help in finding 
jobs. The men will move into the three-bedroom house and the woman into the 
apartment, possibly as soon as May 4, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 A case manager will live at the house and anyone using drugs or alcohol will 
be evicted.

 Campaign funds -- An addition error by the office of Assemblywoman Diane 
Martinez (D-Rosemead) caused Common Cause to rank Martinez as the top 1993 
campaign fund raiser among Assembly freshmen, as reported in The Times. She 
actually raised $41,784 instead of $262,252. Martinez's office said it 
over-reported what she raised in 1993 by adding funds that were received in 
previous years.
