 Flails of the city: Prospective jurors for a bar-brawling case in Hollywood 
Municipal Court were asked whether they'd ever witnessed a fistfight as adults. 
Some related real eye-openers, or, rather, eye-closers. Even a slightly built 
psychologist from Beverly Hills had a story. He began, "Well, I was at this 
homeowners association meeting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One title L.A. would be happy to give up: The FBI announced a while back that 
there were 37% fewer bank robberies in Southern California in 1993 than in 
1992. And new figures show that the 1994 rate is down 17% from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman Ron Twersky attributes much of the decline to improved security 
measures by banks, including the installation of plastic partitions, known as 
"bandit barriers," between the tellers and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, the decline could cause a bit of extra paperwork for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to change our title one of these days," Twersky said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the logo on the faxes of the G-men's L.A. office, which 
proclaims: "Bank Robbery Capital of the World." 
</P>
<P>
 Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old City Hall. Or a blue one. Or . . . Mayoral 
aide Tom LaBonge has asked the city Bureau of Engineering if there isn't some 
way to decorate (or replace) the black armband that City Hall has been wearing 
for almost three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people feel that we're in mourning," LaBonge observed. Actually, the 
funereal covering is a backstop to keep debris from falling while City Hall is 
being retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gloomy thing isn't scheduled to come down for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering said it's open to suggestions, and LaBonge plans to approach Al 
Nodal, the general manager of the Cultural Affairs Department, for ideas. After 
all, Southern California does have a reputation for creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not have an artist design a mock bandage? Or, in honor of next week's 
baseball opener, why not install a "Go Dodgers!" banner? Even if the city keeps 
the black strip, it could be converted into a Raiders' banner by painting 
buccaneers on it. The pirate design, at least, could serve as a landmark to 
guide new lobbyists to City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, we don't want to know: Jeff Bliss spotted an ad that was headlined, 
"Ear Coning Comes to Malibu!" in the Malibu Surfside News. The blurb, which was 
for an ear-cleaning process, was accompanied by an endorsement from a West L.A. 
teacher who enthused, "You won't believe what came out of my ears!" miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Is that big controversy in Washington, D.C., beginning to fade into the 
background? Allen Arata of Hawthorne points out that "White Water Summer," a 
1987 movie, was relegated to a 1:30 a.m. TV slot the other morning.

RON HARRIS: JUDGING THE WORTH OF LOST LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I should have come to grips with it by now. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned early in my journalism career that in death, some people just mean 
more than others. My lesson came only days into my first job as a reporter for 
a now-defunct evening daily in Memphis, my hometown. Like most rookies, I was 
assigned to cops and courts. I covered crimes, arrests and court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Memphis, most murders were usually big local stories, which meant that they 
often made the front page, and if not that page, most assuredly a splash on the 
front of the Metro section. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if the victim was white. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different story for black murder victims. Those were routinely 
handled as small items in the back of the newspaper. Black lives, apparently, 
were deemed to be of less value. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sore point for most reporters. Bill Bain, my competitor on the 
morning paper, complained about it incessantly, and even coined a sarcastic 
acronym to rub his editors' faces in their decisions. He called the incidents 
"LBMs" -- Little Black Murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I've seen similar scenarios played out in communities across 
the country, as reporters and editors make determinations about which deaths 
they record, and certain deaths strike a chord within certain communities. 
Sometimes it is about race, sometimes it is about class. 
</P>
<P>
 I've actually sat in the chair and made the call as to whose death was worthy 
of recording and whose wasn't. There are some news guidelines, of course -- 
prominence, impact, human interest. But beyond that, it's a judgment call. It 
is one of the things about the news business with which I have never been 
comfortable.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why I'm sitting here, trying to figure out how we come to view some 
lives/deaths as less important -- in particular why the deaths of Tanya Marie 
Jones and Jeremy Gabriel Mancilla as less worthy of our concern than the two 
Japanese college students killed in a San Pedro carjacking last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya and Jeremy's bodies were found Sunday morning in an asphalt alley that 
runs behind the homes and apartment buildings in the 1100 block of 105th 
Street. It was the same morning the deaths of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura began 
to dominate the news and the vast resources of the Los Angeles Police 
Department.  
</P>
<P>
 It certainly wasn't because their deaths were more heinous or brutal than 
those of Jeremy and Tanya, a 14-year-old Latino boy and an 18-year-old white 
girl shot in the head the previous night and left stretched out in an alley 
more than a hundred miles from their homes in San Marcos. Residents found Tanya 
nude. Police say she was possibly raped. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ugly, nasty place to die, amid months-old litter, discarded diapers 
ground into mud and stagnant water. I nudged the trash with my toe and tried to 
imagine the terror that gripped their hearts in those last moments when death 
seemed certain. Did they think about their mother, sisters, brothers, friends, 
school? 
</P>
<P>
 I shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't find anything about their deaths in the local newspapers. Other 
than a brief mention on one of the television stations, nothing. There has been 
no barrage of calls to the Sheriff's Department's press office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five calls," the deputy said, "and two of those were from you." 
</P>
<P>
 No massive strike team is on the case, just two sheriff's deputies. There will 
be no press conferences if they find the killers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to the economics," said Steve Blanchard, 36, a postal worker 
who was shooting hoops in the back yard with his girlfriend's son just yards 
away from where the bodies were found. "Over here in South-Central, what are we 
worth? People think everybody down here is on the county, so, they don't care. 
But now those two Japanese guys, that's tourist money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were 25 people killed in Los Angeles County last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were Andre Gonzalez, 21, shot over on Gladys Street; Robert Achie, 
30, shot while driving his car in West Covina; Felipe Angeles, 23, shot while 
being robbed; Paul Slattry, 26 days old, beaten to death; Richard Villapando, 
2, beaten to death; William August, 16, shot in front of his home; Gordon 
Armstrong, 52, shot to death; Chad Edwards, 26, shot in a trailer park; 
Rigoberto Martinez, 34, shot on a Whittier street; Sotheat Phoung, 17, shot 
while cruising in Long Beach; Lee Bolin, 57, stabbed in his Long Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 Those didn't make the paper either. A few others made the inside pages, 
including two incidents where teen-agers and young people were gunned down in 
restaurants. Bill Clinton didn't call their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, we deemed their deaths of lesser worth, of lesser interest. 
It wasn't necessarily about race. It wasn't necessarily about class. They just 
happened to be from Los Angeles, a place where we have come to see our own 
lives of less value than others.

HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If something is said often enough, even though untrue, people will eventually 
begin to embrace it as truth. That is what is happening with the subject of our 
nation's health care.In spite of what we keep hearing from the White House, we 
do not have a health care crisis. There is no need for a drastic change in our 
system. Our country enjoys the most sophisticated and comprehensive health care 
in the world, and we need to look closely at any new system that might threaten 
to erode it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some alarming aspects to President Clinton's health care proposal 
that cause me great concern. While there is always room for improvement in any 
program, the drastic changes called for in the Clinton plan are just too risky.

GREGORY ALAN-WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a black female and I was surprised and very delighted to find a balanced 
story on black writer/actor Gregory Alan-Williams ("Hero Role in Riots Pushes 
Actor Onto a Larger Stage," March 23). It's about time the media began to 
highlight the views of all black Americans, not just the few who claim to speak 
for us all. 
</P>
<P>
 In his quest to publish his book, Alan-Williams ran up against the same 
ideological brick wall many of us knock our heads against every day. It was 
built for us (for our own good) by so-called compassionate, liberal thinkers in 
our society -- both black and white. These are the same fair-minded people who 
are loath to acknowledge the diversity which exists among black Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 If they stopped to really think for a minute, they'd discover, as 
Alan-Williams has, that some of us think it more important to define ourselves 
as we see fit; as decent human beings first, for example, before black 
Americans. To their surprise they'd also find that some do not accept the 
victim label or even desire reparations for such perceived victimization. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are not popular words to spout these days, much less write down in a 
book. So Alan-Williams shouldn't be surprised by the overall rejection he is 
receiving.

EVENING THE BALKANS ODDS; LIFTING THE EMBARGO MIGHT WELL SAVE LIVES BY 
DETERRING SERBIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Balkans war is being waged by the Balkan peoples themselves. But as in 
centuries past, the conflict there is deeply affected by factors far outside 
the Balkans. The European Union (formerly the European Community), the United 
States and Russia surely have, among them, the power to impose peace in this 
region. But their interests are just divergent enough to foil the necessary 
unanimity. Among these differences, none is greater than that regarding the 
blanket arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States believes that ending this embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
would permit that embattled state to defend itself against Serb aggression. The 
European Union takes the view that Bosnian self-defense cannot defeat the Serbs 
but could spread the violence and prolong the conflict. The Europeans have been 
willing to countenance a Serbian conquest if peace can be had at no lower 
price. The Americans have been willing to countenance a dragging on of the 
conflict if the principle that borders may not be revised by force can be 
defended at no lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 But the argument against spreading the violence has been weakened lately by a 
shaky but continuing peace established between the Muslims and the Croats. The 
opinion is being voiced with new cogency -- in Europe as well as the United 
States -- that lifting the arms embargo on Croatia and Bosnia might deter 
rather than spread violence. Serbia is exhausted. Its venture in 
mini-imperialism has left it bogged down in a Vietnam-like quagmire. If Serbia 
can expect the peoples it has sought to conquer to be armed from abroad, it may 
discover a new willingness to negotiate, a new skepticism about whether any of 
its gains will be lasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether changing the embargo will have this effect cannot be known with 
certainty. But what can be known with near-certainty is that in its present 
form the embargo has been a major incentive to violence by the better-armed 
Serbian side. Evening the odds may save more lives than it costs.

MEMORIES OF WILDFIRES PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With spring greenery everywhere, the danger from wildfires seems remote. But 
one need only remember last autumn's devastating Laguna Beach/Altadena/Malibu 
firestorms -- which scorched tens of thousands of acres, destroyed more than 
500 homes and cost hundreds of millions of dollars -- to realize that there's 
no time like the present for homeowners to start preparing for the peril the 
coming fire season will bring. That is no less true for members of the 
California Legislature and Gov. Pete Wilson; they would be wise to employ any 
technology or equipment that upgrades the state's firefighting capability. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Sacramento should experiment with what could be a big gun in the 
state's firefighting arsenal: the CL-415 "Super Scooper." The CL-415 is a 
Canadian-built amphibious plane that can swoop down over an ocean or lake and 
in 12 seconds load up with a prodigious 1,600 gallons of water that can then be 
dumped on a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Each plane costs $17 million. That's expensive. But not nearly as expensive as 
some out-of-control fires. By the time the costs are tallied for emergency 
services, lost property tax revenues, infrastructure repair, disaster relief 
and private insurance payouts to businesses and homeowners, the super scooper 
looks like a bargain.  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) has introduced legislation (AB 
2802) that appropriates $1.7 million to lease two water-scooping aircraft, to 
be used up and down the state during the 1994 fire season. Friedman also is 
seeking federal funding to extend the program through 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Legislature passed a similar bill, which was vetoed by Gov. 
Wilson. But given the consequences of last year's firestorms, Wilson should 
reassess the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2802 is an experiment. If the planes fail to deliver, the Legislature 
always can shelve the program. But lawmakers must not be afraid to try it.

ECONOMIC SUNSHINE, WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN; FORECAST POINTS UPWARD, BUT INTEREST 
RATES CAUSE WORRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California, finally, appears to be joining the rest of the nation in an 
economic recovery. The state is three years behind, but job gains and an uptick 
in the housing market are putting it on a recovery track, albeit a slow and 
perhaps fragile one. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the latest assessment from the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, which 
for each of the last few years has had to report the gloomy prospect of a 
prolonged economic slump -- California's worst since the Great Depression. The 
prominent forecasting group said earthquake reconstruction and the national 
recovery are helping to put people back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1990, UCLA said, Californians have reason to expect 
an increase in jobs, incomes, retail sales and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Payroll jobs rose in January and February, the first increase in two 
consecutive months since mid-1990. Sales of existing houses are up about 20% 
from a year ago, while business failures are down. Those trends, project 
officials say, are expected to continue in California and the rest of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, clouding the promising outlook is a new uncertainty -- abruptly 
rising interest rates and a plunging stock market (although some correction in 
stock prices was expected). 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of sharply higher interest rates is especially worrisome in 
California, where higher cost of borrowing could make homeownership 
unaffordable and could slow job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve has twice in the last month nudged up its short-term 
interest rates as a preemptive strike against inflation. The goal was to 
stabilize long-term interest rates. Few argued with that notion, but the market 
has rebelled in an unexpected furor. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds have shot to above 7%. That in turn is 
pushing consumer interest rates for home loans to above 8%. Even Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan must be puzzled at the seemingly irrational 
market reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry J. Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, said the 
rising interest rates represent a concern that could blow the UCLA forecast out 
of the water. "The bond market is worried about something we don't see. It is 
overreacting. If it stays at these rates, our forecast could be wrong and that 
would mean a whole big difference for California." 
</P>
<P>
 If mortgages hold at 8% or rise higher, that would put homeownership out of 
financial reach for many -- too many. And that would set back the California 
housing recovery during the spring, the very time when the most houses go on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Federal Reserve must consider fully is the possibility that at this 
delicate stage of recovery too much action to quell inflation might result in 
unintended consequences -- such as stalling the economic revival, especially 
here in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Fed are right to worry about the threat of roaring inflation, 
although price increases appear contained now. But it would be wise to allow 
the recovery to gain more momentum before further weighting with higher 
short-term interest rates. Even if the markets settle down, a decent interval 
with no Fed intervention may be salutary. As it is so often in life, timing is 
everything.

2 JAPANESE STUDENTS SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "2 Students Shot During Carjacking Die," March 28: 
</P>
<P>
 A conundrum? If indeed Japan does not have "guns on the streets" and "problems 
like this," the reason can be found in the responses of Takuma Ito's and Go 
Matsuura's parents to their sons' violent death. Instead of raging and striking 
out in retaliation, they expressed "no bitterness" and were "grateful for the 
good experiences their sons had here." 
</P>
<P>
 You and I know that we did not pull this trigger but, even so, we want to 
apologize. It was with these parents' responses that healing began. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not as a society taught to take responsibility for our experience and 
to move on; to respond gratefully for our present good. This does not mean we 
cannot work to create justice for all and to correct wrongs. Somehow along the 
line, however, we learn to expect "it all" and to react with righteous or 
violent indignation when it isn't handed to us easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of ethics, morals, patience, integrity -- basis for clear thinking -- 
we are handing our brothers and sisters anger, resentment and guns. If we could 
give them jobs, self-esteem, the ability to forgive, we would have people like 
Ito's and Matsuura's parents in our schools, at our workplace and on our 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not too late!

 * Do you want to stop carjackings? There is a simple, effective and 
inexpensive way of doing just that. Liberalize concealed weapon permit laws to 
allow law-abiding citizens the right to protect themselves. The number of 
violent crimes in Florida dropped substantially when they did.

 * Regarding your editorial "Gunning Down a Civilization," March 29: 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it will probably take a decline in tourism dollars from 
civilized, non-gun-toting countries like Japan, before our legislators wake up 
to the fact that this carnage must stop. 
</P>
<P>
 These economics will force our politicians to then admit that the National 
Rifle Assn. represents only a vocal minority of this country's citizenry, and 
that meaningful consistent gun control must be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, we should probably steel ourselves that it's going to cost 
15,000 lives a year until this inevitable realization results in a law banning 
handguns.

 * Your editorial quotes Ambassador Walter Mondale that "such crimes do not 
represent everyday American life." 
</P>
<P>
 I calculate the numbers for 1992 as: 15,377 gun murders divided by 365 days 
divided by 50 states equals 0.84 murders per day per state in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the rate is on the rise, my guess is that we have already passed the 
"one murder per day per state" mark. That makes murder by gun a fact of 
"everyday American life." (And that is ignoring murders which do not involve a 
gun.) 
</P>
<P>
 We decry the caning of an American teen-ager in Singapore, yet we are 
incapable of controlling graffiti in our own cities. We are willing to invade 
Panama, shoot down Serbian aircraft and disarm the Somalians, yet we are 
incapable of protecting foreign tourists and students on our own streets. 
</P>
<P>
 We rejoice at the collapse of European communism and demand improved human 
rights in China; while at the same time children die daily from preventable 
diseases and our streets swell with the unemployed homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As a nation, we are immoral, arrogant, hypocritical and self-righteous. Were 
it not for our tremendous military power, the world would have long ago have 
isolated us as a pariah unfit for membership in the family of nations.

 * Isn't it sad that the only carjacking case to get attention from "elite 
detectives" and the FBI is the one that kills people from another country? The 
action taken by our city's leaders sends the citizenry of Los Angeles a clear 
message: Unless a criminal act in our city makes the top of another country's 
evening news, it's just another day in the city. Mayor Riordan, did you think 
Los Angeles could gain notoriety for something besides crime?

 * The tragic loss of those two young Japanese students is heartbreaking. To be 
so young and die so senselessly is truly a loss to this world. But I can't help 
but feel that Japan shares partial responsibility for their deaths. Japan has 
constantly refused to allow equal trade and has led the rest of Asia in 
systematically destroying manufacturing jobs in the U.S. This has caused the 
loss of millions of jobs here in America and we have seen the rapid rise of 
crime as a result. You want to decrease crime? Increase the number of good, old 
factory jobs and crime will do down.

SUSPENSION FOR CONDOM DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Girl Suspended for Condom Display Files Suit," March 19: 
</P>
<P>
 How refreshing it is to find a 14-year-old girl who has courage and the 
quality of leadership beyond her years, beyond her peers and beyond the 
administration of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of all school-aged children should be marveling at Astrianna 
Johnson's bravery, and wondering what the purpose is of all those 
character-building programs. Are all the ribbons awarded for respect, courage, 
citizenship, leadership and honesty merely symbolism without substance? When a 
child displays these qualities in a big and unusual way, in a way that 
communicates loud and clear on a level with her peers, gains their attention 
and respect and actually makes them think, she is tossed out of Bethune Middle 
School because, as a school district spokesman said, the principal thought 
there was a "greater right" -- to prevent her from her right to free speech 
because the other students might be disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, principal! Hey, school district administrators! See those little girls 
over there getting pregnant? See those young, beautiful children dying from 
AIDS? They need to be disrupted! And so do you, so you can wake up and see that 
Astrianna Johnson is doing what you should have been doing five years ago, 
educating our children on the importance of using a condom during the sex that 
you can't seem to be able to stop them from having. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth grade is the year the U.S. Constitution is taught. Let Johnson go back 
to class where she can read about how she exercised her right as a citizen of 
this free nation. CAROLYN HONIGMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * I am appalled at the mother of Astrianna Johnson for allowing her daughter 
to wear condoms pinned on her clothing to school. I don't think the mother is 
teaching her daughter correct moral values in a time when AIDS is prominent. 
Rather than allowing her daughter to wear condoms to school, she should have 
taught her to promote abstinence until marriage, to her fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Astrianna Johnson's lawsuit against the school, I know her allegations 
of school officials restraining her freedom of speech will not have any merit 
and will be thrown out of court. Astrianna is merely a student and not a 
teacher. Her efforts should be expended in her studies and not in promoting 
safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Condom use is not the solution to preventing AIDS, other sexually transmitted 
diseases or pregnancy. Condoms are not 100% effective; abstinence is.

PAYING THE PRICE OF DOING 'GOD'S WORK'; SOMALIA: UNWILLING TO RISK U.S. LIVES, 
WE STRETCHED THE RULES AND SOMALIS DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. BACEVICH, A.J. Bacevich is executive director of the Foreign Policy 
Institute at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The just-completed drawdown of the U.S. mission in Somalia has attracted scant 
notice. Yet before consigning Operation Restore Hope to the recesses of memory, 
Americans would do well to consider how it is that their peacekeepers -- 
dispatched by President Bush to do "God's work" -- ended up as likely to draw a 
bead on a Somali as to feed him. Or her. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following: On Jan. 9, U.S. snipers in Mogadishu shot a Somali 
woman tending a stall in the city's marketplace. With few correspondents 
remaining in Mogadishu, even major newspapers carried at most a brief 
wire-service report of this incident. The woman, eight months pregnant, died. 
Her unborn child, in the carefully calibrated language of the AP dispatch, "did 
not survive." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an American spokesman, the shooting of the pregnant woman had 
been inadvertent. The intended target had been another Somali spotted with a 
machine gun in a truck 500 yards from the Marine outpost. Since rules of 
engagement permitted U.N. forces to "shoot anyone carrying a heavy weapon" in 
Mogadishu, the snipers were justified in taking him under fire. It was simply 
happenstance that their fire had struck a bystander. Just bad luck that the 
bystander was a pregnant woman. Truly unfortunate that she happened to leave 
six children behind.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, another incident on a larger scale: Marines escorting a 
convoy opened fire in a congested Mogadishu neighborhood, killing eight Somalis 
and wounding 12. Accounts of what actually happened were inconsistent. A 
Bangladeshi officer at the scene reported that the American troops fired 
"indiscriminately toward the crowd." U.S. authorities in Somalia defended the 
Marines, asserting that they had come under sniper fire and had responded in 
self-defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Who will be held accountable? The likely answer is no one. After all, the 
Marines acted as their rules prescribed. The mission had become "force 
protection" -- doing whatever was necessary to preclude further American 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 If those in the field are unlikely to be held accountable, then neither are 
the senior officials who devised Operation Restore Hope or those who have 
presided over its undoing. Certainly, those who ordered the intervention -- now 
comfortably retired -- never intended such ugly occurrences. As to their 
successors, they have long since redirected their attention to problems more 
pressing than those that beset the Horn of Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 Assurances that all concerned behaved responsibly -- claims resting on the 
legitimacy of the rules of engagement -- will provide cold comfort to the 
families of those gunned down by peacekeepers. The real effect is to allow the 
Americans involved -- from the Marines at their observation post all the way 
back to the White House -- to refuse responsibility for these acts. After all, 
everyone followed the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is no dodging responsibility. That these incidents elicited only a 
wisp of interest from news reporters may persuade some that the "story" in 
Somalia has reached its conclusion, effectively ended by President Clinton's 
decision to bring American forces home. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, an important story remains -- one that Americans ignore at their 
peril. The killing of these Somalis testifies to the illusion of altruistic 
interventionism in the post-Cold War era. It illustrates one of the 
consequences of committing U.S. forces to ambiguously defined peacemaking, 
peace enforcement or nation-building missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will question the high ideals with which Americans embark upon such tasks? 
Yet once good intentions collide with the reality that American soldiers are at 
risk, preserving their lives becomes an overriding priority. That's the way the 
troops themselves and their commanders see it -- for all too understandable 
reasons. Unless some vital national interest is at stake, that's also the way 
the American people and their elected leaders are inclined to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans will always want to play by the rules. Yet, as the danger to 
American soldiers increases, those rules are subject to change. Actions once 
deemed impermissible become acceptable. Concerns about noncombatant casualties 
diminish. Sensibilities are coarsened. The level of allowable firepower 
ratchets up. Justification is found even for the killing of innocents. This is 
not new. It is a recurring theme of American military history. 
</P>
<P>
 Somalia has revived that theme. Should Americans assume responsibility for 
making peace or rebuilding failed nations elsewhere, we will see it again. That 
prospect alone is not reason to refrain from acting. But let us have the 
honesty to acknowledge the moral price to be exacted.

PERSPECTIVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS; WEARING THE VEIL, UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH; IN THEIR 
QUEST TO ROOT OUT 'WESTERN CORRUPTION,' ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS DECLARE OPEN 
SEASON ON ALGERIAN WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FATIMA B., Fatima B. is the pseudonym for a 22-year-old Algerian woman. This 
article was translated by the French Committee for Intellectuals for Freedom 
House, a human-rights group based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most radical faction of the Islamic fundamentalist movement announced in 
February that any woman seen in public without the hijab (veil) prescribed by 
Muslim orthodoxy could and should be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 This was no empty threat. It was carried out Feb. 28, when a 17-year-old girl 
was murdered on her way to high school by a group of young men. On Wednesday, 
two more young women were killed at a bus station. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, all the young women in the factory where I work as a junior 
manager are wearing the veil. I doubt three of them have the remotest interest 
in following the precepts of Islam in a strict sense, if at all. We respect the 
religion of our parents and of many of our contemporaries. But we were taught 
that religion is a private matter that cannot be imposed by decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, practicing what we were taught can get us killed. None of us wants to 
wear the veil. But fear is stronger than our convictions or our will to be 
free. Fear is all around us. Our parents, our brothers, are unanimous: Wear the 
veil and stay alive. This will pass. 
</P>
<P>
 I am no intellectual, but I believe other people were told, elsewhere in other 
times, that the evil and the fear around them would pass. As far as I know, it 
did not pass. It got worse. I believe it will get worse here unless someone 
hears us. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the Islamists, as the Islamic fundamentalists are called, want to impose 
the veil on us. Tomorrow they will keep us from working or even going to 
school. They say that we should not vote or take part in public affairs. The 
veil between us and our country beyond the thick walls of our homes is to be 
total. And we all can guess that the slightest visit with a boyfriend can get 
us killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of Islam is founded in human dignity and tolerance and respect for 
others. But it is not the best of Islam that is coming to the fore now in 
Algeria. The war against women that is taking place here is not founded in 
Islamic precepts, but in the terrorist mentality that took over Iran years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcely a day goes by when a teacher, a journalist, a labor leader, a lawyer 
is not murdered, not to mention ordinary working people who show signs of free 
thinking. They are considered Westernized, corrupt beyond salvation, good only 
for extermination. Algeria's greatest playwright and actor, Abdelkader Alloula, 
was gunned down at home. Because our country's medical facilities, under the 
strain of civil strife and economic disorder, are no longer equipped to treat 
severe head wounds, Alloula was flown to a hospital in France, where he died a 
few days later. Most of the terrorists' victims, of course, cannot even hope 
for a desperate attempt at rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian women are alone. The secular, democratic parties will not come out to 
back us. Even the National Liberation Front -- the former ruling party which 
since the fiasco of the 1992 elections has taken a back seat to a series of 
military committees, and which the terrorists have sworn to eliminate and 
therefore has nothing to lose -- will not support us. Yet it was they who 
promised Algerian women they would be free after the war against the French. 
</P>
<P>
 France, the country closest to our country's destiny, has waited nervously, 
hesitating between a serious policy of helping Algeria repress the terrorists 
and one of seeking a deal with the eventual winner in what will soon be a 
full-scale Lebanese-style civil war. Our neighbors, Morocco and Tunisia, have 
done nothing, terrified by the prospect of the most powerful country in the 
region turning into another Iran and exporting its terrorist jihad -- and 
millions of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 And the United States has done nothing. Yet America is deeply implicated in 
our fate. And it is threatened, too. In the neighborhood where I live, they say 
that the United States armed and trained the most extreme Islamic 
fundamentalist factions in the Afghanistan war in the 1980s. If that is true, 
America provided a continuing training program for the Algerian extremists. The 
military leaders of the terrorist jihad in my country, young men in their 20s 
and 30s who are as fearless as they are ruthless, are called Afghans.  
</P>
<P>
 I have to believe that you Americans do not understand us or the full 
importance of our problem. Those whom you supported or still support in 
Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia are full of scorn for you. They believe that 
American women are filthy whores. I do not believe this and neither do my 
friends. We do not want to be like you, but we want to live in a country where 
we can be like you if that is what we please, or be ourselves, or even wear a 
veil if we want to. But the Islamist terrorists, after they have turned Algeria 
into another Iran, will not give us any choices at all.

PLATFORM; L.A. IS MORE THAN ITS CITY LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cmdr. DAN WATSON is a 20-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
He comments on an ACLU report noting that 83% of officers live outside the city 
limits: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was born and raised in the Los Angeles area and live less than 15 miles from 
the Civic Center. My family, including in-laws, have faithfully served as city 
employees continuously since 1911, when my grandfather joined the LAPD. To be 
labeled a "carpetbagger" and member of an "army of occupation" is highly 
offensive to me and the other members of the LAPD whose only crime is living 
outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, like all employees, should be measured by the quality of 
service they provide. Los Angeles has about 7,800 officers who are overworked, 
understaffed and poorly equipped. They have worked without a contract for way 
too long and justifiably feel underappreciated. Some of these officers live in 
the city, others do not. But they are all working under the same conditions, 
and no one has been able to show a correlation between an officer's residence 
and commitment to serve the community. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a memorial in front of Parker Center dedicated to LAPD officers who 
have died in the line of duty. In the past 10 years, 21 officers have died 
while serving this community. Of that group, 13, or 62%, lived outside the city 
limits at the time of their death. Does anyone besides the ACLU question the 
devotion of these officers? They should not be remembered as members of an 
"occupying force," but simply as police officers who made the ultimate 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has more than 900 reserve officers. Most live outside the city, yet 
they choose to volunteer to help protect Los Angeles. By the ACLU's standards, 
these loyal people also are carpetbaggers who come into Los Angeles and donate 
thousands of hours of service, only to return to their enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the ACLU has forgotten its basic principles. They spend a great 
deal of effort protecting the rights and liberties of individuals. Like anyone 
else, I have the right to live wherever I wish. In fact, California outlawed 
residency requirements for employees in 1974. Ironically, the ACLU supported 
the ballot proposition that created this protection. I would expect the ACLU to 
defend my right to choose where to live instead of defaming me for not living 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is much more than an area defined by lines drawn on a map. The 
entire region is Los Angeles. We are all residents of this great metropolis, 
regardless of what a ZIP code or map indicates.

LAKERS HAVE A SHOT, BUT CAN'T GET IT OFF; PRO BASKETBALL: JOHNSON IS 2-1 AS 
COACH AND NOT HAPPY WITH AFTER BLOW OPPORTUNITIES IN 95-92 LOSS TO THE 
SUPERSONICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even a bad shot would have been good. Anything but what the Lakers got 
Thursday night with the game on the line at Seattle Coliseum and a chance to 
beat the league's winningest team. 
</P>
<P>
 No shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Only under these circumstances could the Lakers battle back from a 15-point 
deficit, take the Seattle SuperSonics, winners of six in a row coming in, to 
the wire on the road and feel bad. Getting a 24-second violation on a critical 
possession tends to do that to a team, especially when the potential upset ends 
in a 95-92 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any loss is bad," James Worthy said. "I don't know all the details. I do know 
we missed an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 None bigger than after the Lakers got the ball when Elden Campbell intercepted 
Gary Payton's bad pass with about 48 seconds left. Down, 93-92, they looked 
confused, then got the ball to Worthy, as Coach Magic Johnson wanted. But with 
the shot clock winding down, Worthy thought Campbell, who scored 12 of his 
team-high 19 points in the fourth quarter, slipped free a few feet away. When 
Worthy tried to deliver the ball, it was knocked away, leading to the 24-second 
violation with 23.9 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Lakers had a chance. After Shawn Kemp was fouled intentionally and 
made one free throw, the last of his 28 points, they called a timeout. Then 
another, without even breaking the huddle. It was the second game in a row 
Johnson has done that in the closing seconds, and Tuesday against Minnesota at 
the Forum it resulted in Nick Van Exel driving the lane for the winning layup. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it resulted in Tony Smith slicing down the left side, looking for a 
Seattle defender to come out to meet him so a Laker would be free. Except that 
when no SuperSonic stepped forward, Smith took an off-balance 15-footer with 12 
seconds left that missed. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics got the rebound and passed it ahead to Payton, who was fouled. 
He made one free throw with six seconds left for the final 95-92 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Lakers' 10th consecutive defeat here, their longest road losing 
streak. "We had our chances, which makes it worse," said Smith, who had 15 
points and six assists in 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Johnson, now 2-1 as coach with Houston and Atlanta coming next: "They've 
got to believe they can win. Because they have blown so many of them, I don't 
know if they believe they can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Coach George Karl welcomed Johnson's arrival, hoping that interest in 
what normally would be just another game would instead serve as the spark to 
make sure his team does not come out flat. So when Johnson got a nice ovation 
during pregame introductions, Karl was one of those applauding. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Kemp flew down the right side and brought the crowd to its feet 
again with a thunderous dunk off a long lob pass from Payton, the SuperSonics 
had a 22-10 lead. That kind of spark. The cushion then became 39-24 and held at 
15 as late as 43-28 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers responded. In position to get shredded again after losing the first 
three games of the season to Seattle by an average of 16.7 points, they closed 
to within 51-47 at intermission when Worthy made a three-pointer with 0.8 
remaining. Finally, the deficit was erased in the third quarter with a 14-4 run 
capped by Smith's three-pointer that made it 67-67.

CLIPPERS RETURN HOME, BUT KEEP LOSING; PRO BASKETBALL: WILKINS SCORES 28, BUT

 The Clippers, who lost five of six games on a nine-day Eastern trip to drop 
out of playoff contention, returned home from the road to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But they played as poorly as they did on the road, losing their fourth 
consecutive game, 117-102, to the Phoenix Suns Thursday night before a sellout 
crowd of 16,005 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins, the NBA's fourth-leading scorer with a 25.7 average, scored 
28 points to lead the Clippers. Wilkins made 11 of 23 shots. He also had eight 
rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come to play for four quarters as a team," Wilkins said. "If you 
want to win, you've got to do it as a team. You've got to come and give 
everything you've got, each and every person. You can't turn it on and off in 
this league." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Clippers left town, they had won a season-high four games in a row 
and five of six to get back into contention.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got satisfied or something," Wilkins said. "I wish I could answer 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a matter of time until the Clippers (25-45), who made the playoffs 
the last two seasons, are officially eliminated. They trail the Denver Nuggets 
by 10 games with 12 games left in the race for the eighth and final Western 
Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the dog days," Clipper forward Loy Vaught said. "We know we're not 
going to make the playoffs and it's hard playing to the best of our abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper center Elmore Spencer, who had averaged 13 points, 7.2 rebounds and 
2.2 blocked shots in his last 12 games, disappeared against the Suns, scoring 
only four points and and grabbing two rebounds in 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight I played terrible," Spencer said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, who had a 59-48 lead at halftime, took an 18-point lead eight 
minutes into the second half as Cedric Ceballos scored 13 third-quarter points. 
They led, 89-75, going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos, who had 37 points against the Clippers in his last game, had a 
game-high 32 points, making 11 of 21 shots, as Phoenix (46-23) won its third 
game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss went with a patchwork lineup of rookies Harold Ellis, 
Charles Outlaw and Bob Martin, second-year guard Randy Woods and Wilkins at the 
start of the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take a look at our younger players for the remainder of the year, 
but I still want to put a competitive team on the floor," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gamble didn't work as Charles Barkley, who had 16 points and 17 
rebounds, took advantage of the mismatch against Outlaw to score on 
back-to-back drives as the Suns built a 21-point lead. Barkley, who played 27 
minutes, didn't play much in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't need me much tonight in the second half," Barkley said. "You 
don't drive your Mercedes Benz to the grocery store. You save it for the long 
trips." 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, who reached the NBA finals last year, are currently fourth in the 
Western Conference and would seem to have a tougher time returning to the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win the championship this year, you'll never see me again unless you're 
in Alabama or Arizona," Barkley said. "In 1998 I'm going to win governor of 
Alabama."

NBA ROUNDUP; SILENCE IS GOLDEN FOR NORMAN IN MILWAUKEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Norman's ears got a night off because his shooting was on Thursday at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, not exactly the people's choice since coming from the Clippers as a 
free agent, scored 37 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to lead the Bucks to a 
111-109 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter," he said. "If I play well, I play well. The fans are going 
to boo or do whatever they want to do anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Portland led at halftime, but Norman outscored the Trail Blazers, 16-13, in 
first nine minutes of the third quarter. He tied the game, 72-72, with a 
rebound basket, then gave the Bucks a 74-72 lead with another field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee snapped a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland lost its third in a row, despite a season-high 36 points from Terry 
Porter and 33 by Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bucks maybe are struggling, but we're struggling, too," Trail Blazer 
Coach Rick Adelman said. "I really don't have any reasons why we lost the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 101, Cleveland 85 -- David Robinson scored 11 of his 26 points in 
the fourth quarter at San Antonio, helping the Spurs win their fifth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs led, 54-49, at halftime and scored the first seven points of the 
third quarter to establish control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers, who were led by John Williams' 21 points, drew no closer than 
nine points in the final quarter as Robinson kept them at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's three-game winning streak was snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 106, Sacramento 102 -- Kevin Willis scored 16 of his 29 points in the 
fourth quarter and grabbed 21 rebounds as the Hawks won at Sacramento to hand 
the Kings their sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond, who scored 26 points for the Kings, missed a three-point shot 
with 14 seconds to play and Sacramento trailing, 103-100. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis then made two free throws and Mookie Blaylock one, giving the Hawks 
their first 50-victory season since 1988-89.

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARK LEAD OVER DUCKS IS EXTENDED TO 10 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The timing is perfect for the San Jose Sharks, who won their fifth game in a 
row, 5-3, over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning streak is a franchise record, and it has generated 10 points in 
the standings, exactly the number of points by which the Sharks lead the Mighty 
Ducks in the parade -- it can no longer be called a race with only six games to 
play -- to the final Western Conference spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks lost, 3-2 to Edmonton in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulf Dahlen scored for the Sharks to break a 3-3 tie in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 They had fallen behind Toronto, 3-1, in the second period and won despite 
being outshot, 24-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlen's goal came 12:01 into the final period after Todd Elik dumped a pass 
to him just inside the Toronto zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Whitney added a breakaway goal at 13:33, eluding Maple Leaf defenseman 
Todd Gill at the blue line and beating Felix Potvin to the glove side. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 2, Boston 2 -- Boston showed its historical bent, welcoming the past in 
Andy Moog and ridiculing the present in Jon Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 Moog, traded to Dallas last June for Casey, came home to the Boston Garden, 
but he stopped 27 Bruin shots for the Stars. No matter. "Welcome home, Andy," 
the sign read, and "Moooooog," the crowd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey stopped 26 Dallas shots in front of the home fans. No matter. "Casey's a 
Bum," the sign said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Gagner and Mike Modano scored for the Stars, who set a club record for 
points on the road in a season with 41. Steve Heinze and Glen Murray scored for 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 4, Detroit 2 -- Iain Fraser had a goal and an assist in the third 
period to lead the Nordiques at Detroit, where Quebec goaltender Jacques 
Cloutier made 39 saves in his first start since Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Red Wings' sixth game in March against teams that aren't in playoff 
positions and their fifth loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Theoren Fleury scored three goals for the Flames 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Division-leading Flames are 4-1-1 in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 6, Chicago 3 -- Goaltender Bryon Dafoe won his first NHL game in 
his second start and Keith Jones scored twice for the Capitals at Chicago.

MORNING BRIEFING: SPORTS FAN CLINTON HAS BECOME FAIR GAME FOR ESPN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton watched Arkansas beat Michigan in Dallas last Sunday to 
advance to the Final Four, prompting ESPN's Dan Patrick to say:  
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton was thrilled Arkansas wasn't playing Wisconsin Whitewater." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Clinton: While Arkansas was winning, CBS cameras showed Clinton in the 
seats, giving his home-state Razorbacks a big thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to be careful," commentator Billy Packer said. "Michigan has more 
electoral votes than Arkansas." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What was Barry Switzer's record against USC while he was coaching 
at Oklahoma? 
</P>
<P>
 Skategate: Tennis player Brad Gilbert has an unusual opinion on the Nancy 
Kerrigan-Tonya Harding affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kerrigan ought to get down and kiss Harding's feet," Gilbert said in the 
April issue of Tennis magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the attention created by the assault on Kerrigan threw the spotlight 
on both figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Gilbert added, "These girls were going nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Sideshow: National media representatives converged on the Dallas Cowboys' 
headquarters on Monday, the day before Coach Jimmy Johnson resigned as a result 
of his dispute with owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters started arriving as early as 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw guys with sleeping bags," quarterback Troy Aikman said. "I thought 
Garth Brooks tickets were on sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Boo hoo: Xavier McDaniel of the once proud but now struggling Boston Celtics 
summed up his team's attitude to the Boston Globe:  
</P>
<P>
 "We still have some pride, but not a whole lot. When you are a lottery team, 
no one cares about you at all." 
</P>
<P>
 We're No. 3!Coach Jerry Sloan says his Utah Jazz are the happiest third-place 
team he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not able to execute. We're not able to shoot. We're not able to stop 
anybody," he said. "But that must make us happy. We must be happy being in 
third place. Otherwise we'd be out here working -- trying to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Low rise: Walt Zembriski, a golfer on the senior tour, is introduced as a 
former construction worker who used to work on skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the practice range with Zembriski for the Tradition tournament in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., Lee Trevino turned to some friends and said:  
</P>
<P>
 "We investigated and Zembriski never climbed anything higher than a 7-Eleven."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FRUSTRATED SNOW WANTS TO BE TRADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman J.T. Snow, believing that he has no future in the Angel 
organization, said Thursday that he will ask to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "A trade would be the best thing for me right now," Snow said. "It's tough 
when you know you belong somewhere, but you can't get in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's so frustrating is that the Mets deal came and went. Looking 
back, it would have been the best thing for me. At least I'd still have a job 
in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who was nearly traded a week ago to New York for starter Anthony Young, 
has been told that he will open the season in triple-A Vancouver to retain his 
trade value. He would remain in the big leagues only if left fielder Dwight 
Smith is placed on the disabled list. However, Smith believes his strained calf 
will be healed by opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are trying to trade Snow but have not found serious interest. 
General Manager Bill Bavasi said it was highly unlikely that a deal could be 
made by opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who batted .241 with 16 homers and 57 RBIs in his rookie season, found 
himself without a job when the Angels moved Eduardo Perez to first base. Perez 
was scheduled to play left field this spring, but he experienced discomfort in 
his right elbow, and it became clear to the Angels that he belonged at first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who went two for three Thursday in the Angels' 11-7 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs before a record crowd of 8,868 at Tempe, Ariz., finished the 
Cactus League season batting .226 with one homer and 12 runs batted in. Snow 
batted .212 with one homer and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson has proved to the Angels that he's still much more than a crowd 
draw. He went two for three Thursday with a double and homer, finishing his 
spring with a .392 batting average, and team-leading five homers and 17 RBIs. 
Third baseman Damion Easley was the only Angel who had a higher batting average 
(.423) than Jackson, but no one else had more than two homers or 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo gives us a tremendous lift," Angel starter Mark Langston said. "I didn't 
know what kind of person he is, or what kind of presence he had in the 
clubhouse. He has a tremendous presence. It's great to have another guy excited 
about winning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who has been selected as the Angels' opening day pitcher for the 
third consecutive year, yielded only a solo homer in his five-inning stint. He 
not only is ready for the season, but believes the Angels have an excellent 
shot to win the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have the team to win," Langston said. "Really, I like everything I 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left-handed reliever Ken Patterson rejoined the Angel organization at noon 
Thursday, and judging by his debut, could soon be returning to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson will open the season at triple-A Vancouver, but he has established 
himself as the front-runner to return to the bullpen if anyone struggles. 
Patterson yielded two hits and two earned runs in his two-inning stint, and 
struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to leave here in the first place," said Patterson, who was 
released March 27 by the Cincinnati Reds. "I'm glad to be back. I didn't have 
anybody that could help me over there. Now, I'm coming to a place where they 
know me. They know what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers said that reliever Mike Butcher's woes this spring will 
cost him. He won't share the closer's role with Joe Grahe until he regains his 
control. Butcher yielded five hits and four earned runs in one inning Thursday, 
and finished the Cactus League with a 15.43 ERA. He has allowed 27 baserunners 
in 9 1/3 innings this spring, including 13 hits and 10 earned runs in his last 
three innings. "He's wild as hell right now," Rodgers said. "He can't get the 
pitches were he wants them. He's just all over the place." . . . Dwight Smith 
will likely bat second in the lineup in games he starts in left field, Rodgers 
said, moving Easley to sixth. When Jackson starts in left, he'll bat fifth or 
sixth, Rodgers said, and Easley will bat second. . . . Joe Magrane, who pitched 
two innings Wednesday in the Angels' minor league game, says he could be ready 
before the end of April. "I feel great, there's no pain at all," said Magrane, 
who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery in February. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR WORRELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a marked departure from last year, the Dodgers broke camp and headed back 
to Southern California this spring with Todd Worrell set to be the closer in 
the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell wasn't overpowering in 10 Grapefruit League outings -- giving up 10 
hits, four earned runs and four walks in 10 innings -- but it was an 
improvement over the injury-marred 1993 spring that presaged his ineffective 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in here in good shape and has gone through a normal spring -- which 
is entirely different from last year, at each stage," said Executive Vice 
President Fred Claire. "There hasn't been anything that has raised a red flag 
or even a yellow caution flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, who says the only difference this year is that his arm is sound, 
passed his last test when he pitched on consecutive days late in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important that we had a chance to see him on back-to-back days, just 
as a sign of good health," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell is 2-0 this spring, with two saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Tom Lasorda: "The big thing with him is he has to stay healthy. 
That is the main thing. He told me he feels good. That makes me feel OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worrell's one of the keys for us this year. He's got to be his old self for 
us. You know what the guy did when he was with St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said that with all of Worrell's arm troubles, he 
never knew what Worrell was going to do last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pitching -- that's the difference," Perranoski said. "We couldn't pitch 
him last spring. We've been building his arm up, and the last few times he's 
thrown very well. TIM KAWAKAMI

 Michael Jordan will begin his career as a pro baseball player at double-A 
Birmingham of the Southern League, where his longest road trip will be a 
12-hour bus ride and his meal money will be just $16 a day. The Chicago White 
Sox assigned Jordan to the Birmingham Barons on Thursday, and said he will play 
his first game April 8 at home against the Chattanooga Lookouts.

 Pete Rose Jr., son of baseball's career hits leader, was released by the 
Cleveland Indians' organization. Rose, 24, hit .218 with seven home runs and 30 
RBIs for the Indians' class-A Kinston affiliate last year, his fifth minor 
league season. He tore a ligament in his left knee July 9 and missed the rest 
of the year.

</P>
<P>
 Three-time All-Star catcher Sandy Alomar agreed to a $7.65-million, three-year 
contract extension that will keep him with the Cleveland Indians at least 
through 1997. The extension includes a $150,000 signing bonus, annual salaries 
of $2.5 million for the 1995 through 1997 seasons, plus a club option for 1998 
that would pay him $3 million. Alomar, 27, will earn $2.2 million this season. 
. . . . Gene Larkin, whose 10th-inning, pinch single won the seventh game of 
the 1991 World Series for Minnesota, was released by the Twins from a minor 
league contract.He hit .175 with two homers and five RBIs in 40 spring at-bats.

 Dana Altman, who coached Kansas State to the semifinals of the National

 He replaces Rick Johnson, who resigned March 2 after a 7-22 season and a 
three-year record of 24-59.

 The guessing game over President Clinton and the Final Four is over. He's 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had been saying all week he would like to attend the Arkansas-Arizona 
semifinal, but there were lingering doubts about whether he would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Those doubts ended Thursday when aides said he would fly straight from his 
vacation in Southern California to North Carolina on Saturday.

<P>
 Ask Anita was awarded first place in Thursday's $59,475 Avigaition Handicap 
after 2-5 favorite Miss Turkana was disqualified for interference in the final 
strides at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Anita finished three-quarters of a length behind Miss Turkana.Tricky 
Princess finished third, but was moved into second. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Turkana was dropped to third after the stewards ruled she came over on 
Tricky Princess in the deep stretch, costing Tricky Princess second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Chris McCarron, Ask Anita covered 1 1/8 miles on the turf in 1:48. 
She carried 115 pounds and paid $15.40 and $4.60. 
</P>
<P>
 French-bred Tricky Princess returned $3.80. There was no show betting. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Turkana, ridden by Antonio Castanon, led throughout and appeared on her 
way to her 10th victory in 30 starts until the interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenchman's Cove finished last in the race, which was reduced to four starters 
with the late scratch of Viviana. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, worth $33,975, increased Ask Anita's career earnings to $207,950.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; JIM BEAM STAKES WINNERS POINT THE WAY IN TRIPLE CROWN 
RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When rating the Santa Anita Derby with the Jim Beam Stakes as a recent 
successful prep for the Triple Crown, the comparison isn't even close. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the Jim Beam wins, five Triple Crown victories to one. 
</P>
<P>
 The last four winners of the Beam have all won Triple Crown races, with Summer 
Squall taking the Preakness in 1990, Hansel winning the Preakness and Belmont 
Stakes in 1991, Lil E. Tee capturing the Kentucky Derby in 1992 and Prairie 
Bayou winning the Preakness last year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, the only winner of a Triple Crown race to emerge from 
the Santa Anita Derby has been A.P. Indy, who won the Belmont in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these achievements by Beam horses, the stake at Turfway Park, the 
Kentucky track in suburban Cincinnati, struggles to draw top horses. Starting 
last year, the Beam became a $600,000 race, $100,000 more than the Santa Anita 
Derby and the richest of the Kentucky Derby preps, but most of the division 
leaders continue to be sent in other directions. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Turfway is again caught in the scheduling squeeze that positions 
the Santa Anita Derby a week from Saturday and the Blue Grass Stakes at 
Keeneland the week after that. If a horse is going to run only one more race 
before the Kentucky Derby, which is on May 7, most trainers seem to prefer the 
Santa Anita and Keeneland time frames. 
</P>
<P>
 The last four Jim Beam winners blossomed at Turfway. Summer Squall's Beam was 
only his second start as a 3-year-old, and he ran second in the Derby before 
winning the Preakness. Hansel was only the fourth betting choice at Turfway -- 
even Apollo, the fast colt from California, was considered better than him -- 
and ran 10th in the Derby before winning the last two legs of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Lil E. Tee, who had never won a stake, went off at 9-2 at Turfway. 
Prairie Bayou, underrated because his early 1993 victories had come at 
Aqueduct, was favored at Turfway; he also won the Blue Grass two weeks later 
and was second in the Derby before winning the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven horses have been entered for Saturday's Jim Beam, and, based on the 
morning line, the best in the group is Southern Rhythm, who broke his maiden 
less than two months ago and is on a three-race winning streak after a victory 
in the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Rhythm, who is listed at 3-1 by the Turfway linemaker, gets a new 
jockey in Chris McCarron, who won the Beam last year astride Prairie Bayou. At 
1 1/8 miles, Saturday's race is an eighth of a mile farther than the Southwest, 
which was Southern Rhythm's first test around two turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition and Chimes Band, who were third and fourth, respectively, in 
the Southwest, are also in the Beam field, with Polar Expedition the second 
choice at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 California shippers have occasionally been factors in the Beam, but a West 
Coast horse hasn't won the stake since Marfa in 1983. Powis Castle, second to 
Tabasco Cat as he came from a three-month layoff in the San Rafael at Santa 
Anita on March 6, is given the best chance of the California invaders. Listed 
at 4-1, Powis Castle ran twice at Turfway as a 2-year-old and won a sprint 
stake there in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley will be riding Powis Castle. Laffit Pincay has the mount on 
Shepherd's Field, winless since the Norfolk at Santa Anita last fall, and Shane 
Sellers will ride Almaraz, who was third in the Bradbury at Santa Anita in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Others entered are Dynafleet, Mahogany Hall, Road Rush, Sir Walter Lyzalot and 
War Deputy. Polar Expedition, Shepherd's Field and Southern Rhythm drew the 
three inside post positions and Powis Castle got No. 5. There will be betting 
on the Jim Beam at Santa Anita, between the fourth and fifth races. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Chris Antley at Turfway to ride Powis Castle, Corey Nakatani, winner of 
three races Thursday, takes over on Stuka in Saturday's $200,000 San Bernardino 
Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 With Antley aboard, Stuka won the Santa Anita Handicap after the stewards 
disqualified The Wicked North for interfering with another horse, Myrakalu, in 
the stretch. The California Horse Racing Board is expected to rule later this 
month on an appeal by The Wicked North's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Misil, the high weight in the 1 1/8-mile San Bernardino with 119 pounds, has 
earned $1.4 million with 12 wins in 27 starts, but hasn't run since a 
sixth-place finish in the Japan Cup in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissin Kris, 118 pounds, and Stuka, 117, are next in the weights. Others in 
the 10-horse field are Furiously, Hill Pass, Star Recruit, Tinners Way, Dare To 
Duel, Lottery Winner and Del Mar Dennis. Misil, Star Recruit and Dare To Duel 
are also entered in a race today.

SENIOR GOLF / THE TRADITION; FLOYD TAKES THE LEAD WITH A 65, BUT JANUARY'S 67 
STEALS THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don January was one of the original members of the Senior PGA Tour, back in 
1980 when it was mostly a social gathering of old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it is a multimillion-dollar success and the competition is stronger, but 
January, who will be 65 in November, is sometimes still a factor. He was 
Thursday. Despite a back problem, the slow-striding Texan stole the show in the 
first round of the Tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 January took on the 6,869-yard Cochise course at Desert Mountain and whipped 
it, his five-under-par 67 putting him two shots behind the leader, sizzling 
Raymond Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, who went five under in the first eight holes, shot a 65. But on a day 
when it seemed that most of the golfers were under par, Floyd held only a 
one-shot lead over Gibby Gilbert. Gilbert, in the last threesome, had six 
birdies and a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides January, there were four others at 67, among them defending champion 
Tom Shaw. Lee Trevino, Tom Weiskopf and Dave Stockton were in a group of nine 
at 68.  
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, after getting birdies on three of the first eight holes, 
faltered coming home and shot 70, as did Mike Hill, Chi Chi Rodriguez and Gary 
Player. Altogether, 34 of the 83 players were under par on a perfect day with 
little wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a 72-hole tournament, leading after the first round isn't that important," 
Floyd said. "I've been off three weeks and I never know what I'll do after a 
layoff. Naturally, I'm real pleased with the way I played. But this course is 
in such great shape, you should shoot well. If the weather stays like this, 
there will be many good scores." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the conditions, the surprise was January. He hurt his back "jerking 
around a couple of suitcases" and was able to play only because the people at 
the tour's traveling fitness center worked diligently on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The always slender January used to be known as "Old Bones," but since he was 
told four years ago to quit smoking and drinking or die, he has gained 25 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never believed in exercising, except for swinging a club," January said. "I 
walked into the (fitness center) the other day and they didn't know who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 January said he is playing well right now and hitting the ball long. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I always could putt," he said. "Right now, I'm happy with my 
game. I know nobody in the Super Seniors (golfers 60 and over) has ever won, 
but I don't see why I can't. I need the money." 
</P>
<P>
 January might be happy with his game, but he definitely isn't with his 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they told me I had to quit smoking and drinking, I was told I would feel 
better," he said. "They were wrong. I felt better when I was smoking and 
drinking. If there was a problem, I just had another drink and felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they ever tell me I only have six months to live, I'm going out and buy a 
case of whiskey and a carton of cigarettes and everyone can go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiskopf's performance was also a bit of a surprise. Although he had not 
played in a tour event since last fall, his 68 put him in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worry about how long I've been away," said Weiskopf, who lives in 
nearby Paradise Valley. "It only takes me one day to get ready. I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Isao Aoki seemed recovered from his disqualification last week in Texas, where 
signing an incorrect scorecard cost him a chance to win the Doug Sanders 
Classic.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt terrible Sunday when it happened," he said after shooting a 67. "But I 
feel fine now." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who didn't win again after winning here last year until the Senior Slam 
last month in Mexico, was elated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning here gave me renewed confidence," he said. "After shooting a 67 
today, I feel confident once more. Even if I don't win again, I love this 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino, the leading money winner, said that he is happy with every phase of 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't necessarily mean I'll win," he said. "But I'm happy with my 
game."

OLAZABAL SETS COURSE RECORD WITH A 63, LEADS BY FOUR SHOTS

 Despite gusts of more than 20 m.p.h., Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal shot a 
course-record, nine-under-par 63 Thursday to take a four-stroke lead after the 
opening round of the Freeport-McMoRan Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," Olazabal said."I've played here twice before and never broke 
70. I guess I was saving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal, starting on the back nine, had birdies on his second, fourth, sixth 
and seventh holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point was on the 16th," he said. "I pushed the shot to the right, 
close to a bush, then chipped it about 80 yards, then chipped it another 80 
yards from there for a birdie. After that, I managed to keep the ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal added five more birdies on the front nine to break the course record 
of 64 set by Joel Edwards in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those days when everything goes nicely for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Torrance, who also played early, is second with a 67. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great course with demanding holes," Torrance said. "The wind died down 
a touch and that helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champ Mike Standly shot a 68 to tie for third place with Joey 
Rassett. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne Stewart and Nick Faldo shot even-par 72s, David Frost finished at 74, 
Craig Stadler 76, and Jim Thorpe 79.

 Latinos to Protest: A group upset over the lack of Latinos in lead roles in 
the new film "The House of the Spirits" is urging the Latino moviegoing public 
to stay home and rent videos featuring Latino actors this weekend. "We want to 
send a message to Hollywood and the movie industry in general," said 
actor-writer Del Zamora. "We are not being allowed the opportunities to portray 
Latinos in leading roles. . . . So, we are going to stop buying tickets to 
movies." "The House of the Spirits," set against a South American backdrop, 
features a veritable who's who cast including Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Jeremy 
Irons, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Redgrave. Spanish actor Antonio Banderas and 
Cuban-born actress Maria Conchita Alonso appear in the film, which opens today. 
Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of U.S. distributor Miramax Films, said Thursday: 
"The director, Bille August, and the producers cast the film based on what they 
felt would be the best artistic and creative decisions for the picture." A 
spokeswoman for Miramax noted that the film was produced by European companies, 
which "naturally hired a largely European cast." Zamora said his protesters 
will cover their heads with Mexican wrestling hoods to protect performers "who 
do not want to be identified and blacklisted."

 An Inauspicious Debut: Critical reaction was tepid at best to Yoko Ono's first 
Off-Broadway musical, "New York Rock," which opened Wednesday night at New 
York's WPA Theater. Ono wrote the story and music, but does not perform in the 
work, which mirrors the gunshot slaying of husband John Lennon when the central 
character is shot dead by muggers. While several critics granted Ono the 
"right" to use the work as a plea for peace, they were less agreeable with her 
method. "It is painful to report that . . . (Ono's) creative re-entry after 
years of isolation is a sappy, preachy, soft-pop musical that wears its good 
intentions like a scout badge," wrote Newsday's Linda Winer. The Post's Clive 
Barnes called the work "an odd fish" with "only a feebly derivative score, 
banal lyrics with little rhyme and less reason, and a simplistic story." The 
New York Times' Steven Holden, however, called "New York Rock" a "return to the 
style of tribal rock musicals like 'Hair.' " He said Ono's best lyrics "have a 
fanciful dreaminess that invites the listener to fill in personal 
associations," while her "worst song . . . sinks under an embarrassing hail of 
epithets like pig and scum."

 More Bricks in the Wall: Amid giant inflatable pigs and multicolored lasers, 
Pink Floyd returned to the limelight Wednesday night with its first concert in 
more than five years. Despite steady rain, more than 55,000 fans watched the 
psychedelic rockers' two-hour show at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium. It was the 
first of 37 North American concerts for the British band, which is promoting 
its soon-to-be released album, "The Division Bell." The group opened with 
"Astronomy Domine" from its 1967 debut album, then moved on to songs from the 
better-known "Dark Side of the Moon." Pink Floyd expanded to 11 members for the

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PERSONNEL CHANGES CATCH UP WITH POGUES 
</P>

 "Where's Terry?" shouted a fan at the Pogues' concert on Tuesday at the 
Wadsworth Theater, noting the absence of the band's longtime member Terry 
Woods. A few years ago it was "Where's Shane?" for departed singer-songwriter 
Shane MacGowan.If you're a Pogues fan, you'd best accept that personnel changes 
are the norm for the Irish-English folk-punk band, the musical equivalent of a 
body that keeps getting new organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the departure of MacGowan two albums and three tours ago was 
the loss of the band's heart, and it still hasn't been replaced -- even on the 
last tour, ex-Clash leader Joe Strummer was unable to fill the void. What the 
Pogues missed most on Tuesday was the wobbly but brilliant MacGowan's besotted 
sadness . . . well, at least they missed the sadness.  
</P>
<P>
 With founding member Spider Stacy now fully ensconced as frontman, the woozy, 
defiant spirit is intact, and at times it was enough to carry the band through 
its still inventive and expanding musical ventures. But the best songs of the 
show, balancing a tender yearning with a sod-off attitude, were for the most 
part scraps left from the MacGowan years. And when a new song like the sweet 
"Tuesday Morning" did stand out, it was hard to tell whether it was a sign that 
a new heart is beating for the group, or merely a fluke flicker of past 
glories. STEVE HOCHMAN

MOVIE REVIEW; A FEW BIG LAUGHS FROM LITTLE 'CLIFFORD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it bad form for a film critic to send readers to a lousy movie just because 
it has a few screamingly funny moments? On the other hand, who doesn't want to 
laugh out loud at the movies? 
</P>
<P>
 "Clifford," starring Martin Short as a precociously nasty 10-year-old, is not 
a good movie. It's not even good/bad. But Short has a few of those 
laugh-out-loud moments, like the scene where his uncle Martin (Charles Grodin) 
asks him if he could at least try to look normal and Clifford, making his best 
effort, scrunches his face into the look of a demented kiwi. 
</P>
<P>
 Short, at 42, is the ideal actor to play a 10-year-old because, at his best, 
he always seems to carry around inside him the animus of a wacked-out imp. 
Therapists who extol getting in touch with the child within should take a long 
hard look at Martin Short and reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Short never gets gooey in "Clifford." From his first scene as a boy, when, on 
a plane trip with his parents en route to Hawaii, he forces a landing in Los 
Angeles so he can visit Dinosaurworld, Short keeps Clifford intensely, almost 
passionately weird. There have been a lot of movies about adults as children, 
or vice versa, but Short is beholden to none of them. He's bopping to his own 
syncopation here -- he's a peewee pain with an unaccountably lewd undercurrent. 
(It's the lewdness that lifts his impersonation out of the kiddie comic 
category.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the movie is taken up with Clifford's sojourn with his bachelor uncle 
and his girlfriend, Sarah (Mary Steenburgen). Ditched by his parents and 
longing for a day at the Jurassic Park-like Dinosaurworld, Clifford at first 
comes on all adorable -- and Short playing adorable is not a pretty sight. When 
Uncle Marty reneges on his plans to take the tyke to the theme park, Clifford 
turns Bad Seed. The funniest moments in the movie are the goony duets between 
Short and Grodin. Their comic styles couldn't be further apart: Short's nattery 
verve is a universe apart from Grodin's down tempo spaciness. If their scenes 
were better written (by Jay Dee Rock and Bobby Von Hayes) and directed (by Paul 
Flaherty), these two actors might have come up with some classic bits together. 
They come close a few times anyway, particularly when Uncle Martin grows 
homicidal toward his little charge and Clifford responds by tootling on his 
flute like a Pan gone crackers. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers pull off the illusion of making Short seem convincingly, well, 
short. Cinematographer John Alonzo, production designer Russell Christian and 
costume designer Robert DeMora conspire to make Short the low center of gravity 
in his scenes. But the success of the illusion is often more inventive than 
anything going on inside it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you could do worse than to check out a movie where a foreshortened 
Short frugs on the dance floor beneath a forest of towering co-eds. Or a movie 
where Short impales Grodin with a bagel. If the producers of "Clifford" are 
smart, they'll release it on video as a trailer of its best scenes. If they 
were smarter, they would have released it into the theaters the same way. 
</P>

park that may be scary for very small children, and some mild sexual 
references.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'GRIEF' AN ENDEARING MIX OF HUMOR, POIGNANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Grief" may be an unlikely title for a comedy, but a large part of its appeal 
is in its willingness to take its people seriously amid much laughter. In a 
nifty feature debut, writer-director Richard Glatzer makes hilarious use of his 
experiences as producer of "Divorce Court" as he takes us into the crazed world 
of the writers for a lurid daytime courtroom TV show. The staff runs the gamut 
of sexual orientation from gay to straight, from an individual uncertain about 
his orientation to another of indeterminate gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Glatzer picks a particularly tumultuous week in the production office of "The 
Love Judge," headquartered in Hollywood's Art Deco Montecito. Central among six 
key characters is Craig Chester's Mark, a pleasant, preppie-looking story 
editor considered to be among the most gifted of the series' writers and one of 
the operation's more mature presences. However, he's facing the first 
anniversary of the death of his lover from AIDS. Meanwhile, Jo (Jackie Beat), 
the show's producer, announces she's leaving to get married. This doesn't mean 
she still isn't thrown into a tizzy every time she discovers evidence that her 
office's couch has been used for some off-duty lovemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key figures are Jo's man-crazy assistant Leslie (Illeana Douglas), who's 
eager to break into writing; Bill (Alexis Arquette), who's just broken up with 
his girlfriend; the muscular Jeremy (Carlton Wilborn), as wise as he is sexy, 
and the ambitious Paula (Lucy Gutteridge). 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing upon his personal as well as professional experiences -- like Mark, he 
has also lost a lover -- the insightful Glatzer is a filmmaker of humor and 
compassion. He also brings a sure sense of structure and makes the most of an 
opportunity to display a gift for sharp, witty dialogue. "Grief" takes place 
virtually entirely within "The Love Judge" offices, yet it is always cinematic, 
never stagy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever "Grief" threatens to get too emotional, Glatzer deftly cuts to 
glimpses of outrageous "Love Judge" episodes, which feature cameos by Mickey 
Cottrell (as the judge), Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and performance artists 
Johanna Went and John Fleck. The stories the writers concoct border on the 
delirious as do their inevitable mutations -- Jeremy has come up with a story 
idea about a leper only to find him turned into a diabetic amputee. 
</P>
<P>
 The hefty Beat, most appropriately described as a male actress, to borrow 
Charles Pierce's self-description, shines under Glatzer's direction, as does 
everyone. Douglas is especially sparkling as the vibrant, self-deprecating 
Leslie, and Chester, who made his film debut as Nathan Leopold in "Swoon," once 
again conveys exceptional intelligence and perception. Made on a low-low 
budget, "Grief" has been resourcefully designed (by Don Diers) and photographed 
(David Dechant). "The Love Judge" may be laughably outlandish, but the people 
of "Grief" prove to be real and endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes much coarse language, 
adult humor and discussion about sexual themes.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'BABY,' 'MADMAN' HIT THE MIDNIGHT CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's midnight movie madness as the Nuart launches "Spider Baby," which will 
play Friday and the next two Fridays, while the Sunset 5 will show "Memoirs of 
a Madman" Fridays and Saturdays for at least a month, also starting Friday. 
Both are horror pictures with crazies on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither film fulfills the midnight movie ideal, which calls for outrageous, 
disreputable fun or for pictures that are so bad they're good. "Spider Baby," a 
campy low-low-budget '60s horror flick, is amusing enough to approach the 
second ideal, whereas "Memoirs of a Madman" is hopeless by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spider Baby" tells of three demented young adults -- two sisters, one blonde 
(Beverly Washburn), the other brunette (Jill Banner), with a thing for spiders, 
and their all-but-drooling bald brother (Sid Haig, an exploitation stalwart of 
the era). Cared for by their devoted, protective family chauffeur (Lon Chaney 
Jr., in a game, gallant portrayal), they live in the countryside in a large 
hilltop Victorian. The trouble is that a predatory cousin (Carol Ohmart), 
accompanied by her nice-guy brother (Quinn Redeker) and her mercenary attorney 
(Karl Schanzer) and his assistant (Mary Mitchell), turn up to try to get their 
hands on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything that ensues is laughably predictable and silly, but primitive as it 
is, "Spider Baby" is a professional effort in which Hill makes an attempt at 
style, aided by Al Taylor's shadowy black-and-white cinematography and Chaney's 
willingness to play straight. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, George and Mike Baluzy's "Memoirs of a Madman" is a rambling, 
spoofy amateur effort that feebly attempts to justify itself as a dark comedy. 
Somehow, the taunts of two customers (none other than '60s underground star 
Taylor Mead and Quentin Crisp, who also narrates the film) in a roadside cafe 
disturb a young man (Richard Craven) to the extent that he ends up in a mental 
institution, where he becomes part of a break-out led by a homicidal maniac 
(Brad Bechard) eager to go on a killing spree. Among the escapees is a 
transsexual (Jerome Linnemann) in love with Bechard, a goofy Neanderthal type 
(Ralph Giordano). There's absolutely nothing memorable about this "Memoirs." 
</P>

violence and menace.

THEATER BEAT: A CAMPY STAGE VERSION OF 'FOXES,' FOR SURE, FOR SURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently the 1980 film "Foxes" has a cult following. How else to explain the 
tribal gathering on Friday nights at the Hudson Backstage in Hollywood? There a 
"film-to-theater interpretation" by Scotch for Breakfast Productions is staging 
a cross-gender version of the movie about teen-age Valley girls that featured 
Jodie Foster. They call it "Phoxes," probably on advice of counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's unnecessary, since the pretentious, sentimental Hollywood version is 
finally getting the camp treatment it deserves. Now the Sally Kellerman 
character (portrayed to mirror perfection by Brett Paesel) is justifiably a 
hoot as she cries, "Hips! You make me hate my hips!" And the uncanny Foster 
imitation by Loretta Fox as Kellerman's daughter projects a latent panic of the 
1970s, etched in her trademark laugh. There's even a walking soundtrack when 
Bruce Daniels hilariously lip-syncs to Donna Summer's disco anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 The delirious experience recalls the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" phenomenon. 
"Phoxes" is to traditional theater what Yellow Zonkers are to caviar. Beware: 
Whether "Foxes" or "Phoxes," it's a guilty pleasure, full of empty calories and 
disgustingly addictive. Screening the film would probably help, since director 
Benjamin Zook's adaptation reprises entire scenes while assuming the audience 
is familiar with the plot. But homework isn't mandatory to enjoy this odd but 
exhilarating homage to the second-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Phoxes," Hudson Backstage, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. Fridays, 
10:30 p.m. (Saturdays, 10:30 p.m., starting April 9.) Indefinitely. $10. (213) 
660-TKTS. Running time: 2 hours. 'The Firebugs' Glow Dies Before Igniting 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The All-U-Can-Eat Players remain on the road previously taken by the Actors' 
Gang. Just as Tim Robbins' company did after graduating from UCLA, the Players 
migrated from Indiana University to Hollywood. Like the Actors' Gang, they also 
prefer darkly comic Expressionist and absurdist classics such as their 1994 
season-opener, "The Firebugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Where the two companies separate is on aesthetic grounds. While the Actors' 
Gang wildly exploits "The Oresteia" currently, the Hoosier kids struggle to 
faithfully realize "The Firebugs." But at the World Theatre, a devout approach 
gets undermined by space limitations and conceptual detours. Although there are 
scenes of transcendent menace, and harrowing images sometimes gather in the 
claustrophobic space like nightmares, "The Firebugs" never ignites. It's a 
parody of a classic, more kitsch than absurdist. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss novelist Max Frisch wrote "The Firebugs" in 1958 as a cautionary fable 
about how corruption consumes any society that placates evil. Thematically and 
stylistically, it resembles the late Eugene Ionesco's "Rhinoceros" and Harold 
Pinter's theater of menace. But in tone, "The Firebugs" could be an Arthur 
Miller morality play about the responsibility of individuals to resist 
extremism. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown arsonists have been burning the city, neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Businessman Biedermann (a magnetic Michael Kostroff) curses these pyro-Nazis, 
but remains passive when a sinister stranger moves uninvited into his attic. If 
they share space and food, he reasons, then peaceful coexistence should 
prevail. Eventually, Biedermann's wife (a frenetic Kathryn Kelly) and servant 
(a hilarious Kimmy Robertson) uneasily accept the stranger. Compromise leads to 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tuc Watkins sacrifices suspense in the name of cartoonish gags. Since 
the narrow stage won't permit both the attic and dining room to be 
simultaneously present (as in Frisch's original text), parallel visual puns are 
missing while scene changes disrupt narrative logic. The pace is regrettably 
slowed as well by these transitions, and the impact is further undermined by 
the addition of an intermission to a one-act play. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dietl and Christopher Reintz are a memorable team of arsonists, ludicrous 
yet ominous madmen on a mission. Commentary is provided by a one-man Chorus 
(Michael Hunt) in a fireman's uniform, marking time with a miniature xylophone; 
his monotone delivery, at first quite effective, gradually evokes a soporific 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Firebugs," World Theatre, 6543 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends April 19. $10. (213) 883-1565. Running time: 1 
hour, 40 minutes.

<P>
 'Ice Pick': Eloquent, Vivid AIDS Drama 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Celebration Theatre, British playwright John Roman Baker provocatively and 
eloquently explores the hell of AIDS-haunted gay relationships in "The Ice 
Pick." Although somewhat repetitious toward its moving climax, the story of 
HIV-positive Michael (Doug Spearman) and HIV-negative Peter (Michael Latimer) 
possesses a harrowing, hypnotic grace. The actors (including Stanton Schnepp's 
multitude of fine cameo roles) resemble superb musicians performing a Bach 
fugue, gradually exposing emotions that are heartbreakingly vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it the virus, or fear of intimacy, that threatens to extinguish their 
passion? Is AIDS like an ice pick that plunges into the heart of love? Or is 
AIDS-hotline counselor Peter really the ice pick chipping away at his lover's 
frigid detachment? The playwright shrewdly encircles the epidemic by focusing 
on his couple's stereotypical relationship struggles. Director Jason Jacobs 
beautifully maintains an elegiac pace, with brief scenes hovering between 
blackouts like pictures at an exhibition. This reflective tone encourages us to 
ponder the universal ramifications of AIDS while focusing on the compelling 
particulars of a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Ice Pick," Celebration Theatre, 7051-B Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends April 19. $10. (213) 660-TKTS. 
Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. 'Farm Team' Revue Bats a Thousand * 
</P>
<P>
 The Groundlings' farm team of rookies and minor league players are allowed in 
public once a week. The title of their revue, "Slippery When Sunday," implies 
that these rookies fumble like Michael Jordan on a baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 But the writing on Sundays is first-string. Aside from an over-written 
rap-parody of the Clintons, none of the sketches clunk. "Flowers" is an 
inspired comment on office politics and feminism. "Wuthering Heights" displays 
the superb physical gifts of Carolyn Hennessy, while "Talk Show" does the same 
for Chris Kattan as the missing link. Indeed, it's the physical clowning by 
these newcomers that inspires the most laughs. There's nothing grounded about 
these Groundlings. In fact, at times they remind us of Jordan on a basketball 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Slippery When Sunday," Groundling Theatre, 7307 Melrose Ave., West 
Hollywood. Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. $12. (213) 934-9700. Running time: 
2 hours. The 'Housekeeper's' Theory Falls Short 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Adolf and Angela, the dysfunctional siblings. Adolf's hot for his niece. 
Angela's in denial. Alas, their co-dependency spawns the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Eliza Wyatt based "The Housekeeper" on research about Adolf 
Hitler's childhood and pre-Reich life. But this research never comes to life at 
the Burbage Theatre Ensemble. Inert exposition and awkward flashbacks muddle an 
earnest courtroom docudrama about Hitler's half-sister Angela's (Kerry 
Michaels) complicity in little Adolf's incestuous relationship with her 
daughter (Soleil Moon Frye). 
</P>
<P>
 "The first crime he committed with his own two hands" becomes the focus of 
Wyatt's investigation of the origins of Nazism. Michaels labors mightily to 
make believable the half-sister's complicity, but her acting is burdened by the 
symbolic baggage of representing Germany's denial of genocide. Hitler's father 
is portrayed with predictable tyranny by Robert Schuch. Frye has a magnetic 
stage presence equal to her work as TV's Punky Brewster. But such isolated 
signs of life get suffocated by Francine Markow's ponderous story-theater 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Housekeeper," The Burbage Theatre Ensemble, 2330 Sawtelle, Los Angeles. 
Thursdays, 8 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 7:30 p.m. Ends May 7. $12-$15. (310)

ART REVIEWS; SCANLAN'S HUMBLE HOUSE-AND-GARDEN WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No artist is more revered for fusing high art and everyday life than Marcel 
Duchamp. Yet today the iconoclastic Dadaist's pieces rest comfortably in 
museums. Stripped of their function, his urinal, bicycle wheel and bottle rack 
have become untouchable icons of modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scanlan's handcrafted works at Christopher Grimes Gallery forgo the shock 
value of Duchamp's ready-mades by restoring the idea that art can be useful. 
Awkwardly out of place in a gallery, his collapsible bookshelves, biodegradable 
flower pots and customized dropcloths would seem more at home in apartments or 
home-improvement stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity to adapt defines Scanlan's frugal art. Each tier of his 
bookshelves stacks up to fit into a nook in his small Chicago apartment. Each 
tier also nests inside another, making transport cheap and easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mirrors made of aluminum foil aren't as reflective as mirrors made of 
glass, but they get the job done. Unbreakable, they make careful packaging 
unnecessary and emphasize the mobile, makeshift nature of contemporary urban 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 What appears to be a pile of dirt on the floor is actually a mixture of coffee 
grounds, eggshells, cigar butts and sawdust. These useless byproducts of 
Scanlan's life imply that he is more interested in the potential of new 
processes than in the conclusions of old ones. His approach to collecting 
shares more with recycling than with what usually takes place in the art world, 
where precious objects are obsessively accumulated and painstakingly preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan's humble, house-and-garden art embodies an ethos of American 
practicality and asks us to alter our understanding of Duchamp. Rather than 
seeing the father of the ready-made as the progenitor of appropriation, Scanlan 
proposes that we focus on an overlooked component of his oeuvre . 
</P>
<P>
 In Duchamp's apartment, a single door was hinged at the intersection between 
adjoining doorways. As a functional object, the door did two jobs at once: It 
was, simultaneously, open and shut. As a work of art, it was exactly what it 
was, but never only that. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan's crafty, self-effacing works function similarly, becoming nearly 
invisible as they serve utilitarian purposes. Built on the belief that art 
works best when it disappears into the rhythms of our daily lives, his 
do-it-yourself Dada shapes our surroundings while almost escaping our notice.

 Visual Poetry: Larry Johnson specializes in messages with double-meanings. 
Nine big, computer-generated photographic prints at Margo Leavin Gallery 
articulate a slick visual poetry. Readers careen between cliches and secrets, 
sometimes coming up empty-handed and at other times coming across oblique 
meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson begins by refusing to tell his viewers what to think. Unlike many 
other artists who use words as the central feature of their work, he doesn't 
beat us over the head with unequivocal statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Stick With Some Writing On It" depicts exactly that, although the writing 
Johnson employs is intentionally ambiguous, and even contradictory, in 
conveying his emotions. It's impossible to disentangle fraudulence from 
sincerity in this sly image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lillyput" presents this nonsensical word in five designs emblazoned across 
shapes that resemble a pennant, a button, a certificate, a stamp and a bumper 
sticker. Recalling the little people in "Gulliver's Travels," Johnson's 
deliberately misspelled labels suggestively identify a nation, a college team, 
a candidate, a product or a stamp of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Noblesse, Oh Please," printed across a pair of pennants, implies that if you 
don't act on your own behalf, someone will treat you as a victim of unwanted 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 In Johnson's hands, language is a slippery game of high-stakes seduction. With 
great economy, his promiscuous pieces put viewer and artist on the same 
footing, equally implicated in an indeterminate drama of desire, deception and 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivery, rhythm and emphasis complicate matters tremendously. Style is as 
important as content. In the end, Johnson's colorful pictures are not limited 
to expressing personal identity, but address the ways all viewers decipher 
unknown codes and relate to shifty visual stimulation. 
</P>

 Sweetly Poignant: Four years ago, FBI agents broke into Jock Sturges' San 
Francisco studio and improperly seized his photographic equipment, for which 
they were later rebuked by a federal grand jury. Today, he's still making some 
of the most sweetly poignant pictures of adolescents passing through puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jan Kesner Gallery, however, it's impossible not to imagine that Sturges' 
run-in with the federal government hasn't affected his portraits of nude 
children, teens and their parents. An unprecedented sense of toughness -- which 
sometimes slips into defiance -- encroaches upon the idyllic beach scenes for 
which the 47-year-old photographer is best known. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 18 gelatin silver prints exhibited, 17 were shot at a resort on 
France's Atlantic coast, where families of naturalists regularly take their 
summer vacations. For the past 12 years, Sturges has returned to Montalivet to 
photograph his friends and their children as they sleep, read and walk on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 His light-drenched images of lithe young bodies enjoying carefree afternoons 
have always been remarkable for their candor and innocence. Sturges' best 
pictures capture normally awkward adolescents in moments when they're not 
playing roles or pretending, but just being themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his new works include little children who don't seem to be striking 
poses, his subjects appear increasingly guarded and distant as they approach 
puberty. The suspicion and defensiveness that accompany self-consciousness 
enter Sturges' pictures, transforming his explorations of unspoiled innocence 
into a touching chronicle of its loss.

 Technical Merit: Selma Moskowitz's eight paintings at Jan Baum Gallery are 
technically interesting yet visually boring. The veteran L.A. abstractionist 
has invented a technique that combines the absorptive softness of watercolor 
with the reflective sheen of metallic pigment. Although marrying fluidity to 
impenetrability sounds as if it should result in captivating paintings, 
Moskowitz's images are too bland to maintain sufficient tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradictions never disrupt the over-worked surfaces of her acrylics on 
canvas and linen. Muted to the point of being dull, her recent works look like 
faded versions of American Colorfield painting or washed-out repetitions of her 
earlier series. 
</P>
<P>
 Moskowitz often applies more than 100 thin washes of acrylic to her paintings 
on linen, sanding each layer as she proceeds. As each wash evaporates, it 
shrinks the linen until the painting's surface is as taut as a snare drum. 
</P>
<P>
 Moskowitz also paints on vinylized cotton. Like a raincoat, this material 
repels paint, forcing the artist to manipulate beads and rivulets that don't 
soak into the canvas but rest on its surface. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ambiguities and inconsistencies of Moskowitz's methods made their way 
into her paintings, they would hold our attention much longer and be more than 
pleasant decorations.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; BOOK SOUP BISTRO STYLISH, STRUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The restaurant space in the Carolco building where Holloway meets Sunset 
Boulevard has undergone a variety of transformations in the last half dozen 
years, most under the auspices of the talented Chaya gang. There was the 
vaguely nautical Flags, which became the hard-to-pin-down, vaguely Sino-French 
Chaya Diner. This was followed by the listless Mexican restaurant/singles bar, 
El Chaya. The owners could not seem to find a concept for a vital, 
self-sustaining restaurant. Finally, the Chayans abandoned the site. After 
extensive renovations, the bookstore next door, Book Soup, moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Book Soup has long hosted book signings where fans and the visiting author 
were crammed in among the books and disinterested shoppers. This cafe space was 
annexed in part to provide a more appropriate venue for such events. But it is 
also trying to be a full-service restaurant, with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
 Book Soup Bistro has transformed the stylishly stark, slightly sunken Chaya 
space into a warm room with lots of dark, rosy wood and cozy, anachronistic 
golden light exuding from tasteful Craftsman-style hanging lanterns. The 
atmosphere is intimate and intellectual. Small black-and-white portraits of 
literary figures punctuate the walls; we were seated one night under a young, 
bespectacled James Joyce. There's an appealing bar, a bustling open kitchen, a 
charming outdoor patio. So far as looks go, this is one of the classiest, most 
atmospheric new restaurants around. If we can't be in Paris in the '30s, we 
might as well be in West Hollywood in the '90s.  
</P>
<P>
 One can't take the bistro appellation too seriously. I suspect that its 
bookish owners selected bistro over other restaurant terms as much for its 
sound as its meaning; Book Soup Cafe, Book Soup Trattoria, Book Soup Kitchen 
might have served the place as well. Those looking for French bistro food will 
find only traces: a pistachio-veal pate; a nicoise salad, pommes frites . 
</P>
<P>
 Already on its second chef, Book Soup seems to have evoked the irksome 
resident spirits that so haunted the last three restaurants: This one too seems 
to be struggling for a workable defining concept. The menu is a good mix -- you 
can have a sandwich or three-course meal. You could have a drink, or a cup of 
joe, or a quick bowl of pasta. But the prices are a little high: a couple of 
salads, a couple of sandwiches, a couple of nonalcoholic drinks at lunch is, 
without desserts, mighty close to $50, which makes one think twice about 
stopping by for a casual mid-day meal.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bistro's biggest problem lies in the service. Sometimes, the service was 
so slow as to be laughable. What else can you do when you've been sitting 
peacefully on a weeknight in a less than half-full restaurant and nobody takes 
your order for 30 minutes? And when you finally get food, and nobody checks up 
on you or clears your plates or notices that you need another drink? You have 
to laugh or you'd get too grouchy to eat. In a literary, ironic kind of a way, 
I suppose it's interesting to see such a pretty, proud, ambitious restaurant 
display such hubris in erratic service. But I like this place: I want to see 
happily-ever-after, not the fall of a house of waitresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads are juicy and satisfying, particularly a wilted spinach salad with 
pancetta , or a special salad with delicious lamb sausage. Oysters are better 
ordered elsewhere, as is a too-thick, dull Tuscan bread and tomato soup. Both 
the grilled salmon and a special opah fish are beautifully grilled and served 
with earthy pureed beets and roasted potatoes. Half a small, tasty chicken 
comes with a wedge of polenta, more of those beets: These are all decent, 
mom-style dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 I envied my neighbor's fusilli with a simple, fresh tomato sauce; my order 
arrived so undercooked, it was still crunchy at the core, inedible. I sent it 
back, sat while my friend spooned up a cioppino chock full of fresh seafood 
that was overwhelmed by fennel. Eventually, another bowl of pasta arrived, this 
time cooked ever so slightly more -- although to reach a true al dente , it 
needed another three or four minutes in the boiling drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The grilled Book Burger is tasty; a grilled ahi tuna sandwich, with crunchy 
ginger and wonderful knuckly seaweed is dreamy. 
</P>
<P>
 The creme brulee is excellent: creamy, studded with fresh berries; a chocolate 
cherry bread pudding and apple tart pale in comparison. 
</P>

POP ALBUM CHART; PANTERA DRIVES ALL THE WAY TO NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pantera's "Far Beyond Driven" entered the chart at No. 1--far beyond where it 
was expected to debut. It remains to be seen, though, if these rockers have a 
big enough following--or if word-of-mouth is strong enough--to keep the album 
in the Top 10 very long. But Bonnie Raitt's "Longing in Their Hearts," which 
entered at No. 2, should have a long stay. New Age instrumentalist Yanni 
continues to amaze, climbing from No. 11 to No. 5 with his live album--putting 
a lot of mainstream acts to shame. Motley Crue didn't last in the elite circle 
very long, sinking to No. 28 after opening at No. 7 last week. The 
"Philadelphia" soundtrack, powered by Bruce Springsteen's Oscar-winning single, 
"Streets of Philadelphia," jumped from No. 34 to No. 12. R. Kelly's racy "Bump 
'n' Grind" steamed to the top of the pop singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Vauxhall & I," the latest batch of tunes about alienation and the dark side 
of romanticism by Morrissey, entered the chart at No. 18. His fifth solo album 
isn't likely to linger in the Top 20 too long (he's not a major commercial 
force) but it is, for him, an impressive debut.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: WHAT'S THAT STOMPING? HERE COMES 'JURASSIC PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A video retailer joked that "Jurassic Park" should be subtitled "The Beast 
That Ate the September Rental Market." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What he meant was that with MCA/Universal releasing Steven Spielberg's 
dinosaur adventure on home video Oct. 4 at $25, retailers' September budget for 
new titles will be gobbled up by stocking up on that movie. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The other part is Snow White. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney hasn't announced it yet, but industry retailers and distributors are 
saying that the home-video release of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is a 
sure thing -- for late September. Naturally this animated cartoon will be 
chewing up its share of the retailers' September budget too. 
</P>
<P>
 Between "Jurassic" and "Snow White," there won't be room left for much else in 
September. "Don't look for a lot of other releases that month," said John 
Thrasher, Tower Video's president of purchasing and distribution. "How can 
retailers bring in other titles after they've spent their wad on 'Jurassic 
Park' and 'Snow White'? " 
</P>
<P>
 But retailers may not have to worry about overlooking something. Thrasher 
figures other video companies won't even bother to compete with those two 
colossal titles. "They may try to hold off on some releases until November or 
maybe rush them out in late August or early September." 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean for renters? 
</P>
<P>
 If you thrive on new movies, you'd better count on other forms of 
entertainment in September and much of October. But September is usually a slow 
month for new home-video releases anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many other competing activities that month," Thrasher said. "For 
instance, kids gearing up to go back to school, the new fall TV season, the 
beginning of the football season and the baseball pennant races." Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 With the baseball season opening Sunday, look for a flood of baseball movies 
to be freshly promoted and price-reduced. One of the early moves in this market 
is FoxVideo repricing last year's "The Sandlot," featuring Karen Allen and 
James Earl Jones, to $20 next Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Buy your James Bond movies in the next few months or you may have trouble 
finding any. David Bishop, executive vice president of MGM/UA Home 
Entertainment, announced his company will cease shipments of the 16 movies on 
May 18. Though this marketing strategy is associated with Disney, MGM/UA has 
executed it successfully before with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Gone With the 
Wind." "Demand for the title grows while it's off the market and you can 
reintroduce it with a flourish at some later date," Bishop explained. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Film 
</P>
<P>
 "The Joy Luck Club" (Hollywood). A rare American movie focusing on the Asian 
American community. Based on Amy Tan's 1989 best-seller, it's about the 
strife-ridden relationship between four immigrant Chinese women and their 
Americanized daughters.  
</P>
<P>
 "M Butterfly" (Warner). Adapted from the hit play, it's based on the true 
story of a meek French diplomat (Jeremy Irons) who has a 20-year romance with a 
Chinese actor (John Lone) -- all the while believing the actor is a woman. It 
suffers badly in the translation to film, needing theatrical artifice to really 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 "Father Hood" (Hollywood). Patrick Swayze fans, beware. He's totally wrong for 
the role of a tough ex-con suddenly forced to be the father to his son and 
daughter, who've been in a foster home.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dazed and Confused" (MCA/Universal). In the summer of 1976, on the last day 
of school, a group of teens meander, chatter, joke and smoke pot. No real plot, 
no stars, no artificial dramatics -- but director Richard Linklater's lazy, 
upbeat movie is strong on mood and naturalistic dialogue.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Thing Called Love" (Paramount). Getting some interest because it's the 
late River Phoenix's last movie. But Samantha Mathis has the leading role, 
playing a New Yorker intent on becoming a star country singer-songwriter in 
Nashville. Playing one of her suitors, neither Phoenix not the movie is very 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 "Fearless," "The Age of Innocence," "A Bronx Tale" and "The Beverly 
Hillbillies" (Wednesday); "Malice," "Carlito's Way" and "Cool Runnings" (April 
13); "Mr. Jones," "Flesh and Bone," "Ruby in Paradise," "The Saint of Fort 
Washington" and "Another Stakeout" (April 20); "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Batman: 
Mask of the Phantasm" (April 26); "Ernest Rides Again" (April 27); "The Remains 
of the Day" and "A Perfect World" (May 4); "Addams Family Values," "The Three 
Musketeers," "Orlando" and "Into the West" (May 11); "The Piano" and "Rudy" 
(May 25); "Wayne's World 2" (June 8).

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: KEATON'S UNEASY YEARS WITH MGM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Silent film great Buster Keaton may not have been treated well when he moved 
over to MGM as sound spread through Hollywood. But MGM finally does well by him 
now -- via MGM/UA Home Video. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has been releasing a virtual history of early Hollywood in 
its exploration of the first talkies, gives Keaton a beautiful showcase in 
"Buster Keaton: The MGM Talkies" ($140), a new five-disc release that gathers 
up seven of his MGM talkies, each running about an hour and a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad that the films in this beautifully produced collection, complete with 
handsome notes and annotated chapter stops, don't live up to the packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, second-rate Keaton can dance pratfalls over any number of contemporary 
films masquerading as first-rate productions from second- and third-rate comic 
aspirants. And there are some delightful unexpected moments in these movies 
released between 1930 and 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free and Easy" could well be a modern-day bumbling agent trying to carve a 
career for any contemporary beauty contest winner -- this one just happens to 
be from Gopher City, Kan. There are some amusing moments with movie stars of 
the day, including Robert Montgomery, popping in here and there, and topical 
references to actors and directors all over the boards. Lionel Barrymore and 
Anita Page are featured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doughboys" (1930) turns out to be a tedious look at a World War I bumbler, 
with Keaton given too little to do and everyone just talking too much and doing 
too little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parlor, Bedroom and Bath" features the talents of Charlotte Greenwood and 
Reginald Denny, but again Keaton isn't given the chance to show what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sidewalks of New York" reunites Page and Keaton and it's one of Keaton's 
better talkie vehicles as a hapless young millionaire trying to reform street 
gang toughs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious MGM had no idea what to do with Keaton. The studio finally teamed 
him up with a comedian made for the sound age, Jimmy Durante. The two made a 
strange combination in which Durante usually overwhelmed the fragile Keaton, 
who in these MGM features always seems to find himself lost in a sea of 
cackling, often meaningless jabbering. "The Passionate Plumber!" (1932) is a 
contrivance that offers too much Durante and too little Keaton. In "What! No 
Beer?" Durante once again overwhelms Keaton in a mediocre Prohibition comedy 
about incompetent bootleggers. Only in his scenes with Phyllis Barry does 
Keaton show what might have been. It was his last starring feature in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The year before, he had made one of his best talkies, "Speak Easily." The 
script finally gives both Keaton, Durante and leading lady Thelma Todd good 
scenes to play and they make the most of them. For some reason, MGM always 
turned Keaton into a dim-witted somebody and this time it's a hapless professor 
who gets involved with a Broadway show troupe. It's really Durante's world, but 
Keaton is surprisingly good here, and silent film and early talkies star Todd 
makes a convincing talkie vamp. This one makes the whole package worth getting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the Buster Keaton package is not a stellar collection. Keaton 
proves that even a comic actor with impeccable timing and instincts still needs 
good material, or at least material that suits him, to be a success. 
Nonetheless, the distinctive sad-faced, downtrodden master of the silents is 
worth watching. Just don't try to take in all of these in one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Montgomery dominates the screen but doesn't easily dominate Norma 
Shearer in the 1931 film adaptation of Noel Coward's "Private Lives." The 
MGM/UA laser release, in full-bodied black-and-white ($35), doesn't miss a beat 
of the nonstop banter between the two divorced spouses who re-encounter each 
other on honeymoons with new spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is ever any doubt how it all will work out, it doesn't matter. The 
clever repartee is vintage Coward, and it doesn't get much better. Look for 
Jean Hersholt (the name usually comes up at Oscar time) and Reginald Denny to 
add spice to the sophisticated goings-on. 
</P>
<P>
 A bonus is a 1934 MGM short called "What Price Jazz?" which may prove to be 
more a slice of history than ever might have been originally intended, showing 
how the white Establishment regarded black music at the time.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'DEMOLITION' HOLDING STEADY AT NO. 2

 "Demolition Man," the sci-fi/action film starring Sylvester Stallone and 
Wesley Snipes, has to be one of the strongest also-rans ever on the rental 
chart. Retailers report that it's doing great rental business, but it's still 
stuck at No. 2. As potent as it's been, there's always been one with more 
appeal--first "In the Line of Fire" and now "The Fugitive." So does this leave 
"Demolition Man" in the bridesmaid position during its entire rental peak 
period? Maybe. But "Fugitive" could falter, since its rental potential is 
limited because it's also available for sale in the $16-$17 range. The surprise 
of the chart this week is the popularity of "Judgment Night," starring Emilio 
Estevez. Some retailers list it among their Top 5 rentals--noting that it's 
especially popular with teen audiences. It entered at No. 28 and zoomed to No. 
8. Woody Allen's "Manhattan Murder Mystery" took a healthy jump, from No. 30 to 
No. 18. But it's a long shot to make the Top 10. Chart debuts: "Gettysburg" 
(No. 27) and the Kathleen Turner movie "Undercover Blues" (No. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 * "So I Married an Axe Murderer," the comedy starring Mike Myers, did better 
its second week, climbing from No. 29 to No. 15. Cracking the Top 10 is 
possible but not likely, based on the movie's unimpressive box-office 
performance. 03,35,18,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1."The Fugitive" 5 2

TV REVIEWS; 'JAPAN IN AMERICA' VIEWS CULTURE CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Between Two Cultures: Japan in America," a look at the culture clash between 
Japanese nationals living in the United States and the Americans who come in 
contact with them, has the soft focus and feel of an "official" documentary put 
out to present a pleasant side to myriad thorny political and social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt that's because of the show's underwriters: the International Business 
Communications Council, an "association of Japanese automobile, computer, 
electronics and machinery manufacturers committed to improving global 
cooperation and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer-writer Peter Argentine clearly understands where the money is coming 
from: In "Between Two Cultures," serious issues ranging from racism to economic 
warfare are touched upon, then quickly become opportunities to bring about 
positive transformations in the parties involved. Michael Crichton need not 
apply.  
</P>
<P>
 There are some interesting issues raised, but the show's tone mitigates their 
impact. There is no mention of violent crimes against Japanese visitors, such 
as the fatal shooting of two teen-age college students in San Pedro last 
Friday. And much of the "gee, Mom, those people are different from us" material 
will be old hat to Southland viewers well-versed in the multicultural 
lifestyle. * "Between Two Cultures: Japan in America" airs at 10:30 tonight on 
KCET-TV Channel 28. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

TV REVIEWS; 'JESUS IN GALILEE' FOCUSES ON THE LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The life of Christ is a big row to hoe in just an hour, something recognized 
by the producers of "Mysteries of the Bible: Jesus in the Galilee." This A&E 
special narrows the focus, then, to the geography of the Holy Land that Jesus 
trod and how the "fertile valleys pierced by lofty heights" might have 
influenced the metaphors and mapping of his famously itinerant ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The archeological details uncovered and bucolic scenery offered will prove 
interesting enough, for the biblically literate at least, but the emphasis on 
topography may be a tad too narrow after all, rendering this installment of 
"Ancient Mysteries" less provocative than last week's Moses episode. Those 
tuning in for untold insight into Jesus as man, myth or Messiah on Good Friday 
will find the goings pretty sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the various ancient digs explored, the show curiously expends quite a 
few minutes recounting the excavation of a 1st-Century boat, uncovered in the 
sand when a 1986 drought brought the level of the Galilee down considerably. 
Narrator Richard Kiley then wonders whether this rare find can shed any new 
light on Jesus' ministry. Since he just leaves it at that, the answer, 
presumably, is no. 
</P>
<P>
 Other finds are made to seem more relevant, but the hour is weakest in its 
fleeting mentions of recent archeology. It's at its best in reconstructing the 
cultural conditions that were the subtext for the birth of Christianity, 
establishing the "politically uneasy peace" between the wary Jews and the 
occupying Roman forces. The biggest revelation for some may be that the land of 
the Galilee was much more urban and less agrarian than portrayed in the 
Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mysteries of the Bible: Jesus in the Galilee" airs tonight at 7 and 11 on 
A&E.

TV REVIEWS; 'FAMILIES' STUDIES U.S. MUSICAL STYLES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linda Ronstadt has only a cameo appearance in tonight's "Great Performances" 
installment, which turns its cameras toward six distinctive varieties of 
traditional music in America, from Celtic to Cajun. But, in talking about her 
beloved mariachis, she delivers the most obvious, universally applicable tag 
line: "You just think it's impossible this thing could survive one more 
generation, and it does." 
</P>
<P>
 That survival is documented in "The Songs of Six Families," which focuses on 
five relative unknowns and one legend, B. B. King being the climactic drawing 
card. Before getting to the bluesman, the 90-minute show visits slightly more 
exotic subcultures -- an Eskimo wolf dance, an Irish American flutist's 
communal celidh , a New Orleans tribe of Mardi Gras Indians, a Cajun stomp, a 
mariachi festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The passing on of such specific music in an increasingly homogenized (yet 
increasingly multicultural) country is what's most intriguing here -- and most 
skirted. The Irish flutist is seen giving a young descendant a penny-whistle 
lesson. A daughter in the Mexican American family tells how she used to beg her 
grandfather to turn the mariachi music off; she's quite a fiddler herself now. 
But these segments are all too short to really delve into difficulties the 
elder generations might face in competing with popular culture for the souls of 
their scions. The continuation of the lineage is mostly presented as a given, 
and the special -- charming as it is -- doesn't show us much of the chafing. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be unduly prejudiced toward the genre to be anticipating 
King's concluding segment most; if the blues aren't inherently superior to the 
preceding styles, there's still an awfully good reason why he's an icon. 
</P>
<P>
 King is also the most direct, and poignant, in addressing the generational 
problem: "In the black community, my fans are usually my age and older. I think 
a lot of the young people are ashamed of it. . . . If anybody knew what we've 
had to put up with and go through, to still be surviving today, I think a lot 
of them would pat us on the head, even the kids that don't like it." An 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Great Performances: The Songs of Six Families" airs tonight at 9 on KCET-TV 
Channel 28 and at 8 on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

TV REVIEWS; 'SISTER, SISTER' LIKABLE BUT DYSFUNCTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC's "Sister, Sister" is an amiable comedy series about identical twins who 
reunite at age 14 after having been parted at birth and adopted separately. No 
big laughs but lots of smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 It introduces Tia and Tamera Mowry as Tia Landry and Tamera Campbell. Neither 
knows the other exists until they stumble upon each other while shopping with 
their respective adoptive single parents. Tamera lives with reserved, 
strait-laced, well-to-do Ray Bampbell (Tim Reid) and Tia with earthy, mouthy, 
pushy, jobless Lisa Landr (Jackee Harry). 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who follows sitcoms will recognize what's coming: Although the parents 
have nothing in common and don't get along, the two families ultimately will 
merge under one roof, becoming a graceless, even dysfunctional foursome in the 
swanky Campbell home. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that this is hardly an epic comedy that you'd want to build an evening 
around, the premiere sharply disintegrates as it winds down. Yet the 
coming-of-age theme is appealingly executed -- witness the second episode, 
which finds the sisters having a conflict over dating. 
</P>
<P>
 And the girls, who sometimes address the camera from their shared bedroom, are 
cute and likable, as is Marques Roper as their romance-minded next-door 
neighbor, Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping there will be much less of the parents doing their bickering 
than of the kids awkwardly navigating their way through teenhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sister, Sister" premieres at 8:30 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42), with a second episode at 9:30 p.m.

VISIONS OF THE WEST; * 'DESERT DREAMS: THE ART OF MAYNARD DIXON' WILL FEATURE 
THE PAINTER'S SOUTHWEST LANDSCAPES AND DRAWINGS, POEMS AND LETTERS. 
</P>

 Dan Dixon remembers the day he knew he would never be an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 6 years old, and his father, painter Maynard Dixon, stopped en route to 
Taos, N.M., to sketch the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how hard young Daniel squinted at the landscape, he simply couldn't 
see the forms and relationships that his father so effortlessly translated into 
brush strokes. It wasn't until Dan looked at his father's finished sketches, he 
recalls, that he realized "those mountains were so blue, and those shadows so 
violet, and that the cactus there in the foreground had something important to 
say, and that the sky climbed in deepening, darkening levels to the infinite 
vault of heaven." At that moment, Dan, now 68, decided he better try writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desert Dreams: The Art of Maynard Dixon" opens Saturday at the Gene Autry 
Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park. The first major show of Dixon's 
evocative Southwest landscapes, it features 70 works, including many never 
exhibited publicly before, as well as drawings, poems and letters by the 
artist. There are also photographs of the eccentric artist at work, 
extraordinarily good photographs since his second wife (and Daniel's mother) 
was the legendary Dorothea Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald J. Hagerty originally organized the show for the Museum of Fine Arts 
and Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe (the show travels next to the Charles M. 
Russell Museum in Great Falls, Mont., then to the Fresno Metropolitan Museum). 
A former administrator and teacher of American studies at UC Davis, Hagerty has 
been studying the artist and his work for more than 15 years and is the author 
of a lavishly illustrated book called "Desert Dreams: The Art and Life of 
Maynard Dixon," published last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Fresno in 1875, Dixon was still a teen-ager when he sent work to 
Frederic Remington to critique. "You draw better than I did at your age," the 
great Western artist wrote back. By the age of 18, Dixon was a commercial 
artist and quickly became known for his Sunset magazine covers and other scenes 
of Western life. But, in Hagerty's view, the mature Dixon had a vision, both 
mystical and modern, that transcended genre. "One of the things I really tried 
to do in the book was show he wasn't just a cowboy and Indian painter," Hagerty 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hagerty theorizes that Dixon's early experience as a poster and billboard 
designer had a major influence on his later paintings, with their compelling 
colors and simplified, sculptural shapes. "You can really see how his painting 
changed after 1920," says Hagerty. "He realized he could eliminate nonessential 
detail and strengthen the power of the painting by doing so." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon genuinely loved the desert and would disappear into it, all alone, for 
long periods of time. "He would tell Dorothea he'd be gone for two weeks and be 
gone for two months," Hagerty says. (According to son Dan, Dixon much preferred 
building himself a sweat lodge to taking a conventional bath.)  
</P>
<P>
 Although Dixon was a regionalist in the best sense, he was never provincial, 
Hagerty says. He never studied in Europe or even visited it, but he was, by 
nature, in sympathy with the Europeans who were exploding the conventions of 
academic art. Dixon was especially interested in Cubism, says Hagerty, who sees 
the movement's influence in the thrusting angles of "Wild Horses of Nevada" 
(1927). Obviously linked thematically with Remington and the other creators of 
the common vision of the West, Dixon is also kin to such contemporary artists 
as Georgia O'Keeffe and Helen Frankenthaler, Hagerty says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Dixon's vision was unique. "He was never derivative," says 
Hagerty. "You could tell a Maynard Dixon through a brick wall, the style is so 
much his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon was a genuine character, who dressed for years all in black, wore 
high-heeled cowboy boots and carried an ebony sword cane, topped with a silver 
thunderbird (his trademark). As independent as any Gary Cooper cowboy, Dixon 
never hesitated to call a critic a bozo or otherwise speak his mind. "There was 
nobody dull behind the painting," says Hagerty. 
</P>
<P>
 Now an advertising executive in Pasadena, Dan Dixon recalls his parents with 
enormous respect and some residual pain. He chuckles at the memory of 
figure-study classes Dixon taught in Southern California, attended by men who 
spent their days at Disney, animating Snow White. As Dixon sketched the nude 
model in front of him, his left hand was infallible. "The crayon would never 
leave the paper," Dan recalls. "It was all one uninterrupted instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon was never a cuddly parent, even before he and Lange were divorced in 
1935. But he could be wonderful, his son says. When Dan and his brother John 
were young, they treasured visits to their father's studio. Dixon would make up 
stories for his boys, illustrating the tales as he told them, on huge rolls of 
brown butcher paper he unfurled on the studio floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my father was a very gifted man, but I believe my mother was an 
authentic genius," says Dan. Which is not to say they were perfect parents. Dan 
and his brother were boarded out during some of their childhood -- it was the 
Depression and their parents were professionals trying to make a living. That 
experience, says Dan, "left wounds that in some ways have never healed." Today 
Dan is a partner in Older & Wiser Ltd., a firm that markets goods and services 
to people over 50. He is able to offer unique insights into his parents and 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange, who died of cancer in 1965, will always be remembered for her haunting 
images of the Great Depression. But, as Dan reminds, she started out as a 
portrait photographer in San Francisco. He thinks one strain on his parents' 
marriage was that Lange spent years taking pictures of the rich to support the 
family while Dixon catered only to his talent. An occasional collaborator with 
his mother, writing text for her photos, Dan ascribes some of the evocative 
power of her pictures to an unlikely source -- a case of polio in childhood 
that left her with a permanent limp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were "no grab shots" in Lange's portfolio, Dan says. Her subjects always 
had time to compose themselves, to find their dignity, because "she never snuck 
up on nobody." The people in front of her lens "trust her, and I think that's 
why those photographs tell us the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Dixon and Lange influenced each other. Some of Lange's Southwestern 
images -- a weathered Hopi face, an abandoned adobe -- could be studies for his 
paintings. And, during their years together, Dixon did a series of paintings of 
the urban poor and oppressed that are like the rest of his work only in their 
power. Dan is in the process of organizing an exhibit for 1996 that will bring 
together both Lange's socially conscious images and the less famous work his 
father did on the same populist themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon's last years were spent with third wife, Edith Hamlin. Strangled by 
emphysema, he died in 1946. Hamlin was Dixon's tireless champion until her own 
death in 1991. Both Lange and Hamlin left oral histories of their years with 
Dixon, and Dan and John Dixon have also reminisced for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Dan's idea to weave all four voices together in a book on Dixon, called 
"The Thunderbird Remembered." The Autry has just published the new book, which 
is full of photos, sketches and memories of the man who looked at the desert 
and saw what others could not. WHERE AND WHEN

ON THE DRAWING BOARD; * SYLMAR'S CENTURY GALLERY IS DISPLAYING FIVE ARTISTS' 
INITIAL SKETCHES ALONGSIDE THEIR FINISHED WORKS. 'SKETCHY BEGINNINGS' OFFERS 
THE PUBLIC A RARE INSIGHT INTO INSPIRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an art gallery, we are usually treated solely to the finished work of an 
artist. Yet, regardless of the medium, an artist's completed image has often 
evolved from the merest of sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 At Century Gallery in Sylmar, viewers can see five artists' fully realized 
works, accompanied by their initial sketches and other inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to artists' studios, this is what they always show me. They always 
have things taped and thumbtacked up -- what inspired them," said gallery 
director Lee Musgrave. "I've always wanted to show that material. Most artists 
are hesitant to show it. They don't want people to know. The material is 
increasingly valuable to scholars and museums." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, called "Sketchy Beginnings," provides some insight into the 
varied stages artists go through. Some sketches serve only as a point of 
departure for the final work. In others, one can see all of the nuance and 
detail; the sketches stand as accomplished works of art in and of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Shelton's very large triptych, "Good Doggie," in oil and encaustic on 
canvas, begins with a pencil-on-paper drawing of the central painting, 
"Composition Study." In a biting commentary on the corporate structure and its 
minions, the main image is of a corporate soldier walking into headquarters. A 
rather mangy dog is passing by. In the left panel is a dead cockroach on its 
back. The right one contains symbols of money and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the pencil study and the finished triptych, Shelton also did a small 
oil-on-canvas "Dog Study," which depicts only the dog; an oil-on-canvas 
"Architectural Study" of the building in the central image without man or dog; 
and a small "Oil Study" of the triptych. All of these studies are on view. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixed-media sketch on paper for "Landscape of Dishonor" by Frank Gutierrez 
conveys a good sense of the finished work's composition, but not of the bodies 
that ooze out of an open pipeline in a virtual sea of oil. The fully realized 
figures and the drama of the final work are not evident in the first, 
streamlined version. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanore Rembaum's photographs of architectural elements capture aspects of 
the complex urban environment that fascinate her. Here, her pictures form a 
mixed-media "Study" for abstract, geometric monoprints such as "Spatial 
Concepts" and "Spatial Design Panes." 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures in newspapers and magazines are the catalyst for Richard Beck's 
abstract, surrealistic oil paintings. "Landscape With White Eruption" is rooted 
in a newspaper photo of an F-4 Phantom jet slamming into a wall at 480 m.p.h. 
"Southwestern Landscape with Crater" developed from images of a bomb crater and 
a tanker explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Valdes' studies consist of simple blue ink on notebook paper drawings. 
His oil on canvas, "Singing, Some Say Somewhere Someday," depicts two women 
joyously strumming guitars in an appealing outdoor environment. One wears a 
peace symbol around her neck. Both have angels' wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes states: "I picture such a place. Where friendly songs can be heard so 
high up in the mountains, the last place where man hasn't built or paved a 
parking lot. Like summer breezes, and easy lazy days that we all remember." 
</P>
<P>
 One could never see that vision in Valdes' sketch. That sketch, and the 
photographic images that have inspired these artists, "have no identifiable 
texture or quality," Musgrave said. But the completed works have a quality 
specific to the artist. For Musgrave, it is a pleasure to present insight into 
the process of how artists take images around us and make them their own. WHERE 
AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Sketchy Beginnings." 
</P>

JAZZ IS CLOSEST TO HIS HEART; * BOB SHEPPARD AND HIS MODERN-MINDED QUARTET WILL 
PLAY ORIGINALS AND 'EXPERIMENT' WITH SOUNDS AT COMMON GROUNDS IN NORTHRIDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a typical week for reed man Bob Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Los Angeles March 24 on a red-eye flight from Maui, where he was 
performing on Steely Dan's Walter Becker's newest album, due out on Giant 
Records this summer. Then that night, he drove from his North Hollywood home to 
the Club Brasserie in West Hollywood, playing substantial straight-ahead jazz 
in a quartet led by bassist Dave Carpenter. On Saturday, he was down in Orange 
County, sight-reading arrangements behind the vocal group Beachfront Property. 
And starting Monday, he was recording an album of tunes by guitarist Pat 
Metheny, arranged by bandleader Bob Curnow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard, who is just as skilled at reading complex scores at first sight as 
he is at knocking out a turn-your-head jazz solo, is one of Southern 
California's most in-demand musicians. In an era when many players are 
witnessing very slow times, Sheppard works as much as six days a week, 
appearing with anyone from Sheena Easton and Steely Dan to keyboardists Lyle 
Mays, Billy Childs and Bill Cunliffe, as well as his own band. "It's fun. What 
a blessing it is to play music for a living!" he says with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, Sheppard works for others. For instance, he'll tour Japan 
with Steely Dan -- led by Becker and Donald Fagen -- later this month. He 
sometimes plays woodwinds on a movie or TV soundtrack: Recent jobs have 
included "Naked Gun 33 1/3" and the upcoming "Quiz Show" and "Major League II." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the challenge," he says of soundtrack work. "I like to put on 
different hats every day. The mix of studio work keeps me at the top of my 
craft." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard says that jazz is closest to his heart, though -- if there were 
sufficient gigs, he'd play it nonstop. He leads a quartet Monday at Common 
Grounds in Northridge, and Wednesday at the Club Brasserie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anyone in L. A. who can make a living playing jazz," he says. 
"Still, I love any opportunity there is to play. I'll even take a freebie, even 
though it goes against my basic philosophy that you should be compensated. In 
Los Angeles, though, playing out is more of a showcase for music and your 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Common Grounds, Sheppard will bring along drummer David Hocker, bassist 
Jeff DeAngelo and guitarist Larry Koonse. He says the modern-minded band will 
play originals and jazz standards and "experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to play interactively," he begins. "With the right guys, it's 
interesting; things happen; it's never the same. The whole intent of jazz is to 
be open. With that in mind, this music's always a surprise. Still, what we play 
is traditional jazz. Though there are free elements, it's very structured. It's 
almost the same as Dixieland jazz, except that the jazz language is much more 
advanced." 
</P>
<P>
 He specializes in tenor sax. Sheppard coaxes a round, bold tone from his 
instrument, and his improvised lines are alternately angular and leaping, and 
curving and seamless. Influenced first by John Coltrane, and later, by Michael 
Brecker and Jerry Bergonzi, Sheppard has for years sought his own voice. "If I 
listen to any of their records, I try to sound like them," he says, "so I 
listen to other music, like classical, to try and make my playing different." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard has garnered plenty of respect from his cohorts. "He can play, " says 
jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, using the word jazz musicians employ for being 
a telling improviser. Sheppard performed with Hubbard from the early '80s 
through 1992. Sheppard says playing with the trumpeter was "one of the best 
lessons ever." 
</P>
<P>
 "Freddie wants you to play your best, not hold back," he says. "He knows how 
to shape a solo, grab you by the shirt and pull you along." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard, a native of Trenton, N. J., who has a master's degree from the 
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N. Y., came to Los Angeles in the early 
'80s, and soon his reputation was established. He says that though he's happy 
to make such a good living with his instruments, there are pitfalls. "When 
you're working all the time, it doesn't leave much room for creative 
activities, like working on your music and practicing," he says. "You forget 
your original intent in playing music, and it's really a fight to keep your 
creative juices flowing." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>

A LIFE OF THE BLUES; * RANDY RICH HAS HAD A FEW OTHER JOBS, BUT MOSTLY HE'S 
MADE HIS WAY BY PLAYING HIS MUSIC ON THE L. A. BAR AND CLUB CIRCUIT.

<P>
 He has punched cows for a living, been a construction worker and driven a 
garbage truck. On the whole, Randy Rich would rather play the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Rich and the Ravens (drummer Pete Gallagher and bass player Brad Vance) 
have gained a substantial following in the San Fernando Valley area over the 
last three years with their hard-driving mix of blues and rock 'n' roll. They 
can be heard regularly at the Santa Clarita Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, 42, who was born in Florida but spent his high school years in Canoga 
Park, is a charter member of the hard-scrabble L. A. bar and club circuit. 
Apart from a few labor jobs, it's all he's ever done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't doing this," Rich says. "It seems to 
work. I love doing it. I can't think of life without it." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of an aircraft builder, Rich got his first guitar when he was 11. As a 
teen-ager in the '60s, he and his pals were devoted to disc jockey Wolfman 
Jack's radio show. "If you weren't listening to it, you were in trouble," he 
says. "We were always running around record stores looking for old blues 
records, the more obscure the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich played in rock 'n' roll bands at school dances, but at home in the garage 
he returned to the blues. For years, he played only acoustic guitar, playing 
for change on the streets of San Francisco, in the Yosemite Valley and at 
Silverton, Colorado's turn-of-the-century fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a lot of different styles," Rich says. "I'd do Dylan's 'Masters of 
War' and then 'Milk Cow Blues' with a bottleneck, anything that's indigenous to 
this melting pot of music that we have in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich spent three years in Nashville playing guitar for singer-songwriter Ed 
Bruce ("Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys"). "But in the 
Nashville bars, we'd jam blues," he says. "I didn't have the voice for country. 
The blues seems to be my best avenue of expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Eclectic in his musical tastes ("Beethoven to Charlie Parker," he says), Rich 
admired such British blues invaders as the Blues Breakers and Eric Clapton, but 
he found their American success frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, it was OK for English guys to play the blues, but not for 
young American white guys," he says. "We knew where the music came from, 
although Clapton and the others never tried to fool anyone. In fact, they took 
blues players like Freddie King and Albert King on tour with them. They exposed 
audiences to the old heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich mixes in some Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter and Willie Dixon numbers in his 
sets now, and pays tribute to the old masters in his own repertoire of 28 
original songs. Although he has never had an album produced, Rich's songs are 
well known to his fans, who will invariably request "Voodoo Thing," a 
psychedelic number with a touch of Hendrix; "Suspicions and Doubts," a 
traditional slow blues, and "Rock This Joint," which has shades of Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich sells tapes of his music from the stage wherever he plays, and he says he 
has sold hundreds. Record labels have so far spurned him, he believes, because 
his music cannot be pigeonholed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say we're strictly traditional blues," he said. "I'm more into 
mixing other influences: old-time country, Cajun and rock 'n' roll. The small 
independent labels think I'm too rock 'n' roll; big-time labels think I'm too 
blues." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stop Mark and Sheila VanLeeuwen from booking Randy Rich and the 
Ravens into their new micro-brewery and bar, the Santa Clarita Brewing Co., for 
regular "Brews 'n' Blues" dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark VanLeeuwen, 33, quit his career as an insurance broker to turn three 
storefronts in a Soledad Canyon Road mall into a 150-seat brew-pub and 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Open since early January, the pub sells burgers and pizza and 400 gallons a 
week of handcrafted ales. In addition to blues nights, it has live bluegrass on 
Sunday nights and a sports trivia contest every Monday broadcast live on local 
radio station KBET (1220 AM) from 7 to 9 p.m. With two pool tables, two 
dartboards, two electronic-dart machines, a video game, huge clear windows and 
a strict no-smoking policy, it might seem like an odd place to hear the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little brighter than most bars, and it's a bit of a three-ring 
circus," says Randy Rich. "But everyone sure seems to have a good time." WHERE 
AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 Who: Randy Rich and the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Santa Clarita Brewing Co., 20655 Soledad Canyon Road, Santa Clarita.

<P>
 Hours: Pub is open 11 a.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 2 
a.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday. Randy Rich and the Ravens play at 
9:30 p.m. Saturday and April 16 and 23.

HOMAGE TO DRACULA; * THE MUSICAL 'V.A.M.P.' WILL PREMIERE TONIGHT AT WEST END 
PLAYHOUSE IN VAN NUYS. 
</P>

 Strange things are happening down in Malibu. Stranger than usual. Like . . . 
vampires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main character is a Louisiana teen-ager named Charlie Mondo, who's come 
to Southern California to visit his sister," says Larry Transue, whose 
eight-character musical "V.A.M.P." (short for Vampire Asylum Malibu Point) has 
its world premiere tonight at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys. "The two of 
them are trapped at the beach; their car won't start. Unbeknownst to them, 
they've fallen into a tourist trap for V.A.M.P." Lying in wait is a 
megalomaniac vampire named Nicholas, who believes that if he builds a vampire 
colony, all the world's bloodsuckers will beat a path to his door. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is not a serious drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show takes traditional elements, pulls from old horror movies -- and 
mixes that in with a modern-day story," explains director John Comstock, who's 
also a member of the comedy-improv group L.A. Connection Theatre. "It's really 
a homage to Dracula; some scenes are lifted right from the old story." 
</P>
<P>
 Comstock, who's been friends with Transue since high school, describes the 
writer's vision simply: "Larry is like a child -- in a good way -- and likes 
the fantasy, the playfulness of putting together a story." 
</P>
<P>
 "V.A.M.P" -- which also introduces the characters of vampire hunter Kathryn, 
Nicholas' brides Cecilia and Rachel, and his banker Michael -- is the second in 
a quartet of horror homages Transue has umbrella-titled "The Mondo Chronicles." 
In the first installment, "Rockenstein" (which was also directed by Comstock), 
Charlie and his friend Freddie Franken found the body of a teen-ager and 
brought it back to life with rock 'n' roll music. "The last two," says Transue, 
"will be The Wolfman, then we -- pardon the expression -- wrap it up with The 
Mummmy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Allentown, Pa., Transue, 30, grew up in the Philadelphia area, moving 
with his family to Southern California at age 13. He attended Pierce College 
and Cal State Northridge as a theater major, and currently works as a technical 
typist for a biotechnology company, relegating stage pursuits to nighttime and 
weekends. "I always loved horror movies," he says of his theatrical 
inspiration. "I love to be scared, and I love different types of music." 
</P>
<P>
 "V.A.M.P.," which is co-authored by Mary Comstock, the director's sister, has 
lyrics by Transue and an original score by Kyle Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very eclectic," Transue says of the music, "ranging from rock ballads to 
'40s dance numbers, to rockabilly, to a Rex Harrison talk-sing number." The 
writer himself will also be on hand to play the obnoxious male chauvinist 
Eddie, who meets his messy demise with the vampire's brides. "It's a nice 
cameo, and a good chance for me to get out and do it," Transue demurs. "But I'm 
not anything like the character." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "V.A.M.P." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: West End Playhouse, 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays, 3 p.m. Sundays. Closes April 24.

A CALL TO COLORS; FLOWERS ADD DRAMA TO A GARDEN. BUT EXPERTS SAY TO START WITH 
A PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HEEGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Heeger writes regularly about 
gardening for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing gladdens the heart like flowers: rustling roses and iris standing 
bloom-to-bloom along a path, around a pool, beside a sunny kitchen door. 
Freshly cut, they fill a dining room with fragrance. Set in pots, they accent 
entryways and places to sit. In the landscape, whether scattered among shrubs 
or bedded out in blazing color blocks, flowers help define garden space, adding 
texture and life to the green world outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the San Fernando Valley, spring borders already are bursting. But 
it's not too late to get a flower garden growing. In fact, according to Michael 
Wayt, a Tarzana landscape contractor and designer, the cool evenings, sunny 
days and moist soil of April are ideal for planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he and other experts warn that before heading for the nursery, 
garden-makers should ask themselves a few questions. For example, Wayt says, 
"How large an area do you plan to plant? Is it in sun or shade? What's in the 
background? Do you want to cut the flowers or enjoy them outside? How much time 
will you spend maintaining them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing a certain look for a landscape is another decision best made in 
advance, adds Ted Howard, a self-described garden artist from West Los Angeles 
who specializes in showy flower beds for a Valley-based clientele. "It's 
important to start with an idea," says Howard: a picture from a book, a color 
palette, a particular image from a neighbor's garden. He cautions, however, 
that gardens shown in magazines or books might grow in other areas of the 
country, where conditions -- and plant choices -- are different from ours. And 
even in local nurseries the plant selection varies, depending on the time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting flowers together isn't like building a brick wall," Howard maintains. 
"There are many factors. You need to be flexible -- and understand what plants 
are and what they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Kennedy, a Woodland Hills landscape designer and contractor, advises 
fledgling green thumbs to take their ideas -- and their list of garden 
conditions -- to a small, well-run retail nursery and ask for advice on plant 
choices, soil amendments and design layout. 
</P>
<P>
 In her view, just as critical as buying the right plants for a site is 
creating a good medium to grow them in. Amending the beds, she says, is 
"vitally important, especially since our Valley soils run from sandy loam to 
heavy clay to rock." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid correcting for the wrong problem, she suggests taking a bag of the 
garden's soil to a nursery for assessment. In general, she adds, "a rule of 
thumb for the mixed-color border is to blend about half of the recommended soil 
amendment with the existing dirt and dig or rototill the bed to a depth of six 
to eight inches." She also endorses the use of a pre-planting organic 
fertilizer to ensure fast, full growth and vigorous blooming. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, when designing a plot around blooms, the question arises whether 
to focus on perennials, which remain in the garden year-round but are often 
winter-dormant, or annuals, which flower zestfully, need frequent attention and 
live only a season or two. Wayt and Kennedy advocate mixing them up, using 
perennials to structure a layout and annuals for accent color.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my clients prefer perennials," reports Kennedy, "which reflects a 
trend I've seen over the past 10 years. But they appreciate the annuals' extra 
little punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kennedy, Wayt also blends popular ornamental grasses -- which work well 
in cut-flower arrangements -- and even edible greens into his mixed borders. 
"Vegetables," he says, "provide texture and color; they're good filler plants 
-- and you can eat them!" 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the annual-perennial debate are people who dislike the 
appearance of a quiet garden and want lush color throughout the year. Most of 
Howard's clients tend to fall in this camp, and for them he does twice-yearly 
"clean-slate" plantings using a potpourri of the season's annuals. Contrary to 
the neat marigold and pansy squares one might expect from this approach, 
Howard's creations have, in his words, "a wild, English-type look" that's more 
common in mixed borders. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, he explains, is that he enjoys working with plants of different 
heights, pairing knee-high dwarf cosmos, for example, with bushy sages and 
low-lying petunias. This gives his landscapes a certain layered depth of field. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayt, who uses the same approach, describes a simple guideline for success: 
"Read plant tags to find out how tall things will grow. Then plant taller ones 
in back, medium in the middle, and small in front." 
</P>
<P>
 Varying leaf textures adds further interest to a garden. So does planting a 
small tree -- say a crape myrtle, weeping birch or evergreen pear -- on the 
periphery of an especially sunny area. In this way, says Kennedy, "you create a 
bit of welcome shade, though not enough to keep your flowers from blooming." 
</P>
<P>
 Color, of course, is always an important consideration when designing a floral 
show. While it tends to be a matter of personal preference, experts see a 
persistent trend toward softer hues -- pinks, lavenders, grays, blues and 
whites -- and away from yellows, oranges and reds. Kennedy points out, however, 
that bright hues work well as accents and can prevent a pastel garden from 
looking washed out. 
</P>
<P>
 With visions of lacy foliage and extravagant color in mind, it's easy for the 
novice garden-maker to overlook the question of maintenance, particularly when 
wandering through the spring displays at a nursery. Make no mistake about it, 
though, flower beds take a lot of work. They require constant dead-heading 
(removal of spent blooms to encourage more flowering), periodic trimming and 
regular fertilizing -- a once-a-month job during the warm season. They also 
need spot hand-watering if thirsty annuals are tucked in among more 
drought-tolerant perennials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more dramatic the flower garden, the higher the maintenance will be," 
Howard concedes. "Still," he says, "it's not that great a time commitment 
unless you let it pile up. Be consistent. Pay attention to the details." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy points out that knowing the growth habits of plants and leaving them 
plenty of room to spread will reduce the need for foliage cut-backs. And she 
and others agree that starting small -- with just a few plants in a limited 
area -- is a good way for gardeners to learn just how much labor they can 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no rule that says flowers have to be in the ground," Wayt declares. 
"Barrels, clay pots, wood containers, even wheelbarrows make terrific little 
gardens -- great for beginners." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, he concludes, from beginners to experts, can enjoy what he calls 
"the best part of growing flowers" -- cutting a bunch for a friend. "It's so 
nice to hand someone a bouquet and say, 'These are from my garden.' " Matter of 
Choice 
</P>
<P>
 As daunting as it is to face the wealth of glorious flora in the nurseries, a 
few words from the wise can simplify the picture. First, experts agree, it's 
smart to look within be fore you look for plants. Recognizing your time 
limitations, design ambitions, garden-use patterns and attitude about watering 
can go a long way toward determining the right plant palette. 
</P>
<P>
 Most appealing to weekend gardeners may be relatively bulletproof plants -- 
those that thrive and bloom without too much attention. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, landscape contractor Michael Wayt suggests marguerite and Shasta 
daisies, marigolds, sweet alyssum, gazanias, assorted ice plants and lantana -- 
"an incredible, underrated, drought-tolerant ground cover." Designer Ted Howard 
recommends a new perennial petunia, named "Supertunia," that is reported to be 
an abundant year-round bloomer. Landscape contractor Sandy Kennedy cites "the 
whole family of geraniums," and also favors "tough perennials" such as 
westringia and statice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As to plants that produce good cutting flowers, Kennedy lists roses, 
coreopsis, yarrow, zinnias, cosmos, asters and lilies. In local gardens, David 
Austen roses are especially popular now for their profuse, highly scented 
flowers, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For hobbyists who relish novelty, her favorite new perennials are white 
Mexican primroses, rosy-pink Santa Barbara daisies and white mandevilla. Among 
new annuals, she picks seashell-white cosmos and the taller, free-standing St. 
Thomas stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayt, who appreciates the look of ornamental grasses mixed with flowers, 
suggests three kinds that grow well in Southern California: blue fescue, a low, 
clumping ground cover or edging plant; carex, which can be drought-tolerant, 
thirsty, sun-loving or shade-tolerant, and miscanthus, a tall, dramatic grass 
that's suitable for flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wayt's opinion, no spring plant list is complete without hollyhocks and 
sweet peas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's grandmother had them," he said. "When you see them on the back 
fence by the vegetable garden, there's always some great childhood memory in 
your mind." Tools of the Trade 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Ted Howard, veteran designer and connoisseur of flower gardens, for a list 
of indispensable gardening tools and his reply is short and sweet: "Good soil. 
I don't care if you use a fork, a spade, a specific food or a reference book. 
Your best friend is conditioned soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape contractor Michael Wayt shares Howard's affection for fine dirt -- 
amended with plenty of compost and other organic matter -- but he also 
advocates particular implements for digging it. He likes a long-handled, 
V-shaped hoe, called a "Warren hoe," which eases cultivation, weed pulling and 
earth turning. Also tough on weeds but gentle on the gardener is his favorite 
"push-pull weeder," which can be used without bending over. A good steel bow 
rake is essential for soil preparation, he says, while supple gloves and the 
right pruning shears come in handy for dead-heading and trimming plants. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of pruning shears, landscape designer Sandy Kennedy favors a 
lightweight aluminum model with curved blades for maximum control. For larger 
branches, she recommends an eight-inch folding saw that fits easily in a back 
pocket. In her view, a small, pointed shovel -- long-handled and lightweight -- 
is another must-have for planting and maintenance, and she adds that, with 
tools, "you get what you pay for. More expensive is better." 
</P>
<P>
 All three designers agree on one indispensable reference book: Sunset's 
"Western Garden Book." (The 1994 edition is available in paperback for $19.99 
in most bookstores and nurseries.)

BLENDING CAFE FAMILIES; * THE NEW COBALT CAFE, BIGGER AND ACOUSTICALLY SUPERIOR 
TO THE OLD COBALT, DRAWS POETS FROM ITS FORMER LOCATION, PLUS LOYALISTS FROM 
THE OLD STORYTELLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a fact of coffeehouse life that poets are among the most loyal of 
patrons, choosing a java bar and settling there, much as Cliff and Norm chose 
Cheers. As a result, open poetry nights at the new Cobalt Cafe are full of 
writers from the old Cobalt, which lost its Woodland Hills lease last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like supportive places that have supported me," said Darcy Whittemore, a 
16-year-old Woodland Hills poet for whom the club's reopening in January was a 
blessing. "It's therapeutic for me to get up and read," she explained. "And 
there's no other place where I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Lupert, 25, of Encino, described poets who were "lost" during the months 
when Cobalt was closed and who have come back to it with even greater loyalty. 
Said Lupert, "There's an enhanced familial sense here now." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Cobalt's "family" of writers has grown, partly because it 
has exchanged its former shoe-box locale for one three times as big. Another 
reason: Its new spot was previously home to the Storyteller Bookstore & Cafe, 
which had its own crowd of loyalists.  
</P>
<P>
 "I loved that place!" said Kerri Kirchheimer, 16, of West Hills. "I had my 
Sweet 16 party there. I didn't want to see it change." Like other Storyteller 
regulars, however, Kirchheimer has made the switch to Cobalt, which she called 
"a great place. I like the entertainment a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 She also likes the fact that though the Storyteller's great creaking bookcases 
are gone, its flowered carpet remains, a reminder of its homey spirit. 
Otherwise, Cobalt's owner David Politi has minimized the decor, removing some 
tables and adding the armchairs, sofas and colored lamps from his previous 
spot. He has also kept his simple cafe menu, which offers sandwiches, soups, 
muffins and, of course, various versions of caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Cobalt crowd will be glad to know how much the club's program has 
stayed the same too. There are still open mike nights Mondays for acoustic 
music and comedy, Sunday jazz sessions and more musical performances on 
weekends, though these are now rock-oriented rather than acoustic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday poetry nights continue to be hosted by Steve Kinkaid, who favors his 
larger audience (which sometimes reaches 100 listeners) with his trademark 
blend of caustic wit and good-natured ribbing. Readers too will be familiar: 
Randy (Chief Eagle Eye) Watsek, Jane Laurel Sobo and the boisterous 
crowd-pleaser known only as "Boogerman" regularly climb the stage to air their 
verse. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, when they do, they needn't contend with the level of background 
noise that characterized the first Cobalt. Larger digs make the constant parade 
of people going outside to smoke less distracting and put a comfortable 
distance between the stage and the espresso maker. The relative quiet, Kinkaid 
said, encourages more new poets to read, since they know people will pay 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new readers are several deaf students from CSUN and Pierce College 
who arrive with a crowd of friends and an interpreter to translate spoken 
poetry into sign language. "We come as a group because we want to show that 
deaf people can be poets too," said Jamie Gould, 19, a CSUN student who lives 
in Canoga Park. "We have an interpreter so hearing people can understand deaf 
people, and we can understand hearing people." 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity of Cobalt's devotees was clear on a recent Tuesday night when 
Gould and her friends were joined by 10 seniors from an English class at 
Chaminade College Preparatory in West Hills. They came to cheer on their 
teacher, Andrea Burman, as she read poetry about insomnia, insanity and the 
political turmoil in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Other readers included Darcy Whittemore's father, Don, who followed his 
daughter's call-to-arms verse ("Be loud! Love yourself! Revolutionize!") with a 
nostalgic rhymed narrative about a gang of vanished friends from childhood. 
Several poets -- including "Chief Eagle Eye" and Jane Laurel Sobo -- read 
poetry critical of contemporary greed and material excesses, while William 
McLain dealt with love and loss, and "Boogerman" focused on grossing out his 
audience with bathroom humor. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which made for the kind of evening that packs them in at Cobalt: 
freewheeling, interactive, emotional, fun. WHERE AND WHEN

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; RETURN TO 'AGE OF INNOCENCE'; * PROM GOWNS 
ARE RETURNING TO PINK AND DAINTY -- BUT THEY ARE STILL PAIRED WITH DOCS 
INDUSTRIAL BOOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes regularly about fashion for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cutting-edge fashions worn for this famous rite of passage are regaining their 
virginal nuances. Alas, Vegas showgirl looks are still around, but the "age of 
innocence" look, not seen at proms since the late '70s, is vying for a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen mags the likes of Seventeen and YM, among others, feature some 
ingenue-inspired renditions in their spring prom issues. So while some tawdry 
styles are still being touted -- they're just not as cutting edge. Red-sequin 
numbers look old and tired compared to the blush pink brocades, cabbage flower 
prints and even vintage dresses being resurrected for the big night. Cameo and 
pearl-studded crescendos of curls are being adorned with combs and ponytail 
holders accented with dainty faux rosettes. What could be more feminine? 
</P>
<P>
 More daring than dainty is the one rollover trend from last year -- Doc 
Martens boots. They are still being paired with prom gowns across the country 
and in the Valley. The colored, crushed velvet 14-eye boot, has debuted just in 
time for the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dungarees, a clothing and shoe boutique in Studio City, owner Gary Friedman 
says prom-bound Valley girls already have been in with their festive frocks in 
tow. So far, there is a mix of longer floral rayon styles and shorter, flirtier 
skirts destined to be paired with Docs. Exactly what kind of girl goes in for 
the industrial footwear on prom night? 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who is a fashion renegade, who's self-confident and who really wants 
to make a statement," Friedman says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the predominantly avant assemblage of teen-age Valley fashion plates, is 
there really any other kind? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try this at home: Eyelash curlers may be headed for a beauty museum -- 
or trash can -- near you. The torture device invented in the 1930s may yet be 
edged out by lash perms. 
</P>
<P>
 The hair-curling procedure takes 45 minutes. Eyes are closed during the entire 
treatment, which begins with a thorough eye-area cleansing. Then, a gentle 
adhesive is applied along the upper lash line. A minuscule perm rod is selected 
and trimmed to accommodate individual lash length. The rod is laid onto the 
adhesive and the lashes are hand-adhered to the tiny rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another layer of lash adhesive secures the lashes to the rod, and their 
own perm solution is applied and left on for about 10 minutes. The excess 
solution is removed with a cleanser, then a neutralizer, designed to lock in 
curl, is applied and left on 10 more minutes. The area is again cleansed to 
ready the eye for the final lash conditioner. Lashes stay curly for about two 
months, say beauticians. 
</P>
<P>
 But does it hurt? No, says Sheryl Goodman of Gauthier Image and Skin Care 
salon in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't even tickle," she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Food and Drug Administration is investigating lash perms, but the 
procedure is not a top priority because eyelash perms are not sweeping the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only concern at this point is the possible irritation perm solutions may 
cause to the eye area," says John Dailey, director of the cosmetic and colors 
division based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Lash perms aren't exactly enjoying a feverish popularity, but as the word gets 
out, women are picking up on the trendy option, explains Sally Pierson of 
Amadeus Spa Salon in Pasadena, where the lash perm also goes for $45. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more women come in for it in the warm weather months, when they are 
swimming more, because they won't have to worry about curling their eyelashes," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And you were fretting for nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 Dressed to a tee: Anyone who thinks golfers still dress like Rodney 
Dangerfield in "Caddyshack" needs to wake up and smell the designer labels. A 
cruise through the Sherwood Country Club in Westlake Village should suffice 
nicely, thank you.  
</P>
<P>
 Its pro shop, cited for its cutting-edge golf fashions earlier this year by 
Women's Wear Daily, is officially on the fashion map. Head pro Paul Celano and 
Celia Francis, buyer and merchandise coordinator, are maintaining the momentum 
for spring and summer '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Lauren's Polo line and Liz Claiborne's golf fashion line the club's 
walls, among other noteworthy outfitters for the sport. Hot new labels favored 
by the club's golfers include E.P. Pro and Como Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis says the club's reputation is earned thanks to members who dress 
"quite nicely, much more so than at other golf clubs I've visited around the 
country." Though no one style exists, Francis says, one informal fashion motto 
seems firmly entrenched: Everything must match.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: PROGRESS REPORT; * HERE'S THE LOWDOWN ON NATURE'S 
SHAKEDOWN: WHAT CLOSED AFTER THE QUAKE, WHAT PAUSED TO RECOUP, AND WHAT'S OPEN

 As a direct result of earthquake damage, quite a few of the bargain sources 
that have appeared in this column have either moved or closed.  
</P>
<P>
 Lou Marsten, owner of The Wallpaper Bin, assessed his options around noon Jan. 
17. His store at the Tampa Plaza Mall was hit hard. Within hours, he signed a 
lease on a new location and was salvaging his merchandise. Less than two weeks 
later, after the specialized carpentry work required to display hundreds of 
wallpaper patterns was completed, he started doing business at 17139 Ventura 
Blvd., Encino, (818) 886-1291. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguerite Markarian, proprietor of The Bead Source, found herself knee-deep 
in thousands of beads that needed sorting. The structural damage was too 
devastating at her shop, so Markarian moved up the street to 7047 Reseda Blvd., 
Northridge, (818) 708-0972.  
</P>
<P>
 Mom's the Word, a maternity bargain source, lost its Studio City location and 
moved its remaining inventory to its South Pasadena store, 1008 Fair Oaks Ave., 
(818) 441-9692.  
</P>
<P>
 Bay City Kitchens suffered severe damage at its 1302 Santa Monica Blvd. site 
and lost a lot of merchandise, but it's still in business around the corner at 
1412 14th St., (310) 395-8877. The damaged original store should reopen in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Beds Unlimited has relocated to 7045 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park, (818) 
996-4653.  
</P>
<P>
 Foot Fiesta closed its Saugus store but recently reopened its Chatsworth 
store, which had been heavily damaged, at 10206 Mason Ave. (818) 886-4966.  
</P>
<P>
 Steven Craig Wholesale Clothiers is at 19365 Business Center Drive, 
Northridge, about 20 yards from where the freight train derailed. Shelley 
Pepper, owner of this men's apparel shop, is still awaiting an assessment of 
damage to decide whether to reopen. For an update, call (818) 701-7474. 
</P>
<P>
 Open for business after temporary closure are the Robinsons-May Clearance 
Center, 8252 Van Nuys Blvd., Panorama City, (818) 338-5253; Nordstrom Rack, 
21500 Victory Blvd., Woodland Hills, (818) 884-6771; and its next-door 
neighbor, Designer Labels for Less Clearance Center, 21494 Victory Blvd., (818) 
888-1891. In the same mall on Victory Boulevard at Canoga Park Avenue, The 
Designer Outlet, which sold women's apparel, has closed for good.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kids Cottage, a consignment store for children's apparel on West Magnolia 
Boulevard in Burbank, also has closed its doors, due to earthquake-related 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who may clip these columns, what the earthquake didn't do, the 
recession and other demands did, so delete the following bargain sources that 
have folded up and slipped away: ABC Premiums, Ann & Eve, Bizarre Bazaar, 
California Consignment, Clearance Club, Formal Wear Club, HRD Distributors, 
Jerrolds, L.A. Bike, Lighting Trends, Louise the Liquidator, Munchkins, Rattan 
Distribution Warehouse and Sibella.

A FLIGHT TO YESTERYEAR; * BURBANK AIRPORT, WHICH OPENED IN 1930 AND WAS ONCE 
THE AREA'S AVIATION HUB, BEARS HOLLYWOOD'S IMPRINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF PRUGH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, the Lockheed Airport (now formally known as 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport) and the assembly lines that cranked out 
warplanes next door thrived in an aura of make-believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Acres of netting, stretched from tall poles, canopied the terminal, hangars, 
assorted other buildings and the parking lots. Atop the mesh stood fake houses, 
along with wire twisted to resemble tree limbs and chicken feathers 
spray-painted to look like leaves. Tanker trucks spewed green and yellow paint 
on the runways to simulate fields of grass, wheat, alfalfa and corn. 
</P>
<P>
 From 21,000 feet up, it looked as if Hollywood's set designers had worked 
their magic. They made the airport disappear! 
</P>
<P>
 This was World War II -- when Southern California's defense plants risked 
surveillance and attack -- so it made sense to camouflage the Lockheed Corp.'s 
sprawling real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport, then the area's aviation hub before Los Angeles International 
Airport opened in 1947, served more than 1 million passengers on commercial 
flights each year. And on its runways, too, P-38 fighter planes and B-17 and 
Hudson bombers, among other aircraft built by Lockheed, were tested and 
serviced. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no coincidence that the wartime camouflage bore Hollywood's imprint. 
Lockheed's top brass couldn't resist when a nearby studio offered its help, the 
offer made by Walt Disney himself. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just one historical vignette told by Della Bertrand, who gives tours by 
appointment at the airport where Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Howard 
Hughes, Wiley Post and others flew -- and where more than 3.9 million 
passengers last year, a record for the facility, traveled to and from U.S. 
cities and international connecting points. 
</P>
<P>
 If you sign up for one of these free-of-charge tours, it's best to arrive well 
ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll need ample time to find parking space and to navigate the confusing 
ramps inside the multilevel garage across the main thoroughfare to the 
passenger terminal. If you park farther away in the economy lots, allow even 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 a.m.: The ground floor of the parking structure is full. What looks like 
a logical path to the second level turns out to be -- uh-oh -- the exit. Now 
I'm heading out of the parking area. I explain to the cashier that I got lost 
and shouldn't have to pay for not having parked inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The cashier understands. He tosses my ticket, electronically raises the exit 
gate and directs me to the "return to airport" lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I'm stuck in traffic going into the garage. On this second time around, my 
search for a parking space takes another 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 9:50 a.m.: Treat yourself to a leisurely breakfast or brunch at the Air 
Hollywood Bar & Grill, the airport's only sit-down restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as I find snacking irresistible, I cave in to food for thought. To me, 
the airport's newsstand -- and, for that matter, any newsstand -- is almost 
like a public library. I scanned magazines here for so long that I could have 
been arrested for loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 Mementos? The airport's three souvenir stands stock picture postcards of the 
airport, along with the traditional array of caps and T-shirts bearing logos of 
Los Angeles' pro sports teams. And with Easter on the way, look for stuffed 
rabbits to multiply soon at a stand near you. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, our guided tour begins at the passenger terminal entrance: 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m.: The airport opened in 1930 as "Union Airport," operated by a 
forerunner of United Airlines. A Memorial Day weekend grand opening attracted 
thousands who watched air races and stunt flying. 
</P>
<P>
 The terminal would become the setting for many motion pictures (including 
"Pretty Woman," with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and "Wings of the Navy," 
with Olivia de Havilland), as well as the location for the defunct but 
once-popular Sky Room cafe, with its sweeping runway views. Ever palatable are 
prices on a 1958 menu: $2.50 for the "Smorgasbord Buffet," 85 cents for "Pan 
Fried Swordfish Steak, Maitre d'Hotel Potatoes and Vegetable." 
</P>
<P>
 (The cafe has been converted to a conference room for the nine-member 
commission that operates the airport for the three municipalities that have 
owned it jointly since 1978. They plan to build an enlarged, relocated terminal 
in phases -- one by 1998, the other by 2010.) 
</P>
<P>
 Just inside the terminal's main entrance, on the left, sits the 
glass-enclosed, noise-monitoring system room, which operates 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, amber lights -- on a large aerial photo of the airport area -- flash 
when any of 15 remote sites records excessive noise. Microphones on telephone 
poles at each site transmit sounds to a large computer inside the room via 
telephone line. The computer is said to distinguish aircraft noise from that 
of, say, motorcycles or trucks. If noise levels exceed 65 decibels, violators 
can be fined $1,000 or more, airport officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although noise remains a concern, officials stress that the airport in 1987 
became one of the nation's first where only "Stage 3" jetliners -- those with 
newer, quieter technology -- provide scheduled airline service. 
</P>
<P>
 Browse through the vintage photos and other memorabilia that adorn one 
corridor that leads from the ticket counter to the gates. A glass case houses a 
scale model of Lockheed's twin-prop P-38J Lightning fighter plane (cruising 
speed: 420 m.p.h.), which packed four machine guns and a cannon, as well as 
five cameras. Another display case contains such items as leather helmets, 
goggles, a flight-log book, a stylish red beret -- the kind worn by 
"stewardesses," decades before they became "flight attendants." 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 a.m.: Now step outside the rear of the terminal. Hold your ears, if you 
have to. But enjoy the sights: 
</P>
<P>
 * An Alaska Airlines MD-80 jetliner lifts skyward, a generic sketch of an 
Eskimo's face emblazoned on the tail. 
</P>
<P>
 * An old gray hangar, now containing offices for fueling operations, is said 
to have changed little on the outside since the '30s, when Amelia Earhart 
parked her plane there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fire trucks painted pale green ("Easier to see at night," says tour guide 
Bertrand) are poised in readiness -- purportedly able to accelerate from 0 to 
60 m.p.h. in 25 seconds as they chase and spray stricken aircraft at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The airfield, Bertrand adds, is home base for private jets owned by Tom Cruise 
and Arnold Schwarzenegger -- and for TV news helicopters and those flown by the 
Burbank and Glendale police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 As she talks on, a Boeing 737 jetliner shrieks into the chill, gray haze -- 
perhaps bound for Seattle or Denver or Reno. It's one of about 85 takeoffs per 
day at this airport -- the nation's 58th busiest. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon: From their perch in the control tower -- 90 feet up -- a supervisor and 
four associates enjoy a commanding view of the airport's two runways. 
</P>
<P>
 One takes charge of landings; a second does the same for takeoffs. A third is 
responsible for activity on the ground, while a fourth tracks all private 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
 This tower is 30 feet taller -- and more remote -- than the old control tower, 
which reposed atop the passenger terminal and had to be abandoned because it 
sat too close to one runway. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-known fact about the north-south runway, Bertrand says, is that it 
slopes imperceptibly -- 60 feet higher at its north end (or as tall as the old 
tower) -- which gives aircraft a gentle, downhill run before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the airport's tours don't include the control tower, except in rare 
instances when a visit there is specifically requested -- but then, officials 
say, it requires approval well in advance by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a tour of Burbank Airport offers an appreciation otherwise missed by 
hurried, stressed-out adults who travel. And it's recommended for 
schoolchildren before they, too, become too busy stuffing suitcases, renting 
cars, catching planes -- as tomorrow's hurried, stressed-out travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, think of it as a window seat on a flight to yesteryear. WHERE 
AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Group tours (by appointment only) of Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 2627 Hollywood Way, Burbank.

CELESTIAL LOVE STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If love is in the air this spring, there is no better place to find it than 
looking up at the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
 In Roman mythology, Orion was a handsome hunter who was loved by Diana, 
goddess of the hunt, and Aurora, goddess of the dawn. Oblivious to their 
affections, Orion wanders across the sky at night until he sets in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Made teary-eyed by his inattention, Aurora weeps each night, which becomes the 
dew on the morning grass. Jealous that Aurora will win Orion's heart, Diana 
fires an arrow at the hunter's eyes, blinding him. That is why the stars in 
Orion's head, where his eyes would be, are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monache Indians, who once lived on the Tule River Reservation in Central 
California, told another love story, about Pleiades and what we know as Taurus 
the Bull. The Monache knew that sometimes love must be allowed to stink. 
</P>
<P>
 They told of how there were once six wives and a daughter who discovered 
onions. When their husbands returned from successfully hunting cougar, they 
proudly showed their new side dish. But the husbands thought that the women, 
who had been eating the onions, smelled horrible and ordered them to sleep 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The next days did not go well. The men returned after each hunt without any 
cougar, which they blamed on the foul onion odor clinging to their clothes. The 
women grew colder and colder as they were forced, each night, to sleep outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the wives had had enough. They took the daughter, grabbed some magic 
rope and threw it into the sky. When the men returned to spot the women 
climbing into the sky, they suddenly felt lonely and hungry, and called after 
them to stop. But the women had no desire to be with such uncaring husbands. 
Desperate, the men chased into the sky after the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, you can see the men desperately seeking their wives' forgiveness as the 
sky turns. The women are the six bright stars of the Pleiades (the daughter is 
the faint seventh star) and the husbands are just behind them in the stars of 
the Hyades, in what we know as the head of Taurus the Bull. JEFF SCHNAUFER

A STELLAR ROLE; * THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE IDEAL FOR VIEWING A NEBULA AND 
STAR CLUSTERS -- LOCATED CLOSE TOGETHER IN THE EARLY EVENING.

<P>
 They go unnoticed by most of us: fuzzy patches of light dotting the night sky 
that appear too small to be of much importance in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you take a moment to peek through a pair of binoculars or a telescope, 
you can see that some of these objects not only dwarf our own solar system, 
they actually help scientists explain how our universe works. 
</P>
<P>
 The first few weeks of April will be the last time until winter that 
early-evening observers can glimpse these evolving stellar stages -- called 
nebulae and star clusters -- so close together. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking west soon after sunset, seek out the star Sirius, the brightest star 
in the sky, nicknamed the Dog Star. Don't mistake it with the planet Venus, 
which is brighter and lower in the sky. Sirius lies in the collar of the 
constellation Canis Major, the Big Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 To the right of Sirius you will find three stars in a row. This is the belt of 
Orion the Hunter. Below the farthest left star in the belt is Orion's sword -- 
three faint objects descending at an angle toward the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle star in Orion's sword is not a star at all, but the famous Orion 
Nebula, about 1,600 years away from us if we were traveling at the speed of 
light (called light-years). A massive swarm of interstellar hydrogen gas and 
dust that could swallow 20,000 of our solar systems, the Orion Nebula is an 
interstellar womb for stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Visible as a gray filament, the Orion Nebula is collapsing through gravity to 
create stars powered by the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. An average 
star like our sun takes about 50 million years to form. The Orion Nebula 
contains enough matter to create hundreds of thousands of stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the three belt stars of Orion to point to the right, we pass the star 
Aldebaran, the eye of Taurus the bull, and encounter a smattering of faint 
stars called the Pleiades. This open cluster of stars lies about 400 
light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Orion Nebula is a stellar womb, the Pleiades could be viewed as stars 
in preschool. Relatively young (not more than 100 million years old), open 
clusters have been nudged from their nebulae birthplace by the rotation of our 
Milky Way galaxy. This movement will cause the cluster to eventually dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only seven stars are visible to the naked eye in the Pleiades, there 
are actually a few hundred in the cluster, a few dozen of which are visible 
with binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite side of Orion lies another open cluster, called the Beehive, 
in the constellation of Cancer the Crab. At 500 light-years away, the Beehive 
is a challenge to spot with the naked eye. Binoculars bring many of the 
cluster's estimated 200 stars into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 With a telescope, you can see brilliant blue-white stars, which photographs 
reveal to be accompanied by a faint blue nebula remnant, left from the 
formation of the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tip of the right horn of Taurus the Bull lies the Crab Nebula, about 
6,300 light-years away. Visible as a faint gray cloud in an eight-inch diameter 
telescope, this is the remnant of an exploding star that was so powerful it 
could be seen in daylight from Earth, in the year 1054 A.D.  
</P>
<P>
 It is this expelled star stuff, as well as matter shed occasionally from 
dying, red supergiant stars like Betelgeuse (the armpit of Orion), that is the 
seed for a new generation of stars. 
</P>
<P>
 So if anybody asks how the universe works, just point to the sky and tell them 
it's recycling itself. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Los Angeles Valley College Astronomy Club's monthly planetarium shows 
and (weather permitting) observing through its 16-inch telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Valley College Planetarium and Observatory, 5800 Fulton Ave., Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 When: The next star party is April 9, featuring a 5:30 p.m. trek to the Mt. 
Wilson area. Next planetarium / observing session at the college will be at 8 
p.m. April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Mt. Wilson trip is free. Planetarium shows are $3.50 general, $2.50 
seniors and $2 for kids 8 to 16. No kids younger than 8 allowed.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A PLEASANT HALF OF THE WORLD; * MEZZOMONDO IS CASUALLY 
ELEGANT, SERVING UP TASTY COMMON NORTHERN ITALIAN DISHES AND SOME INVENTIVE 
ONES. 
</P>

<P>
 Farewell, Pesto; addio , La Perla. Now it's the turn of Mezzomondo, the third 
consecutive Italian restaurant at this Ventura Boulevard location. Perhaps the 
third time will be the charm for this cheerful, daffodil-yellow trattoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Elio Cavallari, a lighthearted Milanese whom you're likely to meet if you dine 
here, and whom you may have already encountered at the Beverly Hills restaurant 
Bice, is the chef and padrone . (When I called for a reservation, I asked what 
the restaurant's name -- which literally means "half the world" -- referred to. 
"The half of the world I've been in," replied Cavallari impatiently. Ho-o-o-o 
-kay.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, this half of the world is a pleasant place. The cloth banquettes have 
a fruit motif woven into the yellow fabric, and there are fruited wooden 
wreaths on the walls. The tables' comfortable spacing on the beige tile floor 
gives the effect of space as well as lightness. About the only design element I 
can do without is the butcher paper on top of the white tablecloths, which 
seems out of place in a stylish, casually elegant room like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu includes a lot of the northern Italian dishes with which the Los 
Angeles Basin is sloshing over at the moment -- the pastas, the arugula-based 
salads, the simply grilled meats. But it doesn't lack inventiveness, even if 
not all the inventions are on track. (I wonder about dishes like "tropical" 
carpaccio with avocado, salads that include pears and zuppa di calamari con 
piselli , which is tomato broth mixed with squid and peas.) 
</P>
<P>
 You could start with the fresh-tasting zuppa di fagioli Veneta con pasta -- 
bean and pasta soup under a fancy name, but a properly thick and hearty 
version. Take on the minestrone, though, and you run squarely into the 
dimension of Cavallari's imagination. This unconventional minestrone is forest 
green (because of an abundance of chopped basil) and constructed with zucchini, 
green beans and other summery vegetables, plus a liberal amount of rice and 
potato. You may not need a main course if you order it. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll encounter starch in a variety of presentations at Mezzomondo. If 
polenta is your thing, you can get it the simple way -- with melted Gorgonzola 
-- or as grilled triangles inundated with sliced garlic sausage and a pile of 
flavorful white Tuscan beans (polenta grigliata con fagioli e salsiccia ). 
Crostini (otherwise known as bruschette ) are toasted hunks of country-style 
bread with various toppings, the most common -- and Italian -- being fresh 
tomato and basil. I made the mistake of trying the one with mixed wild 
mushrooms ( misto funghi ). What I got was a tired melange of ordinary 
mushrooms and marinara sauce on soggy bread. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastas are prepared in the Mediterranean spirit with a chewy bite. 
Mezzimondi ripieni di carne are a real mouthful: noodle pockets stuffed with a 
finely chopped meat mixture. (At other Italian restaurants you may have 
encountered a similar crescent-shaped pasta under the name of agnolotti .) 
Mezzomondo's mezzimondi come simply dressed in butter and sage, but they are 
stiffer and heavier than they need to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigatoni melanzane mozzarella is another tasty but rather ponderous pasta. The 
waiter promised that this dish of eggplant, cheese and short tube pasta would 
be made with scamorza (smoked mozzarella), but I couldn't detect even a hint of 
smokiness. The eggplant is nicely browned in this dish, but it has been cooked 
in so much oil that it leaves a residue on the bottom of the dish. A lighter 
choice would be the fine fusilli Mediterraneo , in which corkscrew pasta is 
tossed with basil, black olives, olive oil and both fresh and sun-dried 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Main courses are called piatti forti ("strong dishes") on this menu, and that 
they are. The pick would have to be galletto al mattone , a skillfully pressed 
and grilled Cornish game hen that is golden brown on all sides and forgivingly 
tender. Arrosto di vitello con il sugo , roasted veal served in its own reduced 
juices, is also tasty, but the meat isn't particularly tender -- a cardinal sin 
when it comes to veal. The good roasted potatoes and perfectly cooked spinach 
help speed up the process of absolution, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert is nothing fancy, just a choice of a creamy tirami su with lots of 
mascarpone or a three-flavored spumoni with a grainy texture. I would have 
liked to end a meal here with biscotti con vin santo , crumbly cookies and 
rust-colored sweet wine. Unfortunately, although they are on the menu, 
Cavallari hasn't had them on hand during my visits. Too bad. Biscotti and wine 
make a great match for espresso, as half the world knows. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>

 STOCK SETBACKS: The stock market rebounded from a bad start Thursday as the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 9.21 points (A1, D1). But experts 
agree that it's been a tough first quarter, and Valley stocks weren't spared in 
the wreckage. . . . 20th Century Industries in Woodland Hills, in fact, 
finished the quarter at $19.50 per share, down 29%. Great Western Financial in 
Chatsworth closed at $16.125, down 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 PROM TIME: April has finally arrived, which means that prom season is only 
weeks away. This week's Valley Life! (Page 29) takes a look at prom fashion 
trends and finds that the "age of innocence" style is coming back, while the 
tawdry look is no longer cutting-edge. . . . And, believe it or not, Valley 
girls will again wear Doc Martens boots on Prom Night. 
</P>
<P>
 PLANT TIME: Spring also means that it's a good time to plant the flower 
garden, above. But, before you start, you should ask: How large an area do you 
plan to plant? Is it in sun or shade? What's in the background? . . . "It's 
important to start with an idea," says one garden artist. "Putting flowers 
together isn't like building a brick wall." See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN IS HER VALLEY: The Valley gets a big endorsement from a little star. 
She's Gaby Hoffman, 12, the lead on NBC's new sitcom, "Someone Like Me." 
Hoffman spent a lot of time in Manhattan before moving to Woodland Hills, and 
her preference is clear: "When I walk outside in the morning, I'm outside with 
grass and trees." 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH TALK: At 5-foot-5 1/2, 215 pounds, Jim Buffo, 32, of Van Nuys is almost 
a midget compared to his likely opponents in the "World's Toughest Man" boxing 
competition. He's a nephew of the Goosen brothers, who know a lot about boxers, 
and he's not the kind of guy to be intimidated by anyone. . . . "Usually," he 
said, "when the people in my family come to fight, it turns out pretty well"

 RIDING TALL: No lawyer jokes please. A posse of cowboy lawyers plans to hitch 
up some ponies and trot across Palo Comado Canyon near Thousand Oaks during its 
official dedication as public parkland Saturday. . . . Members of the Cowboy 
Lawyers Assn., said Christina S. Kruger, "consider themselves cowboys first and 
lawyers second." The ridge riders plan to clip-clop by the dedication 
ceremonies, she said. "We are going to be very controlled and polite, and as 
quiet as we can be with 63 horses." 
</P>
<P>
 RUNNING SHORT: Remember when camping meant getting away from the madding 
crowds? As the hordes from Los Angeles and beyond descend on Ventura County 
campgrounds, state campground officials say don't bother showing up without a 
reservation. . . . Some tent sites and RV hookups have been booked for months 
by Mistix, a ticket agency with an 800 number. "After the hard rains, everybody 
comes out at once," Point Mugu State Park Ranger Simon Cavazos said. "We get 
people from other states, and from Germany, and France too." 
</P>
<P>
 HARD BALL: It looks like Bobby Ayala, the all-state pitcher from Oxnard's Rio 
Mesa High, has used his split-finger fastball to make a major league move. 
Coaches in Seattle believe that the 24-year-old Ayala will become the closing 
pitcher for the Mariners this season (C8). . . . "He's got the stuff to do it," 
Mariner pitching coach Sammy Ellis said. Ayala has grown a beard since he left 
the Cincinnati Reds to make him more menacing on the mound. Said he: "It's good 
to intimidate the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 FIXED WINGS: Jerry Thomas of Simi Valley hopes to set up shop at the Naval Air 
Station at Point Mugu to help injured birds of prey straighten up and fly 
right. Thomas is working out a deal with Navy officials to take over a 
long-abandoned wildlife facility on the base near Mugu Lagoon so he can nurse 
animals back to health and help with the Navy's wildlife education program 
(B1). "What we teach first and foremost is respect for the animals," Thomas 
said. "Without that, why go on?"

 Why did they like Ike but rebuke Uke? Alan Uke had already spent nearly 
$90,000 on his campaign for Assembly -- yet his name won't be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 60 signatures on Uke's nominating papers, a judge found that only 34 
were from GOP voters registered in north San Diego's 74th Assembly District -- 
and Uke needed 40 to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other candidates are on the June primary ballot (precisely the number of 
names Uke came up short). Growing Older

 Californians' median age was 32 last year, according to the Census Bureau -- 
younger than the median age of 33.7 for the nation's 258 million residents. 
That makes the nation about a year older than the 32.8 median age at the last 
national head count in 1990. Here is a sampling of median ages and populations, 
by state, including the youngest and the oldest, as of July 1: 03,15,12,08

 The rite stuff: The dearth of science teachers is not news, but we had no idea 
they were down to just one . A press announcement touted an appearance by 
Mercury and Gemini astronauts during this weekend's "National Science Teacher's 
Assn." get-together in Anaheim. Perhaps the writer should make the acquaintance 
of the National Council of Teachers of English.

 Ditto the writer who, in a four-paragraph DMV press release, committed these 
to fax paper: "The number of vehicles registered in California resumed their

 Head trip: JFK created a stir by going bare-headed at his inaugural. Hillary 
Rodham Clinton raised a fuss when she did wear a hat at her husband's 
inaugural. And Chelsea Clinton flouted the state children's helmet law this 
week, two-wheeling bare-headed in Coronado.

 Some bikers hoped this meant the President would lend an ear to no-helmet-law 
pleas. (It didn't.) GOP cyclists called for a special counsel. (Not really, but 
it's April Fool's Day.) A spokesman said the Clintons were unaware of the law.

 Leg hold trap: At California's newest Graybar Hotel, the Centinela State 
Prison in Imperial County, a search is a search. When defense attorney Charles 
L. Lindner, who drove from L.A. to see a client, refused to unhitch his 
artificial left leg, the prison cited state rules: no leg inspection, no client 
consultation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lindner says he's submitted to other security scrutiny in state and 
federal prisons, no one has ever before demanded that he detach the prosthesis 
to pass through a metal detector. The leg contains metal, Lindner said he told 
a prison officer, "because biomechanics (has) progressed somewhat since . . . 
Long John Silver in 'Treasure Island.' "

 Lindner, who's heard all the jokes and made a few himself, believes they don't 
have a leg to stand on.

IT'S OFFICIAL: STATE ONCE AGAIN IN A DROUGHT; WATER: WINTER PRECIPITATION WAS 
BELOW LEVELS SEEN DURING RECENT SIX-YEAR DRY PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State water officials on Thursday reported that the winter of 1993-94 was one 
of the driest this century, confirming that California is again experiencing a 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the official rainy season on Thursday, state and local 
agencies said that snowpack and other measures were lower than the totals 
realized in the drought that lasted from 1987 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this winter's low precipitation figures will not immediately translate 
into the brown lawns or mandatory cutbacks that marked the recent six years of 
drought because the state's reservoirs are well supplied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, many residents get their water from local reservoirs that 
are full or nearly full even though rainfall countywide is 73% of normal, said 
an official with the flood control district. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewed conservation efforts would be likely only if the Metropolitan Water 
District significantly reduces its allocations to the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District in the coming year, said Susan Nielsen, Calleguas' director of 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas provides water to nearly 500,000 customers in Simi Valley, Thousand 
Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and parts of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many reservoirs are near capacity, some water officials fear that could 
change over the next month or two if unseasonably warm weather prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is concerned," said Mike Young, chief of operations for MWD, which 
supplies 60% of all the water consumed in the six-county region of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Runoff in the key watersheds on both the eastern and western slopes of the 
Sierra Nevada is expected to be only about half of normal, causing officials to 
classify the year as "critically dry." Most of the state's water supply arrives 
in the rains and snows of December, January and February, and virtually all 
meaningful precipitation falls by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures were down significantly from just one month ago, as warm weather 
melted much of the existing snowpack and little new precipitation accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty bad," said Matt Colwell, a state Department of Water Resources 
hydrologist. "If it's dry in April, things will get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrologists like Colwell said they are not sure whether 1994 marks the 
beginning of a new drought or simply a continuation of the dry period that 
began in 1987. Last year's heavy rains, which resulted in the easing of 
mandatory conservation efforts, may have been an anomaly, Colwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's preliminary plan is to allocate supplies from the State Water 
Project in the Sacramento River Delta at 50% of water agencies' requests. The 
State Water Project is a series of canals and waterways that collect and 
distribute runoff from the Sierra Nevada, the primary water source for most of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is trying to hold to the 50% level," said Young. "But that's the 
limit of their ability. If it stays dry in April and May, it will be very 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Wheeler, state secretary for resources, said Thursday that he remains 
committed to the allocation formula. "The situation would be critical but for 
the strong reservoir supplies," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any cutback by the state would have a ripple effect through hundreds of 
Southern California communities. The MWD, which imports water from the State 
Water Project, supplies water to scores of smaller, local agencies. Any 
reduction in its supplies from the state would have to be passed along or taken 
out of emergency underground storage supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for several local agencies said Thursday that they plan to 
significantly increase their MWD purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for instance, is planning to 
buy about seven times as much water from the MWD as it did just a few years 
ago. Runoff in the department's watershed in the Owens Valley of the Eastern 
Sierra Nevada is only about 50% of normal and is further affected by court 
rulings restricting use of water in environmentally sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD officials said they are confident they will be able to meet their 
customers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the state gets by this year, officials are already concerned about the 
impact it will have on next year.

BODY OF SUSPECT IN SCRIPPS CASE IS DISCOVERED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The husband of slain newspaper heiress Anne Scripps Douglas, who relatives 
believed had fled after being accused of killing his wife, has been found dead, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A railroad employee found the body of Scott Douglas, 39, on the banks of the 
Hudson River in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 His identity was confirmed through dental records by the New York Medical 
Examiner's Office, a spokeswoman said. She said Douglas died of drowning and 
injuries received when he hit the water. The death has been ruled a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas had been charged with bludgeoning his wife to death on New Year's Eve. 
His car was found later idling on the Tappen Zee Bridge, which crosses the 
Hudson in Westchester County, north of New York City, where the two lived. The 
bridge is about 12 miles north of where the body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps family members repeatedly alleged that Scott Douglas was alive and 
that leaving the car on the bridge was a ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Scripps Douglas, 47, was the great-great granddaughter of James Edmund 
Scripps, who founded the Detroit News in 1873, and was part of the family that 
controls the Scripps-Howard newspaper fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just relieved he was found. We don't have to worry he will come after 
us," Alexandra Morell, Scripps Douglas' daughter by a previous marriage, said 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nightmare is over," added sister, Anne, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps Douglas had obtained an order of protection against her husband on 
Dec. 6, 1993, although the couple continued to live together in their 
Bronxville house. 
</P>
<P>
 Police came to the house three times after the protection order was issued to 
break up disputes, authorities said.

U.S. AIMING TO EXPAND RADIO DISASTER NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore on Thursday announced a three-agency effort to expand 
the government's Weather Radio to include all types of disaster warnings and to 
increase coverage to 95% of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 350-station National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio 
network now covers about 75% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came in the wake of devastating Palm Sunday tornadoes that 
claimed at least 43 lives in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the National Weather Service issued warnings nearly 20 minutes before 
the first tornado touched down, "the weak link in the chain was the inability 
to get that warning information to all of the people in the threatened area," 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radios costing less than $25 turn themselves on when the weather radio network 
broadcasts a special alert tone. Gore said an emphasis will be placed on 
getting those radios installed in public gathering places "so they will be as 
common as smoke detectors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency is joining the Weather Service in the 
project. The system will now offer warnings for dangers such as hazardous 
materials spills, FEMA Director James Lee Witt said.

ALBERT GOLDMAN; BIOGRAPHER OF PRESLEY, LENNON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Goldman, whose pitiless biographies of Elvis Presley and John Lennon 
infuriated their fans, is dead of a heart attack at 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, who lived in New York, died Monday as he traveled from Miami to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 "My books are a cold dose of reality," he said in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Elvis," published in 1981, Goldman depicted Presley as a drugged, 
perverted, gluttonous man of questionable talent, leaving Presley fans livid. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman also wrote unflattering appraisals of Lenny Bruce and John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 The biography of the comedian, who died in 1966, was published in 1974, so 
libel against the dead man was out of the question. But Bruce's daughter, 
Kitty, sued Goldman and others, claiming that the author appropriated Bruce's 
name and likeness for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lives of John Lennon," published in 1988, suggested that the former 
Beatle committed a murder in his youth and depicted him as anorexic, bisexual, 
drug-addicted, paranoid and near-psychotic. 
</P>
<P>
 That book received mostly negative reviews with its picture of "a once 
brilliant, rebellious, virile young rocker whom success had puffed up into a 
fat clown." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Dormont, Pa., Goldman attended Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
He left without a degree to serve in the Navy in 1945 and 1946. Goldman later 
earned a master's degree from the University of Chicago and a doctorate in 
English from Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman taught at the City University of New York and at Columbia. In the 
early 1970s, he was pop music columnist for Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 His other books were "Carnival at Rio" in 1978, "Grass Roots: Marijuana in 
America Today" and "Disco," both in 1979, and "Sound Bites" in 1992.

DEAN CONKLIN; FOUGHT FOR ABUSED CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean S. Conklin Jr., champion of physically and emotionally abused children 
who twice served as president of the California Assn. of Services for Children, 
has died. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Conklin died Sunday at his Covina home after suffering from heart disease, 
leukemia and cancerous tumors for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of ill health, he retired in February, 1993, as executive director of 
McKinley Home for Boys in San Dimas, a position he had held for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that Conklin served as executive director of Hillsides Home for 
Children in Pasadena for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970 and again in 1989, Conklin was president of the California Assn. of 
Services for Children, an organization of nonprofit child-care agencies that 
serve more than 30,000 youngsters, or about half the state's foster care 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding suitable foster families is a problem," Conklin told The Times in 
1990. "These children are hurt, incapacitated, explosive and aggressive. They 
don't like themselves, and they don't trust the world." 
</P>
<P>
 During his two decades of working with the state group, Conklin was widely 
credited with establishing modern operating procedures and a peer review system 
that made child-care centers more stable and accountable throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He also helped to negotiate adequate contract service fees with the state, 
which made California's child-care system one of the most progressive in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, he was appointed to the state Department of Health's Advisory 
Committee on Community Care Facilities and served as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was vice chairman of the California Child Welfare Strategic Planning 
Commission in 1990 and 1991, which recommended policy and program improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Conklin spent his life in Southern California and had also served two terms as 
president of what is now the regional Assn. of Children's Services Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 When Conklin retired last year, he referred to his 35-year career as "an 
unusual period of time, a period of change driven by people in the field who 
consistently demonstrate their concern for children and their families. Where 
once things were primarily done through intuition, now they are done in a 
planful way with knowledge and with tested and proven methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself very fortunate," he said. "I'm delighted to have been 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Conklin is survived by his wife of 41 years, JoAnne (Jan); three sons, Dean, 
Jon and Jeff; a daughter, Kim; a brother, Jerry, and 10 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Cancer 
Care Center of Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center in Pomona or to McKinley 
Home for Boys in San Dimas.

STATE TO BUY 2 PROPERTIES NEAR AIRPORT; SANTA PAULA: OWNERS OF THE HOUSES 
DESTROYED IN A 1992 PLANE CRASH SAY THAT SPLITTING $250,000 IS TOO LITTLE TOO 
LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State transportation commissioners have agreed to spend $250,000 to buy two 
houses that burned to the ground after a fiery plane crash near the Santa Paula 
Airport in 1992, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the families who lived in the modest houses when a light airplane dropped 
out of the sky almost 20 months ago complained Thursday that the money is too 
little too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hundred and fifty thousand is real good, but (half of that) is not enough 
to rebuild my house," said Joe Garcia, a 74-year-old Santa Paula native who 
owns one of the homes destroyed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's costing me $13,500 to clean up the debris, $7,000 for the architect and 
$4,000 for the permits," Garcia said. "And I can't even rebuild at my own 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to give 
Santa Paula $250,000 to buy the burned-out remnants of two Santa Clara Avenue 
bungalows, which lie under the flight path of planes landing at privately owned 
Santa Paula Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money will not be immediately available to Garcia and Rafael 
Rodriguez, the second property owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent appraisers must place a fair-market value on the parcels, and the 
actual disbursement could take months, said Ginger Gherardi, executive director 
of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But "this allows them to finally get compensated for the property that's been 
lost," Gherardi said. "This is a mechanism for these people to get some 
compensation, which up to now they've had no opportunity to get." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, a light plane piloted by William Lewis Clark clipped wings 
with a Cessna 150 flown by flight instructor Andrew Sinclair about 300 yards 
from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a crop duster pilot from Kern County, burned to death after his plane 
crashed into Garcia's home. Sinclair was able to land his plane safely on the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months following the crash, the Santa Paula City Council rezoned the 
area around the airport in an effort to establish an "inner safety zone" at the 
request of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The rezoning means that Garcia and Rodriguez would not be permitted to rebuild 
their homes even if they could afford to, Santa Paula City Engineer Norman 
Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen other homes inside the inner safety zone are presently occupied, 
and those residents are allowed to remain there indefinitely. But if those 
homes are damaged or destroyed, those residents would also be prohibited from 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed dramatically since the airport was built in 1930," 
Wilkinson said. "These lots and homes date back to the 1920s, so we have a very 
old problem that does not quite fit modern regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be working on getting state funding for years and years to try 
and acquire these homes and get them leveled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia and Rodriguez have filed civil suits against the city of Santa Paula, 
the owners of Santa Paula Airport and the pilots to try to be compensated for 
losing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Martinez, the Oxnard attorney representing the two Santa Paula 
homeowners, said the state transportation commission agreement would not affect 
his clients' case, which is scheduled for trial later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had two homes destroyed for more than 18 months," Martinez said. "It'll 
help our clients restore some order into their lives, but they still have other 
damages they've suffered as a result of the airplane crash." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the pilots and other defendants did not return calls 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), who testified before the state 
Transportation Commission last month in an effort to help Garcia and Rodriguez, 
said he was pleased with the panel's decision to buy the burned-out properties. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell introduced a recently passed law that allows transit funds to be 
made available to private airports to fund the acquisition of property inside 
state-mandated safety zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "A private airport used by the public should be eligible for this funding," 
O'Connell said. "We went from not even being eligible to getting a 
quarter-million dollars. So that's a success story." 
</P>
<P>
 But Garcia said he expected most of his share of the $250,000 to dwindle away 
-- either to attorneys, appraisers or for fees such as building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they were going to buy the property for a freeway and that was 37 
years ago," he said. "This thing happened 20 months ago and nothing's happened 
so far. This whole thing has gotten out of hand."

CITY FINDS $2.2-MILLION WINDFALL IN ITS BUDGET; VENTURA: THE UNEXPECTED BOOST 
IN REVENUES AND FEES MAY HELP OFFICIALS AVOID LAYOFFS IN THE POLICE AND FIRE 
DEPARTMENTS.

 Ventura city officials say they have $2.2 million more than they had 
anticipated this year and hope to avoid laying off as many as six police 
officers, two code enforcement officers and a fire prevention technician. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had expected to lay off employees and cut at least $1.5 million 
from Ventura's operating budget in the next few months. However, because of 
higher-than-projected revenues from fees, taxes and various city departments, 
city staff announced this week that they have an extra $730,000 instead of a 
$1.5-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus means that termination notices are more unlikely when the City 
Council adopts the budget in June, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a much better position to be in than we were last year," Councilman 
Greg Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson gave credit to city employees for helping raise about $602,000 of the 
$2.2-million windfall. City workers came up with the money after council 
members told them last year that jobs could be saved if police, firefighters 
and code enforcement officers came up with additional revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department generated an additional $210,000 by making sure that 
more residents paid their parking tickets. The Fire Department, which oversees 
code enforcement, got $167,000 through its weed abatement program and increased 
inspections. By contracting fire services for Ventura Avenue from the county, 
the Fire Department raised an additional $70,000. An additional $155,000 for 
police was obtained through a federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them incentives to produce revenues that would go back into saving 
their jobs," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Officer Greg Hayes, one of the six officers whose job may be 
saved, said he was happy to hear the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't push the panic button, but I was a little anxious," Hayes said, 
recalling when he was told of a possible layoff in June. "I think it's good for 
the city that the money's going toward police service and, on a personal level, 
it's fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 A draft budget released Wednesday recommends that funding for all departments 
and services remain much the same as the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the council, City Manager John Baker calls the proposed budget 
a "status quo" spending plan and warns council members that they may still have 
to make cuts if the state Legislature decides later this year to take money 
from cities as it has in the past. But the city's lobbyist has predicted that 
that is unlikely in the state's 1994-95 fiscal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel better than I did last year at this time," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fiscal year, city leaders went through a grim time adopting Ventura's 
$44-million operating budget. The council slashed $4.3 million, eliminated 65 
jobs, laid off 15 employees, instituted a hiring freeze and cut costs in every 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and code enforcement officers' positions were scheduled to be gradually 
eliminated over the next two years, but now the "modest turnaround" in the 
economy may help save their jobs, said Terry Adelman, who oversees the city's 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to savings by city departments, Adelman said the economic boost 
helped improve the city's financial picture. The increases include a jump of 
$635,000 in sales tax revenue compared to last year and a property tax increase 
of $48,000. Business license fees grew by $129,000, licensing and permit fees 
increased by $112,000, and building fees were up $51,000, he said. The city 
also restructured its investment portfolio and gained $190,000 in interest 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman said that city staff projections last year were too conservative and 
that council members cut $2 million more than they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were over-prepared," Adelman said. "The council took a bold step last year 
cutting more than they had to in order to prepare for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman said he is encouraging the council to make conservative decisions with 
the $730,000 surplus because the city's debt-service payments are scheduled to 
increase by $666,000 in 1996. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's Finance Committee will hold public meetings on the budget 
April 6 and 27, and May 11 and 25 at Ventura City Hall. In May, the committee 
is scheduled to make a budget recommendation to the entire council. The council 
will hold public hearings on the budget at its regular June meetings and is 
scheduled to adopt the budget before June 30.

PLAN WOULD STREAMLINE HAZARDOUS WASTE INSPECTIONS; CONSOLIDATION: FIRE 
DEPARTMENT COULD LOSE UP TO 11 JOBS. UNION LEADERS CALL THE IDEA A 'GET EVEN' 
SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Taking a first step to reorganize the Ventura County Fire Department, 
officials plan to streamline hazardous waste inspections -- a move that could 
save at least $1 million annually by eliminating up to 11 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the county's Resource Management Agency and the Fire Department 
both search for code violations at businesses that deal with hazardous 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a plan expected to be adopted by the Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday, the Resource Management Agency would be responsible for the 
inspections, ending the Fire Department's duplicate efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials have praised the proposal as an important 
cost-saving measure, it has come under heated criticism from Fire Department 
union leaders. They say they are the target of a "get even" scheme orchestrated 
by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We question their authority on a pretty regular basis," said Ken Maffei, 
president of the firefighters union. "This is a retaliatory move by the board." 
</P>
<P>
 He said streamlining -- which could result in seven fire prevention officers 
losing their jobs -- will only heighten tensions among department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Morale has plummeted with a recent board decision to exclude the department 
from Proposition 172 sales tax funding, an action that prompted Fire Chief 
George Lund to announce his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials say the consolidation will help cut through the county 
bureaucracy by eliminating some of the duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 County business ombudsman Ruth Schepler said businesses often complain that 
the hazardous waste inspectors with Resource Management Agency's environmental 
health division and the Fire Department often ask the same questions and charge 
separate fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite honestly, I felt their concerns were quite logical," Schepler said. 
"They couldn't understand why one week they get one person from environmental 
health and the next week they get a firefighter. It seemed foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Board of Supervisors directed Schepler several months ago to 
find a way to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Schepler said it made sense to give the Resource Management Agency the 
hazardous waste responsibilities because its inspectors tend to be better 
educated but lower paid than their Fire Department counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still going to provide a service that is required by law," Schepler 
said. "But we are going to do it at a much, much cheaper rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the county would eliminate 11 Fire Department positions, 
including a battalion chief, a hazardous materials specialist and seven fire 
prevention officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Holaway, who will take over as interim fire chief today, said 
department management can live with the change. The department will try to 
place the employees in other jobs but some layoffs may be necessary, he said. 
Three of the 11 positions are vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate to see the program go into environmental health," Holaway said. "But 
it was felt this was best for the system to work properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said the proposal had nothing to do with "getting 
even" with firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has been looking at many departments in terms of consolidation and 
downsizing," Kildee said. "The main goal is to make sure every department is 
functioning as efficiently and effectively as it can." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, she said, will be the first step in county efforts to make the 
Fire Department more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In several weeks, members of a citizens committee studying problems in the 
Fire Department are expected to issue their report on ways to improve 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's recommendations will be used as a basis for more changes in the 
department, which has been accused by county auditors of being lax with 
overtime and top-heavy with managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have also agreed to hire a consultant to help find a 
replacement for Lund, who retired Thursday after 27 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are going to face a difficult time," Kildee said. "The Fire 
Department has always been a good department. But we face a time when everyone 
from top to bottom, east to west, has to make changes to do things better than 
we have before. Those changes are not easy."

ANIMAL PROGRAM MAY MOVE; WILDLIFE: A SIMI VALLEY REHABILITATION AND RELEASE 
EFFORT MIGHT FIND A NEW HOME AT THE POINT MUGU NAVY BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Walk into Jerry Thompson's Simi Valley back yard and you won't find the 
prerequisite expanse of green lawn and shimmering blue pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, you'll find a cramped facility lined with cages and pens of all sizes 
holding a variety of sick and injured birds and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In his nearby garage, you won't find the family cars either. Instead, there is 
the animal version of a MASH unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are nearly out of room here," said Thompson, who along with his wife, 
Kathy, co-founded the Raptor Rehabilitation and Release organization. "We're 
already elbow-to-elbow." 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, under a proposal jointly conceived by Thompson and Point Mugu Naval 
Air Weapons Station environmental officials, Thompson may be able to move to 
new digs roughly twice the size at the seaside base. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Thompson's raptor program -- named after the scientific 
moniker for flesh-eating birds of prey -- would occupy an abandoned 
dolphin-training area on the base near Mugu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit, all-volunteer organization also works with other animals 
besides birds of prey, such as shore and marine birds as well as reptiles, 
deer, raccoons, opossums, foxes and other animals indigenous to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, the program assists about 500 animals a year -- more than 70% of 
which are returned to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing this as a real opportunity to expand our services while at the 
same time expose more people to the wonders of these animals," said Thompson, 
himself a longtime master falconer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tom Keeney, a Navy ecologist, the proposal gives the service a 
chance to expand its wildlife interpretation program while utilizing a facility 
that has been abandoned since the early 1960s when the Navy conducted dolphin 
research there. 
</P>
<P>
 At the site, situated near the northern mouth of Mugu Lagoon, five concrete 
marine mammal tanks of various sizes are now partially filled with dirt and 
other debris and in various states of disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a small trailer that houses a variety of stuffed birds and animals 
serves as a makeshift Navy wildlife interpretation station -- sharing space 
with computers and other gear recording data about the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which is still subject to final approval by base officials, 
calls for Thompson's group to renovate the Point Mugu facility, build netted 
aviaries over the tanks and occupy an adjacent building. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, sick and injured birds and other animals that have been nursed back to 
health will be on display during public tours of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeney said that about 4,000 school-age children and adults take tours of the 
base's wildlife interpretation program each year, and that the idea of 
combining the two efforts seemed a natural match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're very excited about this," Keeney said. "Jerry is perfect for 
this kind of collaboration -- he's an expert in rehabilitation and extremely 
skilled in animal interpretation. His live animal presentations are excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeney said the Navy's primary contribution to the effort will be in providing 
the land, and it may also provide the nonprofit group with some help in 
renovating electrical equipment and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest will be up to them, although we will help them whenever we can," 
Keeney said. "By the interest shown already by our employees, I don't think 
they'll have trouble finding volunteers to run the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the raptor group fits nicely into the Navy's Natural Resources 
Management Plan, according to Ron Barrett, environmental protection specialist. 
Barrett said the management plan calls for the careful monitoring of all 
plants, animals and ecosystems that make up the lagoon and surrounding area -- 
one of the last remaining salt marshes in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a tremendous help because there will be more eyes and ears 
out there," Barrett said. "With downsizing, we can't hire new people. 
Consequently, there are a lot of programs we can't do because we don't have the 
personnel. Jerry's organization will go a long way toward helping us. His 
program really complements our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 For Thompson, who runs his program on a little less than $25,000 a year in 
contributions from the public, relocating to Point Mugu means that he will be 
able to show more people the wonders of animals they might not ever have a 
chance to see up close. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with scores of volunteer veterinarians and other wildlife specialists, 
Thompson's program, which is licensed by the state Fish and Game Department and 
the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, helps nurse back to health eagles, hawks 
and a variety of other birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said that process sometimes means reteaching the animals their 
hunting skills so they can survive again in the wild. He said it also sometimes 
means making more room in his facility for an animal that because of injury or 
illness will never again be able to fend for itself in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a major focus for Thompson is educating the public on 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animal rehabilitation is just as important as the educating that we do," 
said Thompson, who does hundreds of animal presentations each year. "What we 
teach first and foremost is respect for the animals. Without that, why go on?" 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the animal rehabilitation center on the base would ultimately 
be an intermediate step toward the eventual creation of an estimated $7-million 
native wildlife interpretive center to be situated off-base on California 1 
near Mugu Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But until then, Thompson and Navy officials said they hope to be able to start 
renovations this spring and open the new on-base facility by late summer.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 SUPERVISORS REJECT HOSPITAL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura County supervisors Thursday rejected a proposal by Community 
Memorial Hospital to jointly hire a consultant to define health care needs in 
the Ventura area and recommend how they can best be met. 
</P>
<P>
 The private hospital had recommended retaining the consultant to analyze the 
need for a proposed $30-million wing to the county Medical Center, just three 
blocks from Community Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisors Susan K. Lacey and Maggie Kildee told Community Memorial board 
members Fritz Huntsinger and Donald Benton in a 90-minute meeting that the 
county favors studying health care needs countywide, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We suggested looking at the needs of the whole county first and if something 
flowed out of that, we might be interested," said Lacey, whose district 
includes both hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial officials oppose construction of a new 105,000-square-foot 
outpatient wing at the county facility, saying it is not needed, is too costly 
and is part of a county plan to compete for private patients and not just treat 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials argue that they need to replace a hodgepodge of dilapidated 
clinics and must act now or miss a strong chance at 70% state reimbursement. 
They also maintain that they have no plans to compete for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors, who approved the new hospital wing in concept in 1993, have 
responded to new questions on the project by agreeing to a public hearing, 
tentatively set April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the two supervisors said in effect, 'We're going to do our thing and 
you're going to do your thing and trust us that we won't encroach on your 
thing,' " Benton said. DARYL KELLEY

ON THE ISSUE: THE CURRENT THINKING ON TESTS FOR EMFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, citing a potential health hazard caused by high electromagnetic 
fields at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School in Sherman Oaks, anxious 
parents persuaded school officials to relocate an electrical transformer away 
from a portable classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 Several scientific studies have suggested that electromagnetic fields, often 
referred to as EMFs, may present a small increased risk of cancer, although a 
causal link has not been proven. To date, only nine campuses in the more than 
600-school Los Angeles Unified School District have been tested for elevated 
EMFs, but district officials have said they will review building plans to 
identify other campuses where transformers may be creating high levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Should all schools be tested for high levels of electromagnetic fields? 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Keating, president of the Parent-Teacher Assn. at Mayall Street 
Elementary School in North Hills, where a fence was erected last year to shield 
students from an electrical transformer: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think absolutely every school should be checked. We definitely want all 
schools tested. There's a lot of hidden things with EMF, like overhead wires. 
There are also dangers such as computers. There could be faulty wiring. There 
are a lot of hidden dangers. . . . The district is looking for direction. They 
want someone to tell them what to do. That's why I'm hoping that we can get 
this resolution passed (at the California State PTA convention in May) to force 
legislators to take action. . . . I definitely think parents need to be more 
informed on this issue. I don't want people to be afraid of electricity -- it's 
something we need. Just be cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rivera, assistant to Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid 
Thompson: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Testing) will be done on a case-by-case basis. Schools who have concerns and 
make requests will be tested. It's a very complicated issue. We are not in the 
business of regulation. We comply with all health and safety standards . . . 
(but) there are not standards with respect to EMF. We are involved with things 
like asbestos removal because there are standards. . . . Our resources are not 
unlimited. There are other very, very important areas where standards have been 
set and there is a definite need to meet those standards. We don't have the 
people and the money to do widespread (EMF) testing. There is no agreement 
among people in this field as to whether or not there is a link between EMF and 
an increased risk of cancer. In order to allay the concerns of parents, we have 
gone ahead and taken action by moving the transformer at Dixie Canyon. We've 
taken steps in the absence of regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Slesin, editor of Manhattan-based Microwave News, which has been 
covering EMF-related issues since 1980: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (testing) is the place you start. When it comes to schools, you're 
putting all the community's children in one place. That's a concentrated risk. 
We now know enough to take this issue very seriously. If there are high EMF 
levels, then they're all at risk. We don't know the extent of the risk, but we 
know there's something going on there. . . . It's the parents and teachers who 
are most concerned. They're the ones who work in the schools. The incentive or 
pressure always comes from them. . . . I'm certainly not advocating that you 
bury all the (power) lines in California. I'm saying there's a lot of middle 
ground. Understanding where the hot spots are is a good place to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Fried, father of two Dixie Canyon students and the person who brought 
the issue to the school's attention: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's needed is getting someone down to the schools and just walking 
around like I did and see if there are any huge transformers butting up against 
the classrooms. That's not a major project, it's just a very simple thing. You 
walk around and look for transformers and if you find anything, you test it 
then. (Schools) do things when pressure is on and they fear for their image. . 
. . There should be a policy (about where) to place these things in the future. 
The policy should be to put them as far away from children as possible. It's 
something that can be avoided. There's no reason to think that your child will 
come down with some horrible disease, but there's still that remote 
possibility."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; ACQUITTED MAN WANTS BOMB CASE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Moorpark man acquitted almost a year ago on charges that he attempted to 
kill a Simi Valley couple with a homemade bomb said Thursday that the 
investigation should be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They botched the case the first time when they tried to pin it on me," said 
Jim McKeever, 43. "That investigation was mishandled and misdirected, but 
that's no reason to let the real guilty party continue to walk the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors reached Thursday stood by their work on the case, and while 
Simi Valley police would not respond directly to McKeever's criticism of the 
investigation, they made it clear that the case is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no suspects left, and the case is pretty much inactive," said 
police spokesman Sgt. Andy McCluskey.  
</P>
<P>
 McKeever was tried on charges of throwing a bomb into the bedroom of his 
wife's ex-husband during a bitter custody battle. The victims in the bombing, 
John Monroe and Charlene Mayer, were not seriously injured in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his acquittal on criminal charges, McKeever recently lost a civil case 
filed by the injured couple and had to pay them $10,000 for their injuries. 
McKeever plans to appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 During the civil case, Simi Valley police detectives testified that they still 
believed that McKeever was guilty of the crime. McKeever said a "proper" 
investigation would end continued speculation about his guilt in the case.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was acquitted. I spent six weeks on trial and the jury deliberated for less 
than an hour and found me not guilty," he said. "They lost big time, but that 
doesn't seem to make any difference. I'm still guilty in their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeever has assembled evidence, including videotape filmed by the Police 
Department at the crime scene, that he says will show that someone else was 
involved in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying who I think it was," he said. "The point is that this is not 
hearsay. This is evidence that the Police Department chose to ignore." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeever said he still plans to push for an independent investigation into the 
case. Next week he said he will begin the process of filing a lawsuit against 
the county and the Simi Valley Police Department. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SOME GET AN EARLY START ON GETAWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Charles and Linda Wigand looked out their window Thursday morning and saw 
clear blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 That did it. Within hours, the Diamond Bar couple had loaded up their Chevy 
Blazer and were heading north for a holiday weekend of camping, fishing and 
leisurely reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Like dozens of other holiday revelers who descended upon Ventura County's 
campgrounds and beaches Thursday, the Wigands hoped that their early start 
would land them a good camping spot on Easter weekend -- one of the busiest 
times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After being turned down at three crowded campgrounds, they got lucky at 
McGrath State Beach in Oxnard. Not only did they get a spot for the night, they 
chose one closest to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought his fishing pole; I brought my books," Linda Wigand said as her 
husband continued unloading gear from their truck. "We're not going to do 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath State Beach still had plenty of camping spots left Thursday afternoon. 
But Ranger Richard Rojas said they will probably all be gone by late today. 
</P>
<P>
 Campsites at some Ventura County beaches, including Thorne Hill Broome Beach, 
have been reserved for as long as three months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spring break is one of the busiest weekends for state campgrounds," said 
Rojas, chief ranger of the Channel Coast District. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were preparing for the holiday weekend in different ways. At the 
Ventura County Rescue Mission in Oxnard, director Carol Roberg spent Thursday 
organizing a dinner menu for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rescue Mission will feed about 300 homeless people at noon Sunday. But 
instead of the traditional Easter dinner of ham, mission cooks will be serving 
barbecued steak, Mexican rice and beans, tortillas and salsa, Roberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we will draw more people by offering this type of fare," Roberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several churches throughout the county will offer sunrise services Sunday. 
Churches, youth clubs and other organizations are also sponsoring Easter egg 
hunts and other activities for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor crowd will benefit from fair weather throughout the weekend, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Highs will hover from the upper 60s to mid-70s today through Sunday, said 
Dennis Tussey, spokesman for the National Weather Service in Oxnard. There may 
be early morning fog, but it will burn away before noon, Tussey said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was good news for the seven girls and two boys who arrived at McGrath 
State Beach on Wednesday for an early start on spring break partying. The 
girls, from an all-girls Catholic high school in Woodland Hills, and the boys, 
from Pierce College, sat outside on lawn chairs Thursday sizing up their coming 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to sit around and party," said Dan Levack, 20, wearing a black 
Iron Maiden baseball cap. "Get away from the city for a while." KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FESTIVAL ABANDONS CHILD-CARE TENT 
IDEA

<P>
 Hopes of providing child care for visitors to the upcoming Conejo Valley Days 
festival fell through this week after an insured day-care provider could not be 
found, festival officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care idea "never got off the ground," said Steve Rubenstein, 
executive director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for a child-care tent initially was proposed after marketing surveys 
showed community interest in giving the festival a family focus, said Jennifer 
Cole Cummings, president of Executive Performance Group, the company hired to 
put on the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days is scheduled to begin April 27 and run through May 1.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 4 LOCAL RESIDENTS ARRESTED IN RENO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police in Reno have arrested four Ventura men on suspicion of trying to cash 
counterfeit checks at a Reno bank, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngoc Nguyen, 24, Muoi Nguyen, 28, Ai Nguyen, 30, and Huong Nguyen, 21, were 
caught Wednesday with $54,443 in fake payroll checks from a Reno business, said 
Sgt. Doug Evans of the Reno Police Department's fraud unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam was initiated in Southern California and may have been carried out in 
several U. S. cities, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Reno began following the men shortly after they arrived. The Secret 
Service received a tip in Los Angeles that indicated that the four men would be 
coming to Reno in a 1993 Toyota Camry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We . . . spotted the car at a local hotel, then we just waited," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they received warrants and trailed the men until they successfully 
cashed one of the checks for $480 at a Reno branch of First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "They most certainly would have used them all if we had not located them," 
Evans said. "We're happy with how it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 The four men, who gave Ventura addresses, were booked on several counts of 
possession of a forged instrument and are being held in Reno on bails ranging 
from $168,750 to $445,500. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 5 INDICTED IN FATAL SHOOTING AT MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County grand jury has indicted four men and a woman for a fatal 
shooting in December at a Ventura motel, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments mean that the defendants, who prosecutors say are gang 
members, will face a Superior Court trial in connection with the Dec. 18 
shooting death of 21-year-old Paul Martinez of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was gunned down as he stood on the second-floor balcony at Motel 6 on 
Johnson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder indictments were handed down against Steven Hidalgo, 20; Shaun Bolo, 
20, and his brother, Willard, 23. Hidalgo, of Port Hueneme, and the Bolos, both 
of Oxnard, are each being held at the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $1-million 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Indictments of accessory to murder were returned against 19-year-old Naomi 
Honohan of Port Hueneme and Alfonso Cortez, 21, of Oxnard. Honohan is being 
held in custody in lieu of $250,000 bail, while Cortez is free on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said prosecutors requested Honohan's bail 
to be higher than Cortez' because she played a larger role in trying to cover 
up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their conduct is different," he said. A bail review hearing and a pretrial 
conference for Honohan have been set April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men are scheduled to be arraigned May 10 in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the victim and the defendants were attending separate parties 
at the motel when the two sides exchanged words that led to the shooting. 
Martinez apparently did not know his attackers, police said. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY'S HELP URGED FOR SKATEBOARD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Ojai students and teachers have asked the City Council to help them 
attract a skateboard park to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they welcomed the idea of a skateboard park, council members said 
there is no money available in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A subcommittee of the city Parks and Recreation Commission surveyed nearly 500 
junior and senior high students about their interest in such a facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 60% of the students from Nordhoff High School and 46% of the Matilija 
Junior High students surveyed said they would use the park -- especially on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Many would be willing to pay a daily or monthly rate for the park, the survey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff teacher Craig Walker also told the council last week that interest in 
a skateboard park is high among downtown merchants, who have often complained 
about skateboarders annoying their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman James D. Loebl recommended that the school district become involved 
in the early stages of any discussion on the park because many of the users 
would be from outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any problem with the concept," he said after the presentation. 
"My concern is the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers in Camarillo are also attempting to generate interest in a 
community-sponsored skateboard park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai recreation subcommittee members, including some Matilija and Nordhoff 
students, said they would continue looking for funding ideas and perhaps visit 
other skateboard parks in the state. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; AFTER-SCHOOL CARE PROGRAM APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children in the Oxnard Elementary School District who would otherwise go home 
to empty houses may soon be able to stay at school for supervised play or 
homework until 5 p.m., under a program approved by the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Youth After School Program will open the doors of Driffill and 
Lemonwood elementary schools in the afternoon in an attempt to deter 
unsupervised children from joining gangs or otherwise getting in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which was organized by residents and business owners, would give 
the children access to playgrounds and tutors at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be valuable for all working parents, but especially for 
parents who do not speak English or cannot help their children with their 
homework, said Edmundo Chavez, principal of Lemonwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the parents work, and the kids need to do something after school," 
he said. "I think the program is very much needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in August, children ages 6 to 12 attending or living near one of the 
designated schools can stay until 5 p.m. The centers will be staffed by high 
school and college students as well as volunteer senior citizens from the 
Ventura County Area Agency on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which will cost about $44,000 a year, will be funded by 
donations. It will be free of charge to parents. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; PLANS FOR BOOKSTORE IN BANK PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to open a bookshop and coffeehouse in an abandoned bank building in 
downtown Ojai have been put on hold because the would-be buyers missed a 
deadline to sign a contract, a Bank of America spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Terry and Penny Davies, who own the Earthling Books stores in Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo, said the banking giant never told them that time 
was running out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davies last fall began the process of opening their third store -- a 
combination bookstore-coffeehouse -- in the former Bank of America building at 
307 E. Ojai Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 They went so far as to draw up plans for expanding the building and applied to 
the city Planning Commission for tentative approval. At the time, some 
competing bookstore owners complained that Ojai does not typically endorse 
chain businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked carefully in Ojai before we decided we wanted to buy that 
building," Penny Davies said. "We need a space large enough for a good-sized 
bookshop that will also hold a cultural events center and a cafe." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bank of America began negotiating with another buyer when it failed to 
receive written confirmation of a verbal agreement with the Davies, spokesman 
Charlie Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were repeated reminders (of the March 4 deadline)," Coleman said 
Thursday. "It wasn't until March 25 that we heard back from them, and even then 
it was not a complete, signed contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Davies said she and her husband would still like to purchase the 
property. JEFF McDONALD

FILLMORE OPENS ESCROW TO BUY QUAKE-DAMAGED THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quake-ravaged movie theater that entertained generations of Fillmore 
residents will be spared the wrecking ball, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Fillmore opened escrow Thursday on the 77-year-old cinema in the 
city's historic downtown area, agreeing to pay $75,000 for the structure that 
engineers estimate will require $350,000 to $400,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's owners had said they lacked both the money and the energy to 
restore the bedraggled theater. However, scores of nostalgic residents 
organized an effort called "Save the Show" and the City Council decided to make 
the owners an offer with city Redevelopment Agency money. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Roy Payne said he hopes that a grant from the state historical 
society will cover 75% or more of the restoration cost. The city will soon 
begin putting a grant application together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said the city may decide to retain ownership of the theater once the 
restoration is complete, or it may turn over the theater's ownership to a local 
nonprofit organization, perhaps one formed especially for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Payne and other Fillmore residents have grand plans for the 
soon-to-be-revamped theater. 
</P>
<P>
 This, Payne said, need not be an ordinary cinema, playing merely first-run 
movies like everyone else in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be like the theater at Disneyland," he said. "We could be showing 
theme films around the citrus and railroad industries. We could play classics. 
We could even have a series on films filmed in Fillmore." CONSTANCE SOMMER

MOORPARK PARENTS TO GET 1ST PICKS ON SCHOOL CHOICES; EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT IS 
AHEAD OF MOST OTHERS IN THE COUNTY IN IMPLEMENTING A STATE-MANDATED PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting this spring, Moorpark parents will be among the first in Ventura 
County to choose which public school their children will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new state law, parents of elementary and middle school students in the 
Moorpark Unified School District will be able to pick which of the district's 
seven schools they believe is most suited for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is ahead of most districts in the county working to implement a 
state-mandated "school choice" program because the district started developing 
its plan long before the state passed legislation in July that made such 
programs mandatory, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit the ground running because we've spent so much time looking at this 
issue internally," school board member Clint Harper said. "We wanted to 
accelerate the process, because if we wait until the July deadline, we would 
have to wait another year before we could implement choice." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 24 teachers, administrators and parents formed a committee more 
than a year ago to look into the effectiveness of Moorpark's schools, Harper 
said. They concluded that giving parents the choice of where to send their 
children would be the most effective way to involve parents in schools. The 
committee determined that more parent involvement would improve the quality of 
education in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty simple," said David Pollock, a parent who chaired the committee. 
"Parents will become involved because suddenly they are asked to decide what 
school is best for their child." 
</P>
<P>
 Districts throughout the county will be setting up school choice programs over 
the next several months. Officials in the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
said they are preparing to notify parents soon about a choice program for 
Thousand Oaks schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs are based on state legislation passed last year mandating that 
public school districts have a program in place by July 1 allowing parents to 
send their children to any school within the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be restrictions. In Moorpark, choices will be limited by the 
capacity of any one school to take additional students, and the movement of 
children must not upset the racial balance of the school, Assistant Supt. Frank 
DePasquale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is considered one of the most integrated districts in the county. The 
student enrollment at each of its schools is about 75% white and 25% minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unlimited choice," DePasquale said. "But we also don't expect to 
have the kind of fluctuations that some districts in places like Los Angeles 
will have. I believe that parents in Moorpark realize that the overall quality 
of education here is very high. They will choose between schools with the same 
core courses but with unique programs to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 DePasquale said that over the years, many of Moorpark's elementary schools 
have developed reputations for special programs. Campus Canyon School, for 
instance, is known for its environmental programs, while Arroyo West has 
established innovative computer classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those differences will be the basis of choice," he said. "We're not going to 
have any mass exodus from any one school." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the school choice program, the Moorpark school board is 
considering allowing administrators to set up magnet programs for subjects such 
as math and science to improve education in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Choice is the first step," Harper said. "We're doing things that will keep 
improving our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will be allowed to visit all of the district's schools during open 
houses scheduled April 18 to 22. Also, all the elementary schools will have 
"Information Nights" throughout April. Parents wishing to move their children 
to a school outside their attendance area must file an application for the 
transfer by May 1. School Choice Moorpark's elementary schools will hold 
information sessions on the district's school choice program. Here are the 
dates and times:

SOKA'S BID FOR SEPARATE TRIALS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making only minor changes to an earlier ruling, a Ventura-based state appeals 
court on Thursday affirmed that Soka University should fight the condemnation 
of its Calabasas campus in Los Angeles County courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-page opinion by the 2nd District Court of Appeal amended a Feb. 15 
decision, in which the three-judge panel reached essentially the same 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's revised ruling was done to clarify legal points raised by Soka, 
which is locked in a bitter fight with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
over its campus at the corner of Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials want to condemn 245 acres of the campus to use as a 
visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The 
Japanese language school wants to expand into a liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying unsuccessfully to buy Soka's property, the conservancy in late 
1992 launched eminent domain proceedings -- the process by which a public 
agency can force a private property owner to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers claimed the conservancy did not follow proper procedure when it 
began the process and sued to halt the action in court. Early last year, a 
Ventura County judge agreed with Soka and ruled that the conservancy had erred. 
</P>
<P>
 But justices deciding a conservancy appeal ruled that Soka should raise its 
objections to the conservancy's actions in eminent domain proceedings in Los 
Angeles County -- not in a series of separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Thursday's ruling, Soka administrators vowed to press their 
concerns before the California Supreme Court later this spring, an action that 
probably would cause further delays in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to be very sanguine about the whole thing," said Soka spokesman 
Jeff Ourvan. "It's like watching grass grow -- it takes a long time." AARON

POLITICAL BRIEFING: ROBERTI RECALL VOTE COULD HIT HOME IN RENT-CONTROL DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 RENT CHECK: San Fernando Valley voters may hold the future of Santa Monica's 
rent-control law in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the fate of rent control and the fate of state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) could be one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, a staunch supporter of rent control, is the target of a recall effort 
led by the gun lobby in his new Valley district. The recall vote is scheduled 
for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 A candidate for state treasurer, Roberti has to leave the Senate in December 
to comply with term limits. But his presence in Sacramento is much needed in 
the coming months by those trying to block a legislative effort to weaken rent 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Santa Monica rent-control advocates are busy phoning Valley 
voters, urging them to keep Roberti in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt that rent control was more threatened than now," said Michael 
Tarbet, a renters' rights activist in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, Tarbet urged members to 
write state legislators and sought volunteers to work the phones for Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Causing alarm is a bill by Assemblymen Jim Costa (D-Hanford) and Bernie 
Richter (R-Chico) that would allow rents to move to market levels upon vacancy, 
which the Santa Monica law prohibits. The statewide legislation would also 
affect hundreds of tenants whose apartments remain under rent control even 
though other units in their buildings have been converted to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation is backed by landlord and real estate interests eager to have 
the bill signed this year by Gov. Pete Wilson in case the Republican loses his 
November reelection bid. "This is the year if they are ever going to do it," 
said Tony Trendacosta, attorney for the Santa Monica Rent Board. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Roberti has blocked bills to weaken rent control by killing them in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, thereby preventing the issue from coming to a 
vote before the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The current bill awaits Judiciary Committee action, but a hearing will not be 
set until after Roberti's fate is decided April 12. The bill was sent straight 
to the Senate Judiciary Committee without an Assembly vote, so it could be 
heard on a few days notice. The Assembly has supported vacancy decontrol in the 
past, so passage is expected there. 
</P>
<P>
 Though state Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), Roberti's successor as president 
pro tem of the Senate, apparently will oppose the bill, it is unclear whether 
Lockyer will be as committed to the rent-control cause as Roberti has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how many committee votes he has lined up, Steve Hopcraft, a political 
consultant hired to work against the bill, said: "The only head count we're 
worried about is Roberti's head." 
</P>

 OOPS, WRONG PARTY: James Gilmartin, a Santa Clarita attorney, is seeking the 
Democratic congressional nomination for the second time for the 25th District 
seat held by Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita). 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, he was amused to receive a mailing from the National Republican 
Senatorial Committee this week designating him an "at-large delegate" to the 
committee's upcoming platform planning session in Washington. The fund-raising 
solicitation was signed by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), chairman of the GOP's 
senatorial committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter informed Gilmartin that delegates-at-large were "selected from 
Republican Party membership rolls in each of the 50 states" and "will be 
responsible for assisting in the formation of the National Republican Party 
Platform."  
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to attract bipartisan support for my candidacy," Gilmartin said 
in a tongue-in-cheek news release. "But this is more than I ever hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Committee said that the mailing to 
Gilmartin was "obviously a mistake." After checking, he said Gilmartin's name 
was culled from a mailing list the committee rented from a group calling itself 
Donors Opposed to Congressional Pay Raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that's being done to assist our senatorial candidates in 
the '94 election," said committee spokesman Gary Koops. "The issues platform 
has no relevance as far as the '96 platform" that will be adopted by the 
national party two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Koops said, Gilmartin would be welcome to send the committee a check on 
behalf of GOP Senate candidates. Or, he added, "maybe we could even use it to 
help Congressman McKeon." 
</P>

 HIT THE ROAD: As admirable as it may be to advocate car-pooling, Los Angeles 
City Councilman Marvin Braude found out this week that there is a price to pay 
for being too eager. Braude, who represents parts of the Westside and the 
Valley, learned that lesson when he drafted a motion to ask Caltrans to build a 
permanent car-pool lane on the Santa Monica Freeway -- an idea that died 18 
years ago due to public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 But what steamed some of his council colleagues is that he proposed the idea 
under a procedural rule that would have moved it through the approval process 
without review by the council's Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The move drew a barrage of fire from Councilmen Hal Bernson and John Ferraro. 
But the harshest criticism came from Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who also 
represents parts of the Valley and Westside. He called the idea "half-cocked" 
and described Braude's tactics as "sneaky." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that some of us think we know best what's good for the people we 
represent, but sometimes we need to let the people buy into the plan," 
Yaroslavsky said as Braude listened in silence. "Believe me, the path of all 
wisdom does not reside in this building." Braude's response? He agreed to send 
the proposal to the Transportation Committee for review as long as it comes 
back before the council within 30 days. Stay tuned for Round 2.

 HEALTH CARE HEARING: A Republican-sponsored health care hearing postponed by 
the Jan. 17 earthquake has been rescheduled for 10 a.m. to noon April 8 at Cal 
State Northridge's student union. The event is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), the head of a 
House GOP task force on health care reform, will co-chair the session. Rep. 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), the senior Republican on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, a key panel on health care legislation, will also 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Panels will feature representatives of small businesses, health care service 
and product businesses and health care providers. Among those who will testify 
are Jeffrey Flocken, president of Northridge Medical Center; Steve Schmidt, 
president of the Antelope Valley Medical Center, and Leonard Schaeffer, 
chairman of Blue Cross of California. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, Hastert and Moorhead have all expressed strong reservations about the 
health care reform bill proposed by President Clinton. They support a more 
incremental measure sponsored by House Republican Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) that they helped develop. This proposal is not regarded as one of the 
politically viable plans under consideration.

2 COUNTY SITES TO RECEIVE FACE LIFT; BEAUTIFICATION: STATE AGENCY APPROVES 
FUNDS TO LANDSCAPE ENTRANCE TO NEWBURY PARK AND RESTORE HISTORIC TRAIN DEPOT 
NEAR SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks neighborhood looking for a face lift and a run-down train 
depot near Simi Valley got a $400,000 boost Thursday from a state 
transportation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to landscape the main entrance to Newbury Park and restore the historic 
depot in Santa Susana Knolls were among more than 150 beautification projects 
around the state approved by the California Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of projects all over the state competing for these funds, 
so we were very lucky to get both projects approved," said Ginger Gherardi, 
executive director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. The funding 
will be split equally between the two projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also agreed to spend $255,000 to strengthen two bridges in 
Saticoy against earthquakes, and to install a $1-million safety median barrier 
on a three-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway from La Conchita to the Rincon 
Point under-crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Johnson, spokesman for the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, said 
the state money would cover about half the cost of renovating the Santa Susana 
Historic Railroad Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-year-old building, situated east of Simi Valley, is now boarded up. The 
park district hopes to renovate it and open it for tours, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This funding will be a big help," he said. "The goal is to show people how we 
got around before cars were as common as they are now." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Thousand Oaks will use its share of the funding to spruce up the 
entrance to Newbury Park at Borchard Road and Michael Drive near the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans include landscaping, irrigation and monument signs for the southeast and 
southwest corners of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it looks kind of barren, especially in the winter," City 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. "So we're thrilled with the chance to really 
make some improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also agreed to retrofit the bridge at the Santa Paula Freeway 
and California 118 in Saticoy, and the Saticoy Avenue over-crossing on the 
Santa Paula Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation recently built a two-lane bridge that 
carries northbound traffic on California 118 over the Santa Paula Freeway. The 
retrofitting will be conducted on a 30-year-old companion bridge that carries 
southbound traffic, Caltrans construction engineer Robert Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting often involves digging around the footing of a bridge, wrapping 
it with steel and concrete, and hooking cables to bridge decks to keep them 
from caving in during quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting of the two bridges comes after approval early in March of similar 
work on 45 bridges throughout the county. The work is expected to completed by 
the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its continuing road safety program, the commission has also agreed 
to pay for installation of a $1-million, 18-inch steel median on the Ventura 
Freeway from Ocean Avenue in La Conchita to the under-crossing at Rincon Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no barrier there at all now, just a vacant median," Joe said. "The 
new median will provide a barrier to keep cars and trucks from crossing over in 
the wrong direction."

NAVY CANCELS ITS SEARCH FOR WAYWARD SEA LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy called off its search Thursday for Pumpkin, the California sea lion 
that wandered away from a routine training exercise in the Channel Islands, 
saying the wayward sea lion would have to return on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pumpkin will have to go ashore on his own or swim back to San Diego," Navy 
spokesman Tom LaPuzza said.He said animal experts consider it unlikely that 
Pumpkin will return to his pen in San Diego Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said the Navy canceled its search for the 16-year-old sea lion 
Thursday afternoon after searchers failed to catch a glimpse of the elusive 
Pumpkin during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea lion, which was trained by the Navy for 15 years to recover dummy 
mines, disappeared during a training mission near Santa Rosa Island nine days 
ago. Navy searchers located and briefly captured Pumpkin on Tuesday on Gull 
Island near Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea lion was injured in a fall as the would-be rescuers approached, but 
then wrestled free from their grasp, wiggled out of a harness that contained a 
radio beacon and dived back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers spotted the sea lion for the last time late Tuesday as they sounded 
an audible beacon and tried to coax him back with buckets of fish. But without 
the locational beacon to home in on, the Navy was left with little choice but 
to wait for Pumpkin to tire of his new freedom and return, LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will now rely on reports from fishermen, the Coast Guard, lifeguards or 
boat owners who run into a sea lion that is real interested in humans or jumps 
in their boat," LaPuzza said. PATRICK McCARTNEY

FIRM PLANS TO ASK VOTERS TO OK LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debate over the use of Weldon Canyon was rekindled Thursday as a San 
Diego-based company revealed plans for a November ballot initiative that would 
allow the public to determine if a landfill should be placed there, a county 
waste official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Servcom Inc. on Monday will file papers to create an initiative that would 
provide land-use and entitlement permits for Weldon Canyon to be used as a 
landfill, said Scott Montgomery, chairman of the Ventura County Waste 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The rugged canyon, located at the mouth of the Ojai Valley, was the focus of a 
heated debate over the summer when Waste Management of North America attempted 
to get Ventura County approval to build a landfill there. The company withdrew 
its petition after it became clear that the proposal would be rejected by the 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement with Waste Management that would allow Servcom to control a 
landfill on the site "is either imminent to be consummated or has just been 
consummated," said Montgomery, a Moorpark city councilman who is seeking the 
supervisor's seat being vacated by Vicky Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Servcom and Waste Management could not be reached for comment 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going directly to the people is an interesting approach," Simi Valley Mayor 
Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said 18,000 signatures would be needed to get the issue on the 
ballot, and a majority of county voters would need to support the initiative in 
November for it to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be able to find enough signatures in one weekend to get this on 
the ballot," Montgomery said. "People in the east county will be very 
supportive, and people in Ojai will probably be vocal opponents."

THE LAST GASP OF A MORIBUND SYSTEM; MEXICO: THE RULING PARTY GOES THROUGH THE 
MOTIONS FOR A CANDIDATE WHO'S BANKING ALL ON A GHOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist who teaches 
at Mexican and U.S. universities. His latest book is Utopia Unarmed: The Latin 
American Left After the Cold War (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time -- and almost certainly for the last -- Mexico's 
quasi-magical succession mechanism has been called into use twice to replace 
one leader: last November, when Luis Donaldo Colosio was appointed Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's successor, and now this past week as Ernesto Zedillo Ponce 
de Leon was chosen to succeed the assassinated Colosio. The mechanism had never 
been strained as much, and in this, its last hurrah, while it has performed 
admirably, it is clearly showing the signs of its old age. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential prerogative of personally selecting a successor worked again: 
Zedillo was Salinas' choice, and his alone. As always, there was no pretense of 
a democratic process, no alternative candidacies, no debate, no primaries, no 
vote. As on some other occasions, there were resistances, disgruntled though 
silent losers and, exceptionally, a lackluster cargada, the ceremony whereby 
thousands of pristas of all stripes and colors troop down to party headquarters 
or to the lucky candidate's home to express their support and, hopefully, begin 
lining up for jobs in the next administration. The tragic circumstances in 
which the unveiling took place, and the resigned reluctance with which Zedillo 
was accepted, did not allow for much enthusiasm in the traditional buffalo 
charge that is such a distinctive feature of Mexican politics. Still, one 
cannot but marvel at the way in which the entire political elite of a nation of 
90 million inhabitants can rally to the cause of a second-best candidate 
without one single public dissenting voice, simply because a sitting president, 
presiding over a failed presidency, asked them to. 
</P>
<P>
 But along with this impressive show of control, Salinas' handling of the worst 
political crisis in the country's contemporary history also revealed the 
intrinsic and fatal weaknesses of the system. There has been no successful 
presidency in Mexico since Adolfo Lopez Mateos left office in 1964; every other 
administration has ended in discredit, disgrace and disarray. Thus the 
succession mechanism inevitably implies a drastic break between the outgoing 
leader and the incoming one; it's the only way the new leader can overcome the 
opprobrium heaped upon his predecessor. The failed president takes the heat and 
the blame for everything; the new one, whatever his responsibilities in the 
previous administration, acts as if he played no role in the fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Herein lies the reason so many Mexicans of all persuasions, including a 
surprising number of party and government officials, believe that the 
government of Carlos Salinas had something to do with the murder of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. They are wrong: For Salinas, the political consequences and 
emotional impact of the assassination are such that it is inconceivable that 
Colosio's elimination could have been a desired and deliberate solution to any 
imaginable problem. But the tensions between Colosio and Salinas were so 
apparent, were growing so rapidly and extending to so many spheres, that in an 
uninformed and eternally distrustful nation, the suspicions of misdeeds are 
unavoidable. Colosio had to break with Salinas, even had he faced no rivals in 
his quest for the presidency. Facing a strong contender like Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, and having to address the incessant unraveling of Salinas' 
achievements, he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo would have no choice either, all other things being equal -- which 
they are not. He does not have the time, experience or political strength to 
consummate such a tricky maneuver even under ideal circumstances. So, if 
Zedillo cannot break with Salinas, he will try a different tack: Run on 
Colosio's martyred coattails, powered by the "Pedro Infante effect." Infante 
was Mexico's star of stars in the 1940s and '50s, the golden years of the 
Mexican movie industry. When he died in an airplane crash in 1956, the 
outpouring of popular sentiment was extraordinary. Attending his funeral or 
following it on the radio remains a memorable moment in the lives of millions 
of Mexicans. Salinas and the PRI -- the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- 
are seeking to generate a similar groundswell in relation to Colosio, hoping 
they can thus propel Zedillo to victory. It was no accident that Zedillo 
mentioned Colosio 39 times in his 20-minute acceptance speech Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It may work, but the course is a risky one. If the Pedro Infante effect does 
not deliver the votes, the only other option is ominous. It entails playing to 
the Mexican people's fears of instability and violence, and promising order, a 
strong hand and a hard line -- a temptation that every Mexican president has 
encountered but that only Gustavo Diaz Ordaz in 1968 succumbed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico is a country where knowing what the people think or feel is no simple 
task. The sorrow, shock, despair or fear that are supposedly sweeping the 
nation's psyche today are easier to detect in politicians' speeches and 
journalists' cliches than in any palpable signs of popular sentiment. No one 
can tell if the current sympathy for Colosio will last, or whether it is 
transferable to another candidate just because he invokes the martyr's name. 
And there is no certainty that the clamor for law and order is greater than 
that for democracy. Going the low road and seeking to shut down the already 
narrow confines of Mexican democracy means reversing the attempts at true 
electoral reform that the Chiapas uprising has generated. It means risking 
further unrest in the south, as well as post-electoral strife come August. It 
is indeed a non-starter.  
</P>
<P>
 The country is in trouble. The unanimity of the political elite on which its 
authoritarian system has rested for decades has resulted in the absurd 
situation whereby, as Carlos Fuentes has said, there seem to be only two men 
(Salinas and Zedillo) and a ghost (Colosio) who can rule Mexico. A clean 
election and a substantive campaign will not solve all of the country's 
problems; years of negligence and corruption require a lengthy cleanup. But 
they can help, and without them, few things seem possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has for years been a nation where only outcomes count. The time has 
come to begin building a process that makes outcomes largely irrelevant. The 
old process almost certainly is beyond repair.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A GEM IN NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors call Newport Beach the fraud capital of the country, home to 
boiler-room scams in which con men with telephones fleece the unwary. The city 
also hosted the largest embezzlement of school funds in state history -- $4 
million by the school district's then-chief financial officer, who went to 
prison for the theft.However, Newport Beach also has Maria Jimenez, 24, who 
earns $6.20 an hour as a part-time housekeeper at the Newport Beach Marriott 
Hotel. It is lucky to have her, and Shirley Rich Wagner is even luckier. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner stayed at the hotel last weekend and checked out without a bag 
containing jewelry worth about $100,000. When she discovered it missing, her 
reaction was natural: Gone forever. But she did not reckon with Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 The housekeeper found the jewelry bag behind some drapes and took it down to 
the hotel office. 
</P>
<P>
 A hotel spokesman said everyone "is very proud of her," as indeed they should 
be. Jiminez quickly won employee-of-the-month honors, and Wagner said she will 
give her a reward of at least $400. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez lives in Garden Grove and volunteers at a maternal health clinic. Her 
actions provide a refreshing dose of honesty in today's world, and not just for 
Newport Beach, where homes are pricey and a Times Orange County poll last year 
found most residents agreeing that materialism reigns.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we should all be honest all the time. In a perfect world, the 
action of Maria Jimenez would not merit comment. But in the real world, she has 
earned applause.

O.C. PLATFORM; WHY SECRECY IN SHOOTING PROBE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nick Novick is a retired Orange County deputy district attorney with nearly 
19 years of criminal prosecution experience. He comments on the procedures and 
decisions in the case involving the shooting death of Deputy Darryn L. Robins 
by Deputy Brian P. Scanlan during a training exercise. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, my then-supervisor (now Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi) told me 
what types of cases were appropriate for the grand jury. It was a very limited 
and specific category. The Scanlan-Robins' case didn't fit those guidelines in 
any way. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the D.A.'s investigation had obtained in-depth information 
from non-hostile witnesses. It seems to reasonably follow that, since the grand 
jury hearing was not adversarial (Scanlan's attorney would not be present to 
cross-examine witnesses), the D.A. didn't expect any new or startling evidence. 
Why then didn't the D.A.'s office just accept its own professional judgment, 
file a felony complaint and take the matter to preliminary hearing? A judge 
would then make the decision in an adversarial proceeding. Wouldn't such a 
hearing clear the air? Why the secrecy of a grand jury hearing?  
</P>
<P>
 By taking the case to the grand jury, the D.A.'s office was able to have its 
cake and eat it too: After the grand jury refused to return an indictment, the 
D.A. released the results of its investigation. The grand jury transcripts are 
sealed. And the public has no way of knowing what the D.A.'s office presented 
to the grand jury versus the probe evidence that it released to the press. What 
and how strongly did the D.A. argue for an indictment? 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are trained to study and evaluate evidence. As experts, why would 
they defer their judgment to lay persons on the grand jury? To get the feeling 
of what a trial jury would do with it? Hardly! A grand jury hearing can in no 
way be compared to a preliminary one or a jury trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The D.A.'s office felt that a charge of involuntary manslaughter was 
appropriate. So why doesn't it now file the appropriate charge? Did the case go 
to the grand jury because the hearing records would be sealed? 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's and D.A.'s office postured about a clean investigation. Yet 
sheriff's officials sat in on the D.A.'s probe. And the D.A.'s investigator 
left the room during the questioning of Scanlan and the sheriff's investigator 
then questioned Scanlan. Is that what we label an independent probe?  
</P>
<P>
 The public has the right to have this case handled like most all felonies are, 
and to have the many questions cleared. The D.A.'s office should file the 
charge that it had requested from the grand jury and take the matter to 
preliminary hearing.

DUCKS' HOPES FOR PLAYOFFS DIM; NHL: ANAHEIM LOSES TO EDMONTON, 3-2, IN 
OVERTIME. SAN JOSE NEEDS ONLY THREE MORE POINTS TO CLINCH PLAYOFF BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This season of learning for the Mighty Ducks is almost over, and this will be 
one of their final lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what it feels like to be in a playoff race: highlights from San Jose's 
game on the scoreboard, goal-by-goal updates, your fans cheering every San Jose 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is what it feels like to thwart your own hopes, losing to the 
last-place Edmonton Oilers in overtime, 3-2, after leading with five minutes 
left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Jason Arnott scored his 31st goal of the season on a rebound at 1:44 of 
the extra period to lift the Oilers -- and backup goalie Fred Brathwaite, who 
won for the first time this season, in his 13th game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks thought they had a chance to cut San Jose's lead for the final 
Western Conference playoff spot to six points Thursday, but instead they fell 
10 out with only six games left after losing in front of 17,174 at The Pond of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose, meanwhile, is sprinting toward the finish line with a seven-game 
unbeaten streak (5-0-2). The Sharks pulled off a come-from-behind victory 
against Toronto while the Ducks and Oilers were playing. 
</P>
<P>
 'We pretty much dominated the third period, but at crunch time we made some 
bonehead plays," Coach Ron Wilson said. "We blew two points, not just one. We 
blew two." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks now need only three points to clinch the final Western Conference 
playoff spot. Even if the Ducks win all six of their remaining games, San Jose 
only needs a victory and a tie in its last six to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks took a 2-1 lead at 13:34 of the third period on Joe Sacco's rising 
slap shot from the right circle after he used his speed to get open. But the 
Oilers came right back at 15:47 when Steve Rice reached around goalie Guy 
Hebert, who had already gone down, to push in a rebound and tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have much energy tonight it seemed to me," Wilson said. "But it 
shouldn't have even gone to overtime. (Anatoli Semenov) has got to get the puck 
out and Guy can't let a rebound sit right there." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was scoreless until late in the second period, and it was not a 
scintillating stalemate. The Ducks were probably tired after an emotional 
victory over the Kings the night before, and the Oilers are the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oilers scored first, when Kirk Maltby made a backhand pass with his 
back to the net, and Arnott managed to put the puck past Hebert while falling 
down. The goal put Edmonton up, 1-0, at 17:47 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks tied the score with 19 seconds left in the second when Stephan 
Lebeau scored in a scramble after Don McSween threw the puck in front and it 
came to Lebeau on the left side of the net off the stick of Bobby Dollas. 
</P>
<P>
 Brathwaite was hurt on the play when a teammate ran into him and left the ice. 
But the injury proved to be only a torn fingernail, and he returned for the 
third -- and the overtime. He finished with 32 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a lot of courage to play after what happened to him," Oiler Coach 
Glen Sather said. "He said it was OK, but it must have really bothered him. It 
looked pretty wicked. If you've ever slammed your finger in a door, that's what 
it was like." Duck notes 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Mighty Ducks make the playoffs, Coach Ron Wilson is expected to 
coach the U.S. team in the World Championships April 25-May 8 in Italy, General 
Manager Jack Ferreira said. Wilson holds dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship. . 
. . Ferreira said his gut feeling now is that Paul Kariya will start his 
professional career on the other side of the Atlantic. "I'm saying what I think 
he'll do is go to Europe. I think that's what he's thinking." The Ducks are 
millions apart on a multiyear contract proposal with Kariya, the fourth pick 
overall last June, and the sides don't plan to talk again until the World 
Championships. "The lines are open, but I don't think the phone's going to 
ring," Ferreira said. . . . Saturday's home game against Toronto is a rare 5 
p.m. start in order to stagger traffic because of the Freeway Series game at 
Anaheim Stadium.

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; WOODBRIDGE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHOW IRVINE WHO'S NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 There was a certain glee in the faces of Woodbridge players as they ripped 
down a banner that had hung next to their dugout for seven long innings. 
</P>
<P>
 It read, "Irvine No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-ranked Warriors scored three runs in the top of the seventh inning to 
complete a 7-4 come-from-behind victory over Irvine in what is typically the 
most crucial game in the Sea View League race. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it lost a little luster with Tustin's victory over Irvine (5-7, 2-2) 
on Tuesday, the two rivals still must beat the other in order to win the league 
title. Last year, they shared it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important game we'll play all season," said Woodbridge 
shortstop Carrie Brown, a senior who said she was nervous before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior Coach Alan Dugard noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out very tight," Dugard said. "We have a young club (three 
freshmen, two sophomores in the starting lineup) and they tend to be nervous, 
as they were today." 
</P>
<P>
 So nervous that, after taking a 1-0 lead, they surrendered three runs in the 
bottom of the first inning and another in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had seven runs, 14 hits and 11 runners left on base in the first 3 
1/2 innings. It wasn't until the bottom of the fifth inning that a side 
(Irvine's) went down in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had 10 hits. Brown and Ashley Boone had three apiece for Woodbridge 
(12-3, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine got two hits from Shye Nakabayashi, Natalie Tomoguchi and Kim Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugard said the turning point for Woodbridge took place in the fourth inning. 
With two outs, Alison Johnsen walked and stole her way to third base; freshman 
Liz Lemire then sliced a single to right field to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisive seventh-inning rally took place with one out. Keri Byrd and Boone 
singled and Courtney Spelber was hit by a pitch. Brown singled off the 
shortstop's glove, scoring Byrd and Boone, and Spelber scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugard had meant for Brown (three for four, three RBIs) to bat fifth instead 
of sixth, but the wrong lineup was given to the umpire before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fortuitous," Dugard said. "She was in the right spot." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Sea View League game: 
</P>
<P>
 University 3, Tustin 2 -- Corby Bouchard pitched a four-hitter and Carrie Kirk 
was two for three with two RBIs for University (6-7, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunset League: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 7, Rosary 2 (15) -- Kathy Ponce pitched the entire 15 innings, 
striking out a career-high 17 and issuing one walk for Ocean View. Lisa Pasa 
caught what might have been the game-winning home run when she reaching over 
the left field fence and snatched the ball. Rosary drops to 3-3, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Olympic League: 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalry Chapel 7, Orange Lutheran 6 -- Freshman pitcher Keri Prezygocki got 
her first victory, giving up only one earned run and striking out five. Calvary 
Chapel improved to 5-9, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nonleague game: 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 5, Trabuco Hills 4 -- Dana Gulick had two hits, two stolen bases and 
an RBI and Misty Lauby was two for three and pitched the final 3 2/3 innings to 
record the victory for El Toro (9-7).

UPPER DECK BASEBALL TOURNAMENT; TROY MISSES CHANCES, GOES DOWN SWINGING TO 
COOPER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After opening the season with seven consecutive victories, Troy High earned 
the top spot in the county sportswriters' baseball poll this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the Warriors did not fare as they hoped in the Upper Deck 
Classic, they showed some of the the best teams in the nation just how 
competitive things are in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy was defeated by Cooper City (Fla.), 4-3, Thursday at Cal State Fullerton 
in an eventful consolation final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (9-2), who were 2-2 in the tournament, had a chance to tie the 
score in the top of the seventh inning after senior Trevor Brown (two for 
three) tripled with two out. But Cowboy junior right-hander Anthony Rodriguez, 
who entered the game in the seventh and struck out the first two batters he 
faced, induced Troy senior Rick Parmenter to ground out to second, ending the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was credited with his first save, securing the victory for senior 
left-hander David Gates (1-0). Gates took over for junior right-handed starter 
Chad Fitzgerald, who was yanked after only two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Fitzgerald walked the bases loaded in the second, but, as was the case 
throughout the game, the clutch hit eluded the Warriors. Troy right-handed 
senior starter Greg Western hit into a force play, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 3-1, entering the fifth, Troy scored twice to tie the score. The 
Warriors, however, again left the bases loaded. Troy, which outhit Cooper City, 
10-5, stranded 10 runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper City (15-5), which was 3-1 in the tournament, scored the go-ahead run 
in the fifth off of junior right-handed reliever Kevin Gray (4-1). Cowboy 
junior Anthony Coloca drove in junior Charlie Cifarelli from third with a 
groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared as though Troy might tie the score in the sixth when Western, who 
remained in the game to hit, opened the inning on third after his single and a 
two-base error by Cooper City left fielder Nick Parella. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Gates threw a pitch to the next batter, Troy senior leadoff man Nick 
Ruzzi, senior catcher Jose Rivera's return throw caromed off Gates' closed 
glove and rolled to his right. Western broke for the plate but was nailed at 
home on a perfect throw by shortstop Ray Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We teach our kids to be aggressive and think on their own," Troy Coach Dane 
Ilertsen said. "Their shortstop made a perfect throw, but it was still the 
right play." 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship game: 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Bernardo 12, Mission Bay 7 -- Rancho Bernardo, ranked third in the USA 
Today preseason poll, won the match-up of San Diego area-teams. Mission Bay was 
ranked fourth is in the same poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 6, Clovis 2 -- Jeff Moore and Ryan Reyes hit home runs for El Dorado 
(10-3). Moore's third-inning two-run home run gave El Dorado a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Tucson Canyon del Oro 6, Mater Dei 5 (8) -- Russ Brown's two-out single in the 
bottom of the eighth drove in pinch-runner Chris Grissom with the winning run 
for Canyon del Oro at Amerige Park. Matt Treanor's first-inning grand slam gave 
Mater Dei (9-4-1) a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 8, Brooklyn Xaverian (N.Y.) 2 -- Jason Webb had four hits and three 
RBIs to lead the host Aztecs (6-7).

PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; NO. 1 EL TORO ROLLS PAST DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Toro boys' volleyball Coach Mike Jagd couldn't have planned it better. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he was at a loss for words after the Chargers, ranked No. 1 in Orange 
County, dismantled third-ranked Dana Hills, 17-15, 15-6, 15-7, in a South Coast 
League match Thursday at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stunned," Jagd said. "But if we pass well, we can beat anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't an ordinary victory for the Chargers . . . they dominated the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in control the whole match," Dana Hills Coach Oz Simmons said. 
"We'd have a string of errors and then we were playing catch-up all night." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro's Ryan Mariano, a 6-foot-3 outside hitter, had 19 kills and four 
blocks and Doug Thompson had 12 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Chargers neutralized Dana Hills' bigger players, holding 6-5 
Jeremy Darner to 10 kills, and 6-8 Bob Hefty and 6-4 Matt Clem to nine each. 
</P>
<P>
 But most importantly, the Chargers passed well and setter Todd Steinert, who 
had 47 assists, piloted an efficient attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd did a spectacular job tonight," Jagd said. "He was our MVP. We had Dana 
Hills scouted well and we knew where they were going to be; Todd got the ball 
to the right people." 
</P>
<P>
 The right person was Mariano in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills played El Toro tough in the first game, and led, 15-14, after Clem 
blocked a spike attempt by Mariano. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinert went right back to Mariano, whose spike from the right side gave 
the Chargers the side out. Mariano then drew the Chargers even, 15-15, with a 
block and gave them a 16-15 lead with a spike from the back row. 
</P>
<P>
 Clem missed a spike long on game point and the Dolphins never got any closer. 
</P>
<P>
 In another South Coast League match: 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 3, Mater Dei 0 -- Gabe Gardner had 11 kills for the Tritons (6-0, 
2-0), who won 16-14, 15-2, 16-14. Mark Pozsgai had 17 kills for Mater Dei (2-5, 
0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 3, Rancho Alamitos 0 -- Trung Khuu had five aces for La Quinta (6-3, 
5-1), which won 15-12, 15-6, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove 3, Los Amigos 0 -- Greg Blackner had 21 kills and setter Alber 
Cardenas had 35 assists for Garden Grove (3-5, 3-2), which upset Los Amigos 
(4-1 in league), 17-15, 15-7, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica 3, Santiago 1 -- Ian Cheesman had 20 kills, Josh Pagtalunan had 16 
and Mike Parsons had 15 for Pacifica (2-5, 2-3) in a 15-9, 15-6, 14-16, 15-4 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sea View League: 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 3, Irvine 2 -- Junior Nathan Bennett had 30 kills and Steve Jobes 
added 18 for Woodbridge (4-4, 4-2), which won 11-15, 6-15, 15-9, 15-12, 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunset League: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 3, Servite 0 -- Nate Martin had 12 kills and eight blocks and Mike 
Carney added nine kills and eight blocks for Ocean View (3-4, 2-3), which won 
15-2, 16-14, 15-9.

PREP SWIMMING ROUNDUP; EL TORO GETS DOUBLE VICTORY OVER MISSION VIEJO

<P>
 It was apparent from the first race that there would be no blowout at this 
swim meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for the girls' and boys' teams, the winner of the South Coast League 
meet between El Toro and Mission Viejo at El Toro Thursday was determined by 
the last event -- the 400 freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our girls swam to the occasion. They have great heart," El Toro girls' Coach 
Sheri Ross said after the relay team of Alice Park, Christine Kennedy, Lindsey 
Rock and Katie Lowes finished first in 3 minutes 39.02 seconds and won the 
meet, 85-84. 
</P>
<P>
 With both teams losing their top swimmers, Katie Simmons of El Toro and Cheryl 
Murphy of Mission Viejo, to the U.S. Nationals this week in Washington state, 
both coaches were hesitant about making predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 And although El Toro (6-0, 1-0) took a slight lead early and held on to it 
throughout most of the meet, it was the 100 breaststroke that turned the things 
upside down, with Mission Viejo's Carrie Gamel and Carrie Williams taking first 
and second, giving the Diablos a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost got them," Mission Viejo Coach Mike Pelton said. "But I really had 
expected this meet to be a close one. After all, we have two of the county's 
best swim teams competing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a similar situation for the boys' meet, which El Toro won, 88-81. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers held a one-point lead over Mission Viejo before the 400 freestyle 
relay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that whether we won this meet or not depended on me," El Toro senior 
Ian Pyka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyka anchored the relay, swimming his leg in 46.95 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody thought it would be an easy meet," he said. "And before (the meet) 
started, I really didn't know if we could win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pyka, Terry Dougherty and Jay Reaves were key figures for the Chargers (5-1, 
1-0). All were double winners. Pyka won the 50 freestyle (22.07) and the 100 
butterfly (54.47). Dougherty took the 200 individual medley (2:00.28) and the 
500 freestyle in a personal-best time of 4:51.29, and Reaves won the 200 
freestyle (1:47.87) and the 100 breaststroke (1:00.36). 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a fun meet," El Toro boys' Coach Jeff Grosse said. "But I know we'll 
be at it again in league finals." 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague boys' swimming: 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills 93, Edison 77 -- Cory Tague won the 200 freestyle (1:52.52) and 
100 backstroke (55.49) for host Edison (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague girls' swimming: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 121, Trabuco Hills 50 -- Mona Khamis won the 50 freestyle (27.32) and 
100 backstroke (1:06.92) to lead host Edison (4-1).

NOTRE DAME RAGGEDY IN 4-3 SETBACK; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: IN ST. PAUL 
TOURNAMENT, KNIGHTS MAKE FOUR ERRORS AND DON'T HIT IN CLUTCH WHILE LOSING TO LA 
MIRADA.

<P>
 What figured to be a relatively easy victory for Notre Dame High in the first 
round of the St. Paul baseball tournament on Thursday turned out to be an ugly 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (8-2) looked sloppy and lacked the kind of offensive power that 
has made them so successful this season. The result was a 4-3 loss to La 
Mirada, which started a sophomore pitcher in his first varsity appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame committed four errors and left men on base in six innings. That 
included what could have been the tying and winning runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 With Notre Dame trailing, 4-3, Rich Igou led off the seventh for the Knights 
by drawing a walk. After two fly outs, Allen Jerkens singled to left, but first 
baseman Chris Crowley hit a deep fly to center to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bats were down," Notre Dame Coach Tom Dill said. "But I think the real 
difference here was defense. They were hitting easy ground balls and we 
couldn't get them." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada scored the winning run on a throwing error by Jerkens in the top of 
the seventh. With two out and the score tied, La Mirada's Greg Rudiger hit a 
grounder that Jerkens scooped up and threw about a foot in front of Crowley. La 
Mirada's Jeff Nicolini, who led off with a single, scored from third on the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadores got two additional runs -- in the second and fifth innings -- on 
Notre Dame errors. Their only earned run came in the first when catcher Jeff 
Hallock drove in Rudiger with a double to center.  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame starting pitcher Andy Lutz went six innings. The left-handed junior 
gave up six hits, struck out five and walked two. Freshman Juan Montes (0-1) 
took the loss for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights scored in the first on Jon Lichterman's run-scoring single. In the 
fourth, Ryan Benner scored from third when La Mirada first baseman Brett 
Darnell missed Jabbar Craigwell's soft grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley drove in the tying run with a two-out single to left in the fifth. 
Lichterman, who had singled to center, scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallock went three for three for La Mirada with two doubles and an RBI. 
Nicolini went two for two. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore left-hander Ben Orr pitched the first four innings for La Mirada. 
Jereme Garza, who worked the fifth and sixth, earned the victory and Hallock 
got the save.

 Jon Gardikis' fly-ball single in the 11th inning gave host Fullerton a 15-14 
victory over Santa Clara Mission Thursday in the first round of the Fullerton 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The single completed a comeback for the persistent Hornets, who trailed, 11-4, 
after six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton scored five times in the seventh, two in the eighth and three in the 
ninth to tie the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth inning, Jim Sebreros reached on catcher's interference with one 
out. One out later, Andre Robinson singled and Gardikis followed with an RBI 
single to cut the lead to two, 14-12. Erickson Dumaual singled up the middle to 
drive in Robinson.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER; AFTER LANDING JOB AT KANSAS, REES DECIDES THERE'S 
NO PLACE LIKE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing happened to former UCLA assistant football coach Bill Rees 
recently on his way to Lawrence, Kan., to begin a job as recruiting coordinator 
at Kansas: He wound up back home in Manhattan Beach as West Coast scout for the 
Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years as the architect of UCLA's nationally recognized football 
recruiting success, Rees, a Chicago native, agreed to take a similar position 
at Kansas. He booked a flight to Kansas City for March 17, and was set to begin 
his new job the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before leaving his office at UCLA for the final time March 15, the Chiefs 
called and Rees fulfilled a goal of working in the player personnel department 
for a National Football League team. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to establishing the Bruins as a national recruiting power, 
regularly competing for (and signing) players against the likes of Notre Dame, 
Michigan, Ohio State and Texas, Rees was in charge of all in-state evaluations 
for the program. Before the start of last season, more players (38) from UCLA 
appeared on NFL rosters than any other school in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among current NFL players Rees personally signed during his tenure at UCLA 
were Troy Aikman and Frank Cornish (Dallas), Mike Lodish (Buffalo), Eric Ball 
(Cincinnati), Carlton Gray (Seattle), David Richards (Detroit), Kevin Williams 
(Green Bay), plus brothers Mel and Mike Farr, and a probable first-round draft 
choice from the current Bruin roster, junior tackle Jonathan Ogden of 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees said numerous rules changes adopted by the NCAA in recent years to limit 
recruiting and the evaluation process has seriously curtailed the ability of 
college football coaches to make accurate judgments before signing players. 
There are tighter-than-ever restrictions on in-person evaluations, telephone 
calls and campus visits. Thus, most recruiting coordinators now spend more time 
watching game film than games. It is the games -- the UCLA games, that is -- 
that Rees will miss most. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA was always a dream school to be associated with," Rees said. "I was 
fortunate to be part of perhaps the best era in UCLA football history, with an 
opportunity to work for one of the great coaches in college football, Terry 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'll miss most is the UCLA-USC rivalry -- the great games, the great 
players, the intensity and the atmosphere. It's the best rivalry in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football: UCLA has completed its football recruiting with the signing of 
cornerback Aaron Roques (6-0, 180). Roques was a star at Canyon Springs High in 
Moreno Valley three years ago, attracting attention from a number of colleges, 
including UCLA, before he signed a letter of intent with Nevada. However, he 
opted for professional baseball instead of college football. Last year, Roques, 
an outfielder, batted .165 in 32 games for Peoria, Ariz., a rookie league team 
in the San Diego Padres' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball: Jelani Gardner, Bellflower St. John Bosco's heavily recruited 6-6 
point guard, will announce his college choice April 15, two days after the 
spring signing period begins. Gardner has narrowed his list to UCLA, Arkansas 
and California. He left Tuesday for New York, where he will play in the 
McDonald's All-American high school basketball game Sunday at St. John's. 
Gardner is one of two California players selected for the game; the other is 
Duke signee Rick Price, a 6-5 guard from Gardena Serra. Gardner and Price will 
also play in Magic Johnson's high school all-star game April 10 in Auburn 
Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add UCLA: The Bruins also are recruiting Brandon Jessie, the 6-5, 215-pound 
forward from Ventura College who was voted the California community college 
co-player of the year (with Jamie Townsend of Columbia), and Jerod Ward, a 6-8 
forward from Clinton, Miss., who is the consensus choice among coaches and 
talent evaluators as the nation's No. 1 prospect. Jessie is considering Duke, 
Arizona State, Georgetown, Nevada Las Vegas and UCLA. He is still undecided 
about whether to take an official visit to UCLA. Ward, a shooter with unlimited 
range, took an unofficial trip to Mississippi last weekend. He has also visited 
UCLA (his cousin, Annett Buckner, plays volleyball for the Bruins) and Cal, and 
taken another unofficial trip to Ohio State (he has relatives in that area, 
too). In addition, Ward is scheduled to visit Kentucky and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC, with two scholarships available, is hoping to sign 6-6 swingman Joe 
Zaletel, an excellent shooter from El Camino College who averaged 28.2 points 
per game last season, second-best in the state behind Darryle Flicking (29.4) 
of Riverside. Zaletel, a sophomore from Torrance High who also attended Harbor 
College, has visited USC and Arizona State, and may take trips to Hawaii and 
Washington State. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tes Whitlock, a 6-4 guard from Saddleback College, is considering New Mexico 
State, Long Beach State and Pepperdine, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the top high school guard prospects in Southern California, 6-3 Jamie 
Gillin of Compton Dominguez and 6-1 Jason Pickett of Wilmington Banning, may be 
close to announcing their college choices.  
</P>
<P>
 Gillin will probably sign with Washington State, while Pickett, if he 
qualifies academically, will likely attend George Mason University in Fairfax, 
Va., which is coached by former Laker and Loyola Marymount Coach Paul Westhead. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Another Southland guard, 6-1 Sam Turks of Inglewood, recently gave a verbal 
commitment to Utah.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: FOR BOLEN, IT'S WORTH THE WEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some baseball coaches wince at the talk of weightlifting.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, they say, is a sport of precision and grace, not brawn.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell Art Bolen, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolen, Hueneme High's first baseman, attributes his transformation from 
light-hitting reserve to slugging starter to weighlifting, plenty of batting 
practice and more weighlifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolen guessed he hit about .180 last year, playing sparingly. But he has grown 
an inch and added 15 pounds of muscle this season, and was hitting .536 as the 
week began. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just made up his mind that he wanted to have a successful senior year and 
he's been doing that," Coach Reg Welker said. "He's done a lot of work in the 
weight room, and it's showing at the bat." CHANNEL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Clutch Performances 
</P>
<P>
 To say that Buena left fielder Rick Guzman is a clutch hitter would be an 
understatement. The Bulldogs are 5-3, and Guzman has had the key hit in three 
of the victories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 4 at Chaminade, he singled in the winning run in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 10 at Chatsworth, he drove in a pair of runs with two out in the 
sixth, pulling Buena even in a game it would eventually win, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 18 in the league opener against Rio Mesa, he started Buena's comeback 
from a 6-1 deficit with a three-run home run in the fourth. The Bulldogs won, 
13-9. FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 No-Hitter for No-Hitters 
</P>
<P>
 What better remedy for a team that isn't hitting than a no-hit game by its ace 
pitcher? 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs senior Mike Bassett held Canyon hitless last week with eight 
strikeouts and two walks in the league opener for Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 1-0 victory. The Indians scraped together a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the no-hitter, we managed only three hits," Burroughs Coach Jose 
Valle said. "We've faced some really good pitching. But still, we're not taking 
good swings." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassett (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) brought an 8.15 earned-run average into the 
game after losses to Long Beach Wilson, Crespi and Montclair Prep. FRONTIER 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Blown Away 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara Coach Tom Humphreys said last week's softball victory at home over 
Moorpark was a survival act. Both teams were nearly blown off the field by 
strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 20 years in the Navy, I've seen some gale-force winds," Humphreys said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't recall anything like this: 20 to 30 m.p.h., with stinging sand in 
your face. It was hard (for the pitchers) to throw any rise balls or any 
breaking balls because they would really take off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a towering fly ball to the outfield, but the wind blew it back to the 
infield. I've never been in a game like this in my entire life." 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the result? A typical low-scoring game? A no-hitter, maybe? No. 
Santa Clara won, 9-7, after Moorpark rallied for seven runs in the top of the 
seventh inning. MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-Hit Average? 
</P>
<P>
 Poly's Jerry Delgado is batting a paltry .238, but sometimes averages don't 
tell the entire story, according to Poly Coach Chuck Schwal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hits the ball hard," Schwal said. "He leads the team in hard-hit average." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwal actually keeps a "hard-hit average" for his players so he doesn't 
mistakenly take an unlucky hitter out of the lineup because of a mediocre 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his batting average, Delgadao isn't likely to get bumped from the 
lineup.  
</P>
<P>
 All five of his hits have been doubles and he leads the team in runs batted in 
with six. NORTHEAST LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Home Run Parade 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills Coach John Vera is delighted that his team has hit eight home 
runs in seven games. The second-year mentor said he doesn't know how many 
homers the Dons hit last year, but he's certain it was fewer than eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hitting real well right now," he said. "We don't have to rely on the 
home runs, but hopefully it can continue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons hit three homers against Hollywood last week, including a game-winner 
by Kevin McCormick in the ninth inning of an 8-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Dons can't keep pace with the school's softball team. The defending 
3-A champions have hit 13 home runs in eight games. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Jackpot 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake baseball team did something unusual this week. The Warriors went 
to Las Vegas, fell behind, and left as winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they trailed in all five games they played, the Warriors won the 
Blazer Invitational. In the championship game Wednesday, Westlake trailed Las 
Vegas, 6-3, before scoring four runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (9-3) allowed only 13 runs in the first four games, qualifying for 
the championship game ahead of Los Alamitos, which was also undefeated in pool 
play. The Warriors allowed fewer runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching was handled primarily by Chris Flanagan (2-0 in the tournament), 
Todd Singleton (1-0 with a save in the championship game), and Rick Davidson 
(1-0) and Scott Morris (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The leading hitter was Joe Primack, who was eight for 13 with six runs batted 
in. Primack drove in the winning runs in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel pretty good," Coach Rich Herrera said. "We racked up some wins and we 
did some good things. We came back when we had to. We had timely hitting, 
timely pitching. We played as a unit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura has some of the nation's top high school swimmers on its team, which 
creates an interesting problem for Coach Jason Rosenthal. His swimmers 
sometimes miss important league meets because they're off competing on a 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's U.S. Junior National championships claimed several swimmers, who 
missed a league meet against Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Without teammates Christine DiSpaltro and Vanessa Parker, Erin Schatz led the 
Agoura girls to a 106-66 victory over the Highlanders. Swimming without Nathan 
Reese, Chris Zendejas and Harvey Wilford, the boys lost, 133-51. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to deal with missing people sometimes," Rosenthal said. "We knew 
it was going to happen but the girls came through real well. I think it showed 
how deep our girls' team is." WESTSIDE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Wait Till Next Year 
</P>
<P>
 All Tim Stange needed was one more player. Stange was hired as athletic 
director last year by West Valley Christian, a private school with 40 students 
at the high school level, with the goal of fielding a baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms and equipment were purchased. The Seekers even got a transfer, junior 
Matt Berkins from Canoga Park.  
</P>
<P>
 But on the first day of practice only eight players showed up and Stange was 
forced to cancel the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm just watching the softball team, working with Matt and getting ready 
for next year," Stange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year looks more promising for West Valley Christian. More than 30 
eighth-grade students join the high school next season, compared to the 10 who 
will graduate. Around the Leagues . . .

<P>
 * Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill leaped 23 feet 10 1/2 inches in the long jump in 
Saturday's Beverly Hills Invitational to move to ninth on the all-time regional 
list in that event. The record of 25-5 1/2 was set by Percy Knox of Antelope 
Valley in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sophomore left-hander Micah Weathers of Thousand Oaks pitched a one-hitter 
Monday against Wilson in the Thousand Oaks tournament. In his first two varsity 
starts, Weathers has given up one run. Teammate Tim Baron had his streak of 25 
innings without allowing an earned run snapped by El Camino Real the same day. 
Baron (4-0, 0.24 earned-run average) still won the game, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newbury Park right-hander Keith Smith (4-1) suffered his first loss when El 
Camino Real beat him, 2-1, on Monday in the Thousand Oaks tournament. Smith 
pitched a three-hitter, but the Conquistadores scored both runs on groundouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newbury Park pitchers have allowed 2.7 runs per game through 13 games. 
Discount a 14-6 loss to El Dorado in the Loara tournament, and the Panthers 
have allowed only 1.8 runs with three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Junior right-hander Hugo De La Torre of Poly is making the most of his first 
varsity season. De La Torre has not allowed a run in 22 innings. He has allowed 
11 hits and seven walks with 21 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * A consecutive hitting streak by Camarillo's Jake Spahr ended at six last 
week when he grounded out in his first at-bat against Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo walked 12 batters in its first two Marmonte League games. Nine of 
the runners scored. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley recently got its revenge on Royal right-hander David Vicari, who 
was the only pitcher to beat the Pioneers in a Marmonte League game last 
season. The Pioneers won, 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Lutheran catcher James Griffin stole eight bases in a game last Friday 
against Providence. Griffin, a converted center fielder, has 14 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Bonaventure has a team batting average of .317, led by Les Ybarra 
(.520). The Seraphs also carry a 2.41 team ERA. So why are they only 5-4? In 
nine games, they have committed 31 errors. High Marks 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo cleared a region record 7 feet 4 inches in the 
high jump in Saturday's Santa Barbara Easter Relays at Santa Barbara City 
College.

A WILD QUARTER ON WALL STREET; STOCKS SURVIVE A ROLLER COASTER DAY; DOW TAKES A 
BEATING, BUT CLOSES SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seesawing through another volatile session Thursday, stocks closed mixed, with 
the Dow Jones average rebounding from an initial plunge to finish higher for 
the first time in six sessions, aided by lower long-term bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials managed to eke out a gain after renewed buying surfaced in 
the late going. Buyers favored stocks of big-name companies that had been 
battered during the market's recent downturn, which helped the Dow industrials 
edge up 9.21 to 3,635.96. At one point during the morning, the average had been 
down more than 65 points. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the blue-chip gauge has lost 138.77 points since last Friday, the 
worst week's showing since a 216.26-point descent during the week ended Oct. 
13, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which had been up early in the day 
to a high for the year of 7.15%, retreated to 7.08%, compared to 7.10% at 
Tuesday's close. A week ago, the yield closed at 6.95%. The bond's price, which 
moves inversely to the yield, was up 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was brisk as market participants adjusted holdings on the closing day 
of the first quarter and took positions ahead of the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market will be closed for Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several broader market indicators also ended with deficits, and losers 
outnumbered gainers about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board 
volume amounted to 399.30 million shares, for the busiest day since 446 million 
shares were traded on March 18 -- a triple-witching expiration date. On 
Wednesday, 390.52 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE composite index fell 0.28 to 247.06, leaving it 9.23 lower in the 
week; The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index crept 0.22 higher to 445.77, but 
still ended down 14.81 for the week. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller issues slipped 1.45 to 743.45 and tumbled 40.00 in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Waves of computer-guided selling periodically washed over the market, at one 
time dragging down the Dow industrials more than 67 points. 
</P>
<P>
 As has happened on several occasions lately, the NYSE was forced to invoke its 
restriction on a form of computerized trading. The regulation, adopted after 
the market crash of October, 1987, is intended to cope with hectic market 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were breathing a sigh of relief at the end of the day," said Don Hays, 
investment strategist at Wheat First-Butcher & Singer. "But the downturn may 
not necessarily be over. The market is trying to hit bottom, but there's no 
real evidence that that's the case yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks opened on a steadier note after the previous session's setback, which 
plunged the market to levels not seen since last autumn, seemed to lure buyers 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the selective buying was replaced by selling within the first half hour of 
trading, as the bond market reacted negatively to a report from the Chicago 
Purchasing Management Assn. that showed improved conditions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The report reinforced the inflation fears that have hammered the market in 
recent weeks. Stronger economic growth can aggravate inflation, which erodes 
the value of fixed interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggravating the price decline, some managers of investment funds sold 
seven-year and 10-year Treasury notes to minimize their losses in 
mortgage-based securities, said Frank Sannella, money market analyst at 
Technical Data in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Treasury bond market regained ground, partly because the tumbling 
stock market reassured some traders that investors would seek fixed-income 
securities as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term treasuries fell 1/32 point and intermediate maturities rose 1/16 
point to 1/4 point, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Other economic news, including the government's revised reading on the gross 
domestic product, had a neutral impact on the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the minor gain in the Dow industrials, market analysts said the hectic 
action represented a continuation of the selloff that started when the Federal 
Reserve began nudging up interest rates in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Board's list of active stocks was studded with big names, many of 
which turned up in afternoon action. Chrysler headed the list. It rose 1 1/4 to 
51 7/8, while IBM jumped 1 to 54 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold stocks gained along with the price of the metal, which rose on the New 
York Comex to $391.80 an ounce, up $5.90, on concerns over unrest in South 
Africa and safe-haven buying in reaction to the stock market selloff. Silver 
climbed 14.5 cents to $5.785 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Battle Mountain Gold rose 3/4 to 12; Newmont Mining gained 3/4 to 57 3/8; 
Homestake Mining added 3/4 to 22 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software Toolworks led the Nasdaq's most-active list, rising 4 3/8 to 14 
3/8. It agreed to be acquired by British-based Pearson Plc. -- another in the 
recent rash of software industry deals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pyramid Technology fell 4 3/4 to 7. Two Wall Street firms downgraded the 
stock to "hold" from "buy" after the company warned of a "substantial loss" for 
its second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cambridge Biotech slightly more than halved its stock value, down 1-7/16 to 
1/3/8. Late Wednesday, it said its auditors had resigned and withdrawn their 
financial opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the session, the dollar sustained heavy losses as it followed the 
stock market into a steep dive. But as the market recovered, so did the 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crude oil futures rose for a third straight day on the New York 
Merc, as the market continued to rebound from sharp losses on Monday. Light, 
sweet crude for May delivery rose 41 cents to $14.79 a barrel.

<P>
 Kia is the name of a Korean car maker. Pronounced Kee-ah , it is not one of 
those terra-cotta piglets sprouting green stuff and living in Christmas infamy 
as the gift that keeps on dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia's maiden model in America is the Sephia. Pronounced So-fee-ya as in Loren, 
there is no further resemblance between this vehicle and anything Italian, 
daunting or desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Kia Sephia does resemble is a fairly priced, adequately equipped, 
quite roomy, nicely styled subcompact sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is 1994, the Year of the Tyke, when little cars deliver big things, 
basic automotive technology is high, and the values of entry-level sedans are 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, many bargain-basement subcompacts come with standard passenger- 
and driver-side air bags. The Sephia -- which goes on sale next month at 17 
Southern California dealerships -- regresses to door-mounted shoulder straps 
that restrain occupants by strangulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's Tercel, Ford's Escort and other pocket autos offer optional anti-lock 
brakes. Kia's Sephia does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's Civic is available with four engines and up to 125 horsepower. The 
Sephia offers one pallid four-banger developing 88-horsepower, which makes 
freeway access the ultimate adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Its base price of $8,495 does not include automatic transmission, power 
steering, air conditioning or even a two-speaker radio. 
</P>
<P>
 For $480 more, you can buy a equally naked Dodge/Plymouth Neon. But standard 
on Neon are two air bags, a 132-horsepower engine, and more head and rear leg 
room than a stagecoach. Neon is more power, 30% better fuel economy and perkier 
looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining the undersides and insides of Sephia sets a new high in deja vu . 
Beneath hood and body panels are the obsolete front-drive engine and 
transmission of the 1992 Mazda MX-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping all negatives, however, is the mind-set of American consumers. They 
believe that Korea manufactures quality textiles and electronics, but not fine, 
reliable automobiles. The rise and crash of hapless Hyundai -- from sales of 
260,000 in 1988 to currently less than half that -- only confirmed that view. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kia -- despite its 50-year background in building bicycles, motorcycles, 
cars and trucks in Korea -- acknowledges that it is sledding uphill. The 
executive litany, to the media and at auto shows, is that no one knows Kia or 
the car, no one needs them and no one wants to hear from them. 
</P>
<P>
 But . . . they also say that by moving heaven and Detroit to re-establish the 
reliability of a Korean car, by coddling customers with a 24-hour roadside 
assistance program, by emphasizing value and taking the war out of warranties, 
Kia may come to mean more than Killed in Action. 
</P>
<P>
 Sephia will be marketed in three versions, all with the odd yet desirable perk 
of a theft alarm as standard equipment. The base RS is about as bare as small 
cars get, without even wheel covers or visor mirrors. LS models include power 
and tilt steering, deluxe carpeting, tachometer and clock. Top of the line GS 
has power windows and locks, remote trunk and fuel-flap release, four-speaker 
sound system and power steering. 
</P>
<P>
 But add air conditioning, alloy wheels and cruise control, and the price of a 
GS nudges $13,000. That's just a whisker from the price of a Ford Mustang coupe 
with V-6 power, two air bags and power steering. 
</P>
<P>
 Our test vehicle was a Sephia GS with four-speed automatic and overdrive. 
Nothing was memorable about any portion of the vehicle, its looks or 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 It wore 13-inch wheels -- Toyota Corolla and Saturn opt for easier-riding 
14-inchers -- which provide a road feel somewhere between firm and numb. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeway passage was particularly unappealing. With only 88 horses on tap, 
there is little acceleration to spare and each journey became a matter of 
catching up and struggling to stay there. With such limited reserves, one 
certainly watched one's manners. 
</P>
<P>
 Engine noise was high. So were sounds intruding from God's great outdoors. The 
flexing heft of doors and hood clearly show where subcompact manufacturers save 
money and weight on insulation and sheet metal gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sephia's trunk deserves a dishonorable mention. Even gentle slopes of typical 
driveways unbalance the lid when raised for unloading. The first indication is 
an edge tapping the nape of your neck in passable imitation of Madame La 
Guillotine.  
</P>
<P>
 Geno Effler, spokesman for Kia Motors America Inc. of Irvine, acknowledges 
that Sephia is not the best of subcompact cars. Nor the worst. But the little 
sedan does give Kia a seat at the pie-eating contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subcompacts are 23% of new car sales, and as long as people see we're 
interested in quality, not quantity, we'll be OK," he says. "But you don't get 
two chances (at success) anymore. Just one." 
</P>
<P>
 So Kia is praying for public patience with its slow, hesitant, underpowered, 
even false, start. 
</P>
<P>
 For each week moves the company closer to fall; a dealer base spreading beyond 
California, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Texas and New Mexico, and the promise 
of 1995 Sephias with more muscular engines, optional anti-lock brakes and air 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, there will be the Sportage, a 140-horsepower sport utility with 
the looks of an undersized Ford Explorer. Next year, Kia plans a sedan for a 
doughty attempt on the mid-size crowns of Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Ford 
Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
 For buyers, wisdom could be a single word: Wait .

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: SO, MAYBE BLONDS DO HAVE MORE FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Platinum hair started turning up in European fashion magazines about six 
months ago. Worn close to the head or long and loose, these ivory locks looked 
unnatural . . . but nice. Now we're seeing them all over town. Even Joe Pesci's 
a golden boy in "Jimmy Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Keaton recently insisted that her longtime hairdresser, Jonathan Gale at 
Juan Juan in Beverly Hills, turn her into a towhead. As did actress Kate 
Capshaw and super-model Vendela. But Keaton, who had cut her hair to play 
Amelia Earhart, took Gale by surprise. "It's very hard when you've known 
someone for a long time looking a certain way," he said, "but she looks 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect that baby blond hair is part of the fashion world's recent penchant 
for toddler chic. Gale is less analytical: "People just want to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical fun like this may be safe, but it sure ain't cheap: It took five 
highlighting sessions -- $250 worth -- to turn a brunette Capshaw into a 
blonde. Monthly touch-ups range from $95 to $195. And there's all the new 
makeup you'll need to match your hair. (Try Bobbi Brown's Nude lipstick, topped 
with Gold Shimmer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is it worth it? An L.A. parking attendant seemed to think so: "I don't mean to 
offend you," he told our newly blond self, "but you are the most attractive 
woman I've seen in two or three weeks." He liked me. He really liked me.  
</P>
<P>
 Ziggy Oil-Control: "David is in London, recording. He won't be at the press 
conference," we were informed by Mr. Bowie's wife, Iman, Africa's exquisite 
export to the fashion runways of the world. In a news conference next week in 
New York City, squeezed between designer runway shows, she'll describe her new 
skin-care and cosmetics line for women of color. 
</P>
<P>
 It hits JCPenney stores in July, priced from $7 to $35. It is especially for 
African Americans, Latinas, Asians and Native Americans. But even the pale 
Bowie can use one item, a pre-makeup product for oil control. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was modeling I had to be a great chemist, mixing my own things for my 
skin and color needs," Iman said. "People would ask me what I used." Starting 
this summer, we'll ask no more. 
</P>
<P>
 A Spirited Party: We peeked into a darkened room at Century City's 20/20 Club 
on Wednesday night. A stripper was entertaining a handful of businessmen. Quel 
embarrassing! But just beyond, we found what we'd been looking for: a display 
of period costumes worn by Glenn Close, Meryl Streep and Vanessa Redgrave in 
"The House of the Spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 The strip club at the ABC Entertainment Center was the convenient, if 
incongruous, setting for a Miramax films-Maxfield-hosted reception after the 
film's L.A. premiere, which benefited the American Cinematheque. Studying a 
long, black crepe dress designed for Close, we wondered what her sexually 
repressed character would have thought of the writhing, G-string-clad cuties 
who normally occupy the place? 
</P>
<P>
 "That was way better than 'The Piano,' " said one of many short, 
wire-rim-glasses-wearing men who crowded around the groaning buffet tables. 
Other bachelors, we noted, were busy checking themselves out in one of the 
club's many mirrored surfaces. "You look great," we assured one poor slob, 
adding a thumbs-up for sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes can be seen at Maxfield, 8825 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, through 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Weird Science: Remember Realm? Apparently nobody else does, either. The 
fragrance -- touted as the first to contain human pheromones -- was launched 
last year with great fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the perfume's infomercial failed to excite much response. 
Manufacturer Erox Corp. recently announced a net loss of more than $4 million 
in 1993, and revenue from the company's fragrances was only $111,862. 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect that the problem was the honesty of Realm's claims -- the fragrance 
didn't stir erotic longings, but rather merely instilled in the wearer "a sense 
of well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 History Lessons: Edward Maeder, former curator of costumes and textiles for 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, takes a new job as director of Toronto's 
Bata Shoe Museum this month. But he's left behind a small, eclectic exhibition 
that shows off the range, depth and even humor of the items in LACMA's costumes 
and textiles collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Among our favorite pieces in the exhibit, which opened Wednesday, is a Halston 
hat from the '60s that resembles a crown of enormous pastel rollers. And 
there's the 200-year-old wooden doll that solved the problem contemporary toy 
makers run into with sexist renditions. The gender-neutral figurine could be 
dressed as a man in velvet breeches and coat, or a woman in a silk dress, 
embroidered slippers and petticoat. A sexually correct wig and tiny hat 
complete the look. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Celebration: Fifteen Years of Collecting Costumes and Textiles 
(1979-1994)" runs through July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Your Heart: Thinking of tossing that lacy demi-cup into the wasteland of 
another bra gone wrong? Send it to San Francisco artist Nicolino instead. He 
needs 10,000 bras for a planned sculpture called "Bras Across Grand Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolino, who's collected 2,500 bras so far, wants to attach all 10,000 to a 
steel cable, which will then be hoisted across the vast ravine sometime in 
July, 1995. He's on a train tour through the United States and Canada to 
collect bras and monetary donations for the work, which he says is all about 
fun and fighting breast obsession in America.  
</P>
<P>
 Nicolino's train pulls into L.A.'s Union Station about 8 p.m. April 29 for bra 
refueling.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A RAPPER'S MESSAGE FOR THE EYES, NOT EARS; THE ICE 
OPINION, BY ICE-T AS TOLD TO HEIDI SIEGMUND, ST. MARTIN'S PRESS, $17.9, 199 
PAGES

<P>
 Few art forms have roused as much controversy in America as rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, there are its fans -- nearly 8% of the music-buying public, 
according to the Recording Industry Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 These include not only gangly suburban teen-agers and cool urban rappers, but 
leftist politicians and such intellectuals as City University of New York 
professor Marshall Berman, who has likened the breakthroughs of gangsta rap to 
"Picasso's in painting, Eliot's and Pound's in poetry, Faulkner's and Joyce's 
in the novel, Parker's in jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there are many Americans who, upon witnessing gangsta rap's 
seeming glorification of Uzi-brandishing violence and crotch-grabbing misogyny, 
may feel more inclined to agree with Francis Davis' observation in a 1993 
Atlantic article. He wrote that being subjected to "a drive-by musical attack 
from a Jeep whose back seat has been torn out and replaced with speakers" is a 
bit like hearing "the death rattle of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream." 
</P>
<P>
 No rapper is arguably more central to this controversy than Ice-T, a 
34-year-old musician who grew up in L.A.'s Crenshaw District under the name 
Tracy Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, just a month before the Los Angeles riots, Ice-T released an 
album called "Body Count." Inspired by rock groups with such names as Cannibal 
Corpse, Slayer and Megadeth, the album featured such songs as "Cop Killer," 
whose lyrics -- e.g. "die, die, die, pig, die!" -- left nothing to the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T's message grew even more incendiary in the November, 1992, album "Home 
Invasion," whose cover depicted hooded black intruders attacking a white man 
and woman. 
</P>
<P>
 In his provocative and candid book, "The Ice Opinion," written with journalist 
Heidi Siegmund, Ice-T does his best to carve out an identity as an African 
American leader and to defend himself against charges that his albums merely 
exacerbate racial tensions in post-riot Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers unruffled by Ice-T's fondness for four-letter words will be surprised 
to find a literary persona -- witty and even at times judicious -- that is far 
more levelheaded than his rap persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his self-defense is largely unpersuasive. He can be grossly unfair, 
condoning songs such as "Cop Killer," for instance, by saddling police officers 
with our whole sorry history of slavery: "When we came here on the slave ships, 
the police were the ones with the whips." 
</P>
<P>
 And he never resolves the huge contradictions between the high social ideals 
he espouses in one chapter ("Every life is of equal value and . . . has nothing 
to do with race or sex") and the cynical male street behavior he seems to 
encourage in another: "If you are only out to (expletive), then do not be 
afraid to lie. Do not be afraid to lie. . . . Tell her what she wants to hear. 
Lie. Lie. Lie." 
</P>
<P>
 One suspects that he knows he's being disingenuous when he argues that his 
frequent use of the word bitch in songs isn't sexist because "from the ghetto 
perspective, (it) is a non-gender-specific slang term for anybody who thinks 
the world revolves around them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some of Ice-T's arguments can be quite persuasive. At the same 
time that "Cop Killer" came out (Ice-T later pulled it from his album), Clint 
Eastwood released "Unforgiven," a film in which Eastwood's character is 
glorified for gunning down a bad cop and dozens of others with the misfortune 
of being in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T effectively argues here that a double standard explains the fact that 
critics offered near-universal praise for Eastwood's film but near-universal 
condemnation of Ice-T's song. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T also manages to show those who haven't been there some of the subtle 
ways discrimination works in our back yard: "Why can't you go surfing?" he 
wonders. "Who says surfing is just for white kids? That's your wave, too. 
That's your snow mountain up there in Big Bear." 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T argues convincingly that his recordings give voice to this feeling of 
exclusion and to the feelings of powerlessness and helplessness that come from 
growing up in ghettos drained of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the gang members who inspire his raps do not enjoy being told that 
they are devoid of hope (for if there's anything Ice-T knows about, it is the 
fragility of male pride), he creates fantasy characters whose powerful 
posturing soothes his audience's numbing feeling of powerlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, of course, debatable whether the homeboys for whom Ice-T raps see that 
he is inventing not role models but characters, whether they understand that 
underlying his music are mainstream values (here he eschews everything from 
racism and sexism to violence). 
</P>
<P>
 The only sure thing is that the hopeful word that is Ice-T's sign-off in this 
book -- peace -- will not, in itself, be enough to help us get along. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 14, 1994, not long after this book went to press, Tony Thomas, the 
founder and leader of Hands Across Watts, the organization Ice-T has worked 
with in order to "see the gang truce through," was gunned down in front of the 
Imperial Courts Housing Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas had survived an earlier attack in which he was hit by eight AK-47 
bullets. But this one proved fatal.

HOURS ADDED TO LAST DAYS OF FENDER SHOW; ART: THE EXHIBIT, WHICH INCLUDES HIS 
FIRST GUITAR, IS BREAKING ATTENDANCE RECORDS AT THE FULLERTON MUSEUM CENTER. 
</P>

<P>
 The Fullerton Museum Center, which has broken its daily average attendance 
record with an exhibit on pioneer electric guitar designer Leo Fender, will 
extend its hours for the show's final days, today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which organized the show, will be open today from noon to 8 p.m. 
and will reopen tonight at 8:30 for a concert by Popsicle, a local pop band. 
The center will be open Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five Decades of Fender: The Sound Heard Around the World" has drawn an 
average of more than 100 people a day, 10 more than the previous daily record 
average, director Joe Felz said. The show-which features 75 instruments 
including the first guitar Fender ever made -- is expected to break the center 
record of 10,000 total attendance to a single exhibit, Felz added. Both records 
were set by "Titanic," an exhibit in 1991 about the doomed ocean liner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last weekend we had more than 500 people," Felz said. "It's real popular 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the exhibit -- an attempt to illustrate how Fender's designs 
made a whole different type of rock music possible -- has received national and 
international media exposure. Music magazines from France, England and 
Australia sent writers, and cable and radio stations around the country and 
Canada have broadcast information about the show, Felz said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A membership drive was staged in conjunction with the show; Felz said drive 
tallies won't be completed until the middle of the month. But whatever happens, 
he said, the exhibit's popularity won't be triggering any sort of shift in 
center philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five Decades of Fender" focused on the impact of Fender's designs on music 
and "how this was important to people, not just how neat guitars look," said 
Felz. "That's the same approach we take with every show." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Five Decades of Fender: The Sound Heard Around the World" runs through 
Saturday at the Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton. 
Admission: $1.50-$2.50. Tickets to tonight's concert by Popsicle are $5 and are 
good for admission to the exhibit as well. (714) 738-6545.

OPERA REVIEW; BORIS HAS A BAD DREAM; MUSSORGSKY'S 'BORIS GODUNOV' IS SUBJECTED 
TO A REVISIONIST STAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Remember "Boris Godunov"? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Modest Mussorgsky's vast, sprawling, turbulent, essentially Romantic, 
unabashedly grand old opera? The one with the cast of thousands, not including 
the horses? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the colorful, episodic, quasi-historical spectacular about the 
guilt-ridden, long-bearded and long-suffering tsar, the sonorous, downtrodden 
Russian masses, the scheming mezzo-soprano princess from Poland, the preening 
tenoral pretender to the throne, the stuffy boyars, the folksy comic-relievers 
of the lower classes and the socio-political turmoil in Moscow and environs at 
the turn of the 17th Century? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the musical changes, additions and subtractions provided over the 
decades by Rimsky-Korsakov (thick), Shostakovich (thin), Karol Rathaus 
(nondescript) and other well-meaning editors, a.k.a. orchestrators, meddlers 
and arrangers? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the great terminal showpiece for flamboyant, bigger-than-life, 
booming-and-bleeding bassos from Chaliapin to Pinza to Reizen to Kipnis to 
Petrov to Christoff to London to Treigle to Ghiaurov to Talvela? Remember how 
poignantly and resonantly they died, usually while rolling down a convenient 
flight of steps? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget all that. This is the Long Beach Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 This, to be crucially precise, is the adventurous, iconoclastic, modestly 
endowed, forward-looking, sometimes triumphant and sometimes foolhardy Long 
Beach Opera in the hands of Christopher Alden. Always original, often inspired, 
sometimes muddled, occasionally just perverse, he is, for better or worse, a 
thinking-person's stage director. 
</P>
<P>
 He also happens to be a man who leaves no traditional turn unstoned. It would 
seem to be a matter of daring, a point of interpretive honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Abetted by Steven Sloane, a spirited ally in the pit, Alden turned "Boris 
Godunov" on Wednesday at the huge, half-empty Terrace Theatre into a stark 
exploration of a psyche in torment. In the process, he reverted to David 
Lloyd-Jones' reasonable facsimile of the composer's first version, completed in 
1869. Dark, taut and primitive, it lacks love interest -- no Polish princess 
here -- as well as popular pomp. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the potential alienation, Alden has abandoned the progressive 
story line. He concentrates instead on what must be the protagonist's bad 
dream. The director has replaced realism with Expressionism, swapped the props 
of credibility for symbols and abstractions. Turning his back on temporal 
truth, he has decided to play out the ancient drama in a contemporary setting 
replete with political icons. 
</P>
<P>
 The likenesses of Lenin, Brezhnev, Khrushchev and their like dot Carol 
Bailey's bleakly modern set in strategically placed photos. The omnipresent 
protagonist, sensitively enacted by Michael Devlin, resembles Nosferatu in a 
badly tailored business suit. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the picture: The open stage, drastically raked and jutting into the 
pit at a violent angle, reveals the basic tools of Alden's trade. The 
choristers, who gesture in stylized unison, are confined to bleachers in a 
jail-like box, upstage left. Boris-the-ghoul stalks a long, paper-strewn desk 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 An elaborate bier, complete with movable boyish corpse, is stationed beneath a 
trademark Alden clock far right (it is always 10 minutes to 12); an all-purpose 
bed tilts at the far left. The bare feet of some monstrous statue serve as 
partial backdrop. Brechtian spotlights, courtesy of the resourceful Adam 
Silverman, blind the audience at moments of high drama. 
</P>
<P>
 It all, no doubt, is fraught with meaning. Deep meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 A red banner streams across the playing area, bearing a message in Russian. I 
think it flashes the opening lamentation of the Russian people: "Why dost thou 
forsake us, our father? Unto whom dost thou leave us?" No translation is 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast -- including William Hall's gutsy chorus -- sings in dutiful English, 
much of it intelligible from the eighth row. Nevertheless, someone decided to 
add the redundant distraction of English supertitles, projected in sporadic 
phrase-fragments high atop the proscenium. For at least one viewer they created 
a pain in the neck, both literally and figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alden's theater of alienation, it is difficult for a novice observer to 
follow the plot even with the crutch of a translated translation. Storytelling 
does not seem to be a high priority here. Locales are not defined. 
Relationships are not observed. Always posing and desperately emoting in their 
own vacuums, characters wander in and out of scenes that should not involve 
them. We are supposed to believe, apparently, that they are always there 
because they haunt Boris' thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is the tragedy of "Boris Godunov" as filtered through the 
anti-hero's dementia. Call it distorted tsar-gazing.  
</P>
<P>
 One has to admire Alden's daring. One wants to applaud his invention. 
Ultimately, however, one has to admit that his nightmare "Boris" ends up being 
more interesting than affecting. It seems more a commentary on Mussorgsky's 
opera -- a fascinating commentary, to be sure -- than a representation of the 
opera itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Since madness is operative from the start, there is no room here for 
psychological development. Since the chorus must remain militaristically 
static, it cannot exert much of an active force. Since everyone on the stage is 
encouraged to send independent expressive signals at the same time, there is 
much visual counterpoint but little central focus. Logic isn't an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble did its valiant best on Wednesday to validate the director's 
obfuscations within the intimate milieu. Though lacking a charismatic persona 
and a blaring basso, Devlin capitalized on the solid virtues of clarity and 
understatement in the title role. John Duykers complemented him nicely as a 
shifty, cigar-chewing, almost heroic Shuisky. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Creswell asserted himself deftly as the false Dmitri, whose duties remain 
minimal in this edition. Stefan Szkafarowsky put his rough basso to good use as 
the long-winded Pimen. George Hogan avoided second-hand buffoonery as Varlaam, 
ably seconded by the comic-book Missail of Beau Palmer. Martha Jane Howe was 
properly earthy both as the hostess and nurse to Suzan Hanson's hysterical 
Xenia and Colin Nelson's risen-from-the-dead Feodor. Keene Benson dealt keenly 
with the prophetic ravings of the simpleton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small pit, Sloane and an excellent little orchestra served Mussorgsky's 
lyricism somewhat better than his drama. But this was honorable music-making in 
a situation where the music wasn't always of primary importance. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; MURKY PORTRAIT OF SERIAL KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aileen "Lee" Wuornos, the subject of Nick Broomfield's documentary "Aileen 
Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer," has the hard-bitten look of someone 
whose life has been hell and who has made a hell of the lives of others. 
Commentators have often noted how shockingly normal serial killers like Jeffrey 
Dahmer or Ted Bundy look; Wuornos doesn't inspire the same befuddlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the points of Broomfield's movie is that perhaps Wuornos is not, in 
the strictest definition, a serial killer at all. Between 1989 and 1990, while 
working as a prostitute on a Florida interstate highway, Wuornos shot and 
killed seven men. While admitting the killings, she repeatedly characterized 
them during her trial as acts of self-defense, a charge she reiterates during 
the interview she gives Broomfield at the end of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 When we hear Wuornos in the courtroom go into painstaking detail about how her 
first murder victim sexually tortured her and planned to kill her, she appears 
to be reliving the horror. It's almost unbearable to listen to and watch. 
</P>
<P>
 If her murders had been confined to that one alone, she probably would have 
escaped death row. (She's still there, pending appeal.) But her claims of 
self-defense in the other six don't jog the same vehement feminist fury. 
Wuornos is a jangle of mixed motives: She claims to accept her guilt and wants 
to be put to death but when she is sentenced she screams at the judge, "May 
your wife and kids get raped." 
</P>
<P>
 Wuornos' plea of no contest to one of the murders, which led to her 
sentencing, was engineered by her attorney Steven Glazer and Arlene Pralle, a 
born-again Christian and horse farmer who adopted Wuornos just before the 
murder trial because she claims "Lee" had a "heart of gold."  
</P>
<P>
 Broomfield seems manifestly concerned with how the Wuornos murders have turned 
into a commercial enterprise. He draws out a Florida policeman, Brian Jarvis, 
who claims that police officers conspired to sell the rights to the Wuornos 
case before she had been arrested, and that Wuornos' estranged female lover 
Tyria Moore, who some believe was a co-conspirator, was in on the deal in 
exchange for her freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 Broomfield's tack is to highlight the commercialization of the case and, in 
the process, to encourage the view that Wuornos has been sacrificed. When she 
finally relents to be interviewed by him at the end of the film, and 
underscores her position as a victim of abuse who murdered in self-defense, his 
interrogation is not very probing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unremarked, or glossed over in this film, is the fact that Wuornos had already 
been arrested and jailed for armed robbery in 1982, that she had married a 
70-year-old man in 1976 and that the marriage broke up on battery charges (each 
accused the other), that she had a baby at 13 that was taken from her, that she 
had tried to kill herself. Also glossed over or unexamined is the weight of 
evidence against her charges of self-defense: the fact that all the men she 
murdered were white men between ages 40 and 60 and drove fairly expensive 
vehicles; that space had been rented by her to store the spoils; that in all 
the murders she was careful enough to leave behind only one fingerprint; that 
she was not above trying to cut her own deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Selling of a Serial Killer" is properly cynical of the commercial motives 
behind the case but it isn't skeptical enough about Wuornos, who, despite her 
entreaties to Broomfield at the end to investigate police corruption, remains 
remorseless about the murders. The film finally becomes an extension of the 
current vogue in courtroom special pleading: Wuornos is martyred because of her 
abusive childhood and her degradation as a prostitute. The film presents her as 
the first documented female serial killer but what you come away with is 
something else: Wuornos is the first politically correct serial killer.

THEATER REVIEWS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION DRIVES 'TENOR' FARCE AND FURIOUS; THE LONG 
BEACH PLAYHOUSE PRODUCTION TUNES UP THE COMEDY WITH A BRIGHT TEMPO, SERIOUS 
CASTING AND A SENSE OF FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Ludwig's hit Broadway farce "Lend Me a Tenor" borrows from the French 
farceur Feydeau but doesn't have the master's obligatory seven doors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only five in the 1934 Cleveland hotel suite where the action takes 
place, surrounding a performance of the Cleveland Grand Opera that barely 
misses being a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is also missing a couple of the cylinders that help fuel a true 
farce. There are some dull moments not filled with mayhem, and a couple of gags 
run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But this production on the Long Beach Playhouse's main stage has advantages 
that help keep the engine running in a laugh-provoking gear. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the bright tempo that director Darlene Hunter-Chaffee keeps constant. 
She has also been able to infuse her cast with the spirit of having fun, a 
feeling that spills into the audience. The actors look like they're having a 
ball -- a comic ingredient that never misses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast has also been held in check and never tries to make anything funny. 
They are so sincere in their every moment that Ludwig's humor is allowed full 
sway. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to the production's success are the three central figures: 
Saunders (Ray Fulmer), general manager of the Grand Opera; his gofer and 
assistant Max (Jonathan Kass), and the visiting Italian tenor Tito Merelli 
(John Del Gatto). There is no misstep in their performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Kass has that sure comic sense that never allows his audience to see him being 
comic. He is funny without losing his romantic appeal in a role that requires 
these opposites. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulmer's calm authority even when his character is at the end of his rope also 
hides a sure technique, and Del Gatto's volatile tenor maintains a semblance of 
sanity in spite of the insanity around him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, though both Kass and Del Gatto obviously are not opera singers, they 
approximate same with daring and aplomb during the Don Carlo aria with which 
Merelli coaches the tyro Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Gordon is delightful as Saunders' daughter Maggie, who really loves Max 
but is seething to gain experience with Merelli. Mark Schuliger makes 
opera-buff Bellhop a charming, amusing thorn in everybody's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Jackson as the soprano who is supposed to sing opposite Merelli, but 
winds up with Max, Leslie Allen as the chair of the Opera Guild, and Giovanna 
Fusco as Tito's fiery, jealous wife, all handle their chores brightly and with 
flair. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kokol's set achieves a triumph of its own on the playhouse's long thrust 
stage, looking just right as a period hotel suite and giving the actors' mad 
dashings enough distance to make their panic seem real.

THEATER REVIEWS; WESTMINSTER STRAINS ITSELF TO FULFILL 'PROMISES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When exercising in private, you can do just about anything and not worry about 
how you look. Exercising in public is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Community Theatre is exercising in public with its revival of 
the Burt Bacharach-Hal David-Neil Simon musical, "Promises, Promises." The 
workout ethic is admirable, but the strain shows, painfully. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years go by and as the William Finns and Richard Maltbys and David 
Shires build up their resumes with far softer musical comedies, you have to 
admire "Promises," especially what composer Bacharach and lyricist David 
brought in 1969 to this adaptation of Billy Wilder's and I.A.L. Diamond's 
bitter comic film, "The Apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 You've also got to respect the demands the show makes on a cast: Quick, do a 
Neil Simon comedy and sing scat-like Bacharach-David material that no bouncing 
ball could hope to keep up with. Break a leg. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough assignment for anyone, and obviously too tough for the Westminster 
group. It's wonderful that they're stretching those vocal cords and exercising 
their instruments. Just not in public, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you haven't seen this musical before, you've heard some of it. This is 
the show of "Knowing When to Leave" and "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" and the 
title tune. 
</P>
<P>
 And hasn't everyone seen "The Apartment" -- the smashing charisma between Jack 
Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, the unbeatable line deliveries? (It's this 
familiarity that makes the musical so attractive to amateur groups, but it can 
also be a trap.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fans of "The Apartment" can't like what Simon did in the stage 
transferal. 
</P>
<P>
 All the original ingredients are here -- lowly accountant Chuck (Kyle Myers), 
the Consolidated Life executives (led by Warren K. Draper's Sheldrake) whom 
Chuck kisses up to by loaning out his apartment for their quickies and Fran 
(Stephanie Thomas), who's stuck in the midst of the sexual muck. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with some nice Simonisms, such as Chuck taking us into his confidence 
(and his fantasies about Fran) with some winning, nebbishy direct-address 
narration, this is a bowdlerized stage version of a brilliant comic-film 
narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-rate Simon, but it's first-rate Bacharach. Nervous was a term used to 
describe the score when it first appeared, and Bacharach's great skill in song 
after song here is to walk the high-wire of projecting the pressure building up 
in Chuck while crafting the tune with a slick veneer -- exactly the two-sided 
reality of Chuck's world. 
</P>
<P>
 The only artists who have come close to this balance since have been Donald 
Fagen and Walter Becker of Steely Dan. (Imagine the musical they could write.) 
</P>
<P>
 This is a score with killer time signatures closer to jazz than most musicals, 
and director Kent Johnson's cast sounds done in by the whole affair. 
(Accompanying pianist and musical director Bill Wolfe, though, is not, driving 
through where voices trip.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Countless tunes come out flat, and Myers is almost always a little behind the 
note, racing -- like Chuck -- to keep up. Thomas sounds a bit more trained in 
this tricky style but is missing any expression of Fran's dilemmas, which 
include a suicide attempt. Draper brings an effective stiffness to deceitful 
Sheldrake, but the stiffness carries over, alas, to his singing. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief from all of this comes in bits and pieces. Nina DeRosa-Gardner's 
fun, spunky Marge, with whom Chuck makes his half-hearted try at a one-night 
stand, plays right up to Simon's timing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad hardly anyone else is listening. The cheating execs (Glenn Cody, 
Marc LeBlanc, Bob Goff and Steve Berntsen) drive a few witty shots off the tee, 
especially in "Where Can You Take a Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Tom Hardy's doctor neighbor (whom Simon has turned into the 
moralizing voice of the older generation) is utterly humorless. There is no 
chemistry between Myers and Thomas, no spark, no flame. And Myers' habit of 
starting Chuck's lines with a stutter doesn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Set changes from office to apartment to restaurants go fairly smoothly; 
Wolfe's band clicks along nicely, and the execs' chorus line is almost in 
unison, care of Lisa Harvey's choreography. But this group should assign itself 
a workout it can handle. Not this.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'BALTIMORE WALTZ' TURNS ON LIFE-AFFIRMING LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Baltimore Waltz," a 1991-92 Obie award-winner, is not as slow and 
sentimental as the title may suggest. The play, at San Diego's Fritz Theatre, 
has a bittersweet dual nature: as a dance with death and as a passionate, 
infectiously funny life-affirming gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Paula Vogel wrote the play for her HIV-positive brother, Carl, who 
died of pneumonia in 1988. As she explains in the preface to her play, she 
wrote it because she had refused her brother's invitation to take a trip to 
Europe with him two years before, not knowing he was sick or how little time 
she had left with him. 
</P>
<P>
 So the play, set in a hospital room not unlike the one in which her brother 
died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, becomes a story about the trip not 
taken -- recast as an imaginary, fantastic trip to Europe with Carl and his 
sister -- here called Anna. 
</P>
<P>
 But as in a dream, everything is twisted. Suddenly it is not Carl who is sick, 
but Anna, an elementary school teacher with ATD -- Acquired Toilet Disease -- 
caught from one of her pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 And you never forget it is a trip in the mind because Carl and Anna are always 
in their pajamas (though Carl wears a blazer over his) and every other man they 
meet is played by the actor who plays the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 It took guts for this modest little company to take on this project. Never 
mind the difficulty of the subject matter -- it would be so easy to do this 
work badly. Like a cobweb, fantasy is threaded from many delicate strands that 
must all hold perfectly if any flies are to be caught. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does hold, thanks to a wonderfully charged and luminous production 
directed by Christina Courtenay at the Fritz' intimate 80-seat space in the 
heart of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The production values are minimal -- as befits a play of the imagination -- 
but cleverly right-on (kudos to Daniel Morris' stark set with its multiple 
passageways and Douglas Gabrielle's warm lighting). And the acting is 
unforgettably in-your-face. 
</P>
<P>
 The play begins with Anna (Claudia Orenstein) in her nightgown, struggling to 
master phrases in foreign languages in preparation for their trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the language that terrifies me," she says, but we soon see she's not 
just talking about French or German, but about the medical language in which 
she learns of Acquired Toilet Syndrome -- an incomprehensible verbiage much 
like that used to describe AIDS. The joke of course is that the more complex 
the language used to describe the condition, the less anyone actually knows 
about the disease itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Orenstein, who recently earned a doctorate from Stanford in directing and 
criticism, is a slightly built powerhouse, at once compelling, witty and 
vulnerable as Anna. Her work is well matched by the large, soulful portrayal of 
Carl by Duane Daniels, the Equity actor who doubles as the theater's artistic 
director, and by the impeccable timing of the intense Ron Choularton in the 
darkly comic roles of Everyone Else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasy requires some key or messenger to take us from here to there. Here the 
envoy is Carl's old stuffed rabbit, which we later learn that Anna has brought 
to her brother in the hospital. Like the White Rabbit in "Alice in Wonderland," 
this toy seems to be the ticket down the rabbit hole into a world in which 
illogical ideas are brought to their absurdly logical conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 If AIDS were ATD, a disease that strikes single straight elementary school 
teachers, then society wouldn't be talking about blame or shaking collective 
heads at the victims' sexual desires. The public would look with more empathy 
as the afflicted contemplate any cure -- no matter how ridiculous -- even to 
the point of drinking one's own urine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important element that charges this particular work is the fierce 
and tender love between brother and sister, suggested by the way they hold each 
other, the way they look at each other, the way they dance as if they are two 
bodies melted into one. They have a bond that death can't break; it's the one 
thing that feels real amid the madness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that is the triumph of "The Baltimore Waltz." Anyone who has lost a loved 
one knows how it feels to be left yearning for one final embrace or dance with 
that person -- which would only be possible in the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 For those willing to enter its dreamlike state, "The Baltimore Waltz" 
illustrates this with sensitivity and grace. And while the play can't make you 
dance, it does point the way to the dance floor. 
</P>

MANY SCHOOLS TO SCALE BACK ANNUAL MOCK QUAKE DRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Principals, teachers and parents are balking at a Los Angeles Unified School 
District plan to stage a mock magnitude 7.5 earthquake next week, saying the 
drill would be an all-too-vivid reminder of January's 6.8 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are still too traumatized by the quake and its aftershocks and will 
not react well to an extensive practice drill, according to some critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual drill, called Shake '94, could also be difficult for teachers and 
other school staff members who lost homes and possessions in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've had enough practice," said Maureen Diekmann, the principal at 
Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills, which remains closed -- with its 
students relocated -- because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely not going to do the whole nine yards. We're not going to 
have anyone hurt and we're not going to have anyone stuck anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say that the drill, scheduled for Tuesday, is held 
every year at this time to coincide with the state-designated Earthquake 
Preparedness Month and that it is particularly important this year to test 
schools' emergency plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we stop everything?" said Jim Sugahara, a district administrator who 
oversees the emergency services office. "If you have a car accident, when do 
you go back in the car? How long do you want us to wait? I'd rather see our 
schools prepared and going through this exercise than not." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin sent to schools describing Shake '94 tells principals to simulate 
a magnitude 7.5 quake at 10:30 Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact upon the Metropolitan Los Angeles area is significant," the memo 
says. "Power, water, gas, sewer and telephone systems fail in all areas. 
Freeway bridges have collapsed, critically disrupting the transportation 
system. Fires are reported at district sites. Hazardous materials are released 
into the air in South Gate. Supt. Sidney A. Thompson declares a state of 
emergency and orders staff to remain at their sites." 
</P>
<P>
 The drill typically is elaborate. Students pretend to be injured or missing 
and some are carried off on stretchers. Teachers administer first aid and 
conduct search-and-rescue missions. Others hold up signs depicting fires. A 
large aftershock hits 25 minutes into the drill. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, principals across the district say it will be a low-key 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the kids need to go through this -- they've been through enough 
already," said Dan Balderrama, the principal at Langdon Avenue School in North 
Hills, where about 70 students just returned after the January quake. "We'll 
just walk through it with the office staff and support people." 
</P>
<P>
 And at Canoga Park Elementary, Assistant Principal Sara Applebaum said: "We're 
still living it. We haven't stopped living it. Ideally, we'd like to not have 
to think about this again." 
</P>
<P>
 At Hobart Boulevard Elementary near Downtown, teachers will be told to keep 
reminding students that it is just a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to take every precaution so that our children won't be scared by 
it," said Betty Daniels, the assistant principal in charge of the drill. "My 
main emphasis will be to reassure the children that everything will be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Most principals said instead of conducting a 45-minute drill, they will scale 
back the exercise to about 10 minutes and avoid giving students much 
description about the effects of the simulation. Some principals say students 
have just returned to school, others are sharing homes with two and three 
families, and still others are getting counseling because of quake trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's wise right now," said Debbie Moorman, whose daughter 
attends Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, where classroom buildings are 
closed and students take classes in portable bungalows. I think they should 
wait until at least the fall semester."

JOB HUNGRY; 2,000 LINE UP FOR ABOUT 200 DMV OPENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 3 1/2 hours on line and with at least another hour ahead of him, Devlen 
Davis sized up his enormous competition Thursday for jobs at the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles. Or to be more accurate, his competition just to 
receive an application to take a qualifying test to get on a long waiting list 
for $9.86-an-hour DMV clerkships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling that everybody in L.A. that doesn't have a job and would like one 
is here. And if the people have jobs that aren't paying enough, they would like 
a better opportunity. So they're here too," said Davis, a 25-year-old student 
at Los Angeles Trade Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly seemed that way both outside and inside the state office building 
at 107 S. Broadway, where the DMV division for central Los Angeles County held 
its first job call in three years. Officials estimated that 2,000 applicants 
showed up for what could be about 200 job openings over the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the door wasn't opened until 8 a.m., the unemployed and 
underemployed began queuing up around 6:30 a.m., state police reported. Within 
a few hours, the line snaked through a maze of corridors, half a block along 
Broadway and then up 1st Street to the next corner. And it moved slowly in the 
smoggy sunshine, painfully so. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired, they're hungry and they're hot. But they don't care how 
long it takes. They just want to know that they'll get that application," said 
Stephanie Quintero, one of the state police officers supervising the line. One 
of her duties, she said, was to make sure that Downtown panhandlers didn't get 
too aggressive with the captive audience of job-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last in line at one point was Annie Chapman, 31, who has been out of work for 
more than a year. Asked if she felt discouraged, the former school clerk shook 
her head. "No," she said. "It's like this everywhere you apply for a job. You 
have to keep your determination, you have to keep your spirits up, you can't 
give up, you got to keep trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal statistics indicate that California finally is pulling out of its long 
recession. The February jobless rate in Los Angeles County dipped to 9.7%, down 
from 11% the month before. But many of those on line complained that such 
statistics mask other, and more widespread, pain -- the hardship of working at 
near-minimum-wage jobs that offer no medical insurance or other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV positions pay a starting monthly salary of $1,709, close to double 
minimum wage, and could rise over time to $2,405 a month, all with generous 
state government benefits. "You can't find anything like this, $9.86 an hour, 
man, $1,700 a month. That's not bad, plus benefits and everything," said Angel 
Santos, a college student who was on the DMV line Thursday because a department 
store laid him off from a low-paying stock clerk job two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 42 jobs are open in the 11 DMV offices from Santa Monica to West 
Covina, helping drivers get licenses and register cars, according to Theresa 
Kirtley, regional manager. With retirements and transfers, the number of full- 
and part-time openings could grow to 200 or so over the next two years, she 
said. Candidates can remain on the waiting list for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV took applications at three locations. The big turnout Thursday in 
Downtown Los Angeles, along with 1,300 in Pomona and 1,000 in West Los Angeles, 
didn't surprise Kirtley. "Not at all. Not if you see the number of 
organizations that are downsizing and merging," she said. "We have a feel for 
the fact that people need jobs out there." 
</P>
<P>
 So the DMV can be choosy. Applicants needed a high school diploma or 
equivalency, plus at least one year of clerical service involving direct 
customer contact. Those qualifications were discussed during brief interviews 
with DMV counselors in a noisy auditorium that had all the privacy of a rodeo. 
Those who got past that hurdle were invited to take a written qualifying exam 
April 9. The next steps will be in-depth interviews and possible places on a 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 But hundreds on line never got past the building's front door, which state 
troopers closed at 4 p.m. Among those unlucky job-seekers was Gloria Claiborne, 
44, who had waited 2 1/2 hours without getting inside. Out of work for two 
months, the former receptionist and single mother was clearly frustrated: "I 
need a job, anywhere, anything. I have responsibilities and bills to pay."

PROPOSED SHELTER RUNS INTO NEW OBSTACLE; SOCIAL SERVICES: PROJECT IS 
RE-EVALUATED BECAUSE FUEL TANKS ARE NEAR A NAVY SITE THAT WOULD BE USED TO 
HOUSE HOMELESS PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials are re-evaluating whether surplus Navy property in San Pedro 
is suitable for a homeless shelter because it is near tanks holding millions of 
gallons of airplane fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The site on Taper Avenue does not meet federal standards for homeless 
dwellings because two fuel tanks are too close to the buildings, said Louis 
Misko, director of the Navy's base closures division.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
which approved the site for a homeless project in 1993, said the Navy has been 
asked to resubmit information about the site and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 He said HUD would look at the application for the shelter again in light of 
the new information. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said re-evaluation of the site 
would not necessarily stop the homeless project, but "since we are making a 
redetermination, I don't think anyone would want to move forward."  
</P>
<P>
 HUD had already been told by the Navy that the tanks are closer to the 
proposed shelter than allowed by a federal law, but it was approved anyway. But 
in light of concerns raised by local political leaders, HUD has agreed to 
re-evaluate the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval was given to Turner's Technical Institute Inc. to operate a shelter 
for up to 600 homeless people in 144 units of Navy housing, which is currently 
used by sailors and their families. The Navy plans to transfer those families 
before the Long Beach Naval Station closes in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter proposal enraged neighboring residents, who say San Pedro already 
has enough shelters, and the plan was set into motion without anyone in the 
community knowing about it. At a series of public hearings, angry residents 
have questioned public officials and sought a loophole in the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 that gives homeless advocates first 
chance at surplus government land.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that loophole may have been found. Local politicians brought information 
to the housing department's attention early this week about the tanks' 
proximity to the site, the HUD spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The McKinney Act states that no flammable liquids are allowed within 2,000 
feet of a homeless shelter. Misko said at least one of the two above-ground 
tanks on Gaffey Street is about 950 feet from the property line. Each of the 
privately owned tanks holds more than 4 million gallons of fuel, officials 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Navy informed the housing department about the location of the tanks 
before the approval, but Turner's application for the land was accepted, Misko 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (the department) made a determination that that was suitable, and 
now that's being called into question," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnathon Marzet, deputy director of Turner's Technical, a South-Central Los 
Angeles homeless advocacy group, said opponents of the shelter are "trying to 
grab at anything they can to kill the project." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is not concerned about the safety of the housing.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are at least 300, 400 or 500 homes that are closer to those tanks than 
we are," Marzet said.  
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical will fight any attempt to stop the shelter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very upset because we're talking about helping people. We're talking 
about turning children's and adults' lives around, and what we are hearing is, 
'We don't care about that.' That's what disturbs us, the lack of care." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they do care about homelessness but are angry that they were not 
given an opportunity to develop their own plans for the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people living in the neighborhood already have concerns about the safety 
of living near the tanks, said Nancy Donlon of San Pedro/Peninsula Homeowners 
United. "If you're really trying to do the best for the homeless, then that's 
not the best place to house them."

NEW TWIST IN CASE OF THE MISSING MASTERPIECES; CRIME: ARTWORKS WERE RECOVERED 
IN AUGUST. BUT NOW BROTHER OF THE WOMAN WHO SAYS SHE OWNS THEM HAS FILED SUIT, 
SAYING SHE STOLE THEM FROM THEIR LATE SOCIALITE SISTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the biggest art robberies in Los Angeles history seemed to have ended 
happily in August when it was announced the FBI and police had recovered $9 
million in modern art stolen from a Northridge rental storage unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Eva Smith Weisager, the 86-year-old woman who told police she had 
inherited the artworks from her socialite sister, is being accused of stealing 
them herself in the late 1970s. A spokesman for her denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager's brother, Daniel Greenway, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court 
on Wednesday charging that Weisager took the paintings and drawings -- 
including a possible Picasso -- from the home of their sister, Rosita Winston, 
after Winston was debilitated by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway further charges that when Winston -- who was the widow of highly 
successful real estate developer Norman Winston -- died in 1979, he should have 
shared in the artworks under the terms of her will. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine paintings and drawings include "The Party," a painting attributed to 
Pablo Picasso, although leading experts on the artist said they had no 
knowledge of the work. If authenticated, the signed painting would be worth 
about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other paintings and drawings in the group were by such well-known artists as 
Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Eugene Delacroix. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway said in his suit that he is entitled to at least $1 million -- 
one-ninth the value of the paintings, plus punitive damages and costs. He is a 
resident of Baja California, Mexico, and could not be reached for comment. His 
lawyer, who is based in Claremont, did not return telephone calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager's son-in-law, Ken Tate, said Weisager was too upset to comment on the 
matter. Tate also would not comment in detail on the suit, other than to call 
it groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not one thing in there that is true," Tate said, speaking from his 
office in Reseda. "The truth will come out and this will all just go away." 
</P>
<P>
 The artworks were recovered in a raid Aug. 10 on the homes of Chatsworth 
carpenter Peter MacKenzie and Granada Hills electrician Alan McArthur. Several 
of the works, police said, were found hidden in the wall of MacKenzie's 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men and restaurant owner Vasilios Mirmaras, who was accused of trying 
to sell the paintings, are scheduled to go on trial this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager reported the artworks missing Feb. 5, 1992, from the rented storage 
facility where she had kept them for 13 years. She was living in a modest Van 
Nuys apartment and had no insurance on the works, she told police. 
</P>
<P>
 An insurance policy, in addition to protecting her against loss, would 
probably have bolstered her claim to ownership. Art insurers normally require 
proof that a valuable work is owned by the person or institution taking out the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate would not comment on whether the paintings were now insured, or even if 
Weisager still had them in her possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bill Martin, who heads the Los Angeles Police Department's art theft 
division, said he had no reason at the time of the investigation to doubt 
Weisager owned the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it was just the opposite," Martin said Wednesday. "This was an 
elderly woman who was very nice, very cooperative, who had never been in 
trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gave us materials to show that the paintings had been in her family for 
many years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Winstons were well-known in New York art circles for their collection. A 
photograph of Rosita Winston that appeared in Vogue magazine in the mid-1950s 
shows "The Party" hanging on the wall of their apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway charges in the suit that Weisager bought a station wagon in 1978 "for 
the specific purpose of looting Rosita Winston's plush condominium of valuable 
works of art." He further states that Weisager, who is the only defendant in 
the suit, was assisted in taking the art by her daughter and "a servant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway further states in the suit that he never knew what had happened to 
the paintings until he read a Times story in August about their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said that Weisager and Greenway had stayed in contact over the years and 
had seen each other as recently as about two weeks ago. He said he did not know 
if they ever discussed the artworks.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUROR'S 
EMERGENCY FORCES DELAY IN KING CIVIL TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A medical emergency Thursday involving a juror's wife forced a recess until 
Monday of the Rodney G. King civil lawsuit trial, which the presiding judge now 
expects to take another month to complete.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said his timetable for the trial is in 
"shambles" because of testimony that has taken longer than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for King hope to rest their case in the first phase of the trial by 
noon on Monday, a week later than originally projected. Davies had expected the 
entire first phase to take a week.  
</P>
<P>
 Davies' schedule was disrupted further on Thursday when Juror 34 called a 
clerk this morning to report that his wife had been taken to a hospital 
emergency room for an undisclosed illness or injury. The juror had hoped to 
return by this afternoon, Davies said, but he recessed the case until Monday 
anyway.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CANOGA PARK; NASA CHIEF 
GIVES QUALIFIED PRAISE TO ROCKETDYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin gave qualified praise Thursday to 
Rocketdyne, the Canoga Park-based aerospace firm that was plagued last year by 
an embarrassing series of problems involving engines it makes for the space 
shuttle program. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 90-minute tour of Rocketdyne's sprawling main factory, Goldin said the 
company has made some progress in correcting quality control problems that 
caused two shuttle launches to be aborted seconds before liftoff and two other 
scheduled flights to be postponed, much to NASA's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality slipped up a bit, and we let them know that in no uncertain 
terms," said Goldin, standing amid a group of Rocketdyne executives that 
included Paul B. Smith, the firm's president. "To their credit, they have 
stepped up. We're getting there. . . . But they have some more work to do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5,800 workers, Rocketdyne, a division of Seal Beach-based Rockwell 
International Corp., is the San Fernando Valley's largest aerospace employer. 
Rocketdyne also makes solar-based power systems for the space station, engines 
for rockets that launch commercial and military satellites, and other aerospace 
devices. NASA pays Rocketdyne about $350 million annually for shuttle work. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems prompted Goldin last spring to dispatch a dozen engineers and 
quality experts on an extraordinary monthlong inspection of Rocketdyne and its 
shuttle work. Each scrubbed launch costs NASA from $600,000 to $1 million.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; 19-YEAR-OLD MAN 
ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF MOTORIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man has been booked on suspicion of murder in the shooting death 
last week of a father as he drove his three daughters and a neighbor's child to 
school, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone tips from residents in the Oakwood area led to the arrest of Larry Burns 
of Venice, said Detective Cedric Wilder of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Pacific Division.Wilder said investigators have not determined a motive in the 
shooting of Anselmo Cruz, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, wearing a ski mask, allegedly approached Cruz's car and shot him 
several times as the children looked on. One child was slightly injured by a 
bullet fragment and the others suffered minor cuts from broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns is being held without bail at the Los Angeles County jail.

TOP AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution. It can seek court-imposed fines against polluters of $25 to

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COMMUNITY 
COLLEGE BOARD OKS PAY HIKES FOR 3 GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three of the largest employee groups in the Los Angeles Community College 
District will get 3% pay raises retroactive to January. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's seven-member board unanimously approved a pair of new 
three-year contracts with its faculty and staff unions and a separate action 
giving the same raise to unrepresented employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises approved Wednesday will be the first since the 1989-90 school year 
for permanent faculty, technical and clerical staff, and non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The faculty contract also provides a separate 5.7% raise in the hourly rate 
paid to part-time instructors who won't get the regular 3% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the financially strapped district said most of the money for the 
raises will come from $13 million in savings the district expects to achieve 
from health plan changes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EL SEGUNDO; SUSPECT 
HELD IN ATTEMPTED MURDER OF TRIAL WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Segundo police arrested a suspect this week they believe tried to kill a 
witness in the slaying case of an El Segundo City Councilman's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not release detailed information about the attack but said the 
witness came to police after the Feb. 9 slaying of Tairree Lynn West, 25, and 
reported hearing plans to rob the woman's apartment, said Police Sgt. Bill 
Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness was not a member of the West family, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four suspects in the slaying of West are being held without bail. They have 
been ordered to stand trial and are scheduled to be arraigned today in Torrance 
Superior Court on murder and attempted murder charges. They could face the 
death penalty if convicted in the slashing and strangulation death of West. The 
murder charge carries a special circumstance allegation that the killing was 
done during a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, Robert Brendon Foster and Linnette O'Neill Blocker, both 18; 
Marcus Terral Brewington, 19, and Erica Dawn Olson, 20, are also charged with 
the attempted murder of the dead woman's 12-year-old daughter, Ashley. The 
child was stabbed in the neck and left for dead, but managed to dial 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe robbery was one of the motives in the crime, and that West and 
Foster had been involved in a dispute.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MALLS 
CANNOT KEEP OUT PROTESTERS, ACLU SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Managers of shopping malls, today's version of the old town square, cannot 
legally keep out politicians or protesters as long as they obey the rules while 
they exercise their civil rights, according to the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something people should know, especially in an election year, when 
there'll be a lot of this going on," spokeswoman Mary Tokita said. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure, aimed at activists, mall managers, police and others, was released 
as the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California announced an 
out-of-court settlement in a dispute between a suburban shopping mall and a 
group seeking to decriminalize marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many groups that can afford the usual means of communication with 
the public," said ACLU attorney Robin Toma. "This is the way to ensure that the 
grass-roots activists, the people who have volunteers instead of money, also 
have a way to do battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure says that malls are prohibited from barring groups simply because 
they don't like the message. The message, however, cannot be obscene, nor can 
it be conveyed in "fighting words" that arouse anger or incite violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The out-of-court agreement resulted in the dropping of charges of trespassing 
and disturbing the peace against supporters of the 94 California Hemp 
Initiative, the ACLU said. They were arrested while seeking permission to 
circulate a petition at Antelope Valley Shopping Mall, the group said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FAMILY OF 
WOMAN SLAIN BY OFFICERS SEEKS $20 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of Sonji Danese Taylor, who was shot and killed by Los Angeles 
police officers last year, filed a $20-million claim against the city Thursday, 
alleging that officers used excessive force against her and then conspired to 
cover up their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time during the course of these events did Sonji Taylor pose a threat 
to . . . police officers, nor did she do anything to justify the force used 
against her," according to the claim, the first step toward filing suit against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they found Taylor on the roof of St. Vincent's Medical Center on 
the evening of Dec. 16, as she was holding a knife to her son and ranting 
incoherently. Police said she lunged at one officer with the knife and was shot 
10 times, seven times in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Craig Liedahl and Sgt. Michael Long fired the shots, and both are 
named in the claim. The case is under investigation by the Police Department, 
the FBI and the county district attorney's office. A grand jury has heard 
testimony in the case, but no charges have been filed. Department officials 
declined comment Thursday.

GAY LEADERS CONDEMN RULING IN BOY SCOUTS CASE; COURTS: L.A. UNIFIED BOARD 
MEMBER SAYS HE WILL TRY TO END THE ORGANIZATION'S ACCESS TO STUDENTS DURING THE 
SCHOOL DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting angrily to a state court decision, Los Angeles school board member 
and former Eagle Scout Jeff Horton said Thursday that he will press the school 
district to restrict the Boy Scouts' access to students during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am outraged," Horton said of a state Court of Appeal decision that upholds 
the Boy Scouts' right to exclude gay men from the ranks of Scoutmasters. "It is 
nothing short of discrimination and it will harm young people," declared 
Horton, who is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law requires schools to let groups such as the Boy Scouts use 
facilities after school, Horton said the district can take steps to bar the 
organization during school hours. He said it may simply be a matter of 
enforcing the Los Angeles Unified School District's existing policy forbidding 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton was of one of several gay leaders who bitterly condemned the 66-page 
court opinion, which gave a sweeping victory to the Boy Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message that is inherent in this decision is that being different is not 
allowed," said Teresa DeCrescenzo, executive director of Gay and Lesbian 
Adolescent Social Services in Los Angeles. "And any child who might discover 
that he is different has been put on notice and warned: Stay hidden, keep 
quiet, lie, be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said the 2nd Appellate District opinion, issued Tuesday in Los 
Angeles, was the highest ruling made so far on the volatile issue of whether 
openly gay men should be allowed to become Scout leaders. Several lawsuits have 
been filed challenging the Scouts' policy of barring gays -- a policy Boy Scout 
officials say they have every right to set. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased, obviously," Scouts spokesman Richard Walker said from the 
organization's national headquarters in Irving, Tex. "We are a private 
organization and we have the right to teach youth the traditional values we 
have taught them since 1910. We have maintained that all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents overwhelmingly tell us this is not a role model they want presented 
as even an alternative lifestyle to their children," Walker continued. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision, the appeals panel agreed with the Scouts' position that the 
organization is not a business and is therefore not bound by the state Unruh 
Civil Rights Act forbidding discrimination against gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that the court has recognized that the Unruh Act does 
not cover all organized human activity but is confined to the business or 
public accommodations area," said the Scouts' attorney, George Davidson. He 
added that the opinion had put the Scouts on strong legal footing to fight the 
expected appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-old lawsuit was filed by Timothy Curran, who vowed Thursday to 
pursue the case with attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am still a believer in the Scouting program," said Curran, a former Bay 
Area Eagle Scout who sued after the organization refused to let him become an 
assistant Scoutmaster for a Berkeley troop. "I now feel more strongly than ever 
that it's an excellent program run by people who haven't got a clue about what 
Scouting means or the American tradition of judging people individually instead 
of by their membership in a class." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a 32-year-old, free-lance television producer in Washington, Curran said 
his troop had no objection to having a gay leader. "The Scoutmaster of my troop 
and the parents in my troop and my fellow Scouts wanted me to stay. They were 
informed by the national council they had no choice in the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar case now being tried in San Diego, the Curran decision prompted 
the judge to recess the trial for a week to study the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 That case -- which stems from the Scouts' expulsion of El Cajon police Officer 
Chuck Merino -- thrust San Diego into the middle of the controversy over gay 
Scout leaders. A political firestorm erupted after Merino was summarily fired 
as a Scout leader in 1992 by Scouting officials who had learned he is 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 In protest, the El Cajon Police Department and the San Diego Police Department 
severed ties with the Boy Scouts and the San Diego school board moved to 
restrict the Boy Scouts from using school grounds during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Sheriff's Department, on the other hand, sided with the Scouts and 
hundreds of people -- including a county supervisor, a congressman and the 
undersheriff -- attended hastily arranged "Tribute to Scouting" rallies to 
voice support for the Scouts' stand against homosexuals.

1 KILLED, 1 HURT IN 'RAVE' PARTY SHOOTINGS; VIOLENCE: MORE THAN 100 YOUTHS WERE 
ATTENDING SPRING BREAK DANCE WHEN BRAWL ERUPTED AT WESTLAKE CLUB. ONE MAN IS 
ARRESTED ON MURDER CHARGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SECOND ATTACK.

<P>
 A 20-year-old man was shot to death and a teen-ager was wounded after a fight 
broke out during a spring break "rave" party at a Westlake club Thursday 
morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Martinez of Los Angeles, one of more than 100 young people who had 
gathered for a morning dance party at the Gotham Club in the 2800 block of 
Beverly Boulevard, was pronounced dead at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital 
shortly after the 10:30 a.m. brawl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another guest, Eddie Mendietta, 17, of Los Angeles was in stable condition at 
County-USC Medical Center after he was shot twice in the stomach, homicide 
Detective Andy Cicoria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicoria said the club had been rented for a dance party that was to have 
lasted throughout the morning. It had drawn scores of high school students from 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance -- which featured music played by a disc jockey and that was 
advertised on flyers -- had started about 9 a.m. "to accommodate the younger 
kids," Cicoria said. Typically, he said, such dances occur only on weekends, 
but this one was held on a weekday because many students were out of school for 
spring break. Known as "raves," such parties are organized by dance clubs and 
float from location to location. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour into the party, Cicoria said, a fight broke out and several 
"dance crews" from rival neighborhoods began shoving their way into the middle 
of the brawl. A shot was fired, and Mendietta staggered out the door and 
collapsed on the sidewalk, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd stampeded out of the club, he said, with one contingent fleeing west 
on Beverly Boulevard. On the sidewalk, Cicoria said, Martinez was confronted by 
another party guest -- Mark Norgren, 19 -- who whirled on Martinez and fired, 
hitting Martinez in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Two police officers saw Norgren start to flee, and arrested him on suspicion 
of murder, Cicoria said. Two other youths, a 14-year-old boy and a 15-year-old 
girl, were also held for questioning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at the club, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the party had 
been scheduled a month ago, and the rental contract had been signed by an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he could not recall the name of the group that had planned the event, 
but said that because the guests were going to be underage, the contract 
stipulated that no alcohol could be served. Guests also were to be frisked for 
weapons at the door, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out as just a little argument between two older guys, not school 
kids," he said. "Somebody went out to break it up, and a bunch of kids slipped 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, is apparently how an armed gunman managed to get into the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did their best to keep it together," he said, "but it got out of hand."

MIKE PENNER: JONES GETS WISH, NOW HE'S STUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jones: If he wanted a football coach who likes him, he got one in Barry 
Switzer, who couldn't keep his hands off Jones in their touchy-feely, I'm-OK, 
you're-OK, the-Cowboys-are-in-spectacular-shape press conference. Once, I 
thought Jones was going to straight-away keel when a giddy Switzer startled him 
with a good-buddy clap on the neck and began shaking the most powerful owner in 
the NFL like a rag doll. The bug-eyed expression on Jones' face spoke volumes 
-- "Oh my Lord, what have I done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Switzer: If Jones wanted a football coach who will drink with him, he 
got that in Switzer, too. Although, again, judging from that news conference 
("We got a job to do . . . and we're gon-NA DO IT!!!"), we'd have to say to 
Barry: All things in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson: Shed no tears for the Man of Varnish, for he's getting exactly 
what he wanted out of the deal, which is out of the deal. Johnson spent most of 
Super Bowl week dropping hints as large as manhole covers about wanting to 
leave Dallas and coach in Jacksonville, or Miami, or Tampa, or Charlotte -- 
basically, anywhere that Jones isn't. Because the next time Johnson builds a 
winner from the ground up, he wants no one horning in on the credit. Johnson 
was never going to kiss Jones' ring, which is all Jones demanded. Meanwhile, 
back in Dallas, down, Barry, down. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman: Expected to transfer any day now. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Irvin: He's not taking this well, and even before Switzer was hired, 
he was fretting about Johnson's successor. Why, Irvin panicked, they could 
bring in anyone. Even (gasp) "Chuck Knox, Ground Chuck" -- making it sound as 
if he'd just bitten into a rotten apple. Just wait until he sees the new 
playbook at Cowboys mini-camp. "Chapter One: The Wishbone Is Our Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Zampese: Or until he sees it. "I'm sorry, Troy, but I can't find a 
passing play anywhere in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Bosworth: Great time for comeback, I'd say. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL salary cap: Switzer's biggest obstacle coming in. There never was a 
cap at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL Today: They're dancing in New York . . . and in San Francisco . . . 
and in Green Bay . . . and in Buffalo. The Vince Lombardi Trophy has been 
liberated at last. 
</P>
<P>
 The Final Four: Handy, isn't it, how they grouped the stereotypes into two 
neat, easy-to-label brackets? Duke-Florida here, Arizona-Arkansas there. Great 
coaches here, great athletes there. So goes the pre-semifinal hype: 
Arizona/Arkansas ought to be able to run Duke/Florida out of the building, but 
Krzyzewski/Kruger will probably out-coach them. Sounds nice. Too bad Grant Hill 
and Nolan Richardson keep gumming up the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke: That said, Duke will win its third NCAA championship under Mike 
Krzyzewski because of Mike Krzyzewski. (Once you get this far, go with the best 
coach. Exceptions do apply once per decade, allowing for Dean Smith.) The 
Wooden comparisons are not sacrilegious; Krzyzewski's seven Final Fours in nine 
years -- with fewer scholarships to give and against much better competition -- 
are as impressive in their own way as Wooden's 10 national championships. This 
time around, Krzyzewski simply has more bodies than Florida and if he can 
devise a way to foil Glenn Robinson on less than 48 hours' notice, he should be 
able to think up something for the Runnin' Hogs by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Parks: He has developed into a shot-blocking terror in this 
tournament, as well as a good-luck charm for Grant Hill. Hill reports that the 
Blue Devils are 4-0 during tournaments or regionals when he and Parks room 
together. When they don't, such as this year's ACC Tournament in Charlotte, 
they lose to Virginia in the semifinals. "This time in Charlotte," Hill says, 
"I'm staying with Cherokee." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida: The dullest team in the Final Four. But, then, with a coach with a 
name like Lon Kruger, this is a surprise? 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky: He was positively flabbergasted when the Kings presented him 
with a $275,000 Rolls Royce to commemorate his record-breaking 802nd goal. So, 
too, were many of the visiting Mighty Ducks, who were watching a year's salary 
roll out there on the ice in front of them. Then again, what else does Bruce 
McNall have to do with his money? Besides paying back creditors? 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kariya: Why do I have this sinking feeling that a year from now, we'll 
pick up the morning paper and read, "Kariya's agent and the Ducks announced 
that they have suspended negotiations until further notice"? 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow: It seems far too soon to be giving up on him, but the Angels 
apparently have. Three months ago, he was the anchor on Whitey Herzog's 
so-hailed "Gold Glove infield." Now, half that infield -- Snow and Kevin Flora 
-- will start the season in Triple-A, unless Snow is traded or Dwight Smith is 
disabled. It also seems that Snow ought to command more on the market than 
Anthony Young, who is now the Cubs' problem, but when you demote the player, 
you do the same to his trade value. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff George: His trade to the Falcons means two things for the Rams. One, 
Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer cannot be had with the fifth pick in the draft, 
since No. 2 Indianapolis will draft one and No. 3 Washington will take the 
other. Two, in a division where rivals plan to start George and Jim Everett as 
their quarterbacks, Chris Miller now looks like the absolute picture of health.

RICHARDSON'S RAZORBACKS, THE TOAST OF ARKANSAS, TAKE TO NATIONAL STAGE

 What do you call a 47-year-old, 225-pound politician wearing a red plastic hog 
snout on his head? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. President. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the story no one can escape. Dyed- in- the- wool, voted- as- many- times- 
for- Bill- Clinton- as- they- could Democrats may wish the leader of the free 
world would stop draping himself over this team so they can get this basketball 
tournament over, but this is bigger than that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the year of the Hog. It's Hogmania. It's too much for one small, rural 
state to contain. It's going national. The beloved Hogs are headed back to the 
Final Four, not as a surprise as in 1990, when Oliver Miller, Todd Day and Lee 
Mayberry were sophomores and Duke gunned them out in the semifinals by 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 These Hogs are just as young -- of Coach Nolan Richardson's top nine players, 
five are freshmen or sophomores, none are seniors -- but they're the tournament 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask them if they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was totally different," Richardson says. "This team, the expectation has 
been there since the day they picked them No. 2 in one poll and 3 in another. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not an underdog, we're supposed to win because that's the expectation. 
So if you ask the question, what's going to happen, we're supposed to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas Holy Trinity is in it together. President Clinton brought the 
family to the Midwest Regional and promises to be in Charlotte. Bud Walton, the 
brother of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, gave the Hogs their proud, new 
20,000-seat building after all those years in little 7,000-seat Barnhill Arena. 
Now it's up to Rollin' Nolan to deliver the dream. 
</P>
<P>
 If only all 2 million Arkansans could go! What better fun than to take over 
some snooty city in red T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, caps and, for those 
entirely without pretension, the famous Hog hats, one of which Clinton allowed 
himself to be photographed in while governor? What better cultural exchange 
than to head for the bar at some swanky hotel like the Hyatt Regency across 
from Reunion Arena and fill the 20-story atrium with chants of "Soooooey, 
PIG!"? So what if city slickers like the Dallas Morning News' Blackie Sherrod 
run out all those Arkansas jokes ("What are the worst three years in an Arkie's 
life? Fourth grade.")? 
</P>
<P>
 At home, the Hogs average more than 20,000. The 35 luxury boxes, priced from 
$12,000 to $22,000, are sold through 1996. There's a 4,000-name waiting list 
for season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 A rich man's fortune can't assure him of a ticket from the school's 1,200-seat 
allotment for the Southeastern Conference tournament. There are reports Hog 
fans now buy Mississippi State season tickets, where a smaller donation will 
move them onto the priority list. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Hogs ever made the SEC final! 
</P>
<P>
 Despite years of excellence from Eddie Sutton to Richardson, something always 
happens. The Miller-Day-Mayberry team made the Final Four as sophomores and 
never made it back. The Hogs finished this season ranked No. 2 but were upset 
by Kentucky in the SEC tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 A lovesick state gazes soulfully at its coach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I could probably play a golf round in about an hour fifteen minutes and I 
could shoot 69 -- because when I get to 69, I'm going to quit. That's just the 
way I am. Pressure, pressure, pressure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt pressure was always on me, so why not put pressure on others?" 
-- Nolan Richardson 
</P>
<P>
 No, they aren't coming after him if he doesn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the way it was in 1985, when Arkansas still was in the Southwest 
Conference and Richardson took over from Sutton, becoming the first black coach 
of a major sport in that conference, promising the same "40 minutes of hell" he 
had featured at Tulsa -- and went 12-16, instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans wanted his job. There was a report that a cross was burned on his 
lawn. It didn't happen, but it appeared in a paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Richardson's daughter, Yvonne, was dying of leukemia and he was 
asking himself what he needed with these yahoos. He says he stayed because he 
owed it to Frank Broyles, the athletic director who had hired him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I found out what was the most important thing," Richardson says. 
"Basketball doesn't mean anything to me. It's my job, my occupation, but when I 
saw what happened seven years ago -- I really understand what life's all about 
now. And it's very, very short. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That man (Broyles) took a chance. I appreciate opportunity. Coach Broyles 
took a big chance on hiring Nolan Richardson in '85. Highest chance of an AD to 
take in the South, in the Southwest Conference, and I hadn't done my job for 
him. . . . I told him this on several occasions, 'You stick with me and I'll 
guarantee I'll turn it around.' That's why, if we win it, fine, if we don't, 
that's the way it goes. But I've got the program where I think I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes it. Everyone else fears it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Hogs were a regional power, recruiting mostly in Texas and Memphis, 
hoping to find the occasional player in Arkansas. Now Richardson goes as far 
afield as Oakland, where he snatched 6-foot-11 freshman Darnell Robinson out 
from under Cal's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to go back and say, 'It ain't like what they said it was like,' " 
Richardson says. "You come out here, it's basketball, education and, of course, 
we don't have a whole lot of city lights. There aren't a whole lot of things 
you can get into. You can play basketball and get you an education." 
</P>
<P>
 You can play basketball Nolan Richardson's way, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A poor kid from South El Paso, one of 11 raised by his grandmother after his 
parents died, he played for Don Haskins at Texas Western. He suffered the 
standard humiliations of the period, staying in a separate hotel when most of 
the team was in one that was whites-only. 
</P>
<P>
 Haskins was Bobby Knight without the abuse, a no-nonsense type who had learned 
his stuff from Hank Iba. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson took the no-nonsense part, junked the ball-control part and began a 
long, slow climb up the ladder: 10 years on the high school level in El Paso, 
three years at a junior college in Snyder, Tex., where he won a national title; 
five years at Tulsa, where he built a program, then Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson is 6-3, 240 pounds, with a booming bass voice and a speaker's gift. 
He would make dramatic pauses ordering into the speaker at a fast-food 
drive-up. When he talks, people listen and when he barks, his players jump. 
He's an old-fashioned taskmaster who whips his players into top condition, then 
has them over to the house for barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes jokes about race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't cut those lights off," he said at a Midwest Regional news conference 
when someone turned them down. "Hell, you won't see me up here. I'm not going 
to talk to a room and everybody's kind of wondering where the hell I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, he doesn't joke about race. 
</P>
<P>
 He glows with righteous fervor on whatever subject he is on, whether it's the 
opportunities black kids aren't getting, or the place in Arkansans' hearts they 
had for Sutton but deny him, or the burden black coaches still carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a stigma," Richardson says. "The only other coach I've 
ever seen talked about is John Thompson, who got a national championship. Once 
in a while I hear about John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're stereotyped. We don't coach real well, but we recruit real well. We're 
motivators. We're everything but a coach. When you hear 'em talk, you never 
hear what a great coach he is, it's always what a great motivator and what 
great athletes he has. . . . If I play the way I play, it's considered ghetto 
basketball or street ball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard all kinds of conversations on my kind of basketball. Rick (Pitino, 
Kentucky coach) and I are good friends, Rick runs and shoots and guns, but they 
call his uptempo. They gave it a name. You see what I'm saying?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Henry, sports editor of the Little Rock Democrat-Gazette, says 
Richardson has already won, that he owns the state lock, stock and barrel as 
Sutton never did, but that he doesn't realize it. Maybe if you came out of a 
ramshackle place in South El Paso, you wouldn't know it, either. For whatever 
reason, he still has the hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think getting to the Final Four is a great thing," he says, "but I'd like 
to win a national championship, I'll just be straight up and honest with you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean Final Four, I've been there. I tell my kids, 'I don't recruit to win 
the conference, I won a bunch of those. I recruit to win the big one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, he knows he'll be OK if it doesn't happen. In the meantime, he's up 
there, the booming voice rolling on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 An ABC crew wants to come behind the scenes for a "Nightline" piece? Are they 
sure they have enough tape? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Richardson says. "Shoot, I love it, hoss. I think that's what 
it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got here late. I'm behind in the race. I'm trying to catch up, so I'm 
enjoying it."

DREIFORT, PARK ARE MAJOR PLAYERS; FREEWAY SERIES: ANNOUNCEMENT DUE THAT BOTH 
HAVE MADE DODGERS. PARK WILL BECOME FIRST KOREAN IN THE BIG LEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Dodgers and Angels prepare for their traditional Freeway Series 
tonight, a very untraditional event is about to unfold. Pitcher Chan Ho Park is 
about to become the first Korean to play in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Park, 20, and hard-throwing relief pitcher Darren Dreifort, 21, will 
survive the final roster cuts and become the first Dodgers since Sandy Koufax 
to skip the minors.  
</P>
<P>
 The announcement could be made tonight at Dodger Stadium, where the first game 
of the three-game series will be played. Saturday and Sunday games will be 
played at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Park pitched Wednesday in Vero Beach, Fla., and is tentatively scheduled to 
pitch in relief on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In six starts this spring, Park gave up six earned runs in 23 innings for a 
2.35 earned-run average. He struck out 17 but had some trouble with walks and 
balks, the balks stemming from differences in rule interpretation here and in 
Korea on a hesitation in Park's pitching motion. Park has since stopped 
hesitating in his windup. 
</P>
<P>
 He will probably start the season in the bullpen but could be in the rotation 
very soon. Kevin Gross is coming back from shoulder tendinitis and has not been 
effective so far. Pedro Astacio has also been slowed this spring, although he 
looked promising in his last outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, the Dodgers' No. 1 draft pick last June, is effective in any bullpen 
role, but his future with the team is as a closer. Whenever he entered a game 
at Wichita State, he normally just stayed in until it was over. This spring, he 
compiled a 2.77 ERA and had Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski and catcher 
Mike Piazza singing his praises. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ball has more movement than any right-hander's I have ever seen," 
Perranoski said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Park and Dreifort have some seasoning ahead, and it might be difficult 
getting it in the majors. But the organization would rather keep them with the 
big club where they can both work with Perranoski and Manager Tom Lasorda, and 
where Park can adapt with relatives and the Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger front office will meet today to determine the final roster cuts, 
which have to be made by 9 p.m. Saturday. The waivers requested on Kip Gross 
and Rick Trlicek are up today, clearing the spots for Dreifort and Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder will probably open the season on the disabled list, and Mike 
Sharperson's power gives him the edge over Rafael Bournigal, who has an option 
left. The team also needs to decide what to do about the two left-handed 
relievers, Al Osuna and Gary Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, however, returned from Florida more optimistic than in some time. 
Besides the rookie pitchers, the team is strong offensively, having hit 40 home 
runs -- nine by Piazza -- in 27 games. They have played well defensively and 
have shown speed, led by Delino DeShields and rookie Raul Mondesi, the new 
right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have their roster set, with one exception. J.T. Snow is designated 
for triple-A Vancouver unless outfielder Dwight Smith is put on the disabled 
list. The team had a weak spring, but Manager Buck Rodgers is optimistic about 
the Angels' chances in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hold the edge in the Freeway Series with a 36-34-1 record. Rodgers, 
who was on the Angels when the series began in 1962, said it gave his team a 
big lift when they went 5-0 against the Dodgers in the first three series, 
after which the Dodgers bowed out until 1969.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big thing for us then, and there is still a certain elation when 
we go against them," Rodgers said. "I think both of us would like to win two of 
the three as a springboard into the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to pitch are Dodgers Orel Hershiser and Ramon Martinez against John 
Dopson, tonight at 7 p.m.; Tom Candiotti against Chuck Finley and Phil 
Leftwich, Saturday at 7 p.m. and Gross against Mark Leiter, Sunday at 1 p.m.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S AND WOMEN'S FINAL FOURS; SPEED DEMON; NORTH 
CAROLINA'S MARION JONES GETS TAR HEELS OUT FRONT FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much, probably too much, is made of height in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, speed and quickness can still break the hearts of the tallest 
giraffes. Just ask the 31 foes of North Carolina's women's team whose dreams of 
victory were stolen by Marion Jones of Thousand Oaks and Chapel Hill, N.C.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones is the freshman point guard for the Tar Heels (31-2), who play Purdue 
(29-4) here Saturday at the women's Final Four. In the first semifinal, 
Louisiana Tech (30-3) plays Alabama (26-6). 
</P>
<P>
 When you play basketball against Marion Jones, hold onto your wallet.  
</P>
<P>
 The greatest female high school sprinter in U.S. history, she's now the 
fastest player in women's college basketball. If opposing coaches had their 
way, she would be forced to wear ankle weights, just to keep it fair.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Virginia Coach Debbie Ryan, "When North Carolina beat Connecticut at the 
East Regional, Marion stole the ball from Carla Beruby at half-court, and she 
had her layup underway literally before Beruby got turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jim Foster of Vanderbilt, "When you play North Carolina, you go in 
figuring Jones is going to get about three uncontested layups, and in close, 
low-scoring games, that's huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, at 5-10, had 105 steals this season and is already sixth on UNC's 
all-time list, with three seasons to go.  
</P>
<P>
 She averages 14.3 points and, largely because of the layups she gets with her 
speed and quickness, is shooting 53.1% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Foster, "If you're guarding her and you let her get that dribble 
underway, you've got a big problem. To her, that first basketball step is just 
like coming out of the starting blocks.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's explosiveness, that's her training in sports -- and she's carried it 
over to basketball. Her basketball skills really aren't particularly great, but 
her foot and hand speed make up for a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan added, "She changes your preparation for a game. Because of Jones, you 
don't play North Carolina like you do other teams. If one of your wing players 
has the ball, she absolutely can't pass it to the top of the key, not if Jones 
is there. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a great anticipator. She's getting really good at picking her spots to 
turn on that speed. She's one of the quickest players I've ever seen, and her 
flat-out running speed . . . I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Makes you wonder if Carl Lewis ever considered basketball.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones' speed, as well as senior Tonya Sampson's -- she leads the Tar Heels 
with 112 steals -- has not only been an equalizer for North Carolina, it has 
put the Tar Heels in the Final Four.  
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina got here by beating Connecticut in the East final, 81-69, 
despite being outrebounded, 40-34. With Sampson and Jones, however, North 
Carolina forced 30 turnovers. And Jones had four steals, Sampson six. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had eight steals in her first and third games for North Carolina. So 
what does she think about her team being in the Final Four? 
</P>
<P>
 And what does North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell think of her Southern 
California recruiting prize? 
</P>
<P>
 No comment. That's right.  
</P>
<P>
 Hatchell wasn't talking Thursday, and The Times was not allowed to speak to 
Jones. The explanation? "We're too busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones won nine state high school track and field championships at Oxnard Rio 
Mesa and Thousand Oaks High, in the 100, 200 and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not only the national high school record-holder at 200 meters, at 22.58 
seconds, but she ran eight of the nine fastest 200s ever. She had a best of 
11.14 in the 100, .01 off Chandra Cheeseborough's record, and six of the 
fastest 11. She took up the long jump her senior year and leaped 22 feet 
one-half inch -- tying the third-best mark ever. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, according to North Carolina's sprint coach, Curtis Frye, Jones 
will run the 100, 200, maybe the 400, and will compete in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 And naturally, Frye wonders if the basketball season will ever end.

MIKE DOWNEY: NO FOOLING! CHARLOTTE'S THE FINAL STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frankly, Charlotte: 
</P>
<P>
 -- I don't know how college basketball will go over, this being more of a pro 
football town. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Practically everybody is picking Arizona to win the national championship. 
(Note today's date.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas, Arizona, Duke and Florida? Ouch, this four isn't exactly fab, is 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saturday's predictions: Big Pigs over Untamed Felines, Off-Color Followers 
of Satan over Swamp Creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't worry, CBS will break into Final Four coverage whenever necessary 
with up-to-the-minute news about Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The amazing thing isn't that Glenn Robinson would want to go back to 
school. The amazing thing is that he would want to go back to Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yinka Dare from George Washington University is turning pro. I predict he 
will become a big star before the Yinka's dry on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Did anybody send a limo to pick up Duke Coach Shushevski? 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are more pictures of Michael Jordan at the airport here than there 
are of Orville and Wilbur Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sad thing is, some kid somewhere is asking somebody else: "Orville and 
Wilbur Wright -- who do they play for?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that the Arizona Wildcats are 
about to change their name to the Tucson Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- My Final Five continues to include Arkansas, Arizona, Duke, Florida and 
Indiana. If you don't like it, you can hang Bob Knight upside-down and kiss his 
Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gambling is the worst problem in college basketball, according to USA Today 
handicapper Danny Sheridan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Las Vegas, the Florida Gators are the heavy favorites to be the only 
ones who can name five Florida players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I can never remember, did Lon Kruger play the werewolf or the killer from 
Elm Street? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Florida-Arizona final could settle this Grapefruit-Cactus argument, once 
and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I wouldn't want to say Arizona's Reggie Geary talks a lot, but I'm betting 
before this weekend is up, Dick Vitale yells at him, "Would you please shut 
up?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lute Olson could lose by a point and blame the media. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas star Corliss Williamson was one of the top 10 vote-getters for the 
Classic Games John R. Wooden All-American team. I personally believe that if 
you threw one basketball into a room with all 10 vote-getters, Corliss 
Williamson would come out with it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you know how Williamson shaves his head? With a Corliss razor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you know how Coach Nolan Richardson recruited Williamson? On a Corliss 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The real surprise here in Charlotte is that any of these four teams could 
beat the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only good thing about Purdue's Robinson being gone from the tournament is: 
No more "Big Dog" jokes. You know what I mean. No "Big Dog Beats Hogs." No "Big 
Dog Chases Wildcats." No "Gators Snap at Big Dog." No "Big Dog Shaved With 
Corliss Razor." You know. Bad jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of big dogs, Mike Krzyzewski is such a good coach, he could 
probably take Marmaduke to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Just think, only three more NBA lottery picks in their lineup and the 
California Bears might have won their regional. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I am now pretty sure that the only reason UCLA didn't advance is because 
its scouting report on Tulsa was delivered by mistake to Cheryl Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones would have replaced John Wooden as UCLA 
coach after two championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dear Coach Wooden: I was only kidding about Purdue.

RUTHLESS STREAK; WHEN ANGEL CENTER FIELDER CHAD CURTIS SAYS HE'LL DO ANYTHING 
TO WIN, HE MEANS IT

 Chad Curtis was sitting in his adult Sunday school class when he felt that 
familiar sensation.  
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't be happening, he thought. Not here at the First Baptist Church in 
his hometown of Middleville, Mich. Not over this friendly board game that he 
was playing with his friends -- men vs. women, for nothing more than bragging 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 So, OK, the women were beating them pretty bad, yelling out all the correct 
answers. They were even starting to giggle about the ease of their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when it started. Curtis felt the blood rushing to his head. He breathed 
deeply and fast, called time out, gathered the men together, and unveiled his 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out a way we could turn the cards so we could read them," Curtis 
said. "I was just trying to get us back into the game. I mean, they were 
crushing us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I got home when I realized what I had just done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife, 'Can you believe it? I cheated because I hate the thought of 
losing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done things I've been embarrassed about later, and I know I get too 
intense, but that might have been my all-timer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty bad about that one." 
</P>
<P>
 To Curtis, playing a game, any game, is a test of strength, intelligence and 
guts. No matter how frivolous, the goal is the same: May the most ruthless 
competitor win. 
</P>
<P>
 This insatiable desire to win might seem a twisted way of thinking, but for 
Angel center fielder Chad Curtis it has become a necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, for Curtis, the difference in possibly being a star instead of a 
journeyman ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a compulsive baseball player," Curtis said. "I always feel I have to win. 
Losing drives me crazy. I've got to go at everything with full intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at guys like Ken Griffey Jr. He can play up to half of his potential, 
and be an All-Star. When he reaches his full potential, he's a Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do that. I've got to play up to my full potential. I use that as a 
strength, not a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I think Pete Rose and I are a lot alike. He hustles. He wants to 
win. He's not of big stature, never had a lot of talent, but he has more hits 
than anybody in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Pete Rose has abundantly more talent than I do. There's some 
people in the Hall of Fame that can't do the things I can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and say I'm going to be in the Hall of Fame, but 
every day I put my uniform on, I'm going to say, 'I'm a Hall of Fame-caliber 
player.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can tell me any different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The game of baseball tried to exclude Curtis. He was too short. Too slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was never blatant about its feelings, but politely let him know that 
he wasn't really one of its kind, waiting until the 45th round in 1989 to even 
draft him.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was three days after the draft before the Angels even bothered to call 
me," Curtis said. "Even then, they said they didn't want me. They just wanted 
my rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually had to convince them to sign me, and they're the ones who drafted 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis was incensed, but the more he thought about it, why should this be any 
different?  
</P>
<P>
 He was the meanest, toughest kid on the football field at Benson High in 
Arizona, but when you're 5-feet-9 and 155 pounds, no one pays much attention 
until that first big hit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was that game against Morenci High when the Morenci game plan simply was 
to dump off passes to their 6-4, 225-pound tight end, telling him to bowl over 
Curtis time after time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what they had in mind," Curtis said. "The first time they ran it, I 
had a 10-yard head of steam, and I hit him with everything I had. They never 
ran that play again the rest of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the game his senior year when rival Willcox running back Johnny 
Adana vowed that he would upstage Curtis and take over the league rushing lead. 
He even predicted Curtis would be knocked out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big mistake," Curtis said. "Always let a sleeping dog lie. First play of the 
game, I gave him a full-body shot, and never heard from him the rest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have been small, but I made you pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis had no scholarship offers to play football beyond high school, and was 
prepared to be a walk-on at the University of Arizona. Then he stopped at a 
restaurant and saw tables full of baseball players from Yavapai Community 
College in Prescott, Ariz. He boldly walked up to the coach, asked if he could 
try out. He made the team, and batted .360 with 30 runs batted in. He spent the 
next season at Cochise Community College, batting .407 with 15 homers and 71 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he failed to get a full scholarship from a major university. He kept 
weighing offers from Grand Canyon College against a quarter-scholarship to 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I needed to go to someplace where I could be recognized," Curtis 
said. "Then I realized what better place than Canyon because Tim Salmon was 
there. I figured, if scouts were going to come out and see Tim, they had no 
choice but to see Chad Curtis." 
</P>
<P>
 It was good thinking. Salmon attracted about 30 scouts a game, batting .356 
with 19 homers and 68 RBIs, prompting the Angels to draft him in the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis had an even better season, batting .369 with 19 homers, 83 RBIs, and 36 
steals. Scouts promised that he would be selected in the first 10 rounds. He 
stuck around until the Angels took him in the 45th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something, I think that was the best thing that happened to him," 
said Salmon, Curtis' best friend on the team. "There were no expectations. It 
was like, 'Who is this kid?' He was the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina: "I think he uses that to his advantage 
even today. It's what motivates him, to prove to everybody they made a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 It took less than three years for Curtis to prove he belonged, out-hustling 
everyone to the top. Everything in his life was done at full speed. He even 
wore his baseball uniform at his wedding, just to ensure he would not be late 
for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I had to be on the field at 2 and our wedding got pushed back to 1:30," 
Curtis said. "I didn't have any choice but to take off my suit and put on my 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was me, my wife, my mother-in-law and the judge standing in the 
courtroom. He had to borrow his secretary to be a second witness. People think 
it's strange, but I think it's kind of neat our marriage is tied into 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, 25, says that marriage has mellowed him, but he still is probably the 
most intense player in baseball. The biggest difference now, Salmon says, is 
that Curtis no longer flings the remote control, chairs and tables across the 
room when he loses in Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me," said Salmon, his former roommate, "it got pretty ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Said DiSarcina: "He's actually loosened up quite a lot. Before, he'd get so 
frustrated, he'd lose his mind and just go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as when he was coming up through the minor leagues, Curtis relies on 
hustle and intelligence. He brings his own scouting book to the bench, having 
noted which pitchers have a quick delivery and what a pitcher will throw at 
particular times in the count. Although he is not an exceptional runner, his 
instincts have enabled him to steal 91 bases in his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to talk all the time in the minors about how guys don't prepare 
themselves, and how they don't hustle," Salmon said. "He used to tell me, 
'That's fine by me. That's just one less guy I have to worry about getting to 
the big leagues.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Curtis: "The way I look at it, there's a lot of guys who have more talent 
than I do. So if everybody played the game with the same intensity I have, I 
wouldn't have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 This guy who has been overlooked most of his life, today is considered the 
Angels' catalyst. Their hopes for a division title might hinge on his success 
as a leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine by me, because I want to establish myself as the guy who gets the 
team going," said Curtis, who batted .285 and scored 94 runs in 152 games last 
season. "I want to be that guy. It doesn't matter how I do in a game, I could 
go four for five, and I'll still try to find a way to blame myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned now that I can't control my performance when I play, but I can 
control how hard I play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to make baseball my No. 1 priority in life, that's why I try to use 
Pete Rose as an example. On the field, I want to be the kind of player he was. 
Off the field, I don't want to be the way he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I'd like to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to thank him."

DUCKS HOPE TO GET MAXIMUM SCORING BY SIGNING PROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks introduced a fuzzy-cheeked, goal-scoring phenom during a 
press conference Thursday afternoon, but his name wasn't Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxim Bets, 20, signed a three-year contract believed to be worth about 
$325,000 per year.Bets, of Chelyabinsk, Russia, had 116 points (46 goals and 70 
assists) in 63 games this season for Spokane of the Western Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 He was acquired in the March 21 trade that sent defenseman Alexei Kasatonov to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we made the deal was that we could have got a third-round pick 
from Pittsburgh, but we couldn't get a player as good as Max," Duck General 
Manager Jack Ferreira said. "He was one of the guys we had rated in the top 25 
going into last year's entry draft." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Kariya contract talks apparently stalled at least until the World 
Championships April 25-May 8 in Italy, the Ducks worked quickly to get Bets 
into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira liked what he saw of Bets -- the WHL rookie of the year in 1992-93 
and a teammate of unsigned draft pick Valeri Karpov with Traktor Chelyabinsk in 
1991-92 -- during a scouting trip to Spokane earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we look at it, from the blue line in he really has a nose for the 
net," Ferreira said. "Whether or not he's ready (to play in the NHL) in 
September we'll have to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks plan to have Bets practice with the team and travel on next week's 
three-game trip to Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. Whether he plays is up to 
Coach Ron Wilson, who will evaluate Bets' progress. It's then likely he'll join 
the San Diego Gulls for the International Hockey League playoffs. ELLIOTT

DEPENDABLE DOLLAS; MIGHTY DUCK DEFENSEMAN DOESN'T GRAB SPOTLIGHT, BUT STILL 
SHINES FOR TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If you don't notice Mighty Duck defenseman Bobby Dollas, it's not your fault. 
He operates in a hazy world, unseen but never unappreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There he is now, draped on the back of King forward Jari Kurri along the far 
corner boards. 
</P>
<P>
 And there, shoving Eric Lindros of Philadelphia away from the crease. 
</P>
<P>
 And there, sliding in front of a blistering blue-line slap shot from Detroit's 
Paul Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollas is in those pictures only because he's mixing it up with someone easy 
to focus on, usually a goal-scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
 He has emerged this season as the epitome of a defensive defenseman. But 
because he's playing in the shadows, doing all the dirty jobs that come his 
way, it's tough to notice his standout play. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, this is Dollas' finest NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has established career highs with nine goals and 20 points and he leads the 
Ducks with a plus-19 plus-minus rating. 
</P>
<P>
 His contributions go far beyond mere numbers on a page, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollas is steady, dependable, versatile and so much better than the Ducks 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Given more ice time, more responsibility with the first-year Ducks, Dollas has 
responded like never before in a career that includes stops at Winnipeg, Quebec 
and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding his niche for once in his career was crucial to Dollas' success this 
season, Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to stay at home defensively and move the puck quickly and that's 
what he's done," Wilson said. "Your job as a coach is to identify what a player 
can do best. You can't ask small guys to be physical and big guys to be 
goal-scorers." 
</P>
<P>
 It boils down to playing to one's strengths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Dollas camped out at the blue line, playing the old-style, physical defense 
Wilson wanted. He took his shots, picked his spots, and did what was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sense pushing the offensive envelope. Dollas realized he wouldn't 
win a job with end-to-end rushes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to training camp and they probably figured I would be the sixth 
defenseman," said Dollas, who was taken from Detroit in the expansion draft 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a role. I want to be on the ice in that crucial time. Bryan Murray 
(Detroit's General Manager) said something I'll always remember. He said it 
takes courage to score goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a defenseman, Dollas focused on the courage part of the message and 
applied it to the rest of his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to want the puck," Dollas said. "You have to have courage to want 
that puck." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Dollas began to improve, and it was no longer a leap of 
faith for Wilson to insert Dollas into the most difficult situations. And as 
Dollas became more comfortable, his confidence grew and he began playing that 
much better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence comes with ice time," veteran defenseman Randy Ladouceur said. 
"(Players) like to know they are going to be out there every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby's played real well for us, real steady. He does a lot of things for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "I can put him in any situation." 
</P>
<P>
 That's nothing new for Dollas. What's different is that it's happening in the 
NHL this season instead of the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Dollas played for Adirondack of the American Hockey League, 
Detroit's minor-league affiliate, and was nothing short of brilliant. In 64 
games, he scored seven goals, added 36 assists and had a plus-minus rating of 
plus-53. 
</P>
<P>
 But he played only six games with the Red Wings and they decided not to 
protect him in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollas wasn't bitter, but wasn't happy that Murray didn't have more faith in 
his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, a fresh start was what Dollas needed most of all. He knew he 
wasn't washed up and when the Ducks made him their eighth pick, he got a chance 
to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to fighting for a job during training camp, Dollas had to 
battle the prevailing perception that he was a good minor-leaguer but not an 
every-day NHL defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always, that was the attitude of a lot of people," he said. "I was a good 
minor-league player. If somebody got hurt, well, they could always bring up 
Bobby Dollas. He's steady. He won't hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when Dollas was in the Quebec organization, two defensemen went down 
with injuries. The call went out for Dollas, who came up from the minors to 
fill in for a game against the Nordiques' bitter rivals, the Montreal 
Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two guys then said, 'We're OK now,' " Dollas said. 
</P>
<P>
 They played poorly and Montreal routed Quebec, "something like, 6-1," 
according to Dollas. The Nordiques lost badly in their next game, then sent 
Dollas back to the minors without ever suiting him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Final self-evaluation probably won't come until season's end, when Dollas has 
time to reflect on his first year in Anaheim. But for now, with only six games 
left, he's pleased to have made such an impact for the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been the most gratifying," he said. "More and more I've been a 
go-to guy. There's a lot of satisfaction in that."

JORDAN'S NEW CAREER TAKES OFF IN DOUBLE-A; BASEBALL: FORMER NBA GREAT BELIEVES 
PLAYING WITH BIRMINGHAM WILL MAKE OR BREAK HIM AS A BASEBALL PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan will begin his career as a pro baseball player at Double-A 
Birmingham of the Southern League, where his longest road trip will be a 
12-hour bus ride and his meal money will be $16 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago White Sox assigned Jordan to the Birmingham Barons on Thursday, 
and said he will play his first game April 8 at home against the Chattanooga 
Lookouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a level where I'll either make myself or break myself," Jordan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Barons, however, he'll play for the White Sox against the 
crosstown Cubs in the annual Windy City Classic on April 7. Then, he'll trade 
in the high-life luxury of the majors for the daily grind of the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, when you're a first-year player, you only make $850 a month," 
White Sox general manager Ron Schueler said. "He's not going to be buying many 
meals now. It will be interesting to see him get on that bus for the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 That means dinner breaks at places like McDonald's, Waffle House and Cracker 
Barrel. The Barons will spend a lot of nights in Holiday Inns -- they used to 
stay at the Super 8 in Huntsville, Ala., but have changed hotels this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest road trip for Jordan and the Barons will be to Orlando, about 525 
miles and 12 hours on the bus. It's about the same distance to Jacksonville, 
and maybe 10 hours to Zebulon, N.C., home of the Carolina Mudcats. 
</P>
<P>
 While the life may not be glamorous, it's what Jordan and the White Sox 
wanted. At Triple-A Nashville, he might have been overmatched at the start; at 
Class A Hickory, N.C., or South Bend, Ind., it might've been too tough to tell 
how he measured up. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan played for Class A Prince William, Va., on Thursday and went zero for 
four against Pittsburgh's farm team from Salem, Va. He is four for 26 in seven 
minor-league games. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie right fielder was three for 20 with four walks and a sacrifice fly 
in major league exhibitions for the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really looking forward to it, hitting-wise," Jordan said. "The 
competition will certainly get me prepared so I know where I need to be. 
Hopefully it is competitive, and hopefully I'll respond well to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main objective," he said, "is to do well as long as I can and let them 
decide if I'm good enough to move up."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / DAILY REPORT; MEN; BOYCOTT TALK NOT QUITE OVER WITHOUT 
MINORITY CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While emphasizing that "the healing has begun," USC's George Raveling said 
Thursday there still exists the possibility of a future boycott by basketball 
coaches if changes aren't made in NCAA minority policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a National Assn. of Basketball Coaches' press conference in 
Charlotte, N.C., Raveling was quick to praise a recent federally mediated 
agreement between the NCAA and the Black Coaches Assn. In that agreement, the 
NCAA promised to review, among other things, its initial eligibility standards 
for student-athletes, its hiring practices for upper hierarchy positions, its 
position on a fourth year of eligibility for non-qualifiers and its legislation 
concerning access to players during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Raveling, a prominent member of both the BCA and the NABC, said the 
black coaches' organization definitely would have boycotted games had an 
agreement not been reached. Asked to describe the specifics of such a boycott, 
Raveling said he couldn't because, "we might have to use it in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo: "If no changes are made, absolutely 
(there will be a boycott)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting nearby was James Haney, NABC executive director, who tried to downplay 
the threat of a future walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone," Haney said of the animosity between the coaches and the NCAA. 
"History is history. You can't deny it existed. But we're moving on." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Raveling and Carlesimo said they expect significant and favorable 
legislative adjustments at the next NCAA convention in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling based his prediction "on dialogue I've had with people in both 
groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo was even more upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get where we are now, to me, is an absolute incredible accomplishment," 
said Carlesimo, who serves on the NABC's board of directors. "Yeah, I think 
(the NCAA) is going to take a hard look (at the issues). I think there's going 
to be an incredible amount of change." 
</P>
<P>
 One topic that won't go away: restoration of a 14th scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's a dead issue," Raveling said. "I think that will be an 
issue revisited at the next convention." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA Executive Director Cedric Dempsey met with reporters Thursday. Among the 
highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dempsey echoed the words of Raveling, saying the mediated agreement was 
only the beginning of the negotiating process. He also said the powerful 
Presidents Commission had made "no commitment that any of those issues would be 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the threat of a boycott, Dempsey said the NCAA never devised a 
contingency plan to deal with a tournament walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A newly formed NCAA education services division will begin operation as 
soon as a director can be hired. Watching closely, no doubt, will be the BCA, 
which has pushed for greater minority representation in the NCAA administrative 
offices.

 Dempsey wouldn't guarantee that a minority would be hired for the position, 
but he did say, "We are committed to increasing diversity."

<P>
 -- Interviews have been completed with athletes concerning their thoughts on a 
possible Division I-A football playoff. Those players have expressed concern 
about lengthening the season, the loss of free time and the question of 
remuneration for their services in such a playoff system. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dempsey, the earliest a playoff bracket could be put into place 
would be the 1995-96 season. Even then, there might not be time to negotiate 
television and radio rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be looking at two years down the line in order to put it into place," 
Dempsey said of the possible football championship.

 The NABC announced the formation of a 10-member USA Select Team made up 
entirely of college senior players. 
</P>
<P>
 The NABC-sponsored team will be coached by Massachusetts' John Calipari, who 
will help whittle the long list of 40 candidates to the final cut. The team, 
which will assemble May 24, then travels to Portugal, France, Spain and Italy 
for games against those countries' national entries in June. GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

FOR JOHNSEN, STEALING TIME IS ALL THE TIME; SOFTBALL: SOUTHERN SECTION RECORD 
WILL FALL SOON TO WOODBRIDGE CENTER FIELDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Alison Johnsen reaches first base and looks into the catcher's eyes. Looks for 
doubt. Looks for fear. Looks for an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen likes to know what she's facing. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing Johnsen does is get in a sprinter's position -- her left foot 
on the bag, her right foot in foul territory. Then she steals. It's almost a 
sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 She has done so 172 times in her career at Woodbridge High. On Saturday at the 
Woodbridge Classic at Harvard Park, or sometime next week, she'll reach 178, 
and when she does, she will be the Southern Section's all-time career leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven times has anyone thrown her out. Through 15 games, she has stolen 
31 bases. Tenth-ranked Woodbridge (12-3) reached the Woodbridge Classic 
quarterfinals last weekend with Johnsen's perfect performance in a doubleheader 
sweep: She went six for six, scored six runs and stole eight bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record isn't important as long as I get my team to where we need to be," 
Johnsen said. "As long as we keep winning, the record will come. It doesn't 
matter if I get it this weekend or next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Stealing a base is) crucial to the team and helps out a lot, but for me to 
steal, the batter (who is) up has to do her part, and for that it's a team 
effort even though I'm the one stealing the base." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen praised Liz Lemire, a freshman second baseman batting behind her in 
the order, for helping her along this season: "She'll have to fake bunt or 
swing late, or move to the back of the box to distract the catcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen was the only junior from California recognized as a 1993 All-American 
by FastPitch Magazine, and it's easy to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Johnsen batted .473 and stole a section-record 63 bases, eclipsing 
the record 59 set by Calvary Baptist's Carla Black in 1988. She is a three-time 
All-Southern Section first team selection and a two-time member of the Times 
All-County team. Next year, she'll play for national power Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 She's batting .647 this season and has a career average of .457. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen, a 5-foot-6 1/2 center fielder who bats left-handed, has exceptional 
raw speed and quickness, and says she's helped along by an adrenaline rush 
"that just pushes me over." 
</P>
<P>
 She has come quite a way from her freshman year, when she just hoped to play 
her best, get to know some people and win a few games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought it would carry to this extent at all," Johnsen said. "I 
remember after my freshman year (and stealing 37 bases), I thought, 'There's no 
way I could ever steal (177) many bases.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge Coach Alan Dugard told her earlier this year the career record was 
within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just keep your skills up, get on base and be ready to steal and you'll 
probably be able to do it in half a season," Dugard said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. Johnsen should push 200 by the time the playoffs end. Her goals, 
however, involve victories: she wants to win a Southern Section title, which 
the Warriors won her sophomore year. They were upset in last year's 
quarterfinals despite being the top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen gives Woodbridge a scoring opportunity every time she bats. A single, 
a stolen base, a sacrifice bunt and a ground ball will score her. And if 
there's an out, she might steal her way to third base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on first base trying to determine what the catcher is thinking," Johnsen 
said. "Either she's thinking, 'I'm going to get her,' or 'Am I going to get 
her?' If she questions herself, it's going to make it hard for her. When they 
look at me on first base, I can see it in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she has been thrown out twice this season -- as many as all of 
last season -- Johnsen isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're preparing for me beforehand," she said. "I feel I'm a marked man." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it hardly matters. On the Run

BIRMINGHAM'S LINCOLN COMMITS TO BRING VERSATILITY TO NORTHRIDGE TRACK PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Lincoln of Birmingham High, one of the region's most versatile track and 
field performers, has made a verbal commitment to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln finished fifth in the high jump in last year's state championships and 
has a personal best of 6 feet 10 inches in the event.He also has bests of 15.1 
seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles, 21-8 1/2 in the long jump and 45-10 in 
the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go into the decathlon in college," Lincoln said. "That's probably 
my top priority right now. That's why I've been concentrating less on the high 
jump this season and more on some of the other events." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln cleared 6-10 to win the high jump -- and defeat Jeremy Fischer of 
Camarillo -- in the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena in February, but 
he has not jumped higher than 6-8 since. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Lincoln helped Birmingham to a second-place finish in the City 
Section championships by placing second in the high jump, fourth in the long 
jump and triple jump, and sixth in the 110 high hurdles. JOHN ORTEGA

THREE GIRLS FROM ALEMANY RECEIVE ALL-STATE BASKETBALL RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samantha Rigley, Carly Funicello and Kelly McKay, who helped Alemany High 
reach the Southern Section Division II-A girls' championship game, have been 
named to the Cal-Hi Sports all-state basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany is one of the top girls' teams in California, so the talented trio 
could be piling up awards for another year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley, a 5-foot-10 guard, was named the girls' state junior player of the 
year. McKay, a 5-10 forward, was named to the all-underclass junior team and 
Funicello (6-3) was named to the all-underclass sophomore team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley and Funicello also were selected to the All-Division II team, which is 
based on enrollment. Mikko Giordano of Buena, a 6-foot senior forward, was 
named to the All-Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's 5-7 junior guard Ember Brown and 6-1 sophomore center Nicole 
Greathouse of Buena also were named to their all-underclass teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Four boys' players from the region were selected to all-underclass teams, led 
by twins Jason (6-8) and Jarron Collins (6-7), a pair of highly regarded 
front-court players from Harvard-Westlake. Guards Brock Jacobsen (6-4) of 
Crescenta Valley and Arthur Lee (6-0) of North Hollywood made the 
all-underclass junior team. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Alex Lopez (6-10) of Campbell Hall was named to the All-Division 
V team and Damian Cantrell (6-4) of Santa Clara made All-Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Johnson (6-5) of Crenshaw, who played for two seasons at Montclair Prep, 
made the all-state third team. STEVE ELLING

MACHO MEN READY TO RUMBLE; VAN NUYS' 5-5 1/2 BUFFO MUSCLES UP FOR 'WORLD'S 
TOUGHEST MAN' TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, let's size up the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top competitors, a 26-year-old construction worker from Alabama 
with Butterbean as his nom de guerre , goes 6-feet-2 and more than 300 pounds. 
The guy, whose real name is Eric Esch, likes to knock silly whoever jumps in 
the ring with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, from assorted walks of life, display the same tendencies and eagerness 
to inflict pain. After all, that's the point of the "World's Toughest Man" 
boxing tournament: flatten others before they flatten you. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter, says Jim Buffo of Van Nuys. Neither good old Butterbean nor 
anyone else has ever come across someone with his quickness or devastating left 
hook. And they probably haven't faced anyone who is 5-5 1/2 and a mere 215 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's the gap in the tale of the tape between Buffo, 32, and Butterbean. 
But Buffo, a former junior college All-American football player at Valley 
College, says that neither those with funky nicknames nor simple Joes will stop 
him from winning the title in a boxing competition that is more barroom brawl 
than pugilistic work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to come to fight," Buffo says. "Usually, when the people in my 
family come to fight, it turns out pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffo knows about the fighting game. He is the nephew of the Goossen brothers, 
who from their gyms in the Valley have guided young boxers such as Michael Nunn 
and Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas to stardom. It's an environment that Buffo 
believes has prepared him well to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are steppingstones to navigate before making it to the finals in 
mid-May in Las Vegas, where Butterbean, last year's runner-up, might be 
waiting. First, Buffo must qualify at the West regional that starts today in 
Phoenix. That one is not exactly a walkover. 
</P>
<P>
 The format calls for 40 fighters (anyone who has organized amateur or 
professional experience cannot compete) to square off in 20 randomly selected 
first-round bouts. Each bout consists of three one-minute rounds or until one 
fighter can't continue. The slugging concludes the next day -- when the 
participants can be involved in as many as four matches -- until there is one 
survivor. From there, the regional winner advances to the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the regional, the champion will receive a suitcase filled with $5,000 in 
$20 bills. The prize money for the finals at the MGM Grand Hotel has not been 
announced, but it probably will compare favorably to the $50,000 first-place 
prize awarded in last year's competition at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Atlantic 
City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a nice chunk of change that Buffo wouldn't mind bringing home to Cathy, 
his wife of five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be our ticket to get the down payment on a house and to start a 
family," Buffo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being around family is something Buffo, the second oldest of four brothers and 
one sister, knows as well as boxing. His father, Denny, is a private 
investigator and his mother, Ellorie, is one of two sisters to Joe, Greg and 
the rest of the Ten Goose clan of boxing fame. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Joe and his brothers, Buffo's uncles, who first taught their nephew to 
fight. Well, to survive was more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get down on my knees when we were kids and just hammer him," said 
Joe Goossen, 40, who frequently does color commentary on televised boxing 
cards. "He would just get up and come after me." 
</P>
<P>
 Those early training sessions in a makeshift ring in the bedroom of his home 
in Reseda left an impression on Buffo. In fact, several. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it came to the point where my mom and dad didn't want me to go in 
the room where any boxing went on," Buffo said. "I would end up bleeding and 
having to get stitches. I must have maybe 40 to 50 stitches on my head from him 
(Joe) alone. It was from being knocked back and hitting my head on something." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffo said he has been in hundreds of street fights, including many as a kid 
that were fueled by nasty comments about his size. The reasons for the fights 
varied in later years, but the results were pretty much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go looking for fights, but I won't back down," said Buffo, who has a 
quick sense of humor despite his reputation as a tough guy. "My last street 
fight was up in Reno (last year) with a (heavyweight) pro fighter in a hotel 
hallway. He was giving Joe and me crap, and we ended up going to blows. I took 
him out in 20 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Others before the ill-advised pro boxer got similar treatment after mouthing 
off to Buffo or someone in his family. Perhaps surprisingly, Buffo has been 
arrested only once but the case was dismissed because he proved self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite packing a heavy punch, Buffo never pursued a professional boxing 
career and instead became a standout football player at Hoover High in 
Glendale. Buffo had been a nose guard at Notre Dame High for two seasons before 
he got into a fight with another student and was given an ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (administrators) made me an offer: 'Leave or we'll kick you out and it 
will go on your record,' " Buffo said. "So I went to Hoover and then to Valley 
(College)." 
</P>
<P>
 Under then-Valley Coach Chuck Ferrero, Buffo developed into a junior college 
All-American middle linebacker, one that instilled terror in opposing 
ballcarriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is about as tough a kid as I have ever coached," said Ferrero, now the 
school's athletic director. "He was a great tackler. He just laid people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Including a few who weren't even wearing pads at the time. Ferrero recalls one 
incident that illustrates how fearless Buffo was. And is. 
</P>
<P>
 "When his uncle Tom (Goossen, now an assistant at Arroyo Grande High) was 
assisting me, he was having a hard time with one of our tough kids, who had a 
brother who was a big-time professional linebacker. So the kid's brother comes 
over to cause problems with Tom. Jim said something to him and the guy said 
something back and Buffo knocked him into a trash dumpster." 
</P>
<P>
 After Valley, Buffo played two seasons at Cal Lutheran and had hoped for a 
professional career but never got his shot.  
</P>
<P>
 He then turned to boxing, helping his uncles train fighters, and to occasional 
work in his father's P.I. business. Now, he is looking for the recognition -- 
and the cash -- that goes with the title of "World's Toughest Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be difficult, but hopefully, I've learned a lot of things from 
my uncles that I'll be able to execute come fight time," Buffo said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know how to fight. And I think my size is going to be an advantage. If you 
had an ax in your hands and you wanted to cut down a tree, would you rather cut 
a big tree or a stump? The bigger tree is much easier. I feel I've got the 
leverage and the gravity working for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has his uncles, Joe and Greg, polishing him at their Van Nuys gym for 
the challenge. Joe, for one, feels that Buffo can win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his chances are very good, mainly because of his background," said 
Joe Goossen, who attended last year's finals. "He has a lot of advantages over 
some guy who decided to start boxing a year ago. He has a lot of technique that 
will help him and he can definitely take a punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it's thrown by someone named Butterbean.

A HAPPY CAMPER; UNDERRATED AT RIO MESA, AND OVERLOOKED IN DRAFT, AYALA MAKES IT 
IN SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to find someone who pitched in a major league tryout camp, you can 
look just about anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Except in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Bobby Ayala, the likely stopper in the Seattle Mariners' 
bullpen this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala was an all-state pitcher as a senior at Rio Mesa High in 1988. But 
scouts overlooked him. About 1,500 players were drafted in 1988, and none of 
them was Bobby Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala seems to believe that scouts only watched Rio Mesa on Tuesdays, and he 
pitched on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, Ayala was undeterred. He showed up a few weeks after the 
draft at the Cincinnati Reds' annual open tryout in Thousand Oaks. It was a 
gathering of dreamers, those who were certain the scouts were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was going to go there and surprise some scouts because I had good 
stuff," Ayala said during a break at the Mariners' spring training complex last 
week. "All I had to do was show I can pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala threw to four batters, retiring them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, a scout asked him how he might feel about playing professional 
baseball. Less than a week later, Ayala was headed for the Reds' minor league 
camp in Kissimee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala was the only one signed of the 100 players or so who showed up in 
Thousand Oaks that morning. Ayala, 24, has continued to defy the odds by 
earning a spot on a major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked his way steadily through the Reds' system, finally jumping from 
double A to the majors in September, 1992, when he made five starts for the 
Reds and Manager Lou Piniella. 
</P>
<P>
 Piniella was impressed. Then he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired last year to manage the Mariners. As Piniella spent the season 
trying to coax saves out of the bullpen with the worst earned-run average 
(4.74) in the American League, Ayala was spending his time as a spot starter 
for the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala was 7-10 with a 5.60 earned-run average. Hardly impressive numbers, but 
when the Mariners needed relief help, Piniella remembered Ayala's arm. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move also dictated by money, the Mariners sent high-priced right-hander 
Erik Hanson and second baseman Bret Boone to the Reds for Ayala and catcher Dan 
Wilson on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was surprising," Ayala said. "I didn't think I'd ever get traded from the 
Reds. But I thought about it for a while and I thought this was for the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala did not immediately think of himself as the closer. But two weeks after 
the trade, oft-injured reliever Norm Charlton was released, clearing a path for 
Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel he's going to develop into an outstanding pitcher," Piniella said. 
"We think he's got closer stuff. He's going to get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 As spring training began, Ayala was involved in a three-way closer race with 
Jeff Nelson and Bobby Thigpen, who holds the major league record for saves in a 
season (57 in 1990) but has struggled the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 With the season days away, Ayala seems to have won the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping that he'd show us that he might be able to handle the 
late-inning relief and so far he's done that," Mariner pitching coach Sammy 
Ellis said. "He's got the stuff to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of Ayala's transformation from Reds' spot starter to Mariners' 
closer is his beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Players are not allowed to wear facial hair with the Reds, so the first thing 
Ayala did when he was traded was grow a fu manchu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even recognize him when I walked in at first," said Wilson, a 
teammate of Ayala's for several years in the Cincinnati organization. "But 
that's Bobby. That's part of his game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala said he wanted to look menacing. Just like Rod Beck, Bryan Harvey and 
Dennis Eckersley. All are top closers who have some sort of facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some pitchers like to have a mean look," Ayala said. "It's good to intimidate 
the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala's beard intimidates no one. His split-finger fastball, which he's thrown 
without injury since high school, is another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a nasty splitter," Ellis said. "He seems to have that aggressive 
demeanor on the mound. . . . He's a street-wise kid from Southern California. 
He seems to be something of a kamikaze pilot type of pitcher, and that is the 
kind of guy you need in short relief." 
</P>
<P>
 All the Mariners' feelings about Ayala being a closer are just that, feelings. 
They have little evidence that he can do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 He saved just 10 games in the minors and three last season. He has never been 
a regular closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping, hoping dearly, that Bobby will show us he can handle that 
role," Ellis said. "We won't know whether he can really handle it until the 
bell rings and he gets out there with a one- or two-run lead in the ninth 
inning. None of us knows. We don't know. He doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just looks like he can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala believes he can. This is a guy who doesn't lack confidence. Talk to him 
for 15 minutes and he will mention that he has a "good, live arm" 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
 But he isn't cocky. He concedes he still has plenty to learn about being a 
closer. He also admits he wasn't always certain he would wind up in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a surprise for me, a guy not getting drafted, going to a tryout 
camp and working his way up through the minors and proving he can pitch," Ayala 
said. "Coming up to the big leagues within about four years. It's been a big 
surprise to me."

MORGAN BACK IN FOREFRONT AT NEWBURY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Morgan has been here before. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, he spent all of one season coaching the Newbury Park High 
softball team. Then he got "kind of burned out on coaching," he said, and 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The embers, however, appear to be glowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Thornhill, a full-time police officer in his second season as a walk-on 
coach at Newbury Park, resigned last Saturday amid speculation that disgruntled 
parents forced him out. Some parents apparently believe the Panthers (7-3) 
should be more successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Newbury Park's youth softball leagues are extremely 
competitive, producing regional championship teams in recent years. Few 
associated with Newbury Park softball enjoy taking a back seat to nearby rivals 
Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Camarillo. Newbury Park finished 20-8 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Thornhill's abrupt departure, Morgan, who came aboard as 
Thornhill's assistant this season, has assumed the role of interim coach while 
Newbury Park remains on spring break. Until school resumes Monday, Morgan is in 
a wait-and-see mode. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what (the Newbury Park administration) is going to do so 
I don't want to say too much right now," said Morgan, who was noncommittal on 
whether he would accept the vacated position if it were offered.  
</P>
<P>
 Morgan acted as coach for the Panthers in four Righetti tournament games 
earlier this week, leading them to a third-place finish with a 3-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began to heat up for Thornhill when Newbury Park lost its first two 
Marmonte League games, falling to Simi Valley and Camarillo on March 15 and 17, 
according to a source close to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no longer fun," Thornhill told the Thousand Oaks News Chronicle. "There 
seems to be a lack of confidence in my ability as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at home Thursday, Thornhill said he "had no further comment on this 
matter."

LOS ALAMITOS; HARNESS RACING FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only two nights of racing remaining in the 1994 winter-spring meeting, 
the future of California harness racing is once again uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the Premier Harness Racing Assn., which has been leasing Los 
Alamitos for harness racing, appeared before the California Horse Racing Board 
at its monthly meeting in Emeryville, requesting six simulcast races each night 
for a harness meeting at Cal-Expo in Sacramento. The PHRA's plan for a meeting 
includes four nights of racing weekly -- Wednesday through Saturday -- from 
April 29 through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would include six simulcast races from the Meadowlands in East 
Rutherford, N.J., followed by eight live races. Currently, at Los Alamitos, a 
typical program includes three simulcast races and as many as 12 live races 
three nights a week, Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA's proposal was opposed by representatives of the quarter horse 
industry, who believe that simulcast races would affect the mutuel handle on 
live quarter horse races this summer at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the CHRB approved only four simulcast races for the beginning of 
the Sacramento meeting, which would drop to three after June 15 when an influx 
of 2-year-olds would begin racing and help alleviate a horse shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Harness racing interests were not satisfied, and the PHRA investors met on 
Saturday to discuss their options. A subsequent request was made to CHRB 
members, quarter horse interests and especially Edward Allred, a 50% owner of 
Los Alamitos and the president of the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn., 
which operates quarter horse racing at Los Alamitos, to reconsider and allow 
six simulcast races a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA had hoped to hear by Wednesday, but that deadline passed without any 
positive news from the harness industry. By Thursday, the possibility of a 
harness meeting this summer had dimmed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if there's precedent for the CHRB to overturn a decision," said 
Dave Goldschmidt, the PHRA's racing secretary. "We think they made a poor 
decision and it will be hard for them to admit that in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldschmidt said that if the CHRB doesn't allow six simulcast races a night, 
it would be difficult for his group to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA maintains that without six simulcast races a night from Sacramento, 
investors have little or no chance of recouping their investment. Harness 
racing at Sacramento has always been a less productive meeting than Los 
Alamitos'. Last year's average Sacramento handle was $393,000, compared to 
$841,000 at Los Alamitos.  
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA hopes to use the simulcast races as an opportunity to raise money not 
only for operators, but also for purses for live racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-week meeting that concludes Saturday was put together on short notice. 
In December, three weeks before the meeting started, the CHRB approved the 
PHRA's lease, forcing the group to work through the holidays to put together 
racing programs. Fortunately, many horsemen were already operating in 
California and had horses at some level of training. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet began slowly, a reflection of the few horses ready to race. Business 
was also affected when purses were cut 20% at the end of January. But slowly, 
the mutuel handle began to rise, and with it the purses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, purses grew 10% for the second time since the reduction, meaning 
horsemen are racing for about the same money as at the start of the meeting. 
Weekend mutuel handles, which were stuck at about $900,000 at the beginning of 
the meeting, are now routinely above $1 million on Friday and Saturdays.

ANGELS '94; HOW THE WEST COULD BE WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words flow effortlessly from their throats. It's almost as if they believe 
it's natural to utter the words that haven't been heard around these parts in 
eight years. They are not whispering these words, or talking in hushed tones; 
they are shouting them to the heavens. The Angels not only are telling everyone 
who will listen that they are legitimate championship contenders but that they 
will be truly disappointed if they don't win the American League West title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if we could contend in any division in baseball," Angel General 
Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but believe me, I know we're good enough to contend 
in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter to the Angels that their pitching staff's earned-run average 
hovered above the prime rate all spring. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't bother anyone that they reshuffled their team the last week of the 
spring, allowing shortstop Gary DiSarcina only three days to work with his new 
double-play partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it concern them that the only backup third baseman is Spike Owen, who 
never has played a game at third in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one vital fact that captivates the Angels' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels find themselves this season in perhaps the weakest division in 
baseball, needing to overcome only three teams to win the division title. 
</P>
<P>
 "That division by far has to be the worst division in baseball," Boston Red 
Sox designated hitter Andre Dawson said. "With the Oakland ballclub almost 
being depleted, and California with a young club, it's got to be the easiest 
division to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a peek: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Seattle Mariners, who have had only two winning seasons in the 
franchise's existence, and never won the division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Texas Rangers, who also have never won the division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Oakland Athletics, who finished in last place in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Angels, who have finished a combined 38 games under .500 the last two 
seasons and 47 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no more excuses for this club," DiSarcina said. "The rebuilding was 
two years ago. It's over." 
</P>
<P>
 The front office has let it be known by its actions that the youth movement is 
dead. The young players already are in place. It's time to win. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the Angels acquired veteran outfielders Dwight Smith and Bo 
Jackson this winter. It is why they grabbed veteran starter John Dopson and 
veteran left-handed relievers Craig Lefferts and Bob Patterson. It is why this 
spring they sent second baseman Kevin Flora back to the minors, acquired 
infielders Harold Reynolds and Rex Hudler as replacements and picked up starter 
Mark Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't have made those moves a year ago," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers 
said, "but now we think we can win this thing. I truly believe we've got an 
excellent chance of winning the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seattle's the team to beat in our division, but believe me, we're going to be 
right there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, who never have finished higher than fourth in their franchise 
history, certainly should accomplish that modest feat this season. They might 
not have a bullpen stopper, and will be weaker at shortstop with Felix Fermin 
instead of Omar Vizquel, but they're the ones most likely to spoil the Angels' 
illusions of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them that this club has as much talent as any club I've ever managed," 
said Lou Piniella, who managed the 1990 World Series champion Cincinnati Reds. 
"We felt last year we took it to the competitive level. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we're going to take it to the next step." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' paramount flaw is that they have no bullpen stopper. They had a 
deal worked out a few weeks ago for Mel Rojas of Montreal, but it was nixed 
when Mariner ownership decided it could not afford his $850,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle now has no choice but to go with Bobby Thigpen, who saved a record 57 
games in 1990 but has had only two saves since the 1992 All-Star break. 
Piniella is hoping that once the bullpen blows a few games, ownership will wake 
up and allow the club to pursue Rick Aguilera of the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the bullpen will consist of the likes of Thigpen, Bobby 
Ayala, Jeff Nelson, Tim Davis, Bill Risley and either Kevin King or Erik 
Platenberg. Their combined major league experience, with the exception of 
Thigpen, totals a mere two years and 136 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' starting rotation, which might be the finest outside the city of 
Atlanta, should ease the pain. They're going with a four-man rotation of Randy 
Johnson (19-8), Chris Bosio (9-9), Greg Hibbard (15-11) and Dave Fleming 
(12-5). They won't need a fifth starter until April 23, when they probably will 
turn to Roger Salkeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Angels' biggest hope is that the simmering feud between Johnson 
and center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. drags into the season. Johnson recently 
criticized Griffey's work habits, prompting a private meeting initiated by 
Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen his good days, and I've seen his bad days," Johnson said. 
"Sometimes I don't feel like he works as hard as he could. Things come easy to 
him so he doesn't have to work as hard as everyone else. If he worked as hard 
as Kirby Puckett or someone like that I think he would be in the Barry Bonds 
category." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers were the chic pick to win the division throughout the 
winter, but once folks started to catch their pitching act, they realized the 
Rangers are in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it didn't stop General Manager Tom Grieve from coming out in February 
and guaranteeing a division title. His comments quickly found their way into 
the Oakland clubhouse, and were tacked onto the team bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there for seven years," Oakland starter Bobby Witt said, "and you 
always heard the same thing. It was, 'We're going to sign this guy and we're 
going to win.' Then we wouldn't win and the next year it would be, 'We're going 
to sign this other guy and we're going to win.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I don't think they'll go around intimidating anyone. They'll 
score a lot of runs, but they've still got to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who lost starters Roger Pavlik and Bruce Hurst to injuries this 
spring, open the season with only two starters who had winning records last 
season: Kevin Brown (15-12) and Kenny Rogers (16-10). 
</P>
<P>
 This is a team that relies on starter Jack Armstrong to anchor its rotation. 
Yes, the same Jack Armstrong who was a 17-game loser last season. The same Jack 
Armstrong who had a 22-45 record with a 4.82 ERA the last three seasons. The 
same Jack Armstrong who opens the year as the Rangers' No. 3 starter. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rangers' pitching isn't shaky enough, take a look at their infield 
defense, which led the league with 57 errors on the left side of the infield. 
They enter the season with three infielders who ranked among the bottom four 
for fielding percentage in the league last year. Shortstop Manuel Lee was 
spared only because he did not appear in enough games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It says something about the quality of this division that even the Oakland 
Athletics believe they can win it. OK, OK, the Athletics have dominated this 
division the last six years, but this still is the same team that was dead-last 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm thinking we're going to jump back in contention this year," 
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said with a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
 Said bullpen stopper Dennis Eckersley: "You've got to feel optimistic because 
it's a four-team division. We've got as good a shot as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The Athletics' optimism certainly has little to do with first baseman Mark 
McGwire, who missed most of the spring because of back problems. He missed 135 
games last season because of his left heel, and was on the disabled list with a 
herniated disc in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, whether it's an aberration or not, the Athletic pitching staff has been 
superb this spring. La Russa, who set an American League record by going to his 
bullpen 424 times last season -- keeping as many as 13 pitchers during one 
stretch -- may be able to sit on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting rotation of Witt, Bob Welch, Ron Darling, Steve Karsay and Todd 
Van Poppel is solid, albeit unspectacular. This is virtually the same rotation 
that was 41-63 with a 5.19 ERA last season, averaging fewer than 5 2/3 innings 
per start. Their bullpen is a crapshoot until the ninth inning when they can 
turn to Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
 So, now that the entrants are in place, the prognosis? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's all in our hands," Angel reliever Mike Butcher said. "When 
things were going bad this spring, nobody ever panicked. That's a sign of a 
good team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that we better be a contender in this division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly.

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS '94; FIRST TO WORST: BRAVES ARE THE BEST, AND THEY'RE BAD 
IN BIG APPLE 
</P>

 Realignment might be able to turn the Cleveland Indians into contenders and 
the San Diego Padres into a fourth-place team, but it can't obscure the simple 
truths of this baseball season, which are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With or without Ron Gant and Chipper Jones, the Braves are the finest team 
in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With or without Tom Bogar and Alan Zinter, the Mets are the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With or without Joe Magrane and John Dopson, baseballs in Anaheim are 
silently weeping. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without further ado, The Real Life Major League Top 25 (Plus The Usual 
Stragglers) for 1994 . . .  
</P>
<P>
 1. Atlanta. And we're going to keep saying it until they get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Chicago White Sox. They have the best player, third baseman and starting 
rotation in the American League (Frank Thomas, Robin Ventura and 
McDowell-Fernandez-Alvarez-Bere, for those scoring at home). They have the best 
catcher, relief pitcher and designated hitter in the AL Central (Those names 
again: Ron Karkovice, Roberto Hernandez, Julio Franco). They still have Ozzie 
Guillen, Tim Raines and Lance Johnson. I suspect they will be able to survive a 
spring-training tryout by Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 3. San Francisco. One more reason Why Barry Bonds Isn't Willie Mays (GQ took 
care of the first 71): Both Willie and Barry are known for their pet phrases. 
Willie's was "Say Hey." Barry's is "Say Get The &!* Out Of My Way." 
</P>
<P>
 4. Baltimore. Need a first baseman? Let's buy Rafael Palmeiro. Need a third 
baseman? Let's buy Chris Sabo. Need a starting pitcher? Let's buy Sid 
Fernandez. Need a closer? Let's buy Lee Smith. Need a football team? Let's 
throw the rest of our money at the Rams. Reminds me of Anaheim, circa 1978. The 
good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Toronto. Trois -peat? No problem, assuming Joe Carter recovers from a 
broken thumb, Roberto Alomar recovers from a broken leg, Duane Ward overcomes 
biceps tendinitis, rookie Alex Gonzalez makes them forget Tony Fernandez at 
short, rookie Rob Butler makes them forget Rickey Henderson in left, John 
Olreud hits .363 again and Paul Molitor has another 211-hit season at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
 6. New York Yankees. Their No. 2 starter, Jim Abbott, is an ex-Angel. Their 
new leadoff hitter, Luis Polonia, is an ex-Angel. This could be their year. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Philadelphia. It was Mitch Williams' fault; he threw the pitch. It was Jim 
Fregosi's fault; he sent Williams in there. It was Terry Mulholland's fault; he 
failed to pitch a complete game. It was Lee Thomas' fault; he failed to trade 
for Bryan Harvey. Just one question for the Philly fans: Might Joe Carter (10 
seasons, 275 home runs, 994 RBIs) have had something to do with it? Nah, didn't 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Houston. Servais, Taubensee and Eusebio are what? The checking line for the 
Toronto Maple Leafs? Red wines from the Bordeaux region? Correct answer: They 
are catchers for the Houston Astros. So is a 27-year old rookie named Scooter 
Tucker. What's he doing in there? 
</P>
<P>
 9. Montreal. So the Expos lose Dennis Martinez, replace him with Pedro 
Martinez and insist -- swear, even -- that they've improved their team. Must be 
a French-Canadian thing. We wouldn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Kansas City. The people of Kansas City demand improvements in their sports 
teams, a commitment to excellence. So the Chiefs go out and trade for Joe 
Montana -- and the Royals go out and trade for Vince Coleman. Meanwhile, the 
lords of baseball continue to wonder why the fans are staying home. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Seattle. Still have Ken Griffey Jr., still need Bryan Harvey Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Texas. No Rafael Palmeiro, no Julio Franco, no Nolan Ryan -- and still, 
the Rangers are consensus favorites to win the AL West. Why? No White Sox, no 
Royals, no Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Dodgers. Chan Ho Park, the new pitching sensation, speaks only a few words 
of English. Tommy Lasorda, the old fertilizer salesman, speaks only a few words 
of Korean. Everything will be fine, so long as the Dodgers keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 14. St. Louis. Also opening this season without Joe Magrane in the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Cleveland. Eddie Murray signed to play for the major league Indians, not 
the "Major League II" Indians, because "Major League II" is not a silent movie. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Boston. Down south, Mo Vaughn is a question, kind of like "Will Clark?" 
So, ask yourself this: What do the Red Sox need most in '94? Mo Vaughn? No. Mo 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
 17. Chicago Cubs. Next spring, the Cubs fight back and grant their own tryout 
to another Chicago sporting legend. "Batting fifth for the Cubs . . . and 
playing shortstop . . . No. 72 . . . Refrigerator Perry!"  
</P>
<P>
 18. Cincinnati. Chris Sabo goes to Baltimore, Bip Roberts goes to San Diego, 
Dan Wilson goes to Seattle, but Marge Schott stays. Last place, if there's any 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Detroit. The Tigers used to be the only team in town that won and lost 
games by scores of 8-7 and 16-8. But now, the Lions have the two-point 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 20. Pittsburgh. Counting on ex-Braves Brian Hunter, Alejandro Pena and Al 
Martin to make major contributions. If you can't beat 'em, sign 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 21. Oakland. A's send Rickey Henderson to pennant-contending Blue Jays, Blue 
Jays send hot prospects Steve Karsay and Jose Herrera to A's, Blue Jays win 
World Series, Henderson returns as free agent to A's, who also get to keep 
Karsay and Herrera. Rent-A-Rickey, the franchise-building wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 22. Colorado. Howard Johnson, Ellis Burks and Dante Bichette in the outfield, 
Andres Galarraga and Charlie Hayes at the corners. You call this a second-year 
expansion team? Armando Reynoso, David Nied, Greg Harris, Steve Reed and Ken 
Bottenfield in the starting rotation. You call this a second-year expansion 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 23. Angels. The starting rotation will be Langston, Finley, Leftwich and . . . 
and . . . are you sure T-ball is completely out of the question? 
</P>
<P>
 24. Minnesota. Kent Hrbek was a fun-loving, hard-living, hell-raising rogue 
back when the Twins were winning World Series. Now he's just fat. 
</P>
<P>
 25. Florida. Florida's basketball team is in the Final 4. Florida's hockey 
team is headed for the Stanley Cup playoffs. Florida State won the college 
football championship. Can't have everything. 
</P>
<P>
 26. Milwaukee. Once, major league baseball and the Brewers were fun to watch. 
Today, Bud Selig runs them both. 
</P>
<P>
 27. San Diego. Bip Roberts decided to come back, for reasons modern science 
has yet to discern, but if Phil Plantier keeps up this home run business any 
longer, he'll be in Toronto by June. 
</P>
<P>
 28. New York Mets. It took the Mets 32 years to get this bad again. Only last 
time, they were funny.

ANGELS '94; CHILI; DAVIS IS SECURE IN HIS DESIGNATED SPOT DESPITE THE PRESENCE 
OF CLOSE FRIEND BO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bo Jackson, asked if he had a minute to talk about Chili Davis, scowled like 
Larry Holmes at a weigh-in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chili . . . Davis! I ain't got time for no Chili . . . Davis," he bellowed. 
"I've got work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And he stomped off to the batting cage, where he would vent all this apparent 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, a close friend of Davis, was clearly enjoying this and made sure 
every Angel within earshot saw the show. But soon, the rivalry between the two 
might become more than a daily game of clubhouse one-upmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is coming off the best season of his career. He hit 27 home runs, had 32 
doubles and drove in 112 runs, more than any designated hitter in Angel 
history. He chased home one run for every five at-bats and figured to come into 
1994 about as designated a hitter as a DH can be. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bo's presence looms. 
</P>
<P>
 What if Bo's hot, and Chili's not? 
</P>
<P>
 Will Manager Buck Rodgers be tempted to go with Bo? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who stuck with Davis last year when he got off to a very slow start, 
says Jackson will get some action at DH, but it won't be because Davis is 0 for 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some pitchers that Chili doesn't handle too well, and in those 
cases, I'll probably put Bo in at DH," Rodgers said. "And Bo's going to play 
(some) left field." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first news conference as an Angel, Jackson said he didn't intend to be 
a replacement for Davis. But Davis is well aware of his buddy's ability to swat 
a baseball, and he knows Jackson won't turn down any at-bats simply because 
they will come at Davis' expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked at it from that point of view, sure, but I'm not going to go out 
there and put extra pressure on myself," Davis said. "I mean, I knocked in a 
million runs last year, and I don't think Buck will panic on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year could have been a really (lousy) year if Buck wouldn't have kept me 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months into the season, Davis was hitting .222 with four homers and 29 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of managers would've reached the point where they would've said, 'Let's 
try someone else,' but he stuck with me. Maybe it was because I never gave an 
at-bat away, never quit," said Davis, who hit nine home runs with two strikes 
and nine in the seventh inning or later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was because I worked so hard in the spring to get ready. Anyway, in 
the end, it paid off for me and him and the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of Davis -- who signed with Minnesota as a free agent on Jan. 29, 
1991, and came back to the Angels via the same route in December of 1992 -- has 
paid off for the club in almost too many ways to count. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can believe the youngsters who are the future of the team, Davis' 
presence in the clubhouse is worth at least 112 more RBIs on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give Chili a lot of credit for the success I had early last year," first 
baseman J.T. Snow said. "He really had me ready. He told me that guys would be 
testing me early, giving me the fastball just to see if I could hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow crushed a lot of those fastballs and was hitting .407 on April 25, but 
later, when he was fasting on a steady diet of breaking balls, Davis came 
through again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me to keep working hard and to keep my attitude good because this 
is a streaky game," Snow said. "Things can change at any moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow knows change. He was back in the minors by midseason and will probably 
start there this year. But Tim Salmon, whose season-long high turned into a 
rookie of the year award, says Davis deserves a footnote on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chili's been a huge influence on me," Salmon said. "Of course, his presence 
behind me (in the batting order) has been a key factor, but he's been my tutor, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much I've learned from him about temperament at the plate. We both 
face a lot of RBI situations and are expected to drive in runs, and there's a 
lot of pressure that goes along with that. But Chili taught me to be patient 
and never to give away an at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' ability to help young players seems to be surpassed only by his 
willingness to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a veteran who is totally approachable," Salmon said. "I remember my 
first day in the clubhouse, and he walked right up, sat down and started 
talking to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure every guy on this team can tell you something he's done for them. 
He's so important to the chemistry of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina has been hanging on Davis' words of wit and wisdom 
since he first came up with the Angels in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a positive force for me since I was a rookie," DiSarcina said. 
"He's the epitome of a professional baseball player. He's so consistent 
emotionally, and it's good for the young guys to see what it takes to play up 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing thing is he treats everyone exactly the same, whether they have 
10 years in or 10 days in. And nowadays, that's kind of rare." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis insists he is only doing for others what players such as Joe Morgan, 
Reggie Smith and Jack Clark did for him when he was a rookie with the Giants in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treated me with respect as a rookie, and I'll never forget that," Davis 
said. "Anyway, it's easy to suck up to the guys who have been here 10 years, 
but they don't need it. Everybody's always sucking up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not the case for the guys who are nervous about just getting here 
or trying to win a position. I haven't got a college degree like some of these 
guys, but I'm smart enough to know that no man is above anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's a selfish part to it, too. It's all part of trying to win. I'm 
not trying to help Tim Salmon just for Tim Salmon. What helps him helps us, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone it seems, from teammates to the front office, marvels at Davis' 
ability to maintain an even keel, to shake off a three-strikeout performance 
and knock in the winning run in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "See this is just a game, man, but I don't know if you can really teach that," 
Davis said, smiling. "I think that's part of my personality. If I fall in love 
and get dumped, then I just walk away and go on. That doesn't mean I don't 
care. That doesn't mean I don't hurt. I guess it's more a case of 'Why worry 
about it when I could be dead tomorrow?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That attitude really helps in this game, because a season is 162 games long 
and if you let every bad game, every frustration, get to you, you'll be gray, 
or bald, or have some serious ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even more important, you probably wouldn't be very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Success has always been fleeting for Davis, especially in recent years. In 
1989 with the Angels, he hit 22 homers and drove in 90 runs. In '90, those 
numbers dipped to 12 and 58. The next season with the Twins, he had 29 home 
runs and 93 RBIs. Then in '92, he fell to 12 and 66. 
</P>
<P>
 When he resurfaced in Anaheim as a 33-year-old designated hitter last year, 
Davis rebounded with his most productive season.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can expect Chili to have two career years back to back," 
Rodgers said. "I don't think you'll see him drive in that many runs or hit that 
many homers, that's a little too much to ask. But I wouldn't be surprised if he 
hit for a better average." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a career .267 hitter, batted .243 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not even thinking about duplicating last year," Davis said. "(Luis) 
Polonia and (Chad) Curtis seemed to be on base every time I came up, and I've 
never had two guys in front of me who stole 40 or 50 bags each in a year. They 
not only caused a lot of distraction for pitchers, but they got over to third 
with nobody out or one out and I was able to get a lot of RBIs with an out." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and the Angels discussed a two-year contract extension last fall, but 
the Angels eventually renewed his option for $2.4 million. So, for the third 
time in five years, Davis will be playing in the final year of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two times, he also found himself looking for a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way it is," Davis said. "I mean, one reporter asked Buck last 
year if he thought I was washed up. It was the middle of June, and I already 
had 50 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the man up there has decided that I'm going to have to prove myself 
every year, but that's all right. I'm used to it by now."

ANGELS '94; COMPULSIVE WILL TO WIN SEPARATES CURTIS FROM HIS DEMONS; OUTFIELD: 
TAKING A CUE FROM PETE ROSE, HE FEELS HE MUST PLAY UP TO HIS FULL POTENTIAL AT 
ALL TIMES TO ACHIEVE STAR STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chad Curtis was sitting in his adult Sunday school class this winter when he 
felt that familiar sensation overpowering him. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't be happening. Come on, not here at the First Baptist Church in his 
hometown of Middleville, Mich. It was a just a neighborly board game that he 
was playing with his closest friends. Men versus women. Winners take home only 
bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 So, OK, the women were beating up on them pretty good this day. They were 
yelling out all the correct answers, and the game was becoming lopsided in a 
hurry. They even started giggling at the ease of their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when it started. Curtis felt the blood rushing toward his head. He 
breathed deeply and fast, opening and closing his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis no longer could resist temptation. He called time out, gathered the men 
together, and unveiled his strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out a way we could turn the cards so we could read them," Curtis 
said. "I was just trying to get us back into the game. I mean, they were 
crushing us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I got home when I realized what I had just done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife, 'Can you believe it? I cheated because I hate the thought of 
losing. ' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done things I've been embarrassed about later, and I know I get too 
intense, but that might have been my all-timer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty bad about that one." 
</P>
<P>
 To Curtis, playing any game is a test of strength, smarts and guts. No matter 
how frivolous, the goal is the same. May the most ruthless competitor win. 
</P>
<P>
 This insatiable desire to win might appear to be a twisted, almost a deranged 
way of thinking, but for Angel center fielder Chad Curtis it has become a 
necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
 It is what separates Curtis from his peers in major league baseball, the 
difference in becoming a possible star to being a journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a compulsive baseball player," Curtis said. "I always feel I have to win. 
Losing drives me crazy. I've got to go at everything with full intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at guys like Ken Griffey Jr. He can play up to half of his potential, 
and be an All-Star. When he reaches his full potential, he's a Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do that. I've got to play up to my full potential. I use that as a 
strength, not a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I think Pete Rose and I are a lot alike. He hustles. He wants to 
win. He's not of big stature, never had a lot of talent, but he has more hits 
any anybody in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Pete Rose has abundantly more talent than I do. There's some 
people in the Hall of Fame that can't do the things I can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and say I'm going to be in the Hall of Fame, but 
every day I put my uniform on, I'm going to say, 'I'm a Hall of Fame caliber 
player.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can tell me any different." 
</P>
<P>
 The game of baseball tried to exclude Curtis from ever trespassing. He was too 
small. Too short. Too slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was never blatant about its feelings but politely let him know that 
he wasn't one of its kind, waiting until the 45th round in 1989 to even draft 
him. Even Carey Schueler, the 18-year-old daughter of Chicago White Sox General 
Manager Ron Schueler, was drafted higher, picked in the 43rd round last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was three days after the draft before the Angels even bothered to call 
me," Curtis said. "Even then, they said they didn't want me. They just wanted 
my rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually had to convince them to sign me, and they're the ones who drafted 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis was incensed, but the more he thought about it, why should this be any 
different than anything else he had to overcome in life? 
</P>
<P>
 He was the meanest, toughest kid on the football field at Benson (Ariz.) High 
School, but when you're 5-foot-9 and 155 pounds, no one pays much attention 
until that first big hit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was that game against Morenci High when the game plan simply was to dump 
off passes to their 6-foot-4, 225-pound tight end, telling him to bowl over 
Curtis time after time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what they had in mind," Curtis said. "The first time they ran it, I 
had a 10-yard head of steam, and I hit him with everything I had. They never 
ran that play again the rest of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis had no scholarship offers to play football out of high school, and was 
prepared to be a walk-on at the University of Arizona. He stopped at a 
restaurant and saw tables full of baseball players from Yavapai Community 
College in Prescott, Ariz. He boldly walked up to the coach, asked if he could 
try out. He made the team, and batted .360 with 30 RBIs. He spent the next 
season at Cochise Community College, batting .407 with 15 homers and 71 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his credentials failed to get him a full scholarship from a major 
university. He kept weighing offers from Grand Canyon College, or a 
quarter-scholarship to the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I needed to go to someplace where I could be recognized," Curtis 
said. "Then I realized what better place than Canyon because Tim Salmon was 
there. I figured, if scouts were going to come out and see Tim, they had no 
choice but to see Chad Curtis." 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared to be a stroke of ingenuity. Salmon attracted about 30 scouts a 
game, batting .356 with 19 homers and 68 RBIs, causing the Angels to draft him 
in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis had even a more stellar season, batting .369 with 19 homers, 83 RBIs, 
and 36 steals. Scouts promised that he'd be selected in the first 10 rounds. He 
stuck around until the Angels grabbed him in the 45th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something, I think that was the best thing that happened to him," 
said Salmon, Curtis' best friend on the team. "There were no expectations. It 
was like, 'Who is this kid?' He was the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 It took fewer than three years for Curtis to prove he belonged, out-hustling 
everyone to the top. Everything in his life was done at full speed. He even 
wore his baseball uniform the day he married his wife, Candace, just to ensure 
he would not be late for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I had to be on the field at 2," Curtis said, "and our wedding got pushed 
back to 1:30. I didn't have any choice but to take off my suit and put on my 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, 25, is convinced that marriage has mellowed him, but he still is the 
most intense player in baseball. The biggest difference now, Salmon says, is 
that Curtis no longer flings the remote control, chairs and tables across the 
room when he loses in Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me," said Salmon, his former roommate, "it got pretty ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he ascended through the minor leagues, Curtis relies on pure hustle 
and intelligence for his game. He brings along his own scouting book to the 
bench, revealing which pitchers have a quick delivery to the plate and what 
they'll throw at particular times in the count. Although he is not considered 
an exceptional runner, his instincts have enabled him to steal 91 bases in his 
first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to talk all the time in the minors about how guys don't prepare 
themselves, and how they don't hustle," Salmon said. "He used to tell me, 
'That's fine by me. That's just one less guy I have to worry about getting to 
the big leagues.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This same guy who has been overlooked all of his life, today is considered the 
Angels' catalyst. Their hopes for a division title might be predicated on his 
success as a first-year leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine by me," Curtis said, "because I want to establish myself as the 
guy who gets the team going. I want to be that guy. It doesn't matter how I do 
in a game, I could go four for five, and I'll still try to find a way to blame 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned now that I can't control my performance when I play, but I can 
control how hard I play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to make baseball my No. 1 priority in life, that's why I try to use 
Pete Rose as an example. On the field, I want to be the kind of player he was. 
Off the field, I don't want to be the way he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I've like to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to thank him."

ANGELS '94; PLATOON SYSTEM IS ANGELS' METHOD TO MADNESS BEHIND THE PLATE; 
CATCHERS: CHRIS TURNER AND GREG MYERS WILL SHARE TIME IN HOPES OF ESTABLISHING 
THEMSELVES AT THE POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's not likely they will become the most heralded pair of receivers to grace 
Anaheim Stadium since the heyday of Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson, but it 
is spring, and the Angels are looking at their platoon situation at catcher 
with appropriate optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Turner and Greg Myers. Probably not a lot of All-Star votes there, but 
at least there's two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers, who holds the American League record for most games 
caught by a rookie catcher (150 with the Angels in 1962), admits there are some 
shortcomings. Defense is high among them. But then again, Ron Tingley and John 
Orton combined to catch 209 games over the last two seasons for the Angels and 
their combined batting average was .202. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers hit .255 with seven home runs and 40 runs batted in 108 games last year. 
Turner hit .280 with a homer and 13 RBIs in 25 games after coming up from the 
minors on Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether Greg or Chris could be a No. 1 catcher at this time," 
Rodgers said, "but they're both high twos, and on the verge of being No. 1s." 
</P>
<P>
 Both figure to get ample chance to show what they can do, at least until Jorge 
Fabregas, the Angels' first-round supplemental pick in the 1991 free-agent 
draft, is deemed ready to move up from triple-A Vancouver. Fabregas, 24, 
already is the best defensive catcher in the organization and he hit .289 at 
double-A Midland last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But for starters, Turner will catch when Mark Langston pitches -- so he'll be 
in the lineup opening day -- and Myers will catch when Chuck Finley is on the 
mound. After that, Rodgers will generally put Turner in against left-handed 
pitchers and the two will split up the right-handers, with Turner getting about 
60% of the starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers figures to see his number of starts decrease this season. It's not a 
situation he's particularly happy with, but he hopes to play his way into the 
majority of the innings behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's out of your hands, so there's no point worrying about it," he said. "Who 
knows how it will work out? Chris and I sure don't. All you can do is the best 
you can do when he puts you in there." 
</P>
<P>
 For Turner, who made his major league debut after fewer than three full 
seasons in the minors, this platoon thing seems like a relatively good 
jumping-off point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be in there every day, but I'm not complaining," he said. "All 
I've ever asked for is the chance to show what I can do, and hopefully, by next 
year, I'll be in there every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, getting the opportunity is all I can ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, of course, would love to be in a position next winter of having to 
make a wrenching decision about who will be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are good problems that we didn't have three or four years ago," Rodgers 
said, smiling. "We didn't have any players then. Now, we've got players coming 
up and we have decisions to make and that's great. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Jorge is a major league catching prospect. And if he does what we 
think he can do in Vancouver, then some time around the first of August, he 
should be ready to step up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had three solid major league catchers, we could go into the winter and 
make decisions. We won't keep those three catchers. One will have to go next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barring injury, however, it will be the battle of Turner vs. Myers for most of 
1994. Maybe not a clash of titans, but as good as anything Angel fans have seen 
since Lance Parrish in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Catching is still a new experience for Turner, who volunteered to catch after 
two catchers were injured when he was a senior at Western Kentucky.  
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up catching a game in our conference tournament and that's when a 
scout from the Angels saw me," Turner said. "They drafted me in the seventh 
round as a catcher, but I had only caught five games total in college." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first one, he broke a finger when he slammed his hand into the bat 
while attempting to return the ball to the pitcher. An inauspicious debut to be 
sure, but not enough to discourage Turner's enthusiasm for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, it's exciting," he said. "You're in the game on every pitch. It's 
not like other positions where you might go three or four games without ever 
touching the ball. I love it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's rocket ride through the Angels' organization included a season with 
single-A Boise, a season with single-A Quad City, a jump to triple-A Vancouver 
last year and the leap to the big leagues last August. 
</P>
<P>
 He's caught fewer than 300 games as a professional, but he's catching on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on how fast you learn and how smart you are," Rodgers said. 
"Some guys catch all their lives and they're still dumb catchers. Chris is in 
the process of learning and picking up things. He's a very quiet kid, but he's 
a bulldog behind the plate and he does a good job with the pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 And having a former catcher as a manager doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I map out situations and have him answer my questions, rather than just tell 
him you should have thrown a curve here or fastball there," Rodgers said. "I 
want him to go through the process so the next time he remembers the process 
and then the call will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers has been impressed by Turner's abilities at the plate as well as his 
progress behind it. Turner hit .455 with runners in scoring position last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good clutch hitter and for a young kid, that's something," Rodgers 
said. "He's not afraid to drive in runs. In fact, he's better than some of our 
regulars at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Turner-Myers duel might feature wood as the weapon of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, a left-handed hitter who was acquired in a trade with Toronto in July 
of 1992, has been in a platoon situation since he came up with the Blue Jays in 
1989. When Toronto decided to make Pat Borders the full-time starter, Myers 
became expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 His best season before last year was 1991, when he played in 107 games and hit 
.262 with eight homers and 36 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Myers has been hitting the ball this spring as well as he ever has," 
Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers says he didn't get a start against a left-handed pitcher during his four 
seasons with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been allowed to hit against left-handed pitchers in the majors, so 
it's pretty hard to prove you're capable of being an everyday player," he said. 
"It's a little frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, however, will not be writing names on his lineup card in strict 
accordance to the lefty-righty gospel. Myers, he says, was successful in 
limited action against left-handers last season -- he hit .375 with three 
doubles in 24 at-bats -- and Rodgers puts a great deal of emphasis on the 
handling of pitchers and battery chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see how things go," Rodgers said. "To me, the pitcher-catcher game 
is a very important part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Turner and Myers have to hope that the catcher-baserunner relationship 
doesn't weigh too heavily on Rodgers' decisions, or Fabregas might be called up 
sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers threw out only 23 of 90 would-be base stealers last season. Turner 
caught only one of 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that 90% of the time, it's not the catcher's fault," Langston 
said. "It's our responsibility to make sure those guys don't get too good of a 
lead or too good of a jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think both Greg and Chris are throwing pretty well now." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Turner suffered from a sore shoulder and Myers felt like he 
suffered from circumstances beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the catcher can only do so much," Myers said. "I thought I threw the 
ball pretty well last year, way better than my numbers showed, anyway. The 
other night there was a double steal and they got such a good jump, I didn't 
even throw the ball. There's two stolen bases against me right there and you 
can't really say that's my fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many things that go into it, it's a little frustrating that it's a 
number that's hung on the catcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner believes his performance against baserunners was merely a slump caused 
by a myriad of factors that can all be overcome with good health, hard work and 
a reversal of fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "My arm started bothering me in spring training and I don't think I ever had 
the kind of arm strength that I had the year before," he said. "I was in a 
year-long slump and it was really a little bit of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got off a great throw, the guy just happened to have a really good jump. 
Or if we had a chance, then I didn't make a very good throw. I'm not worrying 
about it, though. I've been on a shoulder program to relieve the biceps 
tendinitis that was bothering me. I've been lifting and I feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers -- we did mention he was a catcher, didn't we? -- says his pitchers 
are mostly at fault for the base-stealing barrage against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as this doesn't become a head problem, then I'm not worried about 
it," he said. "The pitchers just haven't done a very good job of holding guys 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Tuesday in Minnesota, the battle-not-so-royal will begin to rage, with 
Fabregas waiting to take on the victor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be players pushing you, no matter where you are," 
Myers said. "There will always be good young players coming up. All you can do 
is your best." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 25, is convinced his best will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to put them into a spot where they have to make a decision between a 
good young player with potential and a good young player who's already proven 
he can do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, Myers has already thrown a few coins in that wishing well.

OLDER, WISER SMALL INVESTORS TAKING STOCK SLIDE IN STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF and CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John E. Brown learned a lot from the 1987 stock market crash. And what he 
learned has kept him calm -- even in the face of a recent free fall in stock 
prices that has pared the value of his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 His investments, once in individual stocks, are now better diversified through 
mutual funds. He is patient because he is investing for the long term. And he's 
far better educated about the market than he was less than seven years ago, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not changing my portfolio because of this," says Brown, a 44-year-old 
attorney from Riverside, speaking of the recent slide that has seen the Dow 
Jones industrial average fall nearly 8% amid renewed fears that Wall Street's 
bull market may finally be over. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the market's roller-coaster ride continued with the Dow falling 
more than 65 points before closing up a modest 9.21 points -- its first advance 
in six trading days. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of individual investors like Brown appear to be taking the recent 
market selloff in stride. Thanks in part to a sweeping trend toward investing 
in mutual funds and retirement plans -- which tend to have a long-term 
orientation -- individuals are less likely to panic as many did in the 1987 
crash, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small investors are more aware and informed today than they were a few years 
ago," said Mark Bergman, senior vice president of the brokerage Cruttenden & 
Co. in Irvine. "They're personally involved with their investments rather than 
just relying on their broker to tell them what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Demographic trends also are a factor, as baby boomers who are investing for 
retirement -- and willing to ride out short-term declines -- make up a huge and 
growing force among small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 And small investors are considerably more educated -- learning, for example, 
that stocks usually recover from selloffs. Applying the age-old money-making 
rule -- "buy low, sell high" -- some small investors are just as likely to buy 
when stocks drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals are finally somewhat smarter. They are older and wiser. They have 
been through market corrections before and they realize they never should have 
sold," says Joseph Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, a long and sustained slide in stock prices could shatter the 
confidence of individual investors and send them heading for the exits. Indeed, 
many individual investors have sold some of their investments in mutual funds 
that hold bonds and foreign stocks -- two market segments that have declined 
much more sharply that U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this thing continues for another month, I think you might see a change," 
economist Wahed says. "Really, you have to have nerves of steel to resist 
selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are mutual funds a panacea, said Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of the 
brokerage Newport Securities Corp. in Costa Mesa. "They have no magical ability 
to go contrary to the market," he said. "Large, diversified portfolios tend to 
be less volatile than individual stock, but you give up some potential for a 
large percentage gain." 
</P>
<P>
 But influenced by forecasts of rising corporate profits and strong economic 
growth -- a point underscored Thursday when President Clinton said Americans 
should remain confident "the fundamental economy is sound" -- many individual 
investors for now say they're either staying put or investing more. Indeed, 
market experts blame the recent selloff primarily on actions of big 
institutions and managers of huge multibillion-dollar investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside attorney Brown continues to invest regularly. "This (recent slide) 
just means that I'm buying at lower prices," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sense of calm continues in the face of further erosion in stock 
prices, it could have a sweeping effect on the world's financial markets, 
bolstering stock prices over the long haul and bolstering confidence in the 
economy, market experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors now have roughly $5.3 trillion invested in stocks, either 
individually or through pension and mutual funds, according to Federal Reserve 
data. That total -- and the market-moving power it brings with it -- dwarfs 
stocks owned by such institutions as life insurance companies, banks and 
foreign firms, which amount to just over $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Other technical shifts in investing patterns also bode well for the stock 
market, experts say. Specifically, since 1987 there's been a dramatic increase 
in investing through mutual funds. Mutual funds now own roughly $667 billion 
worth of corporate stocks -- about 11% of all U.S. equities -- compared with 
just $182 billion, or 6.5%, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike brokers selling individual stocks, who earn commissions when investors 
buy or sell, mutual fund companies earn profits by charging annual management 
fees. Accordingly, they have an incentive to keep investors from the frequent 
buying and selling that brokers find profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, fund companies have made a herculean effort in recent years to 
educate investors about the dangers of trying to "time" market swings, 
counseling them instead to hold on when trends seem bleak. Their message: Over 
the long haul, stocks perform better than other investments, even though their 
prices bounce around in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 The message so far seems to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, reports 
a huge increase in individuals calling for information about the stock market 
over the last week. But, by and large, these customers haven't been selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from modest shifting of money into money-market funds from stock and 
bond funds, investors haven't been doing much of anything, says Neal Litvack, 
executive vice president of Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the October, 1987, crash, some Fidelity stock funds shrunk 
by 10% to 15% in a matter of days as investors took their money and headed for 
the door. Notably, starting in late 1987, the market almost immediately bounced 
back. But individual investors didn't return to stocks for nearly two years, 
after the market had climbed significantly, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a demographic shift among investors as well -- a natural 
consequence of the aging of the baby-boom generation. Many baby boomers -- 
having already bought homes and beginning to see their grown-up kids leave -- 
have shifted their emphasis from spending to saving as they find themselves 
ever closer to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore the point, mutual funds report that the percentage of their 
investors' money in retirement-oriented accounts has soared to about 40% from 
about 20% in 1987. Additionally, some 42% of the new money that continues to 
flow into funds is going into retirement accounts, adds Steve Norwitz, a 
spokesman for the T. Rowe Price mutual fund company in Baltimore. Since this is 
money that investors are unlikely to tap for short-term needs, it tends to be 
fairly stable, Norwitz notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may be more significant is that investors have been seasoned by 
experience and educated by an increasingly sophisticated financial media, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, business pages in the newspaper -- often just a page tagged 
behind the sports section -- tended to report events without spending much time 
analyzing them. But in the last several years, newspapers have made a greater 
effort to examine the reasons behind financial trends, and that's given 
investors more perspective when dealing with a market slide. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investors have weathered steep drops in market prices in 1987, 
1989 and 1990. And in each case, stock prices not only bounced back to previous 
levels, they continued to hit new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen this before," says Mitchel Von Wieser, a 73-year-old Laguna Hills 
retiree. "Investing in stocks isn't a crapshoot. I have invested in real 
businesses that are doing well. There is no reason to panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Howard Gordon, a Palm Springs-based certified public accountant: "I'm a 
long-term investor, and in the long term, this doesn't mean anything."

THE TIMES POLL; CALIFORNIANS' APPROVAL OF CLINTON AT HIGH POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the swirl of controversy over the Whitewater land deal and concerns 
over his health care plan, President Clinton now has the highest approval 
ratings in California seen in any Los Angeles Times poll since his inauguration 
14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-eight percent of Californians said they favor the way Clinton is 
handling his job, a 7-point jump from October. And a rise in the positive 
endorsements carried across the board: Among registered voters, Clinton's 
popularity rose 10 points to 59%. Even 36% of Republicans said they approve of 
his handling of the presidency, up from 21% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase comes as the President and, by extension, his Administration, are 
enmeshed in debate over the First Family's long-ago Arkansas land investments 
and an independent counsel's probe of the deals and related matters. The poll 
does show that, regardless of the high ratings, Californians have not ignored 
the months-long controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey indicates that Clinton's ratings would probably be higher without 
Whitewater, since 25% say they look less favorably on him because of it. 
Further, the public is clearly confused about the issue and it still has the 
potential of turning people against the President. 
</P>
<P>
 About a quarter of Californians said they believe the Clintons have engaged in 
wrongdoing, another quarter say they have not, and the remaining half say they 
don't know enough to form an opinion. Those who say they have not come to a 
conclusion about Whitewater form a bulwark of Clinton support, favoring him 
56%-33%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about something with the possibility to unfold," said John 
Brennan, director of the Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's jump in the ratings occurred not only under the cloud of concern 
over Whitewater but also amid a weakening of statewide support for his health 
care plan, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 42% said they approve of the health care plan on which Clinton is 
planning to spend much of his political capital this year -- and that is down 
from 52% support last October. The percentage of people who disapprove of the 
Clinton plan has risen, to 38% this month from 32% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll surveyed 1,608 adults between March 26 and 29. Included were 
1,211 registered voters. The overall sampling error is 3 points in either 
direction; for Democrats and Republicans it is 5 points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October's Times poll was taken well before the explosion of publicity 
about the Whitewater land dealings. Because there have been no California polls 
in the interim, Brennan said, it is impossible to determine whether the current 
58% approval rating is Clinton's high-water mark or whether it represents a 
lessening of prior, unpolled support. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is clearly demonstrating strength in the nation's most important 
electoral state. The President apparently has benefited from his close 
attention to California, which he has visited 10 times since his January, 1993, 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and other Administration officials have been particularly visible 
since last January's Northridge earthquake, and that level of attention is 
probably providing continued political benefits, Brennan said. A Times poll of 
Los Angeles County residents taken the weekend after the quake showed that 73% 
supported Clinton's handling of the disaster. In the most recent poll, his 
overall job rating in Los Angeles County was a healthy 62%. Clinton is also 
likely to be benefiting from increased confidence about the economy. The poll 
showed that Californians are now more positive about the state's economy and 
their own pocketbooks than they have been in years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Californians have shifted their views about which political 
party is best suited to solve the state's problems. Although that judgment went 
by a paper-thin margin to the Republicans in October -- 32% to 30% -- the 
advantage now rests with Clinton's party, 37% to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their particular reasons, almost all voter groups expressed more 
support for Clinton's handling of the presidency than they had previously. One 
exception was rural residents, whose 56%-34% positive job approval in October 
dropped to a 43%-53% negative rating in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Clinton's core constituencies -- Democrats, liberals, African Americans, 
moderates and women -- his approval ratings were consistently better. Even 
those not naturally inclined to look kindly on Clinton were more supportive of 
him than they had been in October: Thirty-seven percent of conservatives, for 
example, favored Clinton, up from 29% last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hypothetical presidential match-up conducted by the poll, Clinton beat 
out two other prospective candidates by about the same margin as he won 
California by in 1992. Asked whether they would support Clinton, independent 
Ross Perot or Republican Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas in a 1996 presidential 
election, 50% of registered voters said Clinton, 30% sided with Dole and 16% 
with Perot. In 1992, Clinton won 46% of the California vote, with 32.6% going 
to Republican George Bush and 20.6% to Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong job approval ratings did not translate into concurrent support of 
Clinton's explanations about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has said that neither he nor his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
did anything wrong when they invested in the Whitewater development in the late 
1970s. In the poll, 26% said they believed there was no wrongdoing by the 
Clintons, about the same as the 27% who believed there has been wrongdoing. Of 
the latter, only 15% characterized the wrongdoing as "serious." The bulk of the 
respondents, 47%, said they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty obvious in those answers, residents were more 
clear-cut in describing how the Clintons' involvement in the real estate deal 
affected their feelings about the President. Only 4% felt more favorable about 
him while 25% felt less favorable, a net loss to Clinton. Sixty-nine percent 
said Whitewater had no impact on their feelings about Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people said that the Clintons are cooperating adequately with 
investigations into the Whitewater matter -- 61% of all Californians believe 
so, as well as 63% of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The California results on the President's health care proposals represent a 
drop of support -- and a concurrent hike in disapproval -- for the 
high-priority plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 42% who approved of the plan, only 16% described their support as 
strong. Of the 38% who disapproved of the plan, 27% described their opposition 
as strong. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are consistent with a new national poll, which showed support for 
the Clinton health care plan at an all-time low of 42%. THE TIMES POLL: State 
Thinks Highly of Clinton 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drag of Whitewater and growing doubts about his health care plan, 
President Clinton's approval score among Californians is the highest measured 
by the Times Poll since his inauguration.

</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,608 California adults, including 1,211 registered 
voters, by telephone from March 26 through 29. Telephone numbers were chosen 
from a list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were 
used so that listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. Results were weighted slightly to conform 
with census figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling 
error for the total and registered voter samples is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. For certain other sub-groups the error margin may vary. Poll results 
can also be affected by other factors such as question wording and the order in 
which questions are presented.

O.C. PALIMONY TRIAL CATCHES NATION'S EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trial is a classic case of "he says, she says," but legal experts say it 
could lead to the biggest palimony settlement ever in a case that is dripping 
with enough romantic intrigue, high finance and secrecy to hold an audience of 
courtroom TV watchers captive. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening statements began Thursday in the palimony trial of Anthony Maglica, 
the founder of a $300-million flashlight empire, and Claire Maglica, the vice 
president of his company who took Maglica's name and lived with him for more 
than 22 years. They made headlines last year when they spent hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on a blinded boy they rescued from Bosnia. The Maglicas 
told people they were married, but never were. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, just one week after moving from the couple's Anaheim Hills 
estate, Claire Maglica took the multimillionaire to trial, saying she deserves 
half of the empire they built together as they transformed a humble machine 
shop into what attorneys described as a world premier flashlight company.

<P>
 Claire Maglica, 60, alleges that Anthony broke an oral agreement they made 
when they met in 1971 to always share everything and "live out of one pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case about trust, and it is a case about greed," Claire Maglica's 
attorney, John W. Keker, told an Orange County Superior Court jury as the trial 
got underway live on Courtroom Television Network. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a case about love, and someone who didn't remember the promises he made 
once he stopped loving." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for Anthony Maglica, 64, say he was burned by a divorce once and 
vowed from the beginning of the relationship never to marry again in order to 
protect his property. He contends that he only let Claire Maglica use his name 
and publicly introduce herself as his wife "to avoid embarrassment to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica says the couple signed an agreement in 1977 vowing to keep 
their property separate -- an agreement she says she misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll find that this is a story that is truly rags to riches," Anthony 
Maglica's attorney, Dennis M. Wasser, told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those riches, he argued, belong to Anthony Maglica, not Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, jurors glimpsed snapshots of the couple's life together: There 
were photos of them standing with former President Bush when he visited their 
Ontario-based Mag Industries Inc. Other pictures showed the couple in matching 
fur coats, the company Rolls-Royce that Claire drove and their executive office 
at Mag with desks side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a long way from their first meeting in 1971: Anthony Maglica was a 
Croatian immigrant who eked out a living in a Southern California machine shop 
so sparsely furnished that he hung his clothes on a pair of skis in the corner, 
showered in a washbasin and walked across the railroad tracks to a nearby 
Wienerschnitzel for meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire had come from an impoverished past in New York, where she spent her 
teen years in an orphanage. Both were at the tail end of failing marriages when 
they met. 
</P>
<P>
 She was working as an interior designer when he called her to his machine shop 
to help redecorate. Within a month, they were spending the weekend at a Palm 
Springs motel, vowing to commit to one another, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked about whatever we built together from the business, which was in 
the dregs then, we would own together," said Claire Maglica, a pale, willowy 
woman with an immaculate gray bob and a heavy New York accent that hints at her 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony told me we were one pocket," she told the jury. "We'd make it. We'd eat 
beans together if we had to, but we'd do it together." 
</P>
<P>
 She glared at Anthony Maglica as she took the witness stand. Anthony, a 
balding, gray-haired man with bushy sideburns, sat slightly hunched as she 
spoke. Earlier he shook his head repeatedly as her lawyer outlined Claire's 
side for the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Mag Industries Inc. now employs more than 600 people and occupies 11 buildings 
in Ontario. In the late 1970s, the company developed its first flashlight, the 
Mag-Lite, which quickly came into widespread use by street cops and homeowners 
preparing earthquake kits. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship began to sour in 1992, Claire says, when Anthony told her 
she was neither his wife nor his business partner and never had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his assets have become somewhat of a mystery. According to Claire 
Maglica, Anthony has funneled millions of dollars out of the company since she 
filed her lawsuit in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica has filed a cross-complaint accusing Claire of violating their 
written agreement by secretly setting up a joint account and embezzling more 
than $360,000 from him since 1989, spending the money for clothing, jewelry and 
gifts for her children from marriage and for her grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one pocket and it was picked," Wasser told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 So sensitive are Anthony Maglica's business holdings that Superior Court Judge 
Robert J. Polis agreed to seal the case file to keep financial information from 
the prying eyes of business competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 After Claire sued, she remained in the couple's home until last week to help 
care for the Bosnian boy they had rescued last year, her attorney said. Last 
month, Anthony Maglica took young Sead Bekric with him to Lillehammer, Norway, 
for the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Forty thousand flashlights 
donated by Maglica illuminated the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica's attorney, however, said Claire's reasons for staying so long 
in the couple's home were less noble: She enjoyed the luxuries of the estate 
and what Wasser described as a generous allowance that helped her amass an 
awesome collection of jewels, clothes and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only one who rivals her in the number of shoes is possibly Imelda 
Marcos," Wasser told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to hear that Claire Maglica lived like a queen," he said. "Mrs. 
Maglica drove the Rolls-Royce. She stays in the best hotels and always has. 
She's met presidents and vice presidents, and she works her own hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The money she received came to about $1.7 million over the years, Wasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keker countered that the money his client received was well earned. As vice 
president and secretary of Mag Instruments Inc., Claire handled all the 
marketing and personnel decisions, and read Anthony his mail because he does 
not read English well, Keker said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company incorporated in 1974, Anthony Maglica became the sole 
shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 He also insisted that all the property they bought be placed in his name, a 
fact that Claire's attorney said verged on paranoia. His attorney said it 
merely points out how Anthony felt from the beginning about keeping control of 
his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire agreed to accept a salary that was lower than some of the men reporting 
to her only because she was sure all their earnings from Mag were pooled, Keker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her idea to make the mini-mag flashlight -- a smaller version of the 
Mag-Lite -- in different colors as a woman's touch, she testified. And in the 
1980s, she said, it was her idea to create a AAA-battery travel version of the 
small flashlight for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica also said she laid out Anthony's clothes every day, taught him 
how to improve his English and went to 15 to 20 trade shows a year in the early 
years of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Court-watchers say Claire Maglica's stature in the company sets this case 
apart from other palimony suits. That's part of what prompted the Courtroom 
Television Network to cover the case live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her testimony is that she's been sitting across from him in the office for 
years, actually working," said Clara Tuma, the network's reporter on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The first case that coined the term "palimony" caught the public's attention 
in the 1970s, when Michelle Triola sued actor Lee Marvin after they separated. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning about the Marvin case, Anthony Maglica contends, he and Claire 
drafted the 1977 agreement to keep their property separate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Claire says Anthony stuck a document in front her face and told her to 
sign it one night after they celebrated the sixth anniversary of their first 
romantic night together in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney said she believed the document said they would marry one day. 
Attorneys said the case will boil down to whether jurors believe Claire's 
version about an oral agreement or Anthony's version of events about the 
written agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wasser: "What you're asked to decide is, 'What was the deal between these 
two people?' Take a look at the written agreement. That was the deal," Wasser 
told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keker: "We'll ask you whether or not that contract they made . . . should 
be honored, or whether Tony is right. He gets everything and she doesn't get a 
knife, spoon or a tea cup."

S. AFRICA DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY IN NATAL PROVINCE; VIOLENCE: DE KLERK 
SENDS TROOPS INTO ZULU-DOMINATED REGION, WHERE CHIEF BUTHELEZI OPPOSES THIS 
MONTH'S NATIONAL ALL-RACE ELECTIONS. MANDELA APPLAUDS CRACKDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a desperate bid to quell spiraling pre-election violence, the government 
declared a sweeping state of emergency in Zulu-dominated Natal province 
Thursday and ordered a significant military force deployed to ensure that 
balloting is possible in the strife-torn region. 
</P>
<P>
 It is South Africa's first state of emergency since President Frederik W. de 
Klerk lifted far harsher nationwide emergency regulations in 1990 at the start 
of his dramatic campaign to end the legalized oppression of blacks under 
apartheid and usher in parliamentary democracy and black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crackdown makes a confrontation almost inevitable with defiant Zulu 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the only black homeland leader who still 
opposes the nation's first all-race elections, to be held this month. His Zulu 
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party has sworn to boycott the vote, ignore the new 
constitution and resist the new post-apartheid government. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing the decision at a news conference in Pretoria, De Klerk urged the 
increasingly tense nation to "remain very, very calm." Flanked by his defense 
minister and military chiefs, he added: "We are in control. There is no need to 
panic." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited reports of panic buying of food and gasoline in Johannesburg and 
other cities "almost as if we were going into a state of siege." 
</P>
<P>
 The military later announced that at least 500 paratroopers and infantry 
soldiers will be deployed this weekend in the embattled eastern province, 
including the scattered areas within it that form the self-governing tribal 
homeland of KwaZulu. Natal is one of four provinces in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency gives police enhanced power to ban protests, detain suspects 
without trial, order curfews and seize weapons. Political meetings or 
demonstrations will be allowed only with permission from a magistrate, and the 
KwaZulu police controlled by Buthelezi will be confined to barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi called the decree "humiliating" and warned that the estimated 7 
million Zulus, the country's largest ethnic group, would "see it as an 
invasion" if South African soldiers and tanks moved into their traditional 
stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi showed no signs of backing down, insisting that the partial 
suspension of civil rights only proves his point that his political enemies are 
determined to crush Zulu culture. He repeated his demand that elections be 
delayed until international mediators can adjudicate his demands for an 
autonomous Zulu state and restoration of a long-defunct Zulu kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that is happening now completely justifies our stand and 
vindicates us," he said. "We're being coerced through the barrel of a gun. 
We're starting another chapter of oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nelson Mandela, who is expected to become South Africa's first black 
president after the April 26-28 elections, applauded the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's action has one purpose -- to stem the tide of violence which 
threatens to engulf us all," Mandela told a news conference in Johannesburg, 
where a chaotic Zulu protest march Monday resulted in violence that killed 53 
people in the city and townships. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the army would be fully mobilized and in "complete control" by early 
next week across Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's African National Congress was the target of three emergency decrees 
imposed by the ruling white minority regime in the 1960s and 1980s to 
ruthlessly crush black opposition to apartheid. Tens of thousands of people 
were arrested, including Mandela, who eventually spent 27 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has used far more limited powers several times in the last four 
years in localized trouble spots; 11 "unrest areas" were declared Monday, for 
example, after the bloodshed in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 The army has been used twice in the last month to take over former tribal 
homelands created under white minority rule. But pacifying the much larger 
province of Natal may be far more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 It holds about one-fifth the country's 40 million people. And though Buthelezi 
has no formal army, KwaZulu has a well-armed police force and training camps 
that have armed thousands of ardent Zulu guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Turf wars between local members of Inkatha and the ANC have grown steadily 
over the last decade, but the violence has exploded since Buthelezi stepped up 
his anti-election rhetoric. At least 290 people were killed and hundreds were 
wounded in Natal and KwaZulu in March, a grim new record. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the bloodshed continued, an independent judicial commission revealed 
last month that rogue police officials had secretly sold rifles, mortars, 
grenades and other weapons to Inkatha leaders for distribution to anti-ANC 
death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk said his action in Natal and KwaZulu is not a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law and order will be maintained, and we will not allow anarchy to develop," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the interim constitution adopted last December, KwaZulu and the other 
homelands created under apartheid will officially cease to exist after the 
elections. The first black-led government will stop paying for Buthelezi's 
perks, patronage and power base. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts questioned whether an emergency crackdown is warranted. The 
independent Human Rights Commission condemned the decree, saying "the emergency 
has placed a cloud over the legitimacy of the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings this week with election officials, Buthelezi gave half-hearted 
assurances that voting will be allowed in Inkatha-controlled areas on Election 
Day. But his followers have begun a brutal campaign of burning homes, stabbing 
election workers, attacking cars and disrupting ANC rallies.

LAPD'S 'WALL' MAY TOPPLE AS PART OF ENTRANCE EXAM; POLICE: SCALING THE SIX-FOOT 
BARRIER IS A KEY OBSTACLE FOR APPLICANTS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN. CRITICS SAYS IT'S 
OBSOLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For many women, the only obstacle standing between them and a career with the 
Los Angeles Police Department is a six-foot wooden wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaling "the wall" is one of the Police Academy's pass-fail entrance 
requirements, part of an intense physical exam designed to weed out the weak 
from the strong. Fail it and forget a badge. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall, with its emphasis on upper body strength, is one of the biggest 
reasons that women are turned away from the department. About a third of women 
who take the test cannot pull themselves up and over the scuff-marked wall, 
compared to about 5% of men, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had dreams about the wall," said one female applicant who has struggled 
with it. "I've had knots in my stomach. I'm always thinking, 'I've got to get 
over it. I've got to get over it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As the LAPD tries to close a significant gender gap, the wall has become a 
growing point of controversy. A City Hall study of LAPD testing and training 
requirements is expected to recommend that the wall be knocked down as an 
entrance requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The police admissions test is particularly critical now. After years of 
moderate hiring within the force, Mayor Richard Riordan is pushing for a 
massive expansion of the LAPD. At the same time, the City Council has set a 
goal of 43% for female LAPD officers, a long way from the current 15% figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wall is symbolic of the old days," said Katherine Spillar, national 
coordinator for the Feminist Majority Foundation and a former adviser to the 
Los Angeles Police Commission. "These tests screen out people who might make 
excellent community police officers in favor of brute strength. Do we just want 
weightlifters and Marines, the old stereotype of brawny muscle-bound men?" 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to approximate the fences that officers occasionally climb on the 
job, the six-foot wall is a graduation requirement for all California peace 
officers. But most agencies have eliminated the wall as an entrance requirement 
to their training academies. The LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department are among the departments that have not. 
</P>
<P>
 As the LAPD moves toward community policing, which emphasizes mediation skills 
and close contact with neighborhoods, some critics are questioning the 
usefulness of the wall as an entrance requirement -- especially because scaling 
it is a skill that can be learned at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we want a bunch of wimps in the department," said Penny 
Harrington, a former police chief in Portland, Ore., and one of the leading 
critics of the LAPD policy. "We want a test that measures the ability to do the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the department, officers complain about the prospect of altering a 
physical test they had to pass. They say police work is tough and the entrance 
requirements ought to be just as tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is symbolic of the determination and commitment that one has to 
become a Los Angeles police officer," said Capt. Margaret York, the LAPD's 
highest-ranking woman and one who supports the wall. "It is something women can 
do, although it is not something that is easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Lynne Hamilton, the rookie officer shot to death last month four days 
out of the Police Academy, was one who struggled with the wall. She was so 
determined to join the force that she built a six-foot wall in her back yard so 
she could practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Police Academy applicants take the physical abilities test after 
passing a written test, interview, medical exam and background check. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fail the physical portion may retake it. There are special training 
classes to help applicants on their second attempt -- and LAPD statistics show 
that the classes boost the pass rate for women to nearly that of men. But some 
of those who fail do not sign up for the classes, drifting away from a 
department that is under great pressure to increase the number of women in its 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are women for whom the wall is their Waterloo," said Abby Leibman of 
the California Women's Law Center. "We lose some women for this reason alone. 
They may make great police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the wall is part of an ongoing rethinking of the role of the 
modern-day police officer. The emphasis is shifting from military-style 
policing that places a premium on weaponry and confrontation, to a 
community-oriented approach that encourages bicycle and foot patrols that bring 
officers closer to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the height requirement for LAPD officers has dropped from 5-foot, 
8-inches to an even 5 feet. The latest class to come through the academy 
illustrates the change: For the first time in history, the class leader was a 
woman, one who is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 118 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But rethinking the department's role does not make the streets less mean, and 
some within the LAPD are uncomfortable fiddling with standards that have stood 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Tisdale, a senior lead officer in the West Valley Division, said: 
"You have to get over walls as a officer. It's ridiculous to think you don't 
have to do that. If you can't get over a wall, don't be a police officer. This 
is not a sorority." 
</P>
<P>
 The wall's critics say they want fair standards, not less-trained officers. 
They note that officers never have to scale the Police Academy wall again 
during their careers, and they wonder how many current officers could make it 
over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selection and training processes must eliminate all exercises like the 
wall that unnecessarily and unfairly depress female participation by favoring 
physical strength over more highly needed interpersonal communication skills," 
said a report prepared last year by the women's advisory committee to the Los 
Angeles Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, an increasing number of City Council members have questioned the 
validity of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physical requirements for the job are perfectly legitimate," said 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who chairs the Personnel Committee. "You need 
more than just good negotiating skills to be an officer. But I have a number of 
difficulties with the wall. . . . If our experts find a legitimate need for it, 
I'll back off." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Personnel Department is in the midst of a wide-ranging review of 
all LAPD testing and training procedures. The two-year study is due to be 
released by the end of April, and department officials say there is a good 
chance the wall may be eliminated as a prerequisite to entering the LAPD 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
 If that proves correct, the wall will remain a graduation requirement at the 
academy, as required by the state Committee on Peace Officers Standards and 
Training. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall is not the only test that may be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Henning, assistant general manager of the Personnel Department, said 
other elements of the physical entrance exam -- such as dragging a dead weight 
and hanging on a bar -- may be altered in favor of more scientific methods of 
measuring fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Police experts have come down on both sides of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The state completed its own review of the tasks that police officers typically 
perform on the job and found that "climbing is a critical activity that occurs 
with extremely high frequency." The findings indicated that 69% of all climbing 
involved fences or walls. Of those climbs, two-thirds involved solid, six-foot 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the wall point out other studies. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of police physical exams that appeared in a law enforcement trade 
magazine found: "The data did not support the need to climb or jump six-foot 
walls or barriers, walk a balance beam, pull a rope down to the floor against 
some resistance, drag a heavy object some distance, push vehicles or crawl 
through pipes or windows." 
</P>
<P>
 The authors, who included a criminal justice professor, an exercise consultant 
and a police chief, recommended a test that concentrated more on physical 
fitness than strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Academics aside, eliminating the wall is liable to rile the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams, treading cautiously, said he is waiting for 
the review of the test before taking a position concerning the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things you should know how to do," he said in an interview. 
"But we also want a test that doesn't discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
 Could the chief get over the wall today? 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that as an officer in Philadelphia, he scaled an eight-foot wall 
during a chase. As for the LAPD wall, Williams said he hasn't tried.

RAGS-TO-RICHES FORTUNE AT STAKE IN PALIMONY SUIT; TRIAL: WOMAN SAYS SHE 
DESERVES HALF OF $300-MILLION EMPIRE. MAN SAYS THEY AGREED TO KEEP PROPERTY 
SEPARATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The trial is a classic case of "he says, she says," but legal experts believe 
it could lead to the biggest palimony settlement ever in a case that is 
dripping with enough romantic intrigue, high finance and secrecy to hold 
captive an audience of courtroom TV watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening statements began Thursday in the palimony trial of Anthony Maglica, 
the founder of a $300-million flashlight empire, and Claire Maglica, the vice 
president of his company and a woman who took Maglica's name and lived with him 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They told people they were married, but never were. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, just one week after moving from the couple's Anaheim Hills 
estate, Claire Maglica took the multimillionaire to trial, saying she deserves 
half of the empire they built together as they transformed a humble machine 
shop into what attorneys described as a premier flashlight company. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica, 60, alleges that Anthony broke an oral agreement they made 
when they met in 1971 to always share everything and "live out of one pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case about trust, and it is a case about greed," Claire Maglica's 
attorney, John W. Keker, told an Orange County Superior Court jury as the trial 
got under way live on the Courtroom Television Network. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a case about love, and someone who didn't remember the promises he made 
once he stopped loving." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for Anthony Maglica, 64, say he was burned by a divorce once and 
vowed from the beginning of the relationship never to marry again in order to 
protect his property. He contends that he only let Claire Maglica use his name 
and publicly introduce herself as his wife "in order to avoid embarrassment to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica says the couple signed an agreement in 1977 vowing to keep 
their property separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll find that this is a story that is truly rags to riches," Anthony 
Maglica's attorney, Dennis M. Wasser, told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those riches, he argued, belong to Anthony Maglica, not Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Thursday, her attorney showed jurors snapshots of the couple's life 
together. There were photos of them standing with former President George Bush 
when he visited their Ontario-based Mag Industries Inc. Other pictures showed 
the couple in matching fur coats, the company Rolls-Royce that Claire drove and 
their executive office at Mag with side-by-side desks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a quite a change from their circumstances when they met in 1971. 
Anthony Maglica was a Croatian immigrant who eked out a living in a machine 
shop so sparsely furnished that he hung his clothes on a pair of skis in the 
corner, showered in a wash basin and walked across the railroad tracks to the 
local hot dog stand for meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire had come from an impoverished past in New York, where she spent her 
teen years in an orphanage. Both were at the end of failing marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Mag Industries Inc. now employs more than 600 people and occupies 11 buildings 
in Ontario. Their relationship began to sour in 1992, when Claire says Anthony 
told her she was neither his wife nor his business partner and never had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his assets have become something of a mystery. According to Claire 
Maglica, Anthony has funneled millions of dollars out of the company since she 
filed her suit in July. So sensitive are his business holdings that Superior 
Court Judge Robert J. Polis agreed to seal the file in the case to keep 
financial information from the preying eyes of business competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The case that coined the term palimony caught the public's attention in the 
1970s, when Michelle Triola sued actor Lee Marvin after they separated. Like 
the Maglicas, they never married. A judge found there was no agreement to share 
income but still awarded Triola $104,000. That was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In another high-profile case, actress-director Sondra Locke filed a palimony 
suit in 1989 against longtime lover Clint Eastwood -- even though she was still 
legally married to, but separated from, her first husband. Records were sealed 
in the Eastwood case and proceedings were later held behind closed doors. 
Rumors circulated that Locke received several million in a settlement, but 
Locke has denied those reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury rejected a palimony suit brought 
against the estate of the late multimillionaire Henry T. Mudd by one of his 
seven mistresses. Mudd, who co-founded Harvey Mudd College in Claremont in his 
father's name, died in 1990, shortly after Eleanor (Lorraine) Oliver filed a 
$5-million lawsuit seeking compensation for her "wife-like companionship." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning about the Marvin case, Anthony Maglica contends that he and 
Claire drafted the 1977 agreement to keep their property separate. But she says 
he stuck a document in front of her face one night and told her to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney said she believed the document stated that they would marry one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 In her testimony, Claire Maglica said she laid out Anthony's clothes every 
day, taught him how to improve his English and went to 15 to 20 trade shows a 
year in the early years of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was the one who suggested to Anthony that they make a smaller 
flashlight and market it to a wider audience in a variety of colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role began at the very beginning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said the case will boil down to whether jurors believe Claire's 
version about an oral agreement or Anthony's version of events about the 
written agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll ask you whether or not that contract they made 23 years ago should be 
honored, or whether Tony is right," Keker said. "He gets everything and she 
doesn't get a knife, spoon or a teacup."

NAVY PANEL SEEKS TO EXPEL 29 IN CHEATING SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A board of senior naval officers on Thursday recommended the expulsion of 29 
midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy and disciplinary actions against 42 others 
for their involvement in the largest cheating scandal in the school's 148-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, known as the Honor Review Board, cleared 35 other midshipmen of any 
wrongdoing in the December, 1992, incident. The recommendations now go to the 
chief of naval operations, Adm. Frank B. Kelso II, and ultimately to Navy 
Secretary John H. Dalton for action. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has rocked the normally staid academy and raised questions about how 
effectively it is administering its longstanding honor code, which forbids 
midshipmen to cheat or lie. The code is considered a mainstay of officer 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy inspector general's office had concluded in a separate review that 
133 students -- all of them second-classmen, or college juniors -- had obtained 
advance copies of an electrical engineering exam administered to 663 
midshipmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The course, Electric Engineering 331, was said to be one of the most difficult 
at the academy and was a prerequisite for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 The document said that although 81 students ultimately admitted to cheating, 
most of them "repeatedly" lied during an initial investigation. And it charged 
that the academy did not act quickly enough to look into allegations of a 
possible cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's recommendations capped almost a year of investigations, first by 
the academy itself and later by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, 
midshipmen-run honor boards, the academy's board of visitors and the Navy 
inspector general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard L. Armitage, a former U.S. ambassador and a member of the board of 
visitors who took part in that investigation, said the incident showed that 
"the tradition of honor at the academy has been on the back burner." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy's superintendent, Rear Adm. Thomas C. Lynch, a onetime Naval 
Academy football player, was exonerated by Dalton of accusations that he gave 
preferential treatment to members of the football team accused of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch already has expelled six of the 133 students who had been implicated in 
the scandal. The remaining 21 not covered by that action or Thursday's 
recommendations either have been cleared of any charges, have resigned or have 
been disciplined in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's recommendations did not address the unanswered question of how the 
students obtained copies of the exam. The inspector general's report in January 
quoted one student as saying a football player had received a copy from a 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 One troubling factor for the Navy is the apparent failure of those who knew 
about the incident to report it to superior officers, as the honor code 
requires. Earlier investigations found that many midshipmen viewed the code as 
an abstract goal, not a genuine standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said Thursday that the academy now was trying to strengthen 
adherence to the honor code, which Lynch and other officials conceded had not 
been emphasized as much recently as in previous years.

ROBERTI RECALL EMERGING AS CAMPAIGN OF PARADOXES; ELECTION: THE LONGTIME 
LAWMAKER IS FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE AT A TIME WHEN HE HAD PLANNED TO 
LEAVE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 27 years in the Legislature, 13 years as head of the Senate and some 25 
occasions as acting governor, state Sen. David A. Roberti -- prodded by his 
wife, June -- had finally decided to bow out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadn't the people cast their votes against career politicians anyway, with 
term limits? And hadn't running for office changed a great deal since 1966, 
when civic-minded volunteers and $3.50-a-plate spaghetti fund-raisers first 
vaulted Roberti into the Capitol? 
</P>
<P>
 And so, late last year, the Van Nuys Democrat had reached the decision to 
forgo running for higher office when his term expired in December. For the 
first time in practically three decades, Roberti was going to lead a normal 
life. Go home at night to his family, dabble in historical research and maybe 
get a job with a bigger paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Then something happened that made him so angry it changed his mind. A 
coalition including firearms rights advocates, upset over his assault weapon 
control legislation, got a recall election set against him for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were stupid because I actually had him convinced to look for 
something else . . . to go into private life, get out of public life," June 
Roberti, her husband's closest adviser, said in a recent interview. "But the 
recall changed everything. We're in it now to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 As his foes issued their "throw-the-bum-out" cry, Roberti upped the ante and 
tossed in a bid for the state treasurer's office, declaring that he will not be 
intimidated into retiring from politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the first recall election of a state official since 1914 may be 
remembered as something of an oddity, based on a series of paradoxes: a man 
fighting for his political life at a time when the exit light had beckoned; an 
election-turned-referendum on an assault weapon ban that falls short of 
perfection; a slick anti-recall campaign that skirts the issue of whether the 
senator has done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends in the Capitol say it is typical of Roberti, a naturally introverted 
man, to step out of his shell when challenged to protect his legacy. They say 
he desperately wants to avoid ending his long career as the victim of a recall 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn your back on these people," Roberti said of the opponents he 
openly calls "cuckoos" or "nut cases" for the intensity of their Second 
Amendment rights views. "Otherwise, you turn your back on a career of 27 years, 
you turn your back on your life." 
</P>
<P>
 But recall proponents are quick to point out that 46,000 registered voters who 
signed their petitions apparently agree that Roberti has served too long in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has questioned Mr. Roberti's intelligence," said Kevin Washburn, 
manager of the recall campaign. "What we are saying is he presided over the 
Senate at a time of the worst corruption of the democratic system in California 
history. And the people of this district are entitled to their democratic 
rights to recall him." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the senator's strategy is apparent: deny that this is about Roberti 
the officeholder, and define the election as retaliation for his legislation to 
ban assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 While that tells part of the story, Roberti's own rhetoric shrinks away from 
his record or what he stands for ("You don't have to like Senator David Roberti 
. . . " says one campaign brochure urging a vote against the recall.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't view it as an election about me," Roberti said in an 
interview. "If David Roberti were somebody else who had been able to do this 
(pass gun control laws), they'd be on their case." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the underlying issues, a simple question will appear, in less 
than two weeks, on the ballot: "Should David Roberti be recalled (removed) from 
the office of State Senator?" 
</P>
<P>
 To answer that question, voters will have to determine just who is this man 
who burst onto the San Fernando Valley political scene in 1992, renting a Van 
Nuys duplex to set up residency after a quarter-century of representing 
Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol observers sum up Roberti, 54, as an adroit politician, one who 
shrewdly negotiates trade-offs -- if need be -- to further his agenda. And his 
sharp survival skills enable him to hone in on defining issues in the district, 
such as the Los Angeles Unified School District breakup movement in the Valley, 
which he championed. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a track record of successful fund raising, collecting hefty donations 
over the years from labor unions, law enforcement groups, the California 
Teachers Assn., applicant attorneys, trial lawyers and large corporations such 
as Arco and Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
 His ideology, he says, revolves around his belief that government has a 
responsibility to help people so they can eventually help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I gravitate toward the have-nots, the people who need somebody to 
fight for them," Roberti said, noting, however, that, "I think we make an error 
if we patronize anybody who thinks they are always right because of their 
condition, rather than the justice of their cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who succeeded Roberti in 
January as leader of the upper house, describes his predecessor as adept at 
forging the kinds of compromises that keep the wheels of state government 
churning. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the recall, "People tend to focus on guns," Lockyer said, 
"but I tend to see him in a different way. If there's an overarching 
philosophy, it's his sympathy for the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans in the Senate view the Roberti legacy in a more harsh light. 
</P>
<P>
 "He strikes me as having been a typical liberal Democratic legislative 
leader," said Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Upland). "He has blocked legislation that 
would have helped California's job situation over the years -- in tort law, 
environmental law, business regulation and taxation." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard described Roberti as a master manipulator when it came to influencing 
whether a bill would pass or fail. "Because of David Roberti's personality and 
dominance . . . he would stack committees to his interest and then guide 
particular bills to those committees," he said. But, he added, "I certainly 
respect his legislative skills." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Roberti has a reputation among Republicans as a die-hard liberal, one 
notable departure from that stereotype is his anti-abortion rights position, 
stemming from his Catholic upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the short and stout Roberti attends a lot of news conferences, 
often posing with the AR 15s and Colt Sporters that his gun control legislation 
targets. The image belies his reputation as a soft touch for animals, one of 
his most passionate issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He is no less than a hero to animal rights activists such as "Police Story" 
actor Earl Holliman, who says of Roberti, "He really cares. He's a very 
sensitive man." He is similarly praised by stage actress Gretchen Wyler, a 
friend who said she has seen him grow teary-eyed over the loss of a pet cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's staff hands out a laundry list of his accomplishments that include 
not only animal rights legislation but new laws to aid low-income tenants, 
increase criminal penalties for sexual abusers of children, restrict landfill 
disposal of hazardous waste and fund urban parks, AIDS and latchkey children's 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also pushing state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to use the authority given him 
by the 1989 Assault Weapons Control Act to ban so-called copycat firearms. Gun 
manufacturers are getting around Roberti's five-year-old law by making 
identical weapons under different names from those identified by the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, military weapons were also at the heart of Roberti's issues when he 
first ran for Assembly in 1966, championing an anti-Vietnam War platform while 
walking precincts with his then-fiancee, June. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met at the Young Democratic Club in Hollywood after Roberti's 
union-label family abandoned membership in the GOP because, he said, "the 
Republican Party was no longer a home for working people." 
</P>
<P>
 One of two sons of a tailor who sewed costumes for the movies, Roberti figures 
he was drawn to politics because current events were always a topic of 
conversation in his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his mother, Elvira, saw to it that the boys took voice, piano and 
tap-dancing lessons, Hollywood was never a calling for Roberti or his older 
brother -- both of whom grew up to become lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger influence on Roberti's young life was his Italian heritage, which he 
notes was a target of prejudice and scorn during the World War II era. In fact, 
when Roberti was born a 13-pound baby, his birth certificate had listed his 
parents' name as "Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very, very Italian," said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Farrell, 
a former high school classmate. "He's very proud of it, but in growing up, I 
know he felt some discrimination because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell's recollection of early Roberti campaign events is of low-budget, 
warm, family-style atmospheres in which Emil (Papa) Roberti strummed the 
mandolin and his wife cooked stew or spaghetti for a house full of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Roberti's ability to raise huge amounts of campaign funds has reached 
legendary proportions, although the money flow has dried up some since he gave 
up his Senate leadership post, a cash cow in California politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti spent more than $2 million to win the 20th Senate District in a 1992 
special election, garnering 43% of the vote. He estimates that he will have to 
spend $750,000 to defeat the recall movement, led by activists with far less 
cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was money that ended up corrupting the three lieutenants Roberti placed in 
positions of power in the Senate -- former Sens. Alan Robbins, Joseph Montoya 
and Paul Carpenter, all of whom were convicted of using their offices to extort 
cash from people seeking legislative favors. 
</P>
<P>
 By association, this has reflected poorly on Roberti and has emerged as a hot 
theme in the recall debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Washburn, "We're not trying to prosecute Mr. Roberti. We're saying there 
is political accountability. It happened on his watch, and either he knew what 
was going on and failed to stop it, or he didn't know what was going on and he 
was incompetent." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti says he was unaware of his colleagues' criminal activities. "The best 
thing I can say is, Alan Robbins represented the 20th District for 18 years, 
and there was never a recall against him. I don't have to get into Alan's 
problems, except to say they were multiple -- and nobody, but nobody, has 
accused me of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 That it is he, not Robbins, who ended up on the receiving end of a vigorous 
recall effort is an irony that leaves Roberti stinging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a human being. And human beings, they feel sorry for themselves 
sometimes," Roberti said. "Why should I have to go through this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Roberti's fellow lawmakers, unnerved by the mere thought of a recall, 
are circling the wagons and refusing to criticize the senator in his moment of 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observe that the triple duties of performing legislative work, running a 
treasurer's campaign and attempting to defeat the recall appear to be taking a 
toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense of it is that he has moments of both depression and determination," 
Lockyer said. "There's times when he feels, 'Why me? This is unfair.' And other 
times when he is determined to prove that these cranks can't destroy him. I see 
him both ways -- probably depending on whether it's the second hour of the day, 
or the 15th hour." 
</P>
<P>
 June Roberti acknowledges that her husband gets physically tired. But, she 
says, "I think he has the fighting spirit more than he has the low spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he feels sorry for himself a little bit, but he doesn't get away with 
that at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Home is a spacious, two-story Tudor-style house in Los Feliz, where Roberti's 
father, now 90, lives in the care of his daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents charge Roberti is a carpetbagger, and the senator does not try 
to hide the fact that he doesn't reside in the California bungalow-style duplex 
the Robertis rent on Hamlin Street in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 June Roberti says she stayed there for a short while after her husband won the 
Valley Senate seat, but grew anxious because of threatening notices that she 
said were left at the front door by people she assumes were firearms rights 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said he lives in Los Feliz to be with his father, whom he does not 
want to move at his advanced age. He says he uses the Hamlin Street house as an 
office, a place to put up his feet while getting some work done and unwinding 
from the stresses of public life. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a theory circulating among Roberti's supporters that, even if he 
loses his seat, he'll benefit in the treasurer's race from the higher 
visibility brought on by battling the National Rifle Assn., one of the groups 
supporting the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Catholic school. Martyrdom was always the highest calling," Roberti 
said. "But I never aspired to it. I always thought there were less drastic ways 
to achieve an objective." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, critics label Roberti an opportunist for running a crossover 
campaign that suggests his authorship of assault weapon laws would boost his 
ability as state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Roberti-for-treasurer campaign sign, for example, sports a fire-engine red 
bull's-eye for the "o" in his name, underlined with the words "The Man Who 
Banned Assault Weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) says of Roberti, "If he survives the 
recall, he will be known as the guy who fought the NRA and automatic weapons. 
But gun control is not something the state treasurer can do something about." 
</P>
<P>
 If he loses both election bids, Roberti said, he may well become a 
"personality" in the growing national movement to limit assault weapon 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does not sound crushed at the thought of someday being on the outside 
looking in: 
</P>
<P>
 "What I love about politics is what will happen when it's all over. I'll be 
David Roberti, private citizen. And I think I will be able to look back and 
say, hey, 'I was able to do -- with the help of my people -- this, this and 
this.' "

OLDER, WISER SMALL INVESTORS TAKING STOCK SLIDE IN STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF and CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John E. Brown learned a lot from the 1987 stock market crash. And what he 
learned has kept him calm -- even in the face of a recent free fall in stock 
prices that has pared the value of his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 His investments, once in individual stocks, are now better diversified through 
mutual funds. He is patient because he is investing for the long term. And he's 
far better educated about the market than he was less than seven years ago, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not changing my portfolio because of this," says Brown, a 44-year-old 
attorney from Riverside, speaking of the recent slide that has seen the Dow 
Jones industrial average fall nearly 8% amid renewed fears that Wall Street's 
bull market may finally be over. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the market's roller-coaster ride continued with the Dow falling 
more than 65 points before closing up a modest 9.21 points -- its first advance 
in six trading days. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of individual investors like Brown appear to be taking the recent 
market selloff in stride. Thanks in part to a sweeping trend toward investing 
in mutual funds and retirement plans -- which tend to have a long-term 
orientation -- individuals are less likely to panic as many did in the 1987 
crash, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographic trends also are a factor, as baby boomers who are investing for 
retirement -- and willing to ride out short-term declines -- make up a huge and 
growing force among small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 And small investors are considerably more educated -- learning, for example, 
that stocks usually recover from selloffs. Applying the age-old money-making 
rule -- "buy low, sell high" -- some small investors are just as likely to buy 
when stocks drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals are finally somewhat smarter. They are older and wiser. They have 
been through market corrections before and they realize they never should have 
sold," says Joseph Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, a long and sustained slide in stock prices could shatter the 
confidence of individual investors and send them heading for the exits. Indeed, 
many individual investors have sold some of their investments in mutual funds 
that hold bonds and foreign stocks -- two market segments that have declined 
much more sharply that U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this thing continues for another month, I think you might see a change," 
economist Wahed says. "Really, you have to have nerves of steel to resist 
selling." 
</P>
<P>
 But influenced by forecasts of rising corporate profits and strong economic 
growth -- a point underscored Thursday when President Clinton said Americans 
should remain confident "the fundamental economy is sound" -- many individual 
investors for now say they're either staying put or investing more. Indeed, 
market experts blame the recent selloff primarily on actions of big 
institutions and managers of huge multibillion-dollar investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow or the 
next day, it will eventually come back," says Mike Strievy, a 67-year-old 
arbitration judge from Chatsworth. "In fact, if the market falls a little 
further, I may put more money in. And if it falls after that, I'll put in a 
little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside attorney Brown also continues to invest regularly. "This (recent 
slide) just means that I'm buying at lower prices," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sense of calm continues in the face of further erosion in stock 
prices, it could have a sweeping effect on the world's financial markets, 
bolstering stock prices over the long haul and bolstering confidence in the 
economy, market experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors now have roughly $5.3 trillion invested in stocks, either 
individually or through pension and mutual funds, according to Federal Reserve 
data. That total -- and the market-moving power it brings with it -- dwarfs 
stocks owned by such institutions as life insurance companies, banks and 
foreign firms, which amount to just over $1 trillion. 
</P>

 Other technical shifts in investing patterns also bode well for the stock 
market, experts say. Specifically, since 1987 there's been a dramatic increase 
in investing through mutual funds. Mutual funds now own roughly $667 billion 
worth of corporate stocks -- about 11% of all U.S. equities -- compared with 
just $182 billion, or 6.5%, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike brokers selling individual stocks, who earn commissions when investors 
buy or sell, mutual fund companies earn profits by charging annual management 
fees. Accordingly, they have an incentive to keep investors from the frequent 
buying and selling that brokers find profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, fund companies have made a herculean effort in recent years to 
educate investors about the dangers of trying to "time" market swings, 
counseling them instead to hold on when trends seem bleak. Their message: Over 
the long haul, stocks perform better than other investments, even though their 
prices bounce around in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 The message so far seems to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, reports 
a huge increase in individuals calling for information about the stock market 
over the last week. But, by and large, these customers haven't been selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from modest shifting of money into money-market funds from stock and 
bond funds, investors haven't been doing much of anything, says Neal Litvack, 
executive vice president of Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the October, 1987, crash, some Fidelity stock funds shrunk 
by 10% to 15% in a matter of days as investors took their money and headed for 
the door. Notably, starting in late 1987, the market almost immediately bounced 
back. But individual investors didn't return to stocks for nearly two years, 
after the market had climbed significantly, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a demographic shift among investors as well -- a natural 
consequence of the aging of the baby-boom generation. Many baby boomers -- 
having already bought homes and beginning to see their grown-up kids leave -- 
have shifted their emphasis from spending to saving as they find themselves 
ever closer to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore the point, mutual funds report that the percentage of their 
investors' money in retirement-oriented accounts has soared to about 40% from 
about 20% in 1987. Additionally, some 42% of the new money that continues to 
flow into funds is going into retirement accounts, adds Steve Norwitz, a 
spokesman for the T. Rowe Price mutual fund company in Baltimore. Since this is 
money that investors are unlikely to tap for short-term needs, it tends to be 
fairly stable, Norwitz notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may be more significant is that investors have been seasoned by 
experience and educated by an increasingly sophisticated financial media, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, business pages in the newspaper -- often just a page tagged 
behind the sports section -- tended to report events without spending much time 
analyzing them, says John Markese, president of the American Assn. of 
Individual Investors. But in the last several years, newspapers have made a 
greater effort to examine the reasons behind financial trends, and that's given 
investors a greater sense of perspective when dealing with a market slide. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investors have weathered steep drops in market prices in 1987, 
1989 and 1990. And in each case, stock prices not only bounced back to previous 
levels, they continued to hit new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen this before," says Mitchel Von Wieser, a 73-year-old Laguna Hills 
retiree. "Investing in stocks isn't a crap shoot. I have invested in real 
businesses that are doing well. There is no reason to panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Howard Gordon, a Palm Springs-based certified public accountant: "I'm a 
long-term investor, and in the long term, this doesn't mean anything."

SLAYING SUSPECTS SHARE A PAST MARRED BY CRIME 
</P>

<P>
 Like the crimes they are accused of committing, the two young men arrested in 
the killing of a pair of college students from Japan are in many ways typical 
of Southern California's meanest streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Oscar Butler, 18, and Alberto Vasquez Reygoza, 20, have previously 
been arrested and served jail time -- Butler for burglary and Reygoza for 
possessing an illegal weapon. Police say both are gang members. Both come from 
a tough, low-income San Pedro neighborhood, a place where, for some, violent 
crime has become a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a few days after Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were shot to death in the 
parking lot of a San Pedro supermarket and their car was stripped of its 
stereo, Butler offered a 16-year-old friend some harsh advice: 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You can't get a car with a lot of sound, cause you'll get jacked 
like those guys at Ralphs,' " David Schott said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott said that when Butler got out of jail recently, he asked him: " 'You 
going to be good this time?' He says, 'For as long as I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After shadowing the suspects for two days while carefully assembling the 
evidence against them, Los Angeles police arrested Butler and Reygoza in San 
Pedro on Wednesday night and booked them on suspicion of robbing and killing 
Ito and Matsuura last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were announced by Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
shortly before 11 p.m. Wednesday, in time for broadcast on evening news 
programs in Japan, where the case has received considerable publicity and has 
revived Japanese concerns about the safety of Japanese visitors in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura were 19 years old and students at Marymount College in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, an upscale community on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' fathers, who came to Los Angeles after their sons were slain, 
welcomed the chief's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuji Matsuura called it "the news we have been waiting for." He said he 
understood that it probably will take months to complete the prosecution of the 
suspects, "which will be in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will quietly wait for your decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler and Reygoza were being held without bail Thursday. The district 
attorney's office said the two men will be arraigned this afternoon in Long 
Beach Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Janet Moore, who handled the Reginald O. Denny beating 
trial, has been assigned to prosecute the case. Officials said the suspects 
will probably be charged with robbery and murder under special circumstances, 
which could result in the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler and Reygoza grew up a few blocks from each other in a gritty San Pedro 
neighborhood beside Los Angeles Harbor, with the lush hills of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were high school dropouts and served time in Los Angeles County Jail 
shortly after turning 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors expressed more resignation than surprise Thursday at the 
arrests of the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men, they said, had known each other for some time and were 
associated with street gangs around the 479-unit Rancho San Pedro public 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Reygoza, nicknamed "Chato," was known as a gang member, his arrest did 
not come as a shock to Rancho San Pedro resident Lorenzo Guerra, 27, who said 
he served time in Los Angeles County Jail with Reygoza last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But "as a person, I'm surprised (if) he did it," Guerra said. He said Reygoza 
never seemed like a killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his parents moved to Long Beach a couple of years ago, Reygoza had lived 
on and off in the modest stucco house of Leona Bland, 36, a stevedore whose 
children were friends of the beefy suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me a story about how police pulled him over once and said they were 
going to arrest him and he said, 'Go ahead, I'm homeless. At least then I'd 
have a home,' " Bland said. "That's when we started helping him. It made us 
very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Bland said Reygoza was a dependable youth who worked for several summers as an 
aide at the local boys club. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 18, Reygoza, who had dropped out of high school, was arrested on the 
weapons violation. After pleading no contest, he was sentenced to 180 days in 
jail and ordered to undergo psychological counseling and job training. In 
January, he was arrested for violating the terms of his probation and ordered 
to spend 90 days in County Jail, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bland said that after serving the initial sentence, Reygoza seemed to harden 
and began hanging out more frequently with gang associates. "It just started 
getting heavy," Bland said. "Tattoos, everything. He got into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bland said she recently tried to help Reygoza get a job in a low-income youth 
employment program, but he was turned away because he had dressed in gang-style 
apparel -- a black T-shirt and black pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who knew Reygoza expressed anger that the isolated shootings of 
the Japanese students have attracted worldwide attention at the same time that 
homicides at the housing project almost never get media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had happened here to two Mexicans, they wouldn't have made no big deal 
-- it would just be two less Mexicans to worry about," said Jesus Cazares, 14. 
"They don't care about us, why should we care about anyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, the second of three sons in his family, was arrested on charges of 
first-degree residential burglary less than a month after he became an adult 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleading no contest, he was sentenced in September to a year in County Jail. 
With 97 days credit for time served after his arrest, and additional credits 
while in jail, Butler was free within months. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors said Butler was a young man of contradictions who 
occasionally exhibited a warm heart to youngsters in the housing project and at 
other times acted like a bully. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd trade Nintendo games with the kids or buy them ice cream," Schott said. 
"But sometimes he'd do things that didn't make sense, like buy a soda and after 
two sips, throw it on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a good side and everyone has a bad side," said a neighbor who 
asked to remain anonymous. "With him, the bad side showed the most. Sometimes 
he used to beat up people around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler graduated from Dana Junior High School in 1991 but eventually dropped 
out of San Pedro High School. He rarely worked, Schott and other friends said, 
but he did once have a summer job cleaning jail cells at a nearby LAPD station. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott said that a day or two after the shootings, he saw Butler outside his 
parent's cinder-block apartment and told him that he was about to turn 16 and 
was looking forward to buying a car. It was at that point, Schott said, that 
Butler made the comment about the crime involving Ito and Matsuura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura were shot in the head at close range about 11 p.m. March 25 
as they got out of their car in the parking lot of the Ralphs supermarket at 
Capitol Drive and Western Avenue, detectives said. Williams said the suspects 
intended to rob the students and took their car purely on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Declared brain-dead soon after the attack, Ito and Matsuura were taken off 
life-support systems at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead 
Sunday night. Lt. John Dunkin, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said 
that the murders initially looked as if they would be difficult to solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspects were outstanding, the victims' vehicle was gone, there weren't a 
lot of witnesses around," Dunkin said. "There were a lot of things we needed to 
resolve immediately if we hoped to solve this case." 
</P>
<P>
 An investigative team was assembled, starting with veteran homicide 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Monday rolled around, and we started to get an idea who we were looking 
for, we pulled in people who are involved in gang investigations in that part 
of the city," Dunkin said, and eventually, as many as 30 officers were involved 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin emphasized that the resources devoted to the investigation were typical 
for a "difficult-to-solve homicide," and not a response to any political or 
public influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take outside pressure to get us to do our job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there was an outpouring of tips from witnesses, some of them from 
the area where the shooting took place and others who know the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police would not be specific about who supplied the information, they 
said some of the witnesses saw the incident, while others had heard that the 
two suspects were involved in a robbery and car theft that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said evidence from the car also tied Butler and Reygoza to the 
killings, but officers declined to describe the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon Wednesday, Dunkin said, detectives had begun to close in on 
the suspects. He said that as search warrants were served in the South Bay, 
detectives went after Butler and Reygoza with arrest warrants. One of them was 
arrested about 7 p.m., and the other was taken into custody about half an hour 
later. Then came the time-consuming work of booking the two suspects and 
calling the victims' families overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Williams announced the arrests to a room full of reporters, it was 
11 p.m. Williams declined to say Thursday whether his officers have found the 
gun used in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 A police source said a videotape from an automated teller machine in the 
parking lot was not instrumental in locating the suspects.

COLUMN ONE; FEELING BETRAYED BY SCIENCE; A SCANDAL OVER FAKED DATA IN A BREAST 
CANCER STUDY HAS LEFT PATIENTS REELING AND A PIONEERING DOCTOR IN DISGRACE. IT 
ALSO HAS HEIGHTENED FEARS ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIMENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 When she read the news, the patient burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The story documented flaws in a study that had helped change the course of 
breast cancer treatment. Results had been falsified. What was worse, the 
researchers conducting the clinical trial -- part of a long-running and 
extremely important series of breast cancer studies -- knew about the doctored 
data but remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extraordinary reaction, the National Cancer Institute on Tuesday 
demanded -- and got -- the resignation of the man in charge of the massive 
$8-million-a-year project: Dr. Bernard Fisher, a pioneering 75-year-old surgeon 
who is a legend in breast cancer research. The NCI declared that no more women 
will be enrolled in the studies until an investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which left thousands of women who have breast cancer -- and many of the 
doctors who treat them -- feeling angry and betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient, a 60-year-old Los Angeles public relations specialist, had 
watched her mother die of the disease 30 years ago. In 1989, after receiving a 
diagnosis that she had breast cancer herself, she decided to have only the 
malignant lump removed -- based in part on this project's finding that 
lumpectomy was as effective as mastectomy, in which the entire breast is 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she is wondering if she made the right choice, even though experts insist 
that she did. She has lost faith in those who do medical research. "If you 
can't trust the people who are running this kind of trial," she asked, "who can 
you trust?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are many questions surrounding the National Surgical Adjuvant 
Breast and Bowel Project -- a three-decade-long research effort that has 
involved 5,000 doctors, 484 hospitals and more than 44,000 patients throughout 
the United States and Canada. The scandal has rocked the breast cancer 
community and raised serious concerns about quality control in human 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists are hurrying to reassure patients that, despite the discrepancies 
in the data, the basic conclusion of the study stands: A woman's entire breast 
need not be removed when she has cancer; lumpectomy is a safe alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much ado about nothing," said Dr. Susan M. Love, a nationally renowned 
expert who is director of the UCLA Breast Center. "There are multiple other 
studies showing the same thing. Even if you threw the whole study out, it still 
wouldn't change the fact that lumpectomy is just as good as mastectomy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, an undercurrent of doubt and anger has risen among patients, doctors 
and Congress. On April 13, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations will conduct a hearing on the project to determine, in the words 
of a spokesman, "how the system collapsed from beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is creating a substantial problem of trust and uncertainty," said Dr. 
Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. "Women are 
challenging whether or not they had the right treatment, and doctors are 
concerned about how to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jane Alsobrook, an independent film producer and breast cancer patient 
who serves on the board of a local advocacy group: "It makes us angry that . . 
. (authorities) think it's not worth letting the general public know about 
unless somehow it leaks and creates a stir, and after the fact they say, 'Oh, 
yes, that did happen, but don't worry your little head about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy comes on the heels of some widely publicized flaps that have 
undermined public confidence in the ability of scientists to police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert J. Levine, a professor of medicine at Yale University and an expert 
in the ethics of human experiments, points to two recent revelations: Cold War 
radiation experiments on humans without their knowledge and a study in which 
UCLA researchers were criticized for permitting schizophrenic patients to 
deteriorate before they were put back on medication that had been helping them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think right now there is a tendency to have bad feelings about research on 
humans," Levine said. "What people see is headlines, and it sows the seeds of 
some misgivings. They say, 'There must be something wrong with research if that 
can go on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Also at stake is the reputation of more than two dozen breast cancer studies, 
launched in 1958 and known collectively by the acronym NSABP. Paid for by the 
National Cancer Institute, the NSABP is coordinated out of the University of 
Pittsburgh, where Fisher is a professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The research has meant the difference between life and death for tens of 
thousands of women. In the United States alone, 182,000 women are expected to 
learn they have breast cancer this year, and 46,000 will lose their lives to 
the disease, which is the No. 1 cause of cancer in women. 
</P>
<P>
 The lumpectomy study was not the NSABP's only significant accomplishment. Two 
other findings have been at least as instrumental in changing the course of 
breast cancer treatment. NSABP researchers provided the first proof that 
chemotherapy could help cure breast cancer. They also proved that "radical 
mastectomy," in which the breast, lymph nodes and surrounding muscles are cut 
out, was not necessary; "total mastectomy," in which only the breast and lymph 
nodes are removed, is just as effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The NSABP is running six breast cancer studies, and a seventh is about to 
start. Its major research project at the moment is another highly controversial 
study into whether the drug tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer among women who 
have never had the disease but are at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are trying to enroll 16,000 women in the study; half will receive 
tamoxifen for five years and the other half will receive a placebo. The 
scientists recently confirmed that the drug poses a slightly higher threat of 
causing uterine cancer than previously believed, and have changed the consent 
form accordingly -- triggering a minor flap. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar over the fraudulent data erupted March 13 when the Chicago Tribune 
reported that federal investigators had uncovered evidence that a Canadian 
surgeon, Dr. Roger Poisson of St. Luc's Hospital in Montreal, had falsified 
records involving patient enrollment in NSABP studies between 1977 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper went on to report that Fisher had failed to publish a promised 
reanalysis of the study and had never publicly acknowledged the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Poisson was barred from further participation, and he has since been 
barred from receiving federal research money for the next eight years. At a 
Montreal news conference Thursday, Poisson admitted "faults of ethics and 
irregularities of principle" but said he had his patients' best interests at 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago story generated a huge outcry, although the federal government had 
actually released the information nearly a year earlier. The Office of Research 
Integrity, the branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that 
monitors scientific misconduct and ran the investigation of Poisson, had 
published its findings last spring in three little-read federal publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The ORI found that Poisson had either fabricated or falsified data on 99 
patients, including those who participated in the lumpectomy study. The phony 
data did not affect the outcome of the study; rather, Poisson enrolled women 
who were not eligible, presumably to impress the study's organizers with a 
greater volume of data. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, maybe we should have raised a bigger flag," said ORI Director 
Lyle Bivens. "It might have headed off the panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the National Cancer Institute make the matter public. An article in 
this week's issue of the journal Science was headlined: "How Not to Publicize a 
Misconduct Finding." In an interview Wednesday, Dr. Dwight Kaufman, a top NCI 
official, said such criticism is legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a serious oversight," he said. "Frankly, we didn't anticipate the 
level of anxiety and distrust that would emanate from these findings." 
</P>
<P>
 But the flaws did not end with Poisson. On Tuesday, the cancer institute 
announced that ORI investigators had launched another investigation. The 
inquiry involves St. Mary's Hospital in Montreal, where a discrepancy has been 
found in a date listed in a patient's file. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the organizers of the NSABP were informed of the problem last 
September, they did not report it to the cancer institute until last week, 
Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
 That delay cost Fisher his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCI demanded that he be replaced, and the University of Pittsburgh 
immediately announced that he had requested a leave. Although Fisher will 
remain involved in the project, the NSABP will be headed on an interim basis by 
Dr. Donald Trump, deputy director of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're insisting that they get their act together by changing the leadership 
and changing some of the procedures," Kaufman said. He added that the NCI is 
stiffening the penalties for research groups that fail to report discrepancies 
promptly, and this week created an independent office whose sole job will be to 
monitor clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's ouster sent shock waves throughout medical science, especially the 
network of doctors participating in the NSABP. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are angry that Fisher was forced to take the fall for another 
researcher's misdeeds and say that the cancer institute is guilty of the same 
offense it attributed to Fisher -- not making the discrepancies public right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," said Love, the UCLA professor. "Fisher has been a very important 
figure. He's really been on the forefront of trying to figure out new ways of 
treating breast cancer. He's one of the few creative thinkers that we have, and 
I don't think he's actually done anything terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that he should have released the information sooner, but my guess is 
that he probably didn't think it would make any difference. And he was right. 
It didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, are outraged that a scientist of Fisher's stature did not 
report misconduct as soon as he knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was missing here was a sense of responsibility to all of the women whose 
lives have been, are and will be affected by breast cancer," said Susan 
Tibbitts, executive director of the National Assn. of Women's Health 
Professionals. "I think there was a lack of respect. Somebody made a judgment 
that we are not going to share this information." 
</P>
<P>
 Justified or not, a forced departure of this magnitude is practically unheard 
of, said Levine, the Yale professor. He remembered only one -- about a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are strict controls on the way research is conducted -- every 
clinical trial must submit its findings to a "safety and data monitoring 
committee" -- Levine said the system is not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "A skillful and dedicated data faker can beat almost any monitoring system," 
Levine said. But, he added, such deception cannot go on indefinitely: "It's 
very hard to catch them while it's going on, but at the end of it all, when 
they . . . see center by center what the results were, if one of them is 
decidedly out of line there will be an investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all indications that the fraud has not altered the validity of the 
NSABP research, patients and doctors have been left to cope with the fallout. 
Phones were active in the offices of breast surgeons and oncologists across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have had 30 calls," said Dr. Avrum Bluming, an Encino oncologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has all been sort of confusing and unsettling," said Alsobrook, the film 
producer who had a lumpectomy three years ago. "To what purpose would somebody 
falsify results? For personal glory? I don't really understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our lives on the line." Making Progress 
</P>
<P>
 The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project was begun in 1958 to 
evaluate the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs used in conjunction with 
surgery for breast, colon and rectal cancer. Here are some of its major 
findings on breast cancer: 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: In 1961, the study found that a commonly accepted practice for 
treating breast cancer -- removing the ovaries -- was not justified in patients 
with operable breast cancer. Because the hormone estrogen is linked to breast 
cancer, and the ovaries produce estrogen, doctors often removed them. More 
recent research, however, has indicated that women who have had their ovaries 
removed may have less recurrence of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Radical mastectomy: A 10-year study in the 1970s eliminated the particularly 
painful procedure in which the breast, lymph nodes and pectoral muscle were 
removed. The study proved that the far less drastic treatment called "total 
mastectomy," in which only the breast and lymph nodes are removed, is just as 
effective. Today, radical mastectomy is considered barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemotherapy: The project was the first research group to prove that 
chemotherapy could help cure breast cancer or delay its recurrence. Before this 
study in the 1970s, chemotherapy was not standard treatment for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tamoxifen: The study established that the use of the anti-estrogen agent is 
beneficial in breast cancer patients who are past menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lumpectomy: The research group showed that the procedure whereby only the 
malignant tumor is removed, rather than the whole breast, is just as effective 
when combined with radiation treatment as mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Post-surgery: The study established that chemotherapy is beneficial to women 
who have had breast cancer surgery and show no sign of cancer in the lymph 
nodes under the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prevention: In 1992, the research group began studies attempting to 
determine whether tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer in women who are at high 
risk of it.

IT'S OFFICIAL: STATE IS AGAIN IN A DROUGHT; WATER: WINTER PRECIPITATION WAS 
BELOW LEVELS SEEN DURING RECENT SIX-YEAR DRY PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 State water officials on Thursday reported that the winter of 1993-94 was one 
of the driest this century, confirming that California is again experiencing a 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the official rainy season on Thursday, state and local 
agencies said that snowpack and other measures were lower than the totals 
realized in the drought that lasted from 1987 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this winter's low precipitation figures will not immediately translate 
into the brown lawns or mandatory cutbacks that marked the recent six years of 
drought because the state's reservoirs are well supplied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some water officials fear that could change over the next month or two if 
unseasonably warm weather prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is concerned," said Mike Young, chief of operations for the 
Metropolitan Water District, which supplies 60% of all the water consumed in 
the six-county region of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Runoff in the key watersheds on both the eastern and western slopes of the 
Sierra Nevada is expected to be only about half of normal, causing officials to 
classify the year as "critically dry." Most of the state's water supply arrives 
in the rains and snows of December, January and February and virtually all 
meaningful precipitation falls by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures were down significantly from just one month ago, as warm weather 
melted much of the existing snowpack and little new precipitation accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty bad," said Matt Colwell, a hydrologist with the state Department 
of Water Resources. "If it's dry in April, things will get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrologists such as Colwell said they are not sure if 1994 marks the 
beginning of a new drought or simply a continuation of the dry period that 
began in 1987. Last year's heavy rains, which caused officials to declare an 
end to the drought, may have been an anomaly, Colwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's preliminary plan is to allocate supplies from the State Water 
Project in the Sacramento River Delta at 50% of water agencies' requests. The 
State Water Project is a series of canals and waterways that collect and 
distribute runoff from the Sierra Nevada, the primary water source for most of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is trying to hold to the 50% level," said Young. "But that's the 
limit of their ability. If it stays dry in April and May, it will be very 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Wheeler, state secretary for resources, said Thursday that he remains 
committed to the allocation formula. "The situation would be critical but for 
the strong reservoir supplies" provided by last year's rain, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any cutback by the state would have a ripple effect through hundreds of 
Southern California communities. The MWD, which imports water from the State 
Water Project, supplies water to scores of smaller, local agencies. Any 
reduction in its supplies from the state would have to be passed along or taken 
out of emergency underground storage supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for several local agencies said Thursday that they plan to 
significantly increase their MWD purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for instance, is planning to 
buy about seven times as much water from the MWD as it did just a few years 
ago. Runoff in the department's watershed in the Owens Valley of the Eastern 
Sierra Nevada is only about 50% of normal and is further affected by court 
rulings restricting use of water in environmentally sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Municipal Water District is planning to buy three times its 
normal amount from the MWD, and leave much of its considerable ground water 
reserve untouched as a hedge against a dry 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD officials said they are confident they will be able to meet their 
customers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the state gets by this year, officials are already concerned about the 
impact it will have on next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is leaning on the reservoir storage left over from last year," said 
Colwell, the state hydrologist. "If it's dry again next year, we'll see an 
impact. That means cutbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 As consumers found in most of the recent drought years, the low snowfall 
figures will spell significantly higher water bills -- perhaps as much as 20% 
higher in some communities, officials said.

CAUCUS OF LATINO LEGISLATORS BACKS BROWN; CAMPAIGN: SEVEN MEMBERS PRAISE THE 
DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER IN RACE FOR GOVERNOR. BUT SUPPORT IS NOT UNANIMOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The springtime scuffle for endorsements continued Thursday as the California 
Latino Legislative Caucus, a statewide coalition of Latino elected officials, 
announced that it has endorsed state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's candidacy for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at the Carpenters Union Hall in El Monte, seven Latino 
legislators flanked the 48-year-old front-runner, praising her as a responsive 
leader and pledging themselves as warriors in her battle to win the Democratic 
nomination and unseat Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "California does not need and can no longer afford a governor who scapegoats 
communities. It is time to retire Pete," said Assemblyman Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles), the caucus chairman. Brown's bid for governor, he added, "is a 
candidacy that all Latinos can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the news conference ended, however, it became clear that not all 
the Latino caucus members shared Polanco's view. Contrary to a Brown campaign 
press release that implied that all 11 caucus members were on her side, Polanco 
acknowledged that state Sens. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) and Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) had not voted to endorse Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who is running for insurance commissioner, has remained neutral in the 
governor's race. Ayala has endorsed Brown's opponent for the Democratic 
nomination, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Torres nor Ayala were present at Thursday's announcement. Their 
absence was yet another signal that when it comes to the gubernatorial contest, 
the Latino community is less unified than Brown's campaign would like. Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina has endorsed Garamendi, and other 
Latinos have been privately critical of Brown for what they see as her overly 
conservative approach to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislators who spoke up Thursday for Brown said Latinos -- like any other 
group -- cannot be expected to think alike. They said their endorsement is 
meaningful because they, more than some other local politicians, have been able 
to watch Brown in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the Democratic Latinos that work in Sacramento," Assemblywoman Diane 
Martinez (D-Rosemead) said. "We are the ones that are on front lines (and) . . 
. we have a close working relationship with Kathleen Brown. It's no coincidence 
that we're all here supporting her today." 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the Assembly who pledged to work for Brown included Joe Baca 
(D-San Bernardino), Cruz Bustamante (D-Fresno), Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington 
Park) and Grace F. Napolitano (D-Norwalk). State Sen. Charles Calderon 
(D-Whittier) said he thinks Democrats must begin looking beyond the June 7 
primary, which he described as "not even a race." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to start focusing on where the real fight is," he said. "The real 
fight is Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll conducted earlier this week found that Brown 
continues to run well ahead of Garamendi in the Democratic primary, defeating 
him 39% to 25% if the election were held today. Brown would defeat Wilson 51% 
to 41%, the survey found, while Garamendi would beat Wilson by a spare 47% to 
42%. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, described the Latino caucus 
endorsement Thursday as "the Brown camp trying to play tit for tat" in the wake 
of Molina's announcement earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a contest to see who can have the most names on a list, in this 
case the most Latino-sounding names," he said. Moments later he added: "We'll 
be having more Latino endorsements, by the way. But we're not into building up 
a Rolodex. We're into opening up the doors of government to those who 
historically have not had a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Wilson's campaign, also characterized Brown's 
announcement Thursday as a reaction to Molina. He noted that many of the Latino 
caucus members had already endorsed Brown individually. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of sad really when the best damage control you can offer is to 
re-announce the endorsement of politicians who've already endorsed you 
publicly," Schnur said. "I have a lot of respect for Richard Polanco, but I 
have to imagine that after seven or eight times, the news value of his 
endorsement is going to start to wear thin."

UFW SETS OFF ON TREK BACK INTO THE FIELDS; LABOR: WITH MEMBERSHIP AND INFLUENCE 
FLAGGING, THE UNION SAYS ITS 330-MILE PILGRIMAGE SYMBOLIZES A RENEWED 
COMMITMENT TO THE DREAMS OF FOUNDER CESAR CHAVEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The United Farm Workers, hoping to reclaim the magic that once made it such a 
force in these fields, began a 330-mile march up the spine of the Central 
Valley on Thursday -- a trek that signals the union's return to the work of 
organizing farm laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilgrimage, or peregrinacion, opened with a 90-minute Mass on the 67th 
anniversary of Cesar Chavez's birth. About 750 people led by Arturo Rodriguez, 
Chavez's son-in-law and successor, and Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the union, 
marched from the UFW's Forty Acres compound to the first overnight stop, the 
town of Richgrove, about eight miles northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The union hopes to enlist 10,000 new members by the time the march is over. It 
will end with a rally in Sacramento in three weeks, on the first anniversary of 
the union founder's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilgrimage is about recommitment and penance," Rodriguez said at the 
outset of the march, "recommitment to building a national union for farm 
workers, penance, because all of us let Cesar carry the responsibility for 
organizing the union on his soldiers. Now the burden for fulfilling Cesar's 
dreams and our own rests squarely on each of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the pilgrimage was announced, municipalities elsewhere in the state 
were underscoring how far the union has come. In Los Angeles, the Eastside's 
landmark Brooklyn Avenue was renamed Cesar E. Chavez Avenue. Meanwhile, the 
city of San Fernando -- the first in the state to declare Chavez's birthday a 
holiday -- held a march in the labor leader's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the march also signals an important departure from the strategies of 
Chavez. No longer will the grape boycott be the centerpiece of the UFW's 
activities, as it has for the past decade. The union's leadership has decided 
to return to the fields to enlist new members, confront growers and push for 
new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in strategy is a concession that the boycott alone has not been 
enough to improve the lot of farm workers, whose wages have leveled off or 
dropped in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The return to organizing is seen as a gamble for a union that has suffered 
years of defeat and infighting and the death last April of Chavez. Today, the 
UFW does not have a single contract with grape growers; in 1973, it had 
contracts with 80% of them. It has fewer than 15,000 members now, compared to 
100,000 at its height. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics called the march a desperate public relations ploy to revive a dying 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "This march is a publicity stunt," said Richard Baiz of the Grape Workers and 
Farmers Coalition, an advocate group representing the grape industry that 
opposes the UFW. "The grape boycott was a huge failure and now they want to 
organize in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they're going to find it tough out there. The farm workers are happy 
just to have a job, and working conditions have improved a great deal since the 
1970s. For the UFW, this is Custer's last stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in strategy is welcomed by longtime supporters and former top UFW 
organizers. The pilgrimage retraces the path Chavez took 28 years ago this 
spring, a march that transformed the relatively unknown labor leader and this 
farm town into national symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, some of them have decried the union's retreat from the 
fields and its singular dependence on the grape boycott and the issue of toxic 
pesticides as a means of pressuring growers to improve the lot of farm workers. 
They asked how can a union be a union without organizing workers.

 American forces have been on duty in South Korea for more than 40 years, 
standing guard over an armistice agreement that never evolved into a permanent 
peace treaty. With tensions rising over North Korea's nuclear intensions, more 
U.S. troops and equipment are on the way. U.S. military commanders say the move 
is larely for logistical reasons, allowing easy movement of U.S. equipment on a 
non-emergency basis. Specialists say the reinforcements are merely symbolic, a 
show of force while the Clinton Administration works out diplomatic solutions.

<P>
 North Korea, a hard-line Marxist state, insists its nuclear program is only 
for peaceful purposes. But its rejection of full inspections has heightened 
suspicions that it is developing a nuclear arsenal. South Korean President Kim 
Young Sam said deployment of the Patriot missiles plus resumption of military 
exercises with the United States were in order because the Communist north has 
failed to allow full nuclear inspections and swap envoys with the south.

 Since 1953, an uneasy peace 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bloodiest wars in history began on June 25, 1950 when Communist 
North Korea invaded South Korea. By September, North Korean troops had pushed 
to the Pusan Perimter. In a surprise move, U.N. forces landed at Inchon. The 
U.N. force -- 90% American -- pushed as far north as the Yalu River by October. 
China entered the war that same month, pushing U.N. forces back below the 38th 
Parallel. North and South Korea signed an armistice in July, 1953. The toll: 
580,000 U.N. troops and 1.6 million Communist troops killed or wounded.

SINGAPORE AFFIRMS FLOGGING OF AMERICAN; SOUTHEAST ASIA: MICHAEL FAY, 18, SHOWS 
NO EMOTION AT SENTENCING FOR SPRAY-PAINTING 18 CARS. ORDER THAT HE GET SIX 
STROKES OF A CANE DRAWS WORLDWIDE ATTENTION. 
</P>

<P>
 A court here Thursday rejected an American teen-ager's appeal against a 
sentence of flogging for spray-painting cars, saying he had pursued a 
"calculated course of criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Without a trace of emotion, Michael Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, was led from the 
high court by police to begin serving a four-month jail term in the case, which 
has attracted worldwide attention because of the flogging. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Chan, Fay's stepfather, left the court without comment. Fay's teen-age 
friends packed the gallery during the appeal, and several began to cry silently 
as he was led away. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. charge d'affaires Ralph Boyce, who attended the appeal, expressed U.S. 
regret at the sentence and called on the government to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to believe that caning is an excessive penalty for a youthful, 
nonviolent offender who pleaded guilty to reparable crimes against private 
property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs later attacked Boyce for making his 
criticism in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was sentenced on March 3 to receive six strokes of a moistened rattan 
cane, in addition to four months in jail and a $2,230 fine after pleading 
guilty to two counts of vandalism, two counts of criminal mischief and one 
count of possessing stolen property. He admitted to having spray-painted 18 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay appealed his caning sentence, asserting that the law did not require such 
a punishment in cases where the vandalism could be erased or removed. His 
lawyers argued that, since the spray paint was removed from the damaged cars 
with turpentine, it was not indelible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Justice Yong Pung How dismissed that argument, noting: "These acts 
of vandalism were committed relentlessly and willfully over a period of 10 
days. This amounted to a calculated course of criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Singapore prison official quoted in the 1970s, caning is 
usually administered by a prison official trained in martial arts. Those being 
punished often go into shock after the third stroke of the cane, and scars left 
by the stick are usually permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 British lawyer Michael Sherrard, who flew in from London to present Fay's case 
in Singapore's appeals court, said the Fay family was planning to appeal for 
executive clemency from Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce said after Thursday's court session that the embassy understood that the 
caning will not take place while a clemency appeal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 But a prominent American lawmaker seemed to dash hopes for such an appeal, 
which would require a political decision. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) met separately Thursday with Lee Kwan Yew, 
the founding father of modern Singapore who is now a senior minister in the 
government, and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, the deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not about to back down," Cohen said after the meetings. "They said 
this is a judicial matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he expressed concern that Fay was being singled out for special 
treatment and that they both "clearly indicated that this is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he did not believe that the sentence would affect U.S.-Singapore 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The case took on political significance here when President Clinton commented 
on it, calling the caning sentence extreme and asking the government to 
reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore government reacted immediately, asserting the sentence had been 
handed down to 14 others in similar circumstances, including two foreigners, 
and adding tartly that Singapore did not want to end up like New York, "where 
even the police cars are not spared the acts of vandals." 
</P>
<P>
 In another legal case that attracted international attention, a court here on 
Thursday convicted five men, including two prominent journalists, of violating 
Singapore's Official Secrets Act for allowing confidential estimates of trade 
figures to be published. But the five were fined and not sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists had privately expressed concern that the case was designed to 
muzzle Singapore's press, which is already fairly tame. The government insisted 
that the case was not about press freedom but about blocking leaks of 
government information. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Daniel, editor of Singapore Business Times, was fined $2,500 for 
receiving data and passing it on to the newspaper's readers.

 At least 2 million gallons of Iranian crude oil spilled into the sea, forming 
a slick two miles long, after two tankers collided near the entrance to the 
Persian Gulf, shipping sources said.There were no casualties nor signs of fire, 
the sources and a port official said. The accident occurred late Wednesday in 
the Gulf of Oman, 9.5 miles off the coast of Fujairah, one of the United Arab 
Emirates. The spill was contained by noon Thursday, the port official said. The 
cause of the collision was being investigated. The Panamanian-registered Seki 
collided with the U.A.E.-registered Baynunah. The Seki's agents said it was 
carrying 76.5 million gallons of Iranian light crude destined for Japan.

 The U.N. Security Council unanimously urged North Korea to allow full nuclear 
inspections, adopting a statement that lacks the strong sanctions threat sought 
by Washington.Under a compromise worked out with China, the main opponent to 
such a threat, the council adopted a statement that instead only hints at 
further action if North Korea continues to refuse to cooperate. North Korea 
quickly repudiated the U.N. statement and called for talks on the matter with 
the United States. But the Pyongyang government said that it would not permit 
further inspections.

 The Chernobyl nuclear power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, 
remains unsafe, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said.Harsh weather has 
caused serious deterioration, such as gaps in the concrete shell sealing off 
the Chernobyl nuclear reactor that exploded in 1986, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency warned. Inspectors also found "numerous safety deficiencies" in 
the two reactors still operating at the Ukrainian plant. The U.N. agency said 
experts will probably meet in April to discuss solutions.

SECURITY PLAN DRAWS SKEPTICISM FROM THE BATTLE-WEARY IN HEBRON; MIDEAST: STILL 
REELING FROM MOSQUE MASSACRE, MANY CONSIDER OUTSIDE OBSERVERS 'USELESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mustafa Tamimi's gnarled fingers moved faster and faster over his prayer beads 
Thursday as he sat outside his curfew-bound fruit shop. The 50-year-old 
Palestinian's voice grew thin and his anger boiled over as he recalled each 
detail of the morning five weeks ago that thrust this desperate, seething town 
onto the center stage of the Mideast peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamimi recalled how he was there, kneeling in prayer in the first row of 
Ibrahim Mosque, when more than 100 bullets from a Jewish settler's assault 
rifle tore into his relatives, his friends, his fellow worshipers and very 
nearly him. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born 
physician who killed about 30 Palestinians before Tamimi's eyes in Hebron's 
Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, Tamimi laughed. Against such firepower, such hate and such 
helplessness, he concluded, the 160-member international observer force that 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to send here Thursday 
-- part of a breakthrough agreement aimed at "creating a feeling of security 
among Palestinians in Hebron" -- was, in fact, a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is useless that they're coming here," Tamimi said of the force of 
Norwegians, Danes and Italians, who the agreement states will be armed with 
revolvers yet no mandate to act. "I am the first one who will say they are 
welcome. But this is not enough. This is not what we want. Against these 
settlers, against their machine guns, against the Israeli army, this will not 
help us." 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had Tamimi finished saying that than reality caught up with him 
again. An Israeli army patrol, which was stoned as it sped past his shop, 
slammed on its brakes. Half a dozen soldiers waved M-16 assault rifles as they 
scoured the street. Within seconds they led a single Palestinian off to prison, 
with Tamimi chasing behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamzeh! Hamzeh! Hamzeh!" Tamimi shouted through tears as he ran after the 
speeding van. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoner was, in fact, Tamimi's youngest son. He is 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Such were the scenes and the mood of rejection, anger and despair as Hebron's 
more than 100,000 Palestinians reacted with fury, laughter and lament to an 
unprecedented compromise -- the first time in more than two decades of 
occupation that Israel agreed to Palestinian demands for an international, 
U.N.-sanctioned presence in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The security agreement for Hebron broke new ground for the PLO, its leaders 
and the peace process as a whole. It cleared the way for Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to send negotiators back to formal 
talks on Palestinian autonomy for the first time since the mosque massacre. And 
it brought vows from both sides to speed the process of implementing a 
long-delayed promise for Israeli withdrawal and Palestinian self-rule in the 
occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Hebron, where the Feb. 25 massacre left wounds that remain as deep as 
they are fresh, the prospect of an observer force hardly allayed fears. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Palestinians and Jews in Hebron, the security plan served only to 
deepen the sense of foreboding here, where residents, for more than a month, 
have lived with heavy curfews and a constant threat of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebron is, after all, a hotbed of Palestinian radicalism, where 415 heavily 
armed Jewish settlers live in an enclave surrounded by more than 100,000 mostly 
unarmed Arabs; the Arabs, in turn, live adjacent to a sprawling settlement of 
more than 4,500 more heavily armed Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a city overwhelmingly opposed to Arafat and the peace process, a 
handful of local PLO leaders struggled to find victory in Thursday's agreement. 
Chief among them was Mustafa Abdul Nabi Natshe, Hebron's former mayor, whom 
Arafat reappointed to his post on Thursday. The latest accord "is a good step 
forward," he said in an interview in his Hebron home. "It is a first step." 
</P>
<P>
 He reflected the universal sentiment of his city that Arafat was wise to drop 
his demand for a Palestinian police contingent that would have served under 
Israeli command here, noting: "If there is a Palestine police force here, I 
don't want it to be a show." 
</P>
<P>
 Although leaders of Arafat's Islamic fundamentalist opponents, in parties such 
as Hamas, declared the international force was "like a watchdog in chains," its 
most virulent opposition came from the Jewish settlement on the hill high 
above, from the heart of the former home of the doctor who staged last month's 
bloody massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 There, at the fiercely ideological settlement of Kiryat Arba, as many as 
20,000 extremist Jews from settlements and towns throughout Israel marched a 
mile -- in celebration and in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 In an afternoon rally to commemorate 26 years of Jewish settlements in a city 
that the Bible records as the first capital of the Israelite community in 
Canaan, and to protest any government effort to evacuate Israeli settlers from 
the center of town, speakers denounced the new international force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an un-Zionist act to bring a foreign force into Hebron," Benjamin 
Netanyahu, chairman of Israel's right-wing opposition Likud, shouted to a 
cheering audience waving Israeli flags and posters declaring Hebron part of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be much blood spilled here! Jewish blood will be spilled!" 
screamed Shlomo Goren, a former chief rabbi of Israel who pushed for a 
controversial religious ruling this week instructing Israeli soldiers to 
disobey any orders to evacuate Hebron settlers by force -- a plan now before 
Rabin's Cabinet as a more permanent solution to Hebron's security woes. "We 
won't move! We won't move from the heart of Hebron!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowd, Ephraim Ziv, a Brooklyn-born lawyer, explained the settlers' 
opposition to the new foreign force. He did so in terms remarkably similar to 
those of Palestinian critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This international force reminds us of the (U.N.) force in Lebanon -- they're 
going to need soldiers to protect them," Ziv said, adding that he believes the 
planned Hebron contingent is too small, too lightly armed and too powerless to 
be anything more than a target. "They invite Arab terrorists to put on a show 
for them. This new force won't calm down the situation. They incite the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Radical Palestinian leaders echoed the arguments against the force made by 
settlers, who the Palestinians demand must be moved before any permanent 
security is achieved in a city sacred to Muslims and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here were looking for a real force to protect them and separate the 
two communities," said Abdul Aziz Dweik, a U.S.-educated Hebron geology 
professor who was deported by Israel as a suspected Hamas leader and spent a 
year of exile on a barren hillside in a no-man's-land in South Lebanon until he 
was permitted to return home in December. "These people (the international 
observers) will just watch and report what happens, but they will have no 
mandate to actually protect the people." 
</P>
<P>
 On Hebron's streets, where scores of Palestinian youths have been killed or 
injured in almost daily clashes with Israeli troops since the massacre, many 
Palestinians said the observer force will undermine security and stability here 
rather than safeguard it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these guys come here, they will not help the situation; they will 
aggravate it," said a 20-year-old factory worker who asked to be identified 
only as Bassam. "Look, we don't want international forces. We don't want 
Israeli forces. We don't want Arafat. We don't want anybody. All of this only 
means more massacres and death. We only want all the settlers to leave Hebron. 
We want the Israeli troops out of the occupied lands. And then we can take care 
of ourselves."

NEWS ANALYSIS; A PIECE STILL MISSING IN GUATEMALA PEACE MOSAIC; CENTRAL 
AMERICA: THREE-YEAR DEADLOCK IN LENGTHY CIVIL WAR IS BROKEN. BUT THE QUESTION 
OF ATROCITIES REMAINS UNRESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Intense international pressure has helped force the two sides in Guatemala's 
long civil war to break a three-year deadlock and agree on a human rights 
treaty and a timetable aimed at bringing peace by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The accords, participants in the negotiations say, take Guatemala a big step 
closer to ending the oldest, last war in Central America; they give a boost to 
the besieged administration of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Guatemala's government and its leftist guerrillas gathered amid 
fanfare Tuesday evening in Mexico City to sign the documents, a crucial element 
was missing: 
</P>
<P>
 To get the government to sign, the guerrillas agreed to put aside, 
momentarily, their demand for a commission to investigate atrocities committed 
in a war that claimed some 100,000 lives, many of them Mayan peasants killed by 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides agreed to discuss the commission later, but its exclusion from 
the new and widely praised agreements underscores the fact that a host of 
sensitive and divisive issues that go to the heart of the Guatemalan conflict 
have yet to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the accords, signed as a high-level mission from the United Nations and 
diplomats from six countries looked on, come after nearly three years of talks 
in which the Guatemalans could agree on little. Had participants failed to 
reach agreement, the talks probably would have been doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a historic date for peace in Guatemala," De Leon said in Guatemala 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good accomplishment," Miguel Angel Sandoval, a member of the 
guerrillas' political committee, said Wednesday. "It does not fill all of our 
hopes, but it is a very positive step." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the human rights accord, the two sides signed a timetable for monthly 
meetings to discuss issues ranging from land reform to indigenous rights. The 
timetable establishes December as the date for a final peace treaty and 
demobilization of the rebels who have fought Guatemalan governments for 33 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these problems -- like land -- have plagued Guatemala for a century; 
some -- like the resettlement of refugees -- are extremely complicated. It is 
unclear how they will be resolved by the year's end. "They are very complex 
(issues), but if the will to solve them exists, they will be solved," Sandoval 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significant in the accords signed Tuesday, the government for the first 
time will allow U.N. human rights monitors into Guatemala, a country with one 
of the worst human rights records in the hemisphere. The accords also ban 
paramilitary groups and clandestine jails; end forced army recruitment; 
guarantee the right of free movement and association, and provide protection 
for human rights workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas' earlier insistence on including the war crimes commission had 
been a major stumbling block until now. Their willingness to postpone it helped 
make the accords possible, but it angered human rights activists at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the guerrillas, grouped in the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Union, say they are confident the commission will be established by May. But 
the government, and especially the army that backs it, vigorously oppose an 
investigation of war atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan generals look with trepidation at neighboring El Salvador, where a 
Truth Commission established as part of peace accords that ended the Salvadoran 
civil war blamed most massacres and torture on the military. The Salvadoran 
army was purged and has lost much of its power. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, veteran observers weary of Guatemalan talks that go nowhere were 
counting their blessings with the progress that was achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the separation of the war crimes commission, the talks advanced in 
large part because of pressure from the United Nations, the United States and 
five other countries that are lobbying for peace as the "Friends of Guatemala." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations late last year appointed gifted mediator Jean Arnault to 
assume control of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials in Guatemala have also been taking a more activist role. They 
have impressed upon De Leon the importance of stopping the last war in the 
region as the best way to attract investment and heal Guatemala's battered 
economy.

U.S. WARNS AGAINST GUATEMALA TRAVEL

<P>
 The State Department on Thursday warned Americans against traveling to 
Guatemala, where U.S. citizens have been attacked in recent days by mobs angry 
at rumors of child-stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, June Weinstock, 52, a magazine editor from Alaska, was 
in a coma after being attacked by hundreds of Guatemalan peasants in the 
northern town of San Cristobal Verapaz on Tuesday when she tried to take 
photographs of some children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the incidents are 
the result of media-inspired rumors. Local newspapers have reported sightings 
of "long-haired foreigners" driving around remote Guatemalan villages in jeeps 
with tinted windows, allegedly searching for children to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan Interior Minister Danilo Parinello said in a statement that the 
government is studying what action to take.

CLASH OF 2 VIEWS SPAWNS SERIOUS WHITEWATER QUESTION; INQUIRY: RTC CIVIL 
SERVANTS AND WHITE HOUSE AIDES SAW THEIR ACTIONS SURROUNDING THE HIRING OF 
PARTISAN LAWYER JAY B. STEPHENS AS NORMAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the time, career civil servants at the Resolution Trust Corp. wanted most 
to avoid being second-guessed in their probe of a failed Arkansas thrift with 
links to President Clinton and the Whitewater affair. So it seemed natural to 
hire a former federal prosecutor, a Republican, who would never be accused of 
taking a dive for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But what senior White House aides wanted most was to protect Clinton from more 
of what they considered unfair attacks by bloodthirsty Republicans and 
overzealous journalists. So it seemed natural to react with anger when they 
learned that the investigation would be headed by one of the most openly 
critical, partisan lawyers in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 From the collision of those two viewpoints has come one of the potentially 
most serious elements in the tangle of questions and accusations surrounding 
Bill and Hillary Clinton's Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of two senior White House aides to the appointment of former U.S. 
Atty. Jay B. Stephens to handle the RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan is now part of special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s expanding 
probe into the Clintons' real estate investment and related matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske now is trying to determine whether Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos 
improperly attempted to reverse Stephens' hiring by pressuring Treasury 
Department officials, who were temporarily overseeing the RTC. In theory, that 
could amount to obstruction of a federal agency proceeding -- a felony under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the legal outcome of this phase of Fiske's investigation, Stephens' 
appointment and the Administration's reaction is a quintessential tale of the 
way politics and Washington's career bureaucracy interact -- a story of the 
defensive fears and anxieties that sometimes do more to drive events than 
aggressive plans or tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC officials say they never anticipated that their decision to hire Stephens 
would horrify senior White House aides -- and ultimately add another layer of 
intrigue and controversy to the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulatory agency will not acknowledge publicly that it has reopened its 
long-closed probe of Madison, the defunct savings and loan at the center of the 
Whitewater affair, or that Stephens has been retained to head the 
investigation. But the sequence of events that led to the hiring, and the 
reasoning on which it was based, were revealed in interviews with agency 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from Congress to move quickly on the Whitewater-related 
investigation, the RTC's legal services committee rapidly approved a contract 
hiring Stephens and his San Francisco-based law firm in early February. Certain 
that the probe would be scrutinized by Congress and the press, RTC officials 
were eager to hire a former prosecutor who could meet the "very rigorous 
standards required by this case," one source close to the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC officials saw in Stephens an experienced and zealous prosecutor with 
strong credentials in S&L cases; he was already handling another case for the 
RTC involving a failed thrift in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, however, saw only a political enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may have been news to some RTC officials, the enmity between 
Stephens and the Clinton White House was hardly a well-kept secret. To 
political Washington, Stephanopoulos' anger over Stephens' hiring was 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens had been fired last year by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno -- along with other 
Republican U.S. attorney holdovers from the George Bush Administration -- just 
as he was trying to assemble a prosecution against House Ways and Means 
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), a close Clinton ally. Stephens 
then made an abortive run for the Republican nomination for the Senate in 
Virginia, and made surprisingly detailed comments about the continuing 
Rostenkowski probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens suggested at the time that politics played a role in easing him out. 
He was only 30 days away, he said, from making "a critical decision with regard 
to the resolution" of the House post office investigation, the probe that 
involves Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue will be whether or not the ultimate decision in this case is 
somehow unnecessarily impacted by political considerations," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments had prompted the District of Columbia Bar Assn.'s board on 
professional responsibility to look into disciplining Stephens. One source 
familiar with the matter said the inquiry has since been closed. But a 
representative of the board declined to confirm or deny the action, saying all 
ethics matters are confidential unless they result in suspension or disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC officials insist that, although they hired Stephens and his law firm 
hurriedly, they followed proper procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 With the statute of limitations on the Madison case set to expire at the end 
of February -- and with congressional interest in it growing -- top RTC 
officials moved to reopen their civil investigation. The S&L had been seized by 
regulators in 1989, at a cost to taxpayers of at least $47 million. RTC 
officials say they were satisfied with their original investigation of the firm 
for civil violations but were under pressure by Congress in the hothouse 
environment of the Whitewater affair to reopen the case at a time when Fiske 
was conducting his criminal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Top RTC officials told staffers to rush the case through the system so they 
would be prepared to take legal action and to testify before Congress about the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC attorneys gathered in the agency's Kansas City office and scrambled to 
gather long-stored documents. Needing quick legal advice from an outside 
counsel already familiar with such investigations, the agency turned to 
Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys at his firm -- Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro -- were already 
handling the RTC's high-profile case against a failed S&L in Arizona with links 
to Republican Gov. Fife Symington. Stephens, who was hired by the firm in 
January, began work on the Virginia thrift case for the RTC almost immediately. 
Pillsbury, an old-line San Francisco firm, was already doing about $2 million 
in annual billings with the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Before offering the contract to Pillsbury, RTC officials knew that Stephens 
would be the lead partner on the Madison case. 
</P>
<P>
 When news of Stephens' hiring reached the White House, the reaction was fierce 
and immediate. "This was a wow, can you believe that!" one Administration 
official said. So on Feb. 25, sources say, Stephanopoulos and Deputy White 
House Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes expressed their concerns in a telephone 
call to Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, then acting head of the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos denies that he raised the issue with Altman but acknowledges 
that he called his close friend, Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua Steiner, later 
that day and asked whether Stephens' hiring could be reversed. Altman and 
Steiner rebuffed Stephanopoulos, Treasury officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 A Treasury spokesman stressed that "neither Mr. Altman nor Mr. Steiner made 
any attempt to contact or influence the RTC" about Stephens' hiring. On 
Thursday, Steiner testified in Washington before a grand jury hearing evidence 
in Fiske's Whitewater investigation. One of a dozen Clinton Administration 
officials subpoenaed by Fiske, Steiner declined to comment to reporters as he 
entered the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner kept a diary that included notes about his phone conversation, and 
those notes have now been turned over to Fiske, sources say.

 An explosion set a closed nuclear reactor on fire in southern France on 
Thursday, killing one man and injuring four people, but officials said no 
radiation contamination was detected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atomic Energy Commission said the blast knocked down a giant, 
3,200-square-foot slab of concrete, sparking a sodium fire in a tunnel some 
distance from the core of the experimental reactor, which was being dismantled. 
The cause of the blast was unknown.

SCHOOL HEAD IN PROM DISPUTE IS REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A principal suspended after he threatened to ban mixed-race couples from the 
high school prom was reinstated Thursday by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board overrode the recommendation of the county school superintendent in 
its 4-2 vote to reinstate Hulond Humphries as principal of Randolph County High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 A white member of the Randolph County School Board, Joe Belue, resigned 
immediately after joining the lone black member of the panel in voting to fire 
Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 Belue said that he felt the board had made "a pretty strong judgment error." 
</P>
<P>
 The black board member, Charlotte Clark-Frieson, left hurriedly after the vote 
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, 55, who is white, was suspended by the Randolph County School Board 
March 14 after he allegedly told a mixed-race student that she was a "mistake" 
and threatened to stop the prom if interracial dates showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, who has been principal for 25 years, did not attend Thursday 
night's meeting. He was expected back at work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries' wife answered the phone at his home and said: "His lawyer told him 
not to have any comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said Humphries told them during a high school assembly on Feb. 24 
that he did not want mixed-race couples at the prom. Humphries has said his 
remarks were taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 ReVonda Bowen, 16, who has a white father and a black mother, said she asked 
Humphries: "Who am I supposed to take to the prom?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said he responded: "That's just it. Your mom and dad made a mistake having 
you as a mixed child." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen reportedly burst into tears at the remark. Humphries said he tried to 
apologize to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen, president of a student group planning the prom, has filed a lawsuit in 
federal court against Humphries and the board. She was not at the board meeting 
and a telephone message left at her home was not returned.

CLINTON SIGNS EDUCATION LAW THAT SETS U.S. STANDARDS; LEARNING: PRESIDENT 
VISITS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR THE CEREMONY. ACT PROVIDES $700 MILLION FOR STATES 
AND DISTRICTS THAT ADOPT THE GUIDELINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Thursday signed into law the framework for his 
Administration's nationwide education reform, telling hundreds of elementary 
students here that the country now will have "world-class standards for what 
every child in every American school should know." 
</P>
<P>
 Students at San Diego's Zamorano Fine Arts Academy sat on a blacktop play area 
to witness Clinton signing the Goals 2000 Act, which will create a hands-on 
role for the federal government in local schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The act provides $700 million in federal funds in 1995 for those states and 
school districts that voluntarily adopt standards to meet new federal 
guidelines for what students should be achieving at each grade level. The 
Administration intends to ask for $1 billion in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the award-winning Zamorano elementary school, with its ethnically 
diverse student body, was a perfect place to sign the bill because it 
exemplifies the challenges that face the nation's schools, and the successes 
that are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look like America will look in the 21st Century and we will have to win 
with you," Clinton told the black, Latino, Asian and white students. 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton signed a huge replica of the bill with a large black marker, 
dozens of schoolchildren sitting on the stage with him signed it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, took a break from their vacation 
in San Diego for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that "this is a new and different approach for the national 
government," which had assisted only certain groups of students with specific 
needs, such as those with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Education reform is "one of the reasons that my husband ran for President," 
Mrs. Clinton said. "We think every child can learn and that every child can 
make a contribution and be a good citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000 establishes voluntary guidelines in academics and occupational 
skills, providing a yardstick so parents and educators can judge whether their 
schools measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals include the objectives that by the year 2000 "all students will be 
competent in core academic subjects" and that "the United States will be first 
in the world in math and science." 
</P>
<P>
 It also calls for a nationwide high school graduation rate of at least 90%, 
compared with a current rate of about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law establishes a National Education Goals Panel to assess efforts to 
achieve the goals. It also establishes a National Education Standards and 
Improvement Council and a National Skills Standards Board to establish academic 
and occupational standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing culminates a national education reform movement that was launched 
in 1989 by then-President George Bush and a group of the nation's governors, 
including then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. Dismayed at reports showing that the 
nation's schoolchildren were falling behind the rest of the world, the leaders 
pledged to overhaul the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, who flew to San Diego for the ceremony, 
said Goals 2000 signifies that "America as a nation is getting serious about 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Payzant, an assistant secretary of education and a former 
superintendent of schools in San Diego, said the legislation could have an 
impact on each of the nation's schools because "a little bit of money that is 
focused on getting people to the next level of thinking and planning and action 
is so important." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration has faced fierce opposition from 
Republicans and members of its own party in other domestic policy areas, Goals 
2000 experienced bipartisan support. The Senate passed the act 63 to 22 and the 
House passed it 307 to 120. 
</P>
<P>
 "More of a consensus developed across party lines as to what needed to be done 
than in many other parts of the domestic agenda," said Bill Galston, a domestic 
policy adviser to the President who attended the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.) commended Clinton's leadership in forging the 
new legislation, which he said took a "decade too long." In a conference call 
with the President and congressional supporters of the bill right before the 
signing, he urged the President to make the federal government an even bigger 
player in the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of national standards have warned that results will not be 
measurable for some time but that dramatic reform is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have a system of anarchy and chaos," said Albert Shanker, president of 
the American Federation of Teachers. "We need elements of continuity. This does 
not accomplish this immediately, but . . . it will bring us to a more systemic 
approach to education. What kids learn each year will build on the last like 
building blocks."

EX-GI EXECUTED FOR '78 MURDER OF PROSTITUTE

 A former soldier was executed in Georgia's electric chair Thursday night for 
bludgeoning a prostitute to death in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 William Henry Hance, a 45-year-old former Ft.Benning soldier, died at 10:10 
p.m. after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal in a 5-3 vote. 
Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 Hance maintained his innocence in a seven-minute statement before his 
execution at the state prison in Jackson. He had been convicted of two other 
murders in a military court and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, a former construction worker was executed in Texas for 
killing the husband of a restaurant manager during a 1985 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Webb was put to death by injection hours after the U.S. Supreme Court 
rejected an appeal. He was convicted of murdering Leopoldo Cantu, who was shot 
after a robbery at a restaurant. At the time, Webb was on parole for raping a 
child.

A SHRINE RISES IN MOURNING; SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT BECOMES MEMORIAL TO SLAIN 
JAPANESE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came from downtown San Pedro and the suburban slopes of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, bearing flowers and cards and speaking somberly of the specter of 
teen-agers killing teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mourners crowded around the flower-bedecked shrine outside a Ralphs in San 
Pedro on Thursday morning, some lost in prayer and others murmuring quietly 
about the arrests of two San Pedro gang members in the slayings of two Japanese 
college students in the supermarket's parking lot last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were both 19. The young men who allegedly killed them are 18 and 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm devastated. My God! Youths killing youths. Where is their childhood?" 
asked Mary Orlando of Rancho Palos Verdes, who stood in the parking lot 
gathering signatures on a petition calling for the death penalty for first-time 
offenders who willfully kill another. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a few miles down the hill, at the Rancho San Pedro housing project, 
such views were deemed unrealistic by friends and neighbors of the two 
suspects, high school dropouts Raymond Oscar Butler, 18, and Alberto Vasquez 
Reygoza, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 There, residents reacting to the arrests emphasized that shootings are a 
frequent occurrence, with scant attention paid by police or the press -- never 
mind the President of the United States. "Why do they make this such a big 
thing when it happens here every day?" asked one housing project resident, who 
asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "With everything that happens around gang members, why would you be 
surprised?" said Lorenzos Guerra, 27, a friend of Reygoza, who served time with 
him last year in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the arrests drew a wide range of reaction Thursday from San Pedro to 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gritty neighborhood where the suspects lived, residents, while 
expressing sorrow at the slayings, urged that job and educational opportunities 
be improved to steer youngsters away from the violence of street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ralphs shrine, many of the 40 people gathered at noontime urged efforts 
to stem violence through nighttime curfews, gun control, harsher prisons, less 
violence on television and stricter parental oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 In just a few days, this 8-foot by 6-foot flower shrine has been transformed 
into the central symbol of community grief over the slayings of Takuma Ito and 
Go Matsuura. 
</P>
<P>
 Some knelt to write messages on long white sheets of paper taped to the 
pavement around the shrine. The bouquets at center had withered, and the ground 
was dotted with wax mounds from burned-out candles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downtown Los Angeles, at a somber midmorning press conference, the fathers 
of the slain students thanked the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the news we have been waiting for," said Shuji Matsuura, father of Go 
Matsuura, adding that the families would quietly await the decision in the 
prosecution of the two alleged assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiichiro Noboru, consul general of Japan in Los Angeles, speaking on behalf 
of the government of Japan, called the shootings "so regrettable and 
devastating that we have no words to correctly express our deep sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The "one bright spot" was news of the arrests, Noboru said, thanking what he 
called the strenuous police efforts "which have led to such an expeditious 
arrest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the media took note that L.A. authorities were careful to schedule 
the news conference at an unusually late hour in order to catch the evening 
news broadcasts in Japan. The L.A. correspondent for TV Asahi said that the 
investigation itself was carried out more swiftly than usual because of the 
international implications of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asahi newspaper reported: "The people who shattered the American dream of 
19-year-old film-loving exchange students Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were 
American youth of the same generation. They are gang members that can't be cut 
from American society, even if you could cut out the afflictions of poverty, 
violence or drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 The papers, however, reported that L.A. authorities were stressing that the 
shootings had no relation to race or nationality. 
</P>

PALIMONY CASES BRING OUT LURID SIDE OF LUSH LIVES; LAWSUIT: IF CLAIRE MAGLICA 
PREVAILS IN HER CLAIM FOR $150 MILLION SHE WILL ESTABLISH A RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sex, loads of money, spurned lovers. There's nothing quite like a star-studded 
palimony case. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "palimony" was coined in the 1970s when Michelle Triola sued actor 
Lee Marvin, her former lover, contending that she was promised a share of his 
earnings in exchange for her wifelike duties over the years they lived 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge found there was no agreement to share Marvin's income, but a jury 
awarded Triola $104,000 to help her get back on her feet. Marvin appealed and 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most well-known palimony case, but she got zip, zero," said 
Max A. Goodman, a palimony expert at Southwestern University School of Law in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, common law marriages are not recognized. But the Marvin case 
set precedent that financial compensation could be awarded to a partner 
following a break-up if it could be proved that there was an agreement to share 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of Maglica vs. Maglica got underway Thursday in Orange County 
Superior Court, where Anthony Maglica, the founder of a $300-million flashlight 
empire, is being sued by his companion of more than 20 years, Claire Maglica, 
who is also vice president of the company and claims Maglica's last name as her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica is seeking at least $150 million -- half of the company's 
assets. If she prevails, legal experts say, the case would be a record because 
such a large amount of money is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other well-known palimony cases include the 1989 suit filed by actress 
and director Sondra Locke against longtime lover Clint Eastwood. Adding to the 
sensational nature of the case against Eastwood was the fact that Locke was 
still legally married to her first husband at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Records were sealed in the Eastwood case and proceedings were later held 
behind closed court doors. Rumors circulated that Locke received several 
million dollars in a settlement, but Locke has denied those reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury rejected a palimony suit brought 
against the estate of the late multimillionaire Henry T. Mudd by one of his 
seven mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mudd, who co-founded Harvey Mudd College in Claremont in his father's name, 
died in 1990, shortly after Eleanor (Lorraine) Oliver filed a lawsuit seeking 
$5 million for her "wifelike companionship." 
</P>
<P>
 Cases that never quite paid off included a lawsuit filed against Merv Griffin, 
the popular talk show host and man behind television's "Wheel of Fortune." 
Former employee Brent Plott claimed in a lawsuit that he and Griffin were 
lovers, and Griffin promised to support him for life. He asked for $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said the claim was false, and it was later thrown out by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy Playmate Carrie Leigh filed for palimony against Playboy founder Hugh 
Hefner, her lover of six years, but Leigh later married and dropped the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases are fascinating because, Goodman said, it's "the seamy side of the 
lifestyles of the rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
 The most high-profile cases typically include rich and famous men and the 
women who fill the role of companion and homemaker, Goodman said. But Claire 
Maglica is different. She worked side by side with Anthony Maglica at their 
office, holds a top corporate position and helped build the business from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The protections set out in the Marvin case extend to same-sex partners, but 
the line is drawn at sex for money, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the partner is a mistress, and the agreement was for sex, that's not 
valid," said Goodman, who is on the witness list in the Maglica case and 
refused to discuss the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very difficult to prove, it's basically her word against his, and 
that can be difficult," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli Sr. said that unwritten agreements, 
or understandings, between couples are are valid and should be honored -- just 
as a marriage certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're living together, if they've done everything but legally be 
married, its de facto," Belli said.

GENE THERAPY USED ON CHOLESTEROL DISORDER; MEDICINE: THE TREATMENT HAS SLOWED 
THE PROGRESSION OF HEART DISEASE IN A WOMAN WITH A RARE MALADY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene therapy has dramatically slowed the progression of heart disease in a 
woman with a severe inherited cholesterol disorder, and surgeons have already 
applied the technique to four other victims of the disorder, Pennsylvania 
researchers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 30-year-old woman still has dangerously high cholesterol, the 
gene therapy probably will prolong her life, perhaps by years, said Dr. James 
Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel much better in the sense that I can do more physical activities now, 
such as skiing and dancing. I was limited before," the seamstress and part-time 
bank teller from Quebec City, Canada, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who insisted on anonymity, has a severe form of a disease called 
familial hypercholesterolemia, in which the liver lacks the gene to produce a 
normally functioning protein that removes cholesterol from the blood. About one 
in a million people lack the gene. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the disorder, cholesterol clogs the arteries of victims, most of 
whom die in their teens. The Quebec City woman had a heart attack at age 16 and 
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at age 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's team surgically removed about 15% of the woman's liver. In the 
laboratory, they used viruses to shuttle copies of the missing gene into liver 
cells. About one-fifth of the cells took up the gene. The corrected cells were 
then put back into the woman's liver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing to lose," the woman said of the experimental treatment, whose 
results are reported today in the journal Nature Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to helping the woman's liver clear cholesterol from her blood, the 
gene therapy also made her more sensitive to the beneficial effects of a 
cholesterol-lowering drug called lovastatin, thereby increasing the overall 
efficacy of the procedure, Wilson said.

2 SHOT TO DEATH, SUSPECT WOUNDED IN NORTHRIDGE ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A robbery in Northridge left two brothers dead and two of three suspects in 
custody, including one who was accidentally wounded by a gunman who escaped, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred at 8:15 p.m. Wednesday in the 8600 block of Wilbur Avenue, 
said Detective Tom Broad of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Cordova, 44, and his brother Jose, 48, died at the scene, Broad said. 
The Cordovas and two other men were standing near parked cars when two men, one 
of them armed, tried to rob them, Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims struggled with the robbers and one struck the gunman on the wrist, 
deflecting the weapon. But a third gunman approached and opened fire, fatally 
wounding the brothers and accidentally wounding one of the robbers before 
fleeing, Broad said. The wounded man, whose name was not immediately disclosed, 
reportedly was hospitalized in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police plan to seek robbery and murder charges against him and Antonio Bilboa, 
18, of North Hills.

EPA SEWAGE TREATMENT PLAN FOR SAN DIEGO REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Thursday rejected a sewage-treatment and water-reclamation 
system that the federal government was trying to force the city of San Diego to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Rudi M. Brewster ruled that the proposed system would not 
be in the public interest.It would waste money and water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is a victory for the city and the San Diego Area Wastewater 
Management District. They are parties to the lawsuit and opposed the proposed 
sewage-treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
 It represents a defeat for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in its 
almost six-year legal battle over the way San Diego treats its sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed by the EPA and the state of California in July, 1988, in 
an attempt to bring the city's level of sewage treatment up to the federal 
standard, known as secondary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The state recently dropped out as a plaintiff and became a defendant instead, 
supporting the city.

HIGH COURT REJECTS BAN ON SALE OF RECYCLABLE TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first review of a major new environmental law, the California Supreme 
Court held Thursday that cities cannot prevent households or companies from 
selling their recyclable trash directly to private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-2 ruling limits the ability of cities to entice garbage companies into 
the recycling business by promising them exclusive rights to the most valuable 
of recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is important because the state has ordered cities to reduce their 
trash by 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. Cities have argued that they need maximum 
flexibility to meet the deadlines and avoid hefty fines. Independent recyclers 
counter that cities are just trying to cash in on their business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature imposed the mandatory goals in 1989 because dumps are quickly 
filling to capacity. Finding sites for more dumps is politically difficult 
because of community opposition: Landfills can leak and contaminate underground 
water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case before the court, the city of Rancho Mirage gave Waste Management 
of the Desert exclusive rights to collect recyclable goods. Dozens of cities 
have similar arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management collected bottles, newspapers, cans and other recyclables for 
free from households, recouping its losses by charging large commercial waste 
generators, such as hotels, a fee for the pickup and then selling the materials 
to processors. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management shared some of its earnings from the recycling operation with 
the city and credited the businesses a fixed percentage of the profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But several large businesses opted instead to sell their wastes to Palm 
Springs Recycling Center, an independent recycler. The city and the garbage 
company sued, arguing that the recycler was violating the exclusive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial court ruled in favor of the city, but a Court of Appeal reversed the 
ruling. The appellate court held that the state law does not authorize cities 
to grant an exclusive franchise for recyclable materials that have not been 
placed into separate containers maintained by the city or its contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court majority, in an opinion written by Justice Marvin R. Baxter, 
held that such exclusive franchises can be enforced only if the recyclables are 
actually discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone sells recyclables, they "are not discarded and do not become 
waste," Baxter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing for exclusive collection could interfere with the ability of the Boy 
Scouts and other charities to raise money through paper drives, the court 
majority reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's high court directed the trial court to order the city to allow 
Palm Springs Recycling to buy recyclables from commercial establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was mixed for both sides in the garbage wars. Independent 
recyclers wanted a clear ruling that would have allowed people to do what they 
want with their garbage. The cities wanted absolute control. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the court ruling, independent recyclers can take the trash without 
violating exclusive agreements only if they pay for it, lawyers for some of the 
litigants said. Some independents pay for trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is enforcement because it then forces the city to inquire into 
the arrangements between the generator and the collector, and whether they are 
actually being paid for it," said Jon Shoenberger, an attorney for Waste 
Management and Rancho Mirage. "That may make things difficult for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Bernheimer, a lobbyist for the Institute of Scrap Recycling 
Industries, said the decision is more favorable for the recycling industry. He 
said he does not believe recyclers will have to pay for the waste as long as 
the generator has not clearly discarded it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the recyclers I talked to are ecstatic about this," said Bernheimer, 
who represents 120 companies in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Ronald M. George, in a dissent joined by Justice Stanley Mosk, 
complained that the ruling will make it harder for cities to meet their waste 
reduction targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the majority's interpretation of the relevant legislation is 
clearly incorrect and will frustrate, rather than further, the important 
purposes" of the state law, George wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Levine, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of nearly 60 
cities, also said the decision could weaken city efforts to comply with the new 
disposal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have done is plucked a profitable element of recycling out of city 
control," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither officials for Waste Management nor Rancho Mirage would comment on the 
decision because they had not read it.

DANA PARSONS: IT WON'T BE LIKE OLD TIMES WHEN EAGLES COME TO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read the news today, oh, boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the upcoming Eagles reunion concerts at Irvine Meadows are topping 
out at $115. Others will go for $75. The cheap seats are $35. 
</P>
<P>
 God bless rock 'n' roll. God bless supply 'n' demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere deep in my soul, even more so than deep in my wallet, it rankles me 
that I may actually pay those prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, I almost have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of seeing the Eagles in 1994 in the heart of Yuppiedom is 
irresistible. That's because I first saw them 20 years ago, in July of 1974, at 
an outdoor rock concert billed as the Ozark Music Festival in Sedalia, Mo. In 
the early stages of stardom, the scraggly Eagles were but one of the headliners 
in a 20-band show that stretched over three days. At its peak, the crowd was 
estimated at 150,000. A town of 25,000, Sedalia acted as though it had been 
invaded by Martians. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah, the concert was free. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a corporate-merger entity, the Eagles once were a rock band. On rereading 
my account of that weekend, as reported in the Omaha World-Herald, the tales 
from Sedalia make me feel almost wistful for days when rock 'n' roll really was 
the counterculture: 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs flowed freely, as entrepreneurs walked around with cardboard signs 
offering their dope. "Anybody got a reefer for sale?" one young man asked me as 
he picked his way through blankets and tents at the fairgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, a youth wearing a turban and resting under a tent fashioned after 
that of an Arabian sheik, called out, "Does anyone know the chemical makeup of 
Valium? Will it kill you if you burn it?"  
</P>
<P>
 "No," someone hollers back. "Good, then I did have a good idea," the first one 
says. With that, he prepared the drug for use in a pipe.  
</P>
<P>
 . . . As the temperature cracked 100 degrees, a few more naked strollers 
dotted the fairgrounds. The almost universal attire was jean shorts for the 
males, shorts and halter tops for females. As one male ambled down the midway 
in the altogether, his sidekick crowed: "He said he'd do it. He ain't got 
nothing on but his head."  
</P>
<P>
 . . . But through all this, as steady and pounding and overpowering was the 
sun, was the music. That seems to be the common bond among all the tired 
travelers, the only thing they can all identity with. It started in midmorning 
and on Friday and Saturday went past midnight. Sunday's shows ended about 8 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 I then noted the introduction of the celebrated radio disc jockey, Wolfman 
Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a giant wave, starting from the front of the crowd and moving back, the 
people stand. "TONIGHT," blares that familiar raspy voice with just the right 
pause for effect, "IS THE NIGHT OF THE WOLF! " 
</P>
<P>
 Wolflike howls go up and there is a genuine electricity generated by the 
Wolfman. "I WANT TO FEEL A FEELING OF TOGETHERNESS. A FEELING OF ONENESS. DO 
YOU LIKE ROCK 'N' ROLL?"  
</P>
<P>
 The crowd responds, "Ye-a-h-h!"  
</P>
<P>
 If you like rock 'n' roll, say, "OH, YEAH . . . !"  
</P>
<P>
 The crowd says, "Oh, ye-a-a-ah!"  
</P>
<P>
 And before the Wolfman has finished his last sentence, the guitars of the 
Eagles, one of the headline groups, blare out from the powerful amplifiers from 
the other side of the 20-foot-high stage. Immediately recognized, the song 
drives the crowd crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 . . . The air is thick with the smell of marijuana. Everywhere, people are 
smoking. But it is a peaceful crowd, perhaps lulled by the drugs, but more so 
because they know they have nowhere to go for three days and they're with 
people who understand.  
</P>
<P>
 . . . After doctors reported that many people were overdosing on a bad drug, a 
festival promoter announced from the platform, "Watch what you're buying or 
your babies will look like frogs."  
</P>
<P>
 . . . Occasionally, the shout would go up, "O.D., O.D." The next thing you saw 
was a motorized cart, winding its way through the crowd, with a victim sprawled 
in the back, arms hanging over the side, head flung back.  
</P>
<P>
 I wrote that even as drug traffic was heavy, Missouri state troopers stood 100 
yards away. "What could you do?" one said. "We were worried about it, but what 
could you do with a group that size?"  
</P>
<P>
 . . . The Associated Press reported that 3,500 people were treated over the 
weekend, about 1,000 for drug-related problems.  
</P>
<P>
 One woman said: "I love the kids. They were on my lawn. I gave them water and 
I would have taken them inside but I live alone and I just couldn't take the 
chance."  
</P>
<P>
 One local resident said Sedalia looked liked a "tent town." 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't sure what to do but said she realized she probably was powerless 
when she looked across the street and saw a group camped on the lawn of the 
Sedalia chief of police.  
</P>
<P>
 The clipping says 1974 but it feels like a couple lifetimes ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, I may be in Irvine for the Eagles' reunion. And they may be as good 
in 1994 as they were in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 But it just won't be the same. Which leads me to a brilliant thought: 
</P>
<P>
 From free concerts to $115 a pop, it's a long way from Sedalia to Irvine. 
</P>

FELON ARRESTED IN NEWPORT FACES 'STRIKE 3'; LAW: IN THE SECOND CASE OF ITS KIND 
IN THE COUNTY, PROSECUTORS ARE TARGETING A CONVICTED ROBBER AND BURGLAR WHO WAS 
HOLDING A LOADED WEAPON WHEN STOPPED BY POLICE, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 In the second "three strikes" case filed in Orange County, prosecutors are 
targeting a convicted robber and burglar who was holding a loaded weapon when 
he was stopped for speeding, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Lee Hart, 36, was arrested March 23 in Newport Beach after he grabbed 
a loaded handgun and tried to hide it as police ordered him from his car, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new law aimed at cracking down on three-time offenders, Hart faces 25 
years to life in prison if convicted of felony possession of a weapon by a 
felon. He will be arraigned Wednesday in Municipal Court in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart was first convicted of a felony, a robbery in Sacramento, in 1977 and was 
sentenced to five years to life in prison. His second strike came in 1985, when 
he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a burglary in Bakersfield, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Delbert L. Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart originally faced the single felony weapons possession charge until a 
background investigation turned up the additional felonies, said Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Jan J. Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 A Garden Grove man last week earned the distinction of being the county's 
first defendant charged under the new law. Formerly convicted of robbery and 
assault with intent to commit murder, Mario V. Rodriguez, 30, also faces 25 
years to life for allegedly shooting a man in the face with a flare gun after a 
barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys locally and statewide are still 
trying to sort out the impact of the new law. Some say the law takes away a 
judge's discretion, while others say the legislation is needed to crack down on 
defendants who repeatedly commit serious or violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many defense attorneys say the law is too broadly drafted, and unfairly counts 
juvenile convictions as a "strike." Others also question whether the law will 
be used fairly, and wonder whether problems such as purged juvenile files could 
result in uneven prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say they will carefully review all cases in which the new law 
applies. But one case that came before a judge Thursday underscores the wide 
discretion under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel Perez, 45, was arraigned Thursday in Municipal Court in Santa Ana on 
felony charges that he possessed a small amount of heroin, just enough for a 
single high, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges make Perez eligible for the "three strikes" enhancement that could 
send him to prison for 25 years to life. Perez has a prior 1975 conviction for 
forced sodomy, on which he served just over two years on a five-year sentence, 
and a 1986 burglary-assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 He also violated parole numerous times before his recent drug arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armbrust said he asked a judge Thursday to drop one of Perez's prior 
felony convictions for the purposes of the drug case. As a result, Perez now 
faces "two strikes," which still will limit the amount of time that may be 
shaved off his prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, defendants only serve half their given sentences with credit for 
good behavior and work. Perez faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison if 
convicted of the drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't seem right, 25 years to life in prison for such a small amount 
of heroin," Armbrust said, adding that Perez has drug problems. "It would be 
different if he had a larger amount."

CRIME PLUMMETS AT BEACHES SINCE DEBUT OF CURFEWS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: STATE SAYS 
MORE FAMILIES AND GROUPS ARE HAVING FUN WITHOUT ALCOHOL IN YEAR SINCE 10 P.M. 
CLOSURE BEGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crime is down by about 45% at two state beaches where curfews were imposed a 
year ago, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A state review of Bolsa Chica State and Huntington Beach State beaches says 
reports of vandalism, assaults and other criminal activity have fallen off 
significantly, according to Donald Ito, local superintendent for the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, amid growing concerns over crime, the state placed a 10 p.m. 
curfew on the beaches that previously closed at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's changed -- we're noticing more families and groups enjoying themselves 
and not needing alcohol to have a good time," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The review compared beach crimes reported during 1991 to activity in 1993, 
after the curfew went into effect. Within the overall 45% drop in crime, 
alcohol-related crimes were reduced nearly 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of crimes reported at state beaches was not immediately 
available, Ito said. Meanwhile, police officials in Huntington Beach said 
Thursday that lawlessness has also declined at city beaches, where curfews were 
imposed following the state's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Lt. Charles Poe said 39 crime reports were filed for 
such activity as grand theft auto, assault and curfew violation in the year 
before the city's beach curfew was enacted. That number has dwindled to 14 for 
the three-mile beach area, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would certainly mean that our prediction for less calls on the beach with 
a curfew was true," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curfews "have been beneficial for us," said Huntington Beach Lifeguard Capt. 
Bill Richardson. "We're seeing less graffiti, less fights, and we're 
experiencing less problems with law enforcement situations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew on state beaches went into effect last April 1, at a time when 
urban crime such as gang activity and graffiti had been spreading to the 
seashore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Seal Beach, fearing that 
vandals would migrate to their communities when the two state beaches were 
closed early, also imposed beach curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dispute arose last October when the California Coastal Commission 
advised 73 cities and counties along the state's 1,100-mile coastline that such 
closures are illegal without state approval. The commission said the state 
would not approve curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's desire to guarantee access to public beaches collided with 
Orange County elected officials who argued for local control to ensure the 
public's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 A peaceful truce was reached after several meetings between commission and 
Orange County city officials. However, no resolution has been reached, and 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) has introduced legislation that 
would allow the nightly closures to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 While law enforcement is clearly pleased by the curfew's results, not 
everybody is completely happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants who agree the curfew has reduced problems also complain that their 
business is suffering because fewer people stroll the beaches and boardwalks 
after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly lowered the number of customers here," said an employee at the 
Jack-In-The-Box restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach. "It 
has decreased our business." 
</P>
<P>
 North of the fast-food restaurant, Akira Fukuda, the store manager at Jack's 
Surf Shop, was more philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good call," Fukuda said. "As far as we're concerned, having the minors 
loiter around at longer hours doesn't do us any good. We're glad to see that 
the kids are off the beach and the streets at a certain time. In the long run, 
the kids hopefully will understand that it's a good decision."

 Anaheim Stadium has suffered through a long and torturous off-season.

28-year-old stadium for the baseball season, which will unofficially start 
Saturday night when the California Angels host cross-region rivals, the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, in their annual exhibition Freeway Series. (The official home 
opener is more than a week later, when the Angels play the Cleveland Indians 
April 11.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be nice to have baseball start again," said Greg Smith, the stadium 
manager. "There's a good feeling in the air. There's a lot of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Souvenir manager Sam Maida, who has been stocking shelves this week with the 
latest hats, mini-bats and pennants, said Thursday the stadium is filled with 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "In April, everybody is in first place," he said with a chuckle. Even the 
Angels. "Everybody is excited." 
</P>
<P>
 A mere three months ago, however, despair was the prevailing mood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8 earthquake that shook the Southland on Jan. 17 toppled the stadium's 
17-ton scoreboard, destroying hundreds of stadium seats and demolishing a 
concession stand as well as two restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal preparations for the baseball season had to give way to emergency 
repairs to assure that Anaheim's Boys of Summer had a place to play in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium crews worked around the clock to remove twisted seats, concrete debris 
and the broken scoreboard in time for the Freeway Series. The city also 
reinforced 18 steel beams throughout the stadium to bring them up to current 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real challenge," Smith said this week as he surveyed the 
still-visible quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 All the repairs are expected to be completed by August. In the meantime, 
baseball fans will have to settle for a temporary scoreboard positioned in the 
middle of the left-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be fewer seats, some 2,000 of them, for most of the season. 
That, however, will make it easier for the Angels to get a sellout, something 
that eluded them all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the seats and the scoreboard, the stadium looks ready for its 
season debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun shone brightly on the groundskeepers Thursday as they mowed the 
freshly planted grass to a precise five-eighths of an inch and raked the 
infield dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Concessionaires, meanwhile, were busy loading their stands with kegs of beer, 
pretzels and, of course, hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting trucks and trucks of deliveries between now and the weekend," 
said John Trosper, concessions manager at the stadium. "You can tell the season 
is beginning. There's an electricity building around this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the tunnel way from Gate 4, souvenir workers were checking their 
inventories and stocking their shelves with the latest products. Maida said new 
products this year will highlight Angel outfielder Tim Salmon, winner of last 
year's Rookie of the Year award, and Nike pitchman and newly signed Angel Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the team does well, we do well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the Angels suffered through a dismal season, Mighty Ducks 
merchandise received more attention than Angels products, said one woman 
concessionaire, who was stocking her stand with Angels hats Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are looking to change that this year. The organization hopes its 
off-season acquisitions and the development of its younger players will 
strengthen the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, team officials said they hope a new mascot and new team cheer will bring 
the ballclub some luck.

GATES' SOLE OPPONENT IS DISQUALIFIED FROM RACE; COURTS: BONNIE RAE STREETER 
FAILED TO MEET STATE-MANDATED REQUIREMENTS TO RUN FOR SHERIFF, JUDGE RULES. 
SHE, HOWEVER, VOWS TO CONTINUE HER CAMPAIGN AND SEEK WRITE-IN VOTES.

 Sheriff Brad Gates' only challenger in the June election was disqualified 
Thursday when an Orange County Superior Court judge ruled that she did not meet 
state-mandated qualifications to hold that office. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marks the first time a candidate was removed from consideration 
by court order under a 6-year-old law that requires all state sheriff hopefuls 
to have previous law enforcement experience or certification as a peace officer 
by the state Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a formal challenge brought by the California State Sheriffs' Assn. 
and three local residents, Superior Court Judge Francisco F. Firmat found that 
Bonnie Rae Streeter had neither law enforcement experience nor had she been 
certified by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged by the decision, Streeter, a Capistrano Beach County Water District 
director, said she would continue her campaign and seek write-in votes, 
regardless of the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only qualification needed to run for elected office is to be a citizen 
and resident," said Streeter, who appeared at the brief hearing Thursday 
without an attorney. "I fit both those qualifications. This ruling shows this 
is a government of the police, by the police, and for the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's association was joined in the challenge by former Placentia 
Police Chief H.A. Fisher, former Fullerton Police Chief Philip A. Goehring and 
local law enforcement activist Collene Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates was not a party to the legal action, but his personal attorney, Darryl 
R. Wold, represented both the association and the three residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad to get the result we did because it is misleading to the voters to 
have someone on the ballot who doesn't meet the qualifications for the office," 
Wold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law establishing the ballot qualifications for sheriff was championed by 
the sheriff's association. 
</P>
<P>
 Wold said the decision did not represent a full victory for his clients, who 
also were asking the court to order the Orange County registrar of voters 
office to investigate the qualifications of all future candidates for sheriff. 
Firmat denied that request.

MARCHERS FOLLOW PATH OF CHAVEZ; LABOR: RESIDENTS IN STREETS OF SAN FERNANDO AND 
NEW UFW LEADERS IN FIELDS OF CENTRAL VALLEY PAY TRIBUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the new leaders of the United Farm Workers union marched over the Central 
Valley road their founder, Cesar Chavez, took three decades earlier, residents 
in the tiny city of San Fernando -- first in the nation to make Chavez's 
birthday a legal holiday -- marched through their streets Thursday in honor of 
the late labor leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In the town of Delano in the San Joaquin Valley, the UFW, hoping to reclaim 
the magic that once made it such a force in the fields, began a 330-mile march 
up the spine of the Central Valley on Thursday -- a trek that signals the 
union's return to the work of organizing farm laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilgrimage retraces the path Chavez took 28 years ago this spring, a march 
that transformed Delano and the relatively unknown Chavez into nationally known 
symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in San Fernando, about 250 residents, many of them younger than the 
union Chavez organized, marched through the streets waving "Boycott Grapes" 
picket signs and wearing the black and red Aztec eagle symbol of the UFW, 
shouting "Viva Chavez!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was the 67th anniversary of the birth of Chavez, who died in San 
Luis, Ariz., on April 23, 1993 at age 66. 
</P>
<P>
 In Delano, the UFW pilgrimage, or peregrinacion, opened with a 90-minute Mass. 
About 750 people led by Arturo Rodriguez, Chavez's son-in-law and successor, 
and Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the union, marched from the UFW's Forty Acres 
compound to the first overnight stop, the town of Richgrove, about eight miles 
northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The march will end with a big rally in Sacramento in three weeks, on the first 
anniversary of the union founder's death, after moving for 24 days through some 
of richest farmland in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilgrimage is about recommitment and penance," Rodriguez said at the 
outset of the march. "Recommitment to building a national union for farm 
workers, penance, because all of us let Cesar carry the responsibility for 
organizing the union on his shoulders. Now the burden for fulfilling Cesar's 
dreams and our own rests squarely on each of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the holiday, according to San Fernando's City Council, is to 
keep Chavez's memory alive in the 2.4-square-mile city, which has an 82% Latino 
population, and to educate young people about his deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids here were asked about the death of Cesar Chavez last year, they 
thought the boxer had died," said Jenaro Ayala of La Raza Unida, a San 
Fernando-based Chicano group, referring to Mexican fighter Julio Cesar Chavez. 
"They don't teach it in the schools, so we have to go out and do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Passing out flyers at every home they passed, and coaxing residents into 
coming along, the marchers finished with more people than had started.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great leader for the campesinos , especially the underprivileged 
Latinos, and we can't let people forget," said Isabel Salazar of the San 
Fernando Cesar Chavez Memorial Committee, co-sponsor of the march. "Our sons 
and daughters have to be made aware of Chavez and his legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups marched through the San Fernando streets, coming together in the 
city's Las Palmas Park for a celebration including Aztec dancers, mariachis, 
folk dancing, and a commendation for Councilman Jose Hernandez, who introduced 
the measure to make Chavez's birthday a legal holiday last year. The measure 
passed by unanimous vote of San Fernando's City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much impressed that the community would come out like this," 
Hernandez said. "Look at all the young people! Every year it's going to get 
bigger and bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 The march in the San Joaquin Valley signals an important departure from the 
strategies of Chavez. No longer will the grape boycott be the centerpiece of 
the UFW's activities, as it has been for the past decade. The union's 
leadership has decided to return to the fields to enlist new members, confront 
growers and push for new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in strategy is a concession that the boycott alone has not been 
enough to improve the lot of farm workers, whose wages have leveled off or 
dropped in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The return to organizing is seen as a gamble for a union that has suffered 
years of defeat and infighting. In 1973, the UFW had contracts with 80% of the 
grape growers in the San Joaquin Valley. Today, not a single contract remains. 
At its height, the union had 100,000 members; now there are fewer than 15,000. 
It hopes to enlist 10,000 new members by the end of the trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics called the march a desperate public relations ploy to revive a dying 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "This march is a publicity stunt," said Richard Baiz of the Grape Workers and 
Farmers Coalition, an advocate group representing the grape industry that 
opposes the UFW. "The grape boycott was a huge failure and now they want to 
organize in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they're going to find it tough out there. The farm workers are happy 
just to have a job, and working conditions have improved a great deal since the 
1970s. For the UFW, this is Custer's last stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez acknowledges the risks of returning to the difficult work of 
organizing, but he believes the laborers in the fields will heed the union's 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we're taking a risk," he said. "But everywhere we've gone this past 
year, farm workers are tired and fed up with abuse from growers and labor 
contractors who have no respect for them or their families. They are ready to 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in strategy is welcomed by longtime supporters and former top UFW 
organizers. Chavez's original march through the San Joaquin Valley ushered in a 
heady decade for the union. Growers who had sworn never to deal with Chavez 
were forced to the bargaining table. It culminated with the state Legislature 
passing the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, the landmark law that gave farm 
workers the right to collective bargaining and the right to seek redress for 
unfair practices on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodriguez argues that the board set up to enforce the labor law has been 
gutted by 12 years of the administrations of former Gov. George Deukmejian and 
Gov. Pete Wilson. He acknowledged the difficulty in winning contracts at a time 
when the board was headed by a general counsel he said is "averse to the plight 
of farm workers." But the union has no choice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In East Los Angeles, a ceremony was held to unveil the first street sign 
changing the name of Brooklyn Avenue to Cesar E. Chavez Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 people, including schoolchildren from Pacoima, Pico Union, and East 
L.A., Mayor Richard Riordan, City Council members Richard Alatorre, Mike 
Hernandez, Richard Alarcon, Jackie Goldberg and Rita Walters, and county 
Supervisor Gloria Molina, took part in the two-hour event in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the City Council approved the 
name change of one of the city's oldest streets, which extends from just east 
of the Los Angeles River to Atlantic Avenue, last October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education in February called on schools to teach 
Chavez's life and work, between Thursday and April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state Senate approved a measure designating Chavez's birthday 
as a state holiday. The measure, which would not have given government workers 
the day off, was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson.

MAJOR ART ROBBERY CASE GETS MORE ABSTRACT; SUIT: BROTHER CHALLENGES SISTER'S 
OWNERSHIP OF THE WORKS, WHICH WERE RECOVERED LAST YEAR AFTER A THEFT FROM A 
NORTHRIDGE STORAGE UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One of the biggest art robberies in Los Angeles history seemed to have ended 
happily in August when it was announced the FBI and police had recovered $9 
million worth of modern art stolen from a Northridge rental storage unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Eva Smith Weisager, the 86-year-old woman who told police she had 
inherited the artworks from her socialite sister, is being accused of stealing 
them herself back in the late 1970s, a charge a spokesman for her denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager's brother, Daniel Greenway, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court 
Wednesday contending that Weisager took the paintings and drawings -- including 
a possible Picasso -- from the home of their sister, Rosita Winston, after 
Winston was debilitated by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway further contends that when Winston -- who was the widow of highly 
successful real estate developer Norman Winston -- died in 1979, he should have 
shared in the artworks under the terms of her will. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine paintings and drawings include "The Party," a painting attributed to 
Pablo Picasso, although leading experts on the artist said they had no 
knowledge of the work. If authenticated, the signed painting would be worth 
about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other paintings and drawings in the group were by such well-known artists as 
Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Eugene Delacroix. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway said in his suit that he is entitled to at least $1 million -- 
one-ninth the value of the paintings, plus punitive damages and costs. He is a 
resident of Mexico and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, based in 
Claremont, did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager's son-in-law, Ken Tate, said Weisager was too upset to comment on the 
matter. Tate also would not comment in detail on the suit, other than to call 
it groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not one thing in there that is true," Tate said, speaking from his 
office in Reseda. "The truth will come out and this will all just go away." 
</P>
<P>
 The artworks were recovered in an early morning raid Aug. 10 at the homes of 
Chatsworth carpenter Peter MacKenzie and Granada Hills electrician Alan 
McArthur. Several of the works, police said, were found hidden in the wall of 
MacKenzie's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men and restaurant owner Vasilios Mirmaras, who was accused of trying 
to sell the paintings, are scheduled to go on trial this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager reported the artworks missing Feb. 5, 1992, from the public storage 
unit where she had kept them for 13 years. She was living in a modest Van Nuys 
apartment and had no insurance on the works, she told police. 
</P>
<P>
 An insurance policy, in addition to protecting her against loss, would 
probably have bolstered her claim to ownership. Art insurers normally require 
proof that a valuable work is owned by the person or institution taking out the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate would not comment on whether the paintings were now insured, or even if 
Weisager still had them in her possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bill Martin, who heads the Los Angeles Police Department's art theft 
division, said he had no reason at the time of the investigation to doubt 
Weisager owned the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it was just the opposite," Martin said Wednesday. "This was an 
elderly woman who was very nice, very cooperative, who had never been in 
trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gave us materials to show that the paintings had been in her family for 
many years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Winstons were well known in New York art circles for their collection. A 
photograph of Rosita Winston that appeared in Vogue magazine in the mid-1950s 
shows "The Party" hanging on the wall of their apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway contends in the suit that Weisager bought a station wagon in 1978 
"for the specific purpose of looting Rosita Winston's plush condominium of 
valuable works of art." He further states that Weisager, who is the only 
defendant in the suit, was assisted in taking the art by her daughter and a 
servant. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway further states in the suit that he never knew what had happened to 
the paintings until he read a Times story in August about their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said that Weisager and Greenway had stayed in contact over the years and 
had seen each other as recently as about two weeks ago. He said he did not know 
if they ever discussed the artworks.ART COLLEC

NASA CHIEF VISITS ROCKETDYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin gave qualified praise Thursday to 
Rocketdyne, the Canoga Park-based aerospace firm that was plagued last year by 
a series of problems with its space shuttle engines. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 90-minute tour of Rocketdyne's sprawling main factory, Goldin said the 
company has made some progress in correcting quality control problems that 
caused two shuttle launches to be aborted seconds before liftoff and two other 
scheduled flights to be postponed, much to NASA's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality slipped up a bit, and we let them know that in no uncertain 
terms," said Goldin, standing amid a gaggle of Rocketdyne executives that 
included Paul B. Smith, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "To their credit, they have stepped up. We're getting there. . . . But they 
have some more work to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5,800 workers, Rocketdyne, a division of Seal Beach-based Rockwell 
International Corp., is the San Fernando Valley's largest aerospace employer. 
Rocketdyne also makes solar-based power systems for the space station, engines 
for rockets that launch commercial and military satellites, and other aerospace 
devices. NASA pays Rocketdyne about $350 million annually for shuttle work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, a valve in one of the shuttle Columbia's engines failed to close, 
forcing mission controllers to abort its launch only three seconds before 
liftoff -- a dangerous procedure due to huge amounts of burning fuel. In 
August, a faulty fuel sensor in the shuttle Discovery's engine caused NASA to 
scrub the mission only seconds before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, NASA had to postpone for two weeks the launch of the shuttle 
Endeavour because Rocketdyne failed to properly document that an engine pump 
was space-worthy. In February, NASA discovered a part missing in an engine 
turbine, a problem that could prove catastrophic if the shuttle lost thrust 
while in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lapses prompted Goldin last spring to dispatch a dozen engineers and 
quality experts on an extraordinary, monthlong inspection of Rocketdyne and its 
shuttle work. Each scrubbed launch costs NASA from $600,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors concluded that there were discrepancies between NASA's designs 
and specifications and Rocketdyne's blueprints, and that in some cases 
Rocketdyne technicians were not following procedures dictated by their own 
manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems badly shook the firm, which has built shuttle engines for 20 
years and had few problems until last year. They were especially damaging to 
Rocketdyne's image because they came at a time when the Clinton Administration 
was proposing major funding cutbacks in NASA programs, including the space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters Thursday, Goldin said part of the problem was that there 
was not enough accountability by executives overseeing the shuttle engines. 
Then he pointed at Smith, saying: "He's in charge of that engine . . . If it 
works, it works. If it doesn't, he's accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tour of the plant, Goldin alternately joked with and cheerfully 
chided several Rocketdyne engineers who resorted to acronyms and exotic 
terminology in an attempt to explain complicated engine components. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in 44 states and one of my concerns is that you don't speak to the 
average American," he told one engineer. "Speak English!" 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin was invited to Canoga Park and accompanied on his tour by Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who has supported the shuttle program but opposed 
the space station in Congress, despite the presence of most of Rocketdyne's 
facilities in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin insisted that NASA was not contemplating any funding cutbacks on the 
shuttle program and said that the United States is in danger of losing its 
worldwide lead in aerospace technology if Congress continues to reduce 
space-related expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the tour, Beilenson said he was impressed with the work at 
Rocketdyne but had not changed his mind about the space station.

LIFTING THE 'SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA'; AEROSPACE: OVER 10,000 JOIN NORTHROP 
CHRISTENING OF B-2. LAWMAKERS URGE SUPPORT FOR BOMBER PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 10,000 people turned out Thursday for a ceremony at the Northrop 
Corp. plant to mark the naming of the second operational B-2 bomber the Spirit 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The large showing couldn't have come at a better time for Northrop, which is 
seeking congressional approval of $150 million in the 1995 budget to keep the 
B-2 production lines intact. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ceremony, Northrop also garnered support for its so-called "insurance 
policy" from a pair of guests. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Howard 
P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) said they favor not only the $150 million, 
but the government purchasing more than the current 20-bomber order. 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress now funding just 20 bombers, production is slated for completion 
in early 1998. Already, equipment used in the early stages of production is 
being put into storage and contractors are completing their work on the B-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already we have mothballed some tooling in our Palmdale plant," Paul 
Tackabury, business development manager for Northrop's B-2 division, said 
before the naming ceremony. "Tooling is being mothballed here, in Washington, 
in Texas and throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
 When Northrop began constructing the B-2s in the early 1980s, the plan was to 
build 132 of them. Congress later reduced the order to 75 and in 1990 it was 
further lowered to just 20 aircraft, with a price tag of $44.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 With a government commission preparing to study the mission of the armed 
forces, Northrop is hoping that more B-2s will be needed. A recent RAND Corp. 
study said that as many as 60 bombers may be needed and there has been growing 
support in Washington for more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who on Thursday was promised she would someday be taken for a ride 
in a B-2, said: "I make no bones about being a supporter of the B-2." 
</P>
<P>
 As the military continues to shrink and the United States pulls out of foreign 
bases, she said, "the Air Force and long-range bombers will play an even more 
important role in our nation's defense." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon was one of 22 members of the California Republican delegation who on 
March 16 sent a letter to the House Armed Services Committee urging that the 
$150 million be included in the 1995 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 At the naming ceremony Thursday, McKeon said there should be enough B-2s built 
to name one for every state "and even the territories." 
</P>
<P>
 California was the name chosen for the second operational bomber (the first 
was named Spirit of Missouri since the B-2 fleet will be based there) because 
of the contributions the state has made to aerospace and to the B-2 in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "This technological marvel could only have been brought to life in 
California," said Lt. Gen. Stephen B. Croker, commander of Air Combat Command's 
8th Air Force. "We want to name this airplane after a place and a people whose 
strong spirit we're very proud of."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COURT REJECTS SOKA'S BID FOR SEPARATE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Making only minor changes to an earlier ruling, a state appeals court on 
Thursday affirmed that Soka University should fight the condemnation of its 
Calabasas campus in Los Angeles County courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-page opinion by the 2nd District Court of Appeal amended a Feb. 15 
decision, in which the three-judge panel reached essentially the same 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's revised ruling was done to clarify legal points raised by Soka, 
which is locked in a bitter fight with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
over its campus at the corner of Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials want to condemn 245 acres of the campus to use as a 
visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The 
Japanese language school wants to expand into a liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying unsuccessfully to buy Soka's property, the conservancy in late 
1992 launched eminent domain proceedings -- the process by which a public 
agency can force a private property owner to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers claimed the conservancy did not follow proper procedure when it 
began the process and sued to halt the action in court. Early last year, a 
Ventura County judge agreed with Soka and ruled that the conservancy had erred. 
</P>
<P>
 But justices deciding a conservancy appeal ruled that Soka should raise its 
objections to the conservancy's actions in eminent domain proceedings in Los 
Angeles County -- not in a series of separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Thursday's ruling, Soka administrators vowed to press their 
concerns before the California Supreme Court later this spring, an action that 
probably would cause further delays in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to be very sanguine about the whole thing," said Soka spokesman 
Jeff Ourvan. "It's like watching grass grow -- it takes a long time." AARON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SCHOOL'S LAND USE REQUEST REJECTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members this week voted 4 to 1 to deny Brethren Christian 
School's request to use a vacant parcel of land for a temporary school and 
sports field. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they don't think it would be an appropriate use for the 
8.2-acre lot on the southwest corner of Cerritos Avenue and Walker Street, 
which is owned by First Church of the Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 The south side of the parcel, where Brethren proposed to set up a modular 
school and practice playing fields for three years, is not zoned for that, city 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Brethren's junior high school at 5172 Orange Ave. is overcrowded, the 
school wanted to house some students in a temporary facility on the Nazarene 
property until a permanent facility could be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis R. Brown, Brethren's president and superintendent, said: "We're in a 
position where we need a facility. We need to do something for our own 
existence and we want to stay in Cypress." The council's action, he said, 
"places us in a difficult situation." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; COMMERCIAL FILMED AT STATE PARK BEACH

<P>
 What looked like a battle Thursday between two groups of warriors on the beach 
at Crystal Cove State Park was actually a film crew shooting a commercial for a 
Japanese noodle company. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of about 100 actors, dressed as cavemen, and camera operators spent 
two days on the beach at the state park about 500 yards north of cottages while 
shooting the commercial for the Nissin Food company, according to a park 
spokesman.A Los Angeles-based production company did the film shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Ito, the state parks superintendent for the Orange Coast district, said 
residents' concerns that the filming was destroying natural habitat on the 
bluffs and the beach turned out to be unfounded. The production company had the 
proper permits and also paid an off-duty park ranger $30 an hour to monitor the 
film shoot for two days, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, there was no damage to the resource," Ito said after visiting 
the site Thursday. "The film crew was very cooperative and complied with all 
the requirements of the permit. They did everything right."LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GROUP PLANS CANCER INFORMATION PUSH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society-Orange County region plans to set up new satellite 
offices countywide in an attempt to reach more people with information about 
cancer prevention and detection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that in our Orange County unit, we were only reaching people 
within a 12-mile radius of our office in Santa Ana," said Margaret Edwards, 
American Cancer Society spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society plans to set up community information centers and 
small satellite offices in cities across Orange County in hospitals, business 
parks, shopping centers, churches and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to move our staff out into satellite community centers, so that 
in all parts of the county we'll have facilities close to the people who need 
the services," said George Hedley, member of the board of directors and vice 
president of administration. "By each community having their own center, we can 
focus on their needs and not the whole county's needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization plans to open six satellite offices in north, south, central 
and west county areas this year, Edwards said. Each office would be 
self-governed by a board of directors and oversee its own operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, our goal is to have one in every community," Hedley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Services will include support group meetings, breast and prostate cancer 
education, stop-smoking classes, patient transportation to medical 
appointments, early prevention and detection measures, and nutrition 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, an information center is expected to open at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. It will complement the hospital's own 
cancer services, which include the Orange County Regional Cancer Center, a 
nonprofit organization established for the purpose of furthering cancer 
research and education, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about the cancer society creating a unit here to be associated 
with our Orange County Regional Cancer Center," said Dr. Terence O'Heany, who 
specializes in gynecology and is interim director of the oncology program. 
"What this means is we can develop a comprehensive program where the patient 
can have everything done on this campus." 
</P>
<P>
 An information center in a medical building near Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo already provides some informational and 
referral services, said Gloria Ruston, American Cancer Society district 
representative for South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruston said the cancer society is in need of donated space for satellite 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 While more than 10,000 volunteers currently are involved with the local 
American Cancer Society, Hedley said more people are needed to carry out the 
plan to reach the public with its services and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to reach more people with less staff people and more volunteers," 
Edwards said. "We're trying to increase the volunteer base by 15% this year. 
People can give as little or as much as they want. But whatever they give, it 
will make a difference. The donation of time is an invaluable resource for us."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MEXICAN AMERICAN GROUP ELECTS LEADERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Santa Ana residents and community leaders were elected this week to 
represent the newly formed Orange County chapter of the Mexican American 
Political Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's president is Rueben Martinez, who organized the local chapter and 
is the owner of the Martinez-Hernandez Bookcase in downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 53, was designated by Gov. Pete Wilson as Orange County's "Small 
Businessman of the Year" in 1992. He serves as a volunteer in schools 
throughout the county, where he speaks and reads to children in an effort to 
motivate them to learn and stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 He was chairman of the Orange County Leukemia Society in 1988 and has worked 
on numerous Democratic presidential, mayoral, senatorial and gubernatorial 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as MAPA president, his goal is to stand up for the rights of 
immigrants, push voter registration and speak out against hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work for progress" and promote Latino activism in politics, 
education and civil rights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nativo V. Lopez, the executive director of Hermandad Mexicana of Orange 
County, is MAPA's first vice chairman and M. Esther Fonseca, an attorney in the 
county public defender's office, is second vice chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Enriqueta Ramos, a Rancho Santiago Community College District trustee and 
Spanish and Chicano studies professor at Cypress College, was chosen treasurer. 
Judy Perry, a community activist and employee in the counseling and financial 
aid offices at Cal State Fullerton, is the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Alvarez, a Rancho Santiago College student, was elected as MAPA's 
youth organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the community pretty much covered," Ramos said. "I'm very excited 
about this group." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said more than 70 people have already joined the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 One of MAPA's main goals will be to get Latinos registered to vote and "learn 
that we can make a difference," Ramos said.MIMI KO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; COPTER SAVES 2 BOYS TRAPPED BY RATTLESNAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brian Rushton and John Norris had an excellent adventure right above their own 
back yard Thursday when the teen-agers were airlifted to safety after being 
trapped on a hillside by two diamondback rattlesnakes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-olds climbed up a hillside above their homes on Mission Tierra 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Brian go up there a lot," John said. "We go up and hang out at a big 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before noon, the youths heard the sound of a car crash and bounded 
down the hillside to get a good look at the accident on Balboa Avenue, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as they got bored with watching the firefighters work and decided to head 
back home, they heard a rattle about 5 feet in front of them, John said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like snakes," Brian said. "I never have and I never will." 
</P>
<P>
 John, shaken by the sound, fled down the hill until a 6-foot-deep drainage 
ditch blocked his way.  
</P>
<P>
 He grabbed a branch above the culvert and hung there while Brian tried to pull 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian couldn't reach his friend, so he advised him to drop into the culvert 
and follow it uphill where they could meet and find another way down.  
</P>
<P>
 As Brian climbed back up the hill, he ran into a second snake, and at that 
point both boys became too frightened to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too steep to get down, and our path was blocked by snakes," John said. 
</P>
<P>
 John then began waving his arms at the firefighters below, who heard him 
calling for help and ran halfway up the hill to speak with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters dispatched an air rescue helicopter that arrived about 45 minutes 
later and carried the boys off the hillside to a soccer field on Balboa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting at the end when we knew we were going to be OK, but the time 
between when we heard snakes and heard the helicopter, well, I don't want to 
get into that," Brian said. "We were shaking and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Norris, John's father, said the boys are usually allowed up on the 
hillside during the months when snakes hibernate, and he didn't expect the 
reptiles to return so early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said this is definitely the last time the young hikers will be up 
there this year. CHIP JOHNSONSNAKES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BUDDHIST FEDERATION TO JOIN CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans by the Los Angeles Buddhist Federation, a Japanese-American group of 
seven Downtown congregations, to join the annual inter-ethnic celebration of 
Buddha's birthday this year have won praise from two temple leaders in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Japanese Buddhist clergy outside Little Tokyo have taken part in 
past communitywide observances, this year the federation volunteered to act as 
co-host for Sunday's event in Downtown Los Angeles with the multiethnic 
Buddhist Sangha Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful for people to come together, and it's good for 
outsiders to see this unity," said the Venerable Sumanatissa Barua, a spokesman 
for the Wat Thai Temple in North Hollywood. He estimated that about 50 monks 
and lay people will go from the Thai temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting," said the Rev. Kakyue Tada of the San Fernando Valley 
Hongwanji Buddhist Temple in Pacoima. "I'm looking forward to attending if time 
permits." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 500,000 people in Southern California observe Buddha's birthday 
on various dates in the spring because of differing traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Buddhists mark the birthday 2,500 years ago of Gautama Buddha, or 
Hanamatsuri, around April 8, but Buddhists of other ethnic traditions observe 
Wesak, which commemorates both the birthday and Enlightenment, around the time 
of the full moon in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although congregations pick convenient weekend dates to have their own 
observances, the Sangha Council sought each year to choose one date for all 
groups to celebrate together. But the council had been unable to persuade 
federation representatives to participate in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 But early this year, the Rev. Gyoken Kuroyanagi of the Nichiren Shu Temple in 
Los Angeles approached the Venerable Havanpola Ratanasara, director of the 
Sangha Council, to suggest that a common Buddha's birthday celebration be held 
April 3 at the Japanese-American Cultural Center. Coincidentally, the program 
will fall on the same day Catholics and Protestants celebrate Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons the Japanese-American federation had shown little interest in 
pan-Buddhist observances before, Kuroyanagi said, "are very complicated. It is 
a hard question." 
</P>
<P>
 The Venerable Karuna Dharma, an associate of Ratanasara, said the reluctance 
may be partly because Japanese Buddhism, especially the federation, is the 
oldest Buddhist community in Southern California and its leaders haven't felt 
the need to take part in inter-Buddhist events. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's changing now because a lot of young ministers are interested in 
reaching out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tada, whose Pacoima temple dedicated a new building in 1992, is a member of 
the Sangha Council and has usually attended the communitywide observances. If 
he misses it this year, it will be because his temple holds its own Hanamatsuri 
festival on Sunday starting at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The inter-ethnic celebration Downtown is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The program includes a parade at noon and a religious service at 1 p.m. JOHN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; ROLLER HOCKEY FINDS FRIENDS ON COUNCIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Roller hockey enthusiasts have won support from the City Council in their 
effort to remedy the chronic lack of facilities for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 this week to try to solve a local roller hockey 
club's most pressing problem: the Capistrano Unified School District's ban on 
roller skating on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members held off on the district's request to enact a citywide 
anti-skating law and will invite school officials to join a task force that 
will explore a permanent home for youth roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mission Viejo has the reputation of being a mecca of youth sports in Southern 
California," said Mike Dashefsky, who coaches two roller hockey teams in the 
city that play in tournaments throughout the region. "However, there are 
substandard roller hockey facilities in Mission Viejo. . . . To deny the youth 
a place to play would be a travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Local roller hockey players are practicing in facilities that are about 
one-third the size of regulation rinks, said team officials. Unsanctioned 
pickup games are held on the playgrounds of some Mission Viejo schools. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say that the district is self-insured, and that allowing 
roller hockey could pose a legal risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I saw a roller hockey game (at a Capistrano district school) I would ask 
them to stop," said Dan Crawford, district director of facilities. "We're 
prohibiting any type of roller blading including roller hockey. Obviously, it's 
a problem of liability." 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Sharon Cody voted against establishing the task force because 
she wanted the council to take stronger action than sending an invitation to 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district shares the use of some public parks owned by the city that adjoin 
school property. Cody suggested that the city could make joint use a bargaining 
chip to get the district to soften its stance on roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would basically ban (roller hockey) from the city" if the anti-skating law 
were enacted, Cody said. FRANK MESSINA

 The victim, Jose Trinidad Verela Aguilar, 30, of Mexico, had darted through 
South Coast Highway's two northbound lanes and was crossing the southbound

 A physician who witnessed the accident performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
on Aguilar until paramedics arrived. He was then flown to South Coast Medical 
Center, where he was pronounced dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the vehicle, a 34-year-old man, was not detained, police Sgt. 
Greg Bartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood samples from both the driver -- who volunteered to take the test -- and 
the victim will determine whether either had been drinking, Bartz said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; POLICE RADAR SPEED TRAILER USE PLANNED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to get speeders to slow down, the Police Department will place 
its radar speed trailer in several spots throughout the city for a month 
beginning Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 The trailer will sit for 24 hours at a time in 20 locations.Drivers will see 
the speed they are driving displayed by the trailer as they pass, police said. 
Police are not planning to have officers stationed at the site for the full 
time the trailer is in use. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar trailers will also post the legal speed limits in the area, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailer will be at the following locations: 16161 Parkside Lane on Sunday; 
17th Street near Acacia Avenue on Tuesday; Main Street in front of Huntington 
Beach High School on Wednesday; Adams Avenue at Lotus Lane April 10; 
Indianapolis Avenue east of Ives Lane April 11; Heil Avenue east of Monroe 
Avenue April 12; Delaware Street south of the Boys and Girls Club April 13; 
McFadden Avenue west of Electronic Lane April 17, and 12 other places until May 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailer serves as "an educational tool to let people know how fast they're 
actually driving and see for themselves what we would see through a radar gun," 
Sgt. T.R. Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said when most speeders see their speed flash on the trailer, they tend to 
"dramatically slow down." MIMI KO

 The City Council this week gave preliminary approval to an ordinance that will 
allow second units to be added to residential lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, any of the city's 9,054 single-family residences might be 
allowed to add an extra unit to the property. The units must be occupied by 
family of the owner.  
</P>
<P>
 The second units might not be allowed in areas where parking is too limited or 
where lots are too small. 
</P>
<P>
 After city planners come up with recommendations regarding lot size, potential 
traffic problems and possible restrictions, the council will consider taking 
final action on the ordinance, officials said.MIMI KO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MTA CRITICIZED OVER RAIL LINE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley-based transit official has accused the county 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority of dragging its feet on securing federal 
funding for a Valley rail line, but planners said Thursday that the process is 
on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter last week to MTA chief Franklin E. White, alternate board director 
Nick Patsaouras expressed unhappiness with the agency's progress in applying 
for federal funds for a rail line from Universal City to Woodland Hills.He said 
the agency has not initiated studies that would move along the effort to 
receive federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly believe staff is neglecting the (Valley) east-west line. . . . 
What is going on?" Patsaouras wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA planners said Thursday that the line remains a priority and noted that 
they cannot formally submit a request for federal funds until the MTA board 
decides what form the rail line will take: an elevated railway along the 
Ventura Freeway median or a subway beneath Burbank and Chandler boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not dragging our feet. We cannot 'federalize' a line until the final 
alignment is determined," MTA analyst Judith Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on a route is expected this summer, after completion of engineering 
feasibility studies for the two proposed lines. HENRY CHU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CHILDREN GET PREVIEW OF COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smiling and clutching his friend's hand, Atyah Hadaddin, 6, marched and 
skipped through Rancho Santiago College along with 2,000 other gleeful 
kindergarten students as part of a fair promoting higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tour Thursday, Atyah said he looked forward to attending Rancho 
Santiago some day in preparation for a career as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 College "makes you study hard. It makes you be something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atyah and other students from dozens of local schools visited the campus for 
"KinderCaminata," an event designed to encourage children and their parents to 
plan for a college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Los Amigos of Orange County, the Santa Ana Unified School 
District and the Rancho Santiago College District, the fair also emphasized 
that college is within everyone's reach, said Galal Kernahan, who helped 
organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether (the children) remember this or not, the very fact that they're here 
sends a message to their parents, their families and the community" that higher 
education is available for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're planting a seed today that in 12 years is going to flourish and we'll 
see them back here at Rancho," said Enriqueta Ramos, a member of the college 
Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 During the event, children wore colorful shirts that said, "Si, se puede," 
Spanish for "Yes, it can be done," as well as paper tags stating what career 
they would like to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 They also watched folk dancers perform in brightly hued costumes and talked 
with firefighters, doctors, teachers, police officers and representatives of 
other professions who stressed the importance of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching colored helium balloons, the children later marched and skipped 
through the campus to a musical performance and lunch. Several students said 
the visit made them think more about continuing education and about possible 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Guerrero, 5, said she wants to become a nurse "because I like nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that college would be fun because "you can learn and then you 
can do things good." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see they really want to do something when they grow up," said 
Alma Buis, minority affairs officer for the Fullerton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "We should do more of these, because they're really going to 
remember this. It's going to have an impact."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THREATEN TO STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Classified employees in the Orange Unified School District are threatening to 
strike following a school board vote approving a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract cuts health benefits, imposes furloughs and empowers the district 
to unilaterally force layoffs and hour reductions without negotiating with the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 Union employees vow they will continue picketing district headquarters until 
April 7, when the membership is expected to reject the contract. At the same 
meeting, the union's 1,160 members will decide whether to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Becky Mayers called the contract "ludicrous" and said a strike 
is likely unless the district modifies the contract. The union is made up of 
the district's non-teaching employees, including bus drivers and maintenance, 
food service and clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a jampacked meeting last week, the school board voted 6 to 1 to impose a 
new contract concluding 11 months of labor negotiations between the district 
and the classified employees' union. The contract requires employees to take 
three furlough days and to pay more money to maintain current levels of health 
benefits for themselves and dependents. The contract will save the district 
$484,113. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials are particularly angry over a contract provision absolving the 
district from negotiating "either the decision or the impact of a layoff or 
reduction in hours." MARTIN MILLER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; JURY MULLS MURDER, ROBBERY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With attorneys on both sides agreeing that the sole issue is eyewitness 
identification, a jury began deliberations Thursday in the case of a Pacoima 
man charged in a series of supermarket robberies, one of which led to the death 
of a soft-drink salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-week trial, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury is weighing a murder 
charge and 20 counts of robbery against Jose Santillan, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan and two other men who authorities say fled to Mexico are suspected 
in a six-week crime spree that ended with the execution-style slaying of Robert 
Ward Jr., a 28-year-old Coca-Cola representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward was talking on the phone with his fiancee -- apparently unaware that a 
robbery was under way -- when a gunman walked up to him and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels admitted that Santillan is not the man who 
fired the fatal shot but argued that he is nevertheless legally responsible for 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward was killed during an early-morning robbery on Oct. 19, 1992, at the 
Ralphs supermarket at Sherman Way and Woodman Avenue in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan is accused of participating in eight robberies at seven stores.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ralphs where Ward was gunned down was robbed twice in a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, two people who were in the store when Ward was killed 
identified Santillan as one of the robbers.  
</P>
<P>
 Another witness said he saw Santillan in the parking lot moments after the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, four other people who were in the store during the crime were unable 
to identify Santillan as being present, a point stressed by defense attorney 
Dennis G. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to say whether these eyewitness identifications are accurate . . . 
beyond a reasonable doubt and a moral certainty," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution produced no physical evidence linking Santillan to the crimes.

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DIETETIC GROUP SEEKS MOORHEAD'S SUPPORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Rep. Carlos Moorhead, touring a Burbank food bank Thursday, 
criticized President Clinton's health care plan as impractical but said that 
including nutrition therapy in any plan would save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead had been invited to Burbank by the Los Angeles chapter of the 
California Dietetic Assn., which wants his support for including the services 
of a registered dietitian among those covered by a national health care 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The group supports the use of medical nutrition therapy -- a way of using diet 
to prevent serious health problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Bettye Nowlin, a legislative coordinator for the group, said that they are 
trying to ensure that the therapy is included somehow in any health care reform 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherie Combs, executive director of the Burbank Temporary Aid Center, showed 
Moorhead the empty plastic containers of cottage cheese that are used as bowls 
and demonstrated World War II army surplus can openers, which are not much 
bigger than a fingernail. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, the food bank had a budget of $80,000, which has grown to 
$290,000 today, Combs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, with the community in Burbank, the (hunger) problem is getting 
worse," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead suggested that Combs work with local churches to raise more money. ED

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY STUDYING COSTS OF ANNEXING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have begun a new study to determine how much it would cost to 
annex the Santa Ana Heights area. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the results of the study, the city could begin the process of 
securing the unincorporated area just south of Costa Mesa as part of Newport 
Beach later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Santa Ana Heights residents have pushed for the annexation. They said it 
would bring the neighborhood improved emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials are concerned that the move might end up costing hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 A city study completed in 1992 found that providing services to Santa Ana 
Heights would cost about $725,000 a year, said Kenneth J. Delino, the assistant 
city manager. The area would generate about $425,000 in revenues to the city, 
leaving an annual deficit of about $300,000, Delino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Annexation would also make it necessary for the city to build a new fire 
station and purchase a new police car, street sweeper and trash truck -- at a 
total cost of more than $2 million, Delino said. Currently, Santa Ana Heights 
is served by the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the Orange County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Delino said the fire station and new equipment would be used in areas of 
the city beyond Santa Ana Heights, so residents there should not bear all the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't need a fire station just for Santa Ana Heights," Delino said. 
"Our coverage is (already) spread thin in some areas, and (the annexation) 
would exceed the threshold. It would be the straw that broke the camel's back." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to close the annexation deficit by requesting money from 
the county's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city decides to proceed with the annexation, officials will negotiate 
with the county to divide sales tax revenues generated in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Local Agency Formation Commission would have to approve the proposal. A 
vote by Santa Ana Heights residents would occur if significant opposition forms 
to the annexation. SHELBY GRAD

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; JURY TO WEIGH DEATH PENALTY FOR KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although a prosecutor urged the death penalty for a parolee convicted of 
murdering an armored car guard, a defense attorney said Thursday that life in 
prison would be an appropriate punishment for the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Superior Court jury is scheduled to begin deliberations Monday in 
the penalty phase of Sean Darnell Slade's murder trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The same panel that will decide Slade's fate convicted him in the 
execution-style murder of armored courier Edwin Maldonado during a July 29, 
1992, robbery at a Home Depot store in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society shows its value for life by how it treats those . . . who take that 
life," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas said during his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor reminded jurors that Slade, 27, admitted that he would deserve 
the death penalty if he had ambushed Maldonado after the guard had picked up 
$82,000 in receipts from the hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Jonas said, Slade has denied he had any role in the robbery-murder, 
blaming the judge, jury, prosecutor and mother of another man he killed for his 
arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiming to demonstrate that Slade is a menace to society, Jonas cited testimony 
of a woman Slade was dating in 1987 when he admittedly gunned down Howard Baker 
during a dispute over drugs and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Bradford testified Tuesday that after killing Baker, Slade first 
slept, then wanted to have sex, then ate breakfast as he gloated over the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't care," Bradford said. "He was calm; he was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't imagine that someone I cared about could be so evil," said 
Bradford, who added that Slade threatened to kill her and her family if she did 
not lie in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Baker killing and served about 
four years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
 He was paroled only 25 days before Maldonado was ambushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill avoided the details of the two shootings and 
focused on any "lingering doubt" the jury may have about convicting Slade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you that sure?" Hill asked as he read off the names of 23 people he said 
were wrongfully convicted and executed in the United States since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death is an absolute punishment and should be imposed only if you're 
absolutely certain," said Hill, who argued that life in prison means Slade will 
forever live in a cell about the size of a small bathroom. THOM MROZEK

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; RUPTURED GAS MAIN FORCES EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 150 residents were evacuated Thursday morning from homes spanning a 
five-block area after cable TV workers severed a high-pressure gas main -- 
sending a plume of natural gas 30 feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were digging up asphalt on East California Avenue about 8:30 a.m. when 
their equipment cut through a four-inch-diameter natural gas line that provides 
service to 100 gas company customers, said Norman Williams, district manager 
for Southern California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 firefighters, 10 police officers, a helicopter and several ambulances 
were called to the scene, Fire Department Battalion Chief Mike Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas company workers stopped the leak about four hours later, after they 
drilled through the asphalt on either end of the rupture to pinch off the line 
using a large hydraulic press.  
</P>
<P>
 Evacuees from 21 buildings surrounding the rupture were escorted by 
firefighters down the street to the YMCA on North Louise Street, where they 
were served coffee and doughnuts by Red Cross volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Veda Lane, who lives on the corner of California Avenue and Louise Street, 
said she was having a cup of coffee when firefighters banged on her door and 
asked her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some confusion among my neighbors. I just didn't want anything to 
blow up," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were allowed to return home about four hours later after 
firefighters conducted a search of neighborhood residences to ensure pockets of 
gas were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews restored gas service by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said because the ruptured line was backed up by a high-pressure valve, 
shooting the gas straight into the air, there was a limited danger of an 
explosion or fire.  
</P>
<P>
 If wind had been present, however, officials would have been forced to 
evacuate a much larger area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although natural gas is invisible, the leak was clearly visible throughout the 
city for several hours because dust particles clung to the gas as it escaped 
from the line. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters of Orange County will hold a free educational forum 
on the various health care reform proposals Wednesday at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, "Citizens' Voice for Citizens' Choice: A Campaign for a Public 
Voice on Health Care," will explain the various health care plans being 
considered by Congress and the potential impact each may have on people's 
lives, league members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to understand their options so they can make their voices 
heard as to what they want in the way of health care reform," said Marilyn 
Dettmann, a league spokeswoman. "We're not promoting advocacy on any reform 
plan. Our purpose is to educate." 
</P>
<P>
 Local congressional representatives will be at the meeting and will take 
questions from the audience, expected to reach 900 people. Those interested in 
attending must make reservations by calling (714) 647-7101. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SIBERIAN STUDENTS VISIT HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volodia Glinsky and 13 other students from Siberia experienced education -- 
American style -- at Garden Grove High School during their weeklong tour of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Volodia, 13, said he loved his visit and the people he met in the last few 
days. He said the people were funny with "so many smiles." 
</P>
<P>
 Volodia said learning about the cultural differences between his country and 
the United States has been fascinating. For example, he noticed that 
Californians appear to have a unique predilection for driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting that there's so many cars and so few people. In Siberia we 
have less cars and more people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through interpreters, the Russians also offered their impressions of their 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the American people. I didn't expect to get such hospitality," said 
Yulia Kolchina, 16. "It's very easy to socialize with them." 
</P>
<P>
 She said such cultural exchanges are important "to get to know each other 
better and know more about our countries. They help bring our countries 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Yulia and her companions said that they liked almost everything about 
California, that the people are nice, the theme parks fun, and the food, well. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 They said they are used to diets with lots of vegetables and soups, and 
although they never criticized the bulkier U.S. cuisine, several giggled when 
asked to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's . . . interesting," one girl offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the daylong tour at the high school, the Russians talked with 
students and experienced a typical day in school, including classes and lunch 
in the cafeteria. While visiting math, literature and biology classes, the 
Russians answered questions from their U.S. counterparts about their hometown 
of Novosibirsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoya Bobomolova, 51, a chaperon, confirmed local students' perception that, 
yes, Siberia does get chilly. She showed a photo of herself standing in a 
wooded area blanketed with snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that she wore little in the photo besides jogging shorts and a tank 
top, students asked how cold it was, and were shocked to learn it was 22 
degrees below zero. They seemed interested to learn that Siberian residents 
experience such harsh weather during the winter and that summer temperatures 
reach into the 80s and 90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahzeah Babylon, 17, a senior at Garden Grove High, said she appreciated the 
visit and that such exchanges help eliminate stereotypes because many people in 
the United States believe Russians are staid, serious and humorless. 
</P>
<P>
 She said some people think "they have no feelings. But they're just like us. 
The only thing that separates them and us is the ocean."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FIRE DISPATCHERS' BENEFITS MAY BE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER and MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire department dispatchers for five north Orange County cities are about to 
change employers, a change that could reduce their benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of June 30, the 17 dispatchers for North Net, the alliance of the 
Anaheim, Buena Park, Fullerton, Garden Grove and Orange fire departments, will 
be laid off by the city of Orange, their current employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately they will become the responsibility of Anaheim, although that city 
is considering having a private, outside firm become their direct employer. The 
net cities would then pay the firm for the dispatchers' services. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatchers say that if they are transferred to the private firm, they 
will be removed from the state municipal employee retirement system, forced to 
pay the Social Security tax that private sector employees pay and lose five 
vacation days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their union spokesman said that will cause the best dispatchers to leave the 
network for other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would they stay in Anaheim for this kind of money when they could go to 
Los Angeles or anywhere and make a lot more?" said Larry Lykins, spokesman for 
the Orange County Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim City Council will make the final decision April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Fire Chief Jeffrey Bowman said: "I'm preparing a study that will cover 
the merits of both sides. Don't even know yet which system we are going to 
recommend." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the dispatchers from Orange to Anaheim is being done primarily to keep 
North Net's communication center operating in case of a major flood, Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is currently located in the basement of an Orange Fire Department 
building next to the Santa Ana River. When Anaheim takes over, the dispatchers 
will be moved to a room inside Anaheim City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I have been here, I have been asking this question: 'Why would you 
put a fire dispatch center in the basement of a building next to the Santa Ana 
River?' " Bowman said. "If there had ever been a flood, we would have been out 
of business." TERRY SPENCER and MARTIN MILLER

BREAKING CAMP FOR HOMELESS; EVICTION: RESIDENTS OF ENCAMPMENT BESIDE THE SAN 
DIEGO FREEWAY COLLECT POSSESSIONS AND GET READY TO MOVE TO PARTS UNKNOWN. THE 
SQUATTERS MUST LEAVE BY SUNDAY, CALTRANS OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Red peppers? Yes? No?" Bare-chested and slightly out of breath, Dale Worley 
held out a half-empty jar at arm's length, waiting for a verdict. His friend 
Don Wilson stared at it for a moment, then shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, no sense taking all that stuff. It ain't like we're going to have 
anywhere to put it," Wilson said. "But keep the hot sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 The two homeless men spent Thursday painstakingly sorting through their 
possessions -- agonizing over what to leave behind and how much to carry to 
parts unknown. After three years of living in a homeless encampment beside the 
San Diego Freeway, the pair and a dozen others are being evicted from the 
state-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation officials say the homeless people must 
leave by Sunday so they can landscape the area as part of a $929,652 highway 
beautification project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," Wilson said, seated on a well-worn sofa beneath his tent. 
"What we'd been trying to do here is exist. What little bit we had, people 
took." 
</P>
<P>
 A church missionary in Westminster has offered the men temporary shelter. But 
it is only for the short term, Wilson said. It will only be a matter of time 
before he and his friends find themselves back on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any alternatives," he said. "Most of the shelters only let you 
stay for a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 The men tried unsuccessfully to fight their evictions through the legal 
system; a lawyer won them a temporary reprieve March 18. But 10 days later, 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert E. Thomas gave Caltrans the go-ahead 
to evict the men, voicing concerns about safety and sanitation at the 
encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision makes Wilson's blood boil. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're spending thousands and thousands of dollars to clear out these bushes 
so homeless people won't have any place to sleep," Wilson said angrily. "It has 
nothing to do with ecology or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said the men were squatters and did not have permission to 
be there. Spokeswoman Rose Orem said the camp was also a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found some very unsanitary conditions there that could have caused some 
harm to them," Orem said. "They dug a hole that was their latrine area, so now 
we have to contact a hazardous materials company to come and clean that out and 
dispose of the byproducts." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the homeless men said they emptied the latrine regularly and took the 
waste up to the garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to stay clean when you don't have toilets and showers at your 
disposal," said 40-year-old Frank Murphy, a Vietnam vet who became homeless 1 
1/2 years ago when he was fired from his handyman's job and ran out of money. 
"We did the best we could." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is invisible from the street, hidden from view by thriving acacia and 
oleander bushes next to the Beach Boulevard ramp to the San Diego Freeway. A 
dirt path meanders through the thicket to a shady, tranquil clearing. An 
American flag draped in front of one tent greets visitors.  
</P>
<P>
 The elaborate furnishings inside are a testament to the care that went into 
the homes. Some have closets, dressers, couches, recliners, vanity areas and 
other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless men -- and occasionally women -- had coexisted with the community 
at large in relative peace for more than three years. By day, they pushed 
shopping carts through the neighborhood collecting recyclable cans. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, neighboring businesses began complaining to police about an 
increase in car break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach police say they contacted Caltrans to clear the brush from 
the area to discourage the homeless from living there. They said they believed 
some of the transients were responsible for some of the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lt. Charles Poe said it was the residents of a neighboring camp -- 
not the one facing eviction -- that caused police to contact Caltrans. "We have 
never arrested anybody in this particular camp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One camp resident, 38-year-old Craig Fritts, said it is unfair to blame him 
for the crimes committed by other homeless people. On Thursday afternoon, he 
flipped through a stack of snapshots, reminiscing about happier times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like one big family," he sighed. "Now it's gone."

MANY BARELY BEAT STATE DEADLINE FOR QUAKE AID; CANOGA PARK: DISASTER 
UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE OFFERS CASH PAYMENTS TO OWNERS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiny Bernice Marcus, 64, and Rose Altmark, who admits only to being "over 60," 
looked out of place at the Canoga Park unemployment office Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, we're here to apply for DUA. Which line is that?" Marcus asked a 
security guard, pulling herself up to her full height of maybe 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what DUA stands for," added Altmark, her equally diminutive 
friend of 30 years, "but it's because of the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, DUA stands for Disaster Unemployment Assistance, a U.S. Department of 
Labor program administered by local California Employment Development 
Department (EDD) offices like the one in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides weekly cash benefits following a disaster to owners of 
small businesses like Marcus and Altmark, both of West Hills, and others -- who 
are ineligible for regular state unemployment benefits. The payments are 
retroactive to Jan. 23, when DUA went into effect six days after the Northridge 
quake, and continue up to 26 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was officially the last day to apply for the benefits. Individuals 
can still sign up for the program through July 23, according to a Labor 
Department spokeswoman, but applicants must have a good reason for not applying 
by March 31, such as illness or injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of people showed up at the EDD office on Vanowen Street in Canoga Park 
to beat Thursday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Yamanaka, manager of the Canoga Park EDD office, said the 15 EDD offices 
that serve the San Fernando Valley and its environs -- 12 in Los Angeles County 
and three in Ventura County -- had received 8,316 DUA applications by March 26. 
The Canoga Park office alone had received 2,554. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that many of those claims were filed by people who were only out of 
work for a week or two because of the quake. "The total figures look massive 
and they are, but a lot of those people are now back at work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the disaster-unemployment claims are being forwarded to a special Labor 
Department unit in Sacramento, which decides who is eligible for the aid and 
how much. 
</P>
<P>
 DUA payments generally range from $40 to $230 a week depending on income 
level, the same as regular unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who waited half an hour or more in the D line -- for Disaster 
-- to sign up for unemployment aid said they had just learned of the DUA 
program this week when they went to apply for other quake relief from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 They included Marcus, who keeps the books for her husband's tool business 
based in their quake-damaged home. Altmark and her husband own a wholesale 
novelty business in Canoga Park, Buttons 'N Bears, which sells personalized, 
campaign-style buttons and stuffed animals. The Altmarks had to close their 
store for several weeks after the quake because of structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so lucky. We just heard about this DUA program yesterday," Rose 
Altmark marveled. "It's a pity it isn't more widely known," Marcus added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamanaka said information about the unemployment program has been available at 
disaster centers in the area since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "As many claims as we've processed already, it's hard to believe there is 
anybody still out there to apply," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Al Rematch, a free-lance writer who also lives in West Hills, said he lucked 
out too. "I didn't know it was the last day. I just decided to come in."  
</P>
<P>
 Rematch said he would use his unemployment benefits to fix his home computer, 
which still works but has developed some new quirks since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Bedigian of Encino said she would also put her money into repairing or 
replacing computers -- as much as $60,000 worth -- for use in the 
desktop-publishing business she runs out of her garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all came down in the quake," Bedigian said, adding that she started to 
apply for DUA last week but didn't have all the necessary documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was amazed when they called me to say today was the last day, which was 
really nice," Bedigian said. "I'm hoping the money will go a long way toward 
helping me rebuild my electronic disaster."

EPA DENIES PERMIT FOR WASTE BURNER; ENVIRONMENT: FOES OF THE HIGH DESERT 
FACILITY APPLAUD THE DECISION. NATIONAL CEMENT SAYS IT WILL APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making good on a threat, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday 
denied a permit for continued hazardous waste incineration at the National 
Cement Co. kiln.  
</P>
<P>
 If it stands on appeal, the decision will be a victory for longtime foes of 
the incinerator, described by EPA as the only operating commercial hazardous 
waste burner in California or three other states in the agency's western 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laud the EPA for doing the right thing and stopping this gross 
transgression of our desert environment," said Joe Blackburn of Desert Citizens 
Against Pollution, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement, which uses a blend of conventional fuel and spent solvents to 
fire the kiln, will appeal the denial to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board, 
said the firm's chief operating officer Michel Plagnol. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plagnol voiced pessimism, noting that the appeals board "is itself part of 
EPA . . . (and) may just confirm the decision which has already been made." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement caps a convoluted and increasingly bitter dispute between 
National Cement and its landlord, Tejon Ranch, that figured prominently in 
rejection of the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 For a dozen years, National and prior operators of the kiln have conducted two 
businesses at once -- making cement and burning hazardous waste -- on property 
leased from Tejon Ranch near the Los Angeles-Kern county line. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its old permit expired in 1991, National has been allowed to continue 
burning waste while state and federal authorities reviewed its renewal 
application. But it ran afoul of a federal requirement that owners of hazardous 
waste sites, as well as their operators, vouch for the accuracy of permit 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Tejon officials refused to sign the application, saying they took no part in 
preparing it and couldn't truthfully swear to its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 To break the impasse, Tejon and National negotiated a tentative agreement on 
sale of the kiln site to National. 
</P>
<P>
 But National backed out, saying certain sale conditions were too onerous. The 
firm then asked EPA to waive the signature rule -- arguing that it should not 
have to buy the property until assured all other aspects of the permit would 
meet with EPA approval. 
</P>
<P>
 However, EPA refused to continue reviewing the application without a 
landowner's signature, and formally proposed to deny it last October. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, prior to the final decision, Tejon signed and submitted a 
modified statement of responsibility, saying it had done so under legal threats 
from National Cement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tejon statement did not include the language specified by EPA 
requirements. "We don't have any reason to believe the EPA will accept this new 
language," Tejon President Jack Hunt said at the time. But at least "we can 
sign that language without perjuring ourself," Hunt said. Tejon Ranch is about 
30% owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials on Thursday cited the unacceptable language as the reason for 
denial, saying Tejon had merely acknowledged joint responsibility for complying 
with federal hazardous waste rules. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the agency said, owners and operators also must "certify that . . . 
the application was prepared under their supervision; the information presented 
in the application is true and accurate; and they are aware of the significant 
penalties associated with submitting false information." 
</P>
<P>
 The permit was denied because the "certification does not meet these 
requirements," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, the decision was "black and white" because of the "very 
explicit language" required for permit applications, said Jeffrey Zelikson, 
director of the hazardous waste division at EPA regional headquarters in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He said EPA chief Carol Browner's call for tougher scrutiny of waste 
combustion plants made it harder still to give National "the benefit of the 
doubt on the signature thing. . . . We discussed that in the course of making 
this decision," Zelikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has a very high expectation about how the agency is going to 
oversee these facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement is a subsidiary of Vicat, a large French cement concern. At 
the kiln site, liquid wastes are received and prepared by Systech Environmental 
Corp., which is owned by the even larger French cement maker Lafarge.

MALL FIRM FINED FOR LAUNDERING DONATIONS; CRIME: EX-MANAGER OF NORTHRIDGE 
FASHION CENTER ADMITS ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO BERNSON AND OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The firm that formerly managed the Northridge Fashion Center has agreed to pay 
an $87,000 fine after admitting that it made laundered campaign contributions 
to local politicians in San Diego and Los Angeles, including a $2,000 donation 
to Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, who represents the Northridge area, was not accused of wrongdoing in 
an accusation filed against the Yarmouth Group by the state's Fair Political 
Practices Commission, nor were the other lawmakers involved. Yarmouth is 
accused of making a total of $13,500 in illegal contributions to 11 lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York City-based company advises shopping mall investors and manages 
mall properties throughout California. Until this year, it managed the 
Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a stipulated agreement that the FPPC is expected to approve at 
its April 7 meeting, Bernson received contributions of $500 from each of four 
employees of Yarmouth in May, 1990. All four, including one of the firm's 
senior executives, Paul Wilson of Los Angeles, were subsequently reimbursed by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal under the California Political Reform Act to hide the source of 
campaign contributions, a practice called laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Los Angeles campaign-finance rules prohibit contributions of 
more than $500 from one source to a candidate for elected office. The proposed 
FPPC settlement "only addresses the state law violations, not any possible 
violation of local ordinances," said FPPC spokeswoman Jeanette Turvill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't comment," said Benjamin Bycel, head of the Los Angeles Ethics 
Commission, when asked if the commission, charged with enforcing local reform 
laws, would be investigating the Yarmouth matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson aide Francine Oschin said the councilman would not be available for 
comment until Monday. But she said she had no knowledge of the contributions 
and was certain that Bernson granted the company no favors for its financial 
help. "I know Hal Bernson and he's turned down campaign contributors time after 
time that were looking for help," Oschin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the Yarmouth executive, contended that the illegal way in which the 
contributions to Bernson and other lawmakers were made was the result of 
ignorance, not corrupt intent. "We were aware that the contributions had to be 
personal, not corporate, but we did not know that it would be wrong to be 
reimbursed," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said that Bernson and the other lawmakers were unaware of 
Yarmouth's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bernson case, Wilson said, the contributions were made because "we felt 
he was a good councilman for the district and we should support him." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing on the table before him or the council," Wilson added. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC stipulation also stated that Yarmouth made 44 illegal contributions, 
totaling $10,750, to eight San Diego City Council members and $750 to two San 
Jose council members. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, the FPPC report noted that Yarmouth made its contributions 
between October, 1989, and March 24, 1993. In April, 1992, Yarmouth introduced 
a preliminary plan to expand its Fashion Valley Mall in San Diego. That project 
is still pending before the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego and San Jose have laws barring single-source contributions greater 
than $250.

CALABASAS EXPECTS PAINLESS BUDGET PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike its older neighbors, the 3-year-old city of Calabasas is expected to 
skate through this year's budget process without having to make painful cuts or 
scrape for new revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect a $6.6-million spending plan for next fiscal year that 
is nearly identical to this year's budget, with a surplus of $735,000, 
according to budget guidelines approved at a special meeting of the City 
Council Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're newly incorporated, so we haven't issued any debt yet," said Calabasas 
Finance Director Sheila Cumberland. "Most of the (financial) problems cities 
are having are related to debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Although next year's budget probably won't include any debt, Cumberland said, 
the city may choose to borrow money in the near future if the council decides 
to build a parking structure near Old Town or undertake some other large 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will begin to change for us once we start to put our General Plan and 
the Old Town Master Plan into practice, and we really know where we're going," 
Cumberland said. "Right now, we're still finishing those things." 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines approved this week suggest that developing a draft budget by 
May 18 will be a low-key process, said City Manager Charles Cate, although a 
higher priority will be placed on some projects. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also hope to make major strides on plans for a gymnasium and 
community center, the Juan de Anza Park and the renovation of the Calabasas 
Tennis and Swim Club, most of which will be funded by Los Angeles County park 
bond money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other goals include putting into practice new zoning guides and plans for the 
renovation of Old Town, as well as the annexation of the Leonis Adobe, 
Sagebrush Cantina, Motion Picture and Television Fund and half of a housing 
tract on the northeast side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Agoura Hills, Los Angeles and other cities, Calabasas has been 
relatively unaffected by the regionwide economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the things we've had going for us is we started as a city 
after things had already slowed economically," said Mayor Marvin Lopata. 
"Things were slow, and we were just gearing up." KURT PITZER

STATE GRANT NUDGES DISNEYLAND RESORT PLANS FORWARD; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
$30-MILLION CONTRIBUTION WILL GO TOWARD CONSTRUCTION OF A $223-MILLION PARKING 
STRUCTURE IF EXPANSION PROJECT PROPOSED FOR ANAHEIM TAKES PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed expansion of Disneyland moved forward this week when the state 
formally agreed to contribute $30 million to the county's plan to build the 
world's largest parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission's grant will go toward the 
$223-million, 12,000-car structure that would be constructed by the county next 
to the park if Disney's proposed $3-billion Disneyland Resort expansion takes 
place. Gov. Pete Wilson had pledged the grant last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is one of the first Disney hopes government bodies at all levels -- 
federal, state, county and city -- will make to the expansion. Of the 
$3-billion estimated cost, Disney is asking that government contribute almost 
$800 million for such items as parking structures, sewers, streets and 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a step in the right direction," said Kenneth P. Wong, Disney 
Development Co.'s senior vice president. "But we still have a lot of work to 
do. But we are glad to see the governor's pledge was passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mills, the Orange County Transportation Authority's assistant executive 
officer, said her agency is proposing that of the $193 million in remaining 
cost for the structure, $131 million come from the federal government, $32 
million from the Orange County Transportation Authority, $20 million from 
Disney and $10 million from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The state money will come from savings on other transportation projects in the 
county, Mills said. The county "would not normally get that money back," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally the money would go back in the statewide funding pool," Mills said. 
"It's great that we get to keep that money here." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney says the government expenditures are justified because Westcot would 
add 24,000 jobs and billions of dollars to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve White, vice president of Anaheim HOME, a group of local residents 
opposed to the expansion, said Thursday he does not understand why Disney 
should receive government assistance. If Disney needs a parking structure, new 
streets or sewers, it should pay for them itself, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what could justify spending taxpayer funds to benefit a very 
profitable company," White said. "I was reading a magazine the other day and 
saw that (Disney Chairman) Michael Eisner got paid $208 million last year. The 
company sounds pretty healthy to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The structure would be connected directly to the Santa Ana Freeway and allow 
park-goers to get into and out of the resort without using Anaheim streets. 
Construction of the seven-story building tentatively is scheduled to begin in 
1996, about a year after construction of the resort is scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed structure's bottom floor would be a mass transit center, with bus 
and train stops and parking spaces reserved for park-and-ride commuters. The 
other six floors would be used by Disneyland visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the Disneyland Resort would include 5,600 hotel rooms, an 
amphitheater, a seven-acre lake, a shopping district and a new theme park next 
to Disneyland called Westcot. It is tentatively scheduled to open in 1998.

<P>
 A man shot to death in the hallway of a boarding house this week has been 
identified as 39-year-old Viliulfo Pahua of Santa Ana, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pahua was helping someone move into the boarding house, in the 1400 block of 
West Cubbon Street, on Tuesday afternoon when he was shot several times in the 
head during an attempted home-invasion robbery, said Sgt. Dick Faust.

U.S. ALLEGES FRAUD BY HEALTH PLAN IN ENCINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Labor has sued administrators of an Encino-based health 
care plan for allegedly cheating its members out of more than $1.1 million, 
department officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that from March to October in 1992, a "sham union" called 
Local 555 of the National Council of Allied Employees International Union 
collected $3.7 million in contributions from more than 3,000 members and paid 
less than $1.2 million in claims. When the local's plan ceased operations, it 
had about $40,000 with which to pay claims but more than $604,000 in unpaid 
claims in addition to those claims not yet reported, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds collected by Local 555 were siphoned off by principals of the union and 
their subsidiary operations under the guise of administrative expenses, said 
Olena Berg, assistant secretary of Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, 
which investigates fraud in union health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable chunk of the premiums collected, more than $700,000, is still 
unaccounted for, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit targets "Local 555," not the union itself, which chartered the local. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seeks 
repayment of any illegal profits and an order banning those involved in the 
alleged scheme from having any future involvement with employee benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Action against the Los Angeles union coincided with suits against four other 
health care plans nationwide. The five unrelated plans, the Labor Department 
alleges, bilked 20,000 workers in at least 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Berg, Local 555 was a phony union set up by the principals of the 
American Health Care Underwriting Managers, who also set up a nonprofit group 
called the National Health Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to diversion of funds, operators of the Encino plan are accused of 
failing to set contribution rates sufficient to cover the promised benefits; 
failing to monitor the plan's accounting, financial and marketing services, and 
using unlicensed insurance carriers.

RANSOM NOTE CAME IN MONTANA CATTLEMAN'S DEATH; CRIME: RANCH HAND BEING HELD IN 
CONNECTION WITH A 1986 O.C. SLAYING IS CALLED ONE OF THE PRIME SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The wife of an internationally known cattleman got a ransom note demanding $1 
million after her husband disappeared, authorities have disclosed. He was found 
shot to death two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Stevenson, 51, was reported missing Sunday evening after he failed to 
return from feeding cattle. His body was found near a shed Tuesday. He had been 
shot several times, Sheriff Steve Knecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 A ranch hand, David Llamas Blake, emerged as a leading suspect when 
authorities discovered an outstanding murder warrant for him from Orange 
County, while investigating Stevenson's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we expect him to remain one of our prime suspects, but we're still not 
sure how many or if there were any others involved," Knecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, 32, of Corona was wanted in the 1986 slaying in Irvine of a 26-year-old 
Mexican who apparently failed to pay Blake a $700 fee for smuggling his wife 
and children across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake is being held on $250,000 bail; he has not been charged in the Stevenson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We presented enough evidence for his arrest for murder in 1986 and haven't 
been able to locate him," said Irvine police Lt. Sam Allevato. "Obviously, this 
is very helpful for us. Now . . . we can bring him back and hold him 
accountable for this murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake had worked at Stevenson's Basin Angus Ranch for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, his brother Keith and other family members operate three sprawling 
ranches in central Montana, marketing cattle, semen and embryos. The Stevenson 
Basin Inc. sale in December netted a record $2.7 million, livestock industry 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ransom note received by Marian Stevenson brought the FBI into the 
investigation, officials said Wednesday.

MAN KILLED, 2 HURT IN GANG FIGHT 
</P>

<P>
 One man was killed and two others were injured Thursday afternoon during a 
fight that involved about a dozen gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Michaels, 18, of Placentia was stabbed several times in the chest during 
the fight, which broke out at 4:45 p.m. in the courtyard of an apartment 
complex in the 3100 block of Pearl Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels was taken to Placentia Linda Community Hospital in Placentia, where 
he died about 45 minutes after the attack, said Sgt. Danny Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Injured in the melee were 20-year-old Charles Ernest Matthews of Placentia and 
a 17-year-old boy from Anaheim. Both were stabbed in the torso and are in 
stable condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still trying to piece together what happened," Becerra said. "Nobody 
has been arrested and we are still interviewing witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews and the injured teen are admitted gang members, as was Michaels, 
Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing was Fullerton's second homicide of the year. Becerra said there 
has been a recent increase in gang activity in the area where the stabbing 
occurred.

CASE AGAINST TIMOTHY LEARY FOLLOWER DROPPED AFTER 22 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former follower of LSD guru Timothy Leary and his Laguna Canyon-based 
Brotherhood of Eternal Love has finally escaped from his past, after 22 years 
on the lam from drug smuggling charges, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was indicted in 1972, Russell Harrigan has turned his life around, 
officials said.He has moved to Northern California, raised five children and 
started a house-painting business. 
</P>
<P>
 His past caught up with him, however, after he was pulled over for a minor 
traffic violation earlier this year, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl Armbrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrigan, 53, and 29 others including Leary, a former Harvard University 
professor, were indicted in 1972 on charges of smuggling marijuana and LSD. The 
case came to symbolize the 1960s drug culture and Leary's philosophy: "Turn on, 
tune in and drop out." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those indicted were convicted and sentenced to prison. Others, like 
Harrigan and Leary, disappeared, evading prosecution. Leary was later captured 
and sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the traffic stop earlier this year, Harrigan's outstanding warrant was 
discovered. He was prepared to buy his plane ticket to Orange County and face 
his fate in Superior Court when he learned that prosecutors would not pursue 
the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust said he decided to dismiss Harrigan's case earlier this month because 
Harrigan has apparently lived a crime-free life for two decades. Proceeding on 
a case long after witnesses and evidence have disappeared would have proved 
difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He apparently went 22 years without even a traffic ticket," Armbrust said. "A 
dismissal seemed appropriate in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrigan's attorney could not be reached for comment Thursday.

CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT FILED AGAINST WESTMINSTER; COURTS: ESCALATING A LONG BATTLE, 
FIREFIGHTERS UNION CLAIMS ITS TOP OFFICIALS WERE VICTIMS OF POLITICAL 
RETRIBUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The labor union representing Westminster firefighters filed a federal civil 
rights lawsuit against the city and several municipal leaders Thursday, 
charging that officials punished top union representatives for campaigning 
against the mayor and three other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal action is part of a pitched battle between the Westminster 
Firefighters Assn. and city leaders that has lasted for years and escalated in 
January when the city, following a payroll audit, accused firefighters of 
fraudulently collecting overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's president has been fired and a fire captain suspended in recent 
months, while the union has gathered enough signatures to force a recall 
election in June against Mayor Charles V. Smith and three other council 
members. The lawsuit seeks reinstatement of both firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in control of this City Council are so reactionary that they will 
stop at nothing to oppose people who oppose their views," said Alan C. Davis, a 
San Francisco attorney who filed the lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges a scenario of political retribution that began in 1992, 
when Fire Capt. Michael Garrison and union President Paul Gilbrook actively 
campaigned for Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer to become mayor. Smith, her 
opponent, won the seat in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing months, the lawsuit alleges, Smith and three other council 
members -- Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam -- embarked on 
a politically motivated financial review that resulted in layoffs and staff 
reductions at the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city conducted an audit which showed that the Fire Department 
had spent about $1 million on overtime pay when the budget for fiscal 1991-92 
had been set at $710,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors also found that overtime costs had nearly tripled from 1986 to 1990, 
from $342,000 to about $928,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the city ordered that only emergency overtime be approved and set 
the overtime budget for fiscal 1993-94 at $75,000. The union sued and obtained 
a temporary restraining order. During the 10 weeks the injunction was in 
effect, Smith said, the Fire Department racked up $283,000 in overtime costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that ain't abuse, I don't know what is," Smith said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, union leaders began circulating a recall petition against Smith 
and the other three council members. Two months later, Gilbrook was suspended 
after investigators found that he improperly claimed sick leave and drove a 
fire engine with a suspended driver's license. Gilbrook was fired in February. 
He maintains that he was singled out because of his political activities. 
</P>
<P>
 After a mentally disabled man died in a fire at a Westminster residential care 
facility in January, Fire Capt. Garrison called a news conference and said that 
budget cuts directly contributed to the man's death. The city's fire chief 
disputed the charge and suspended Garrison with pay for making "unsubstantiated 
statements" while the cause of the blaze was still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two days, eight firefighters, including Garrison, have been called 
before a panel of investigators who are trying to determine whether they abused 
their sick leave or vacation time between 1986 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison said that no firefighter has been asked about alleged overtime 
abuses, and attorney Davis said that no investigation involving overtime is 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew S. Anderson said an investigation of possible 
overtime abuses is still pending. He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the city's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, is preparing a report to be 
released at the next council meeting, on April 12, that will show numerous 
discrepancies in overtime payments since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (union's) claim is that everything we've done to stop overtime has been 
political, (but) it has nothing to do with political retribution," Smith said. 
"This is a power struggle, and the Fire Department has had control of the City 
Council for years. That changed in November, and we are getting control of a 
department that was out of control. At the rate they were spending money, this 
city would have been bankrupt in three years."

OFFICER FIRES SHOTS AT TEEN IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran police officer fired three shots at a 16-year-old suspected gang 
member who allegedly pointed a gun at him during a confrontation at El Salvador 
Park Thursday afternoon. The youth was not hit, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, a gang investigator whose name was not released, was patrolling 
the park just before 3:30 p.m. when he noticed a group of teen-agers who he 
suspected had been spray painting a wall near the northeast area of the park, 
Sgt. Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group spotted the officer, they ran across the park toward a 
recreation center. The officer followed the group and noticed one of the 
teen-agers carrying what he initially thought was a can of spray paint, Faust 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the (teen-ager) stopped in front of the recreation center, he withdrew a 
semiautomatic handgun and pointed at the officer," Faust said. "The officer 
exited his car, drew his service weapon and fired three shots at the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager ran to the east side of the park and was taken into custody by 
other officers who had arrived at the park. The teen-ager's weapon was 
recovered at the scene, Faust said.

VETERANS GROUP GETS OK TO SERVE ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A veterans group received approval from county planners this week to serve 
alcohol at its new post in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission unanimously voted to grant 
an alcohol use permit Wednesday to Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6885. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit allows the group to sell alcohol at the post it bought in October, 
a 2.25-acre site two miles northeast of Santa Clarita along Sierra Highway. The 
group purchased the site after the Santa Clarita City Council voted to shut 
down its Sand Canyon post because it did not have a valid conditional use 
permit for the facility and because neighbors complained of noise and rowdy 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit carries several restrictions, including limiting business hours 
from 11 a.m. to midnight, requiring no more than 70 people inside the club at 
any given time and requiring that alcohol be consumed by members and their 
guests only, said Lonnie Bell, a regional planning assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Post supporters contended that selling alcohol is a major source of revenue 
for the group and helps pay bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Hunt, spokesman for the VFW post, said the group will now apply for a 
liquor license from the state. JULIE TAMAKI

MALL FLAP CALLED A BLOW FOR FREE SPEECH; CIVIL LIBERTIES: MARIJUANA ACTIVISTS 
WILL BE ALLOWED TO GATHER SIGNATURES IN A PALMDALE SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The outcome of a civil dispute between hemp activists and the owners of the 
Antelope Valley Mall has led to the recognition that political activists have 
the right to exercise free speech activities inside privately owned malls, 
lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement stems from the Jan. 17 arrests of two Antelope Valley men, 
volunteers for the California Hemp Initiative, who attempted to gather 
signatures for a marijuana-legalization petition at the Palmdale shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Tisbert, 46, of Palmdale, and Donovan Taylor, 23, of Lancaster, claimed 
that their First Amendment rights were violated when Antelope Valley Mall 
security personnel denied them access to the mall to gather signatures for 
their petition and told them to reserve space at a community table at a later 
date. The men argued with security and were arrested later that day for 
trespassing and disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific terms of the agreement were kept confidential as part of the 
settlement, but during a news conference at the ACLU's Downtown Los Angeles 
office, it was suggested that the Antelope Valley Mall may have revised its 
rules. The charges against the men were dropped this week and the pair will be 
allowed to return to the mall to gather signatures after a brief waiting 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed," Tisbert said. "We had to compromise a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas J. Leanse of the Los Angeles law firm of Katten, Muschin, Zavis & 
Weitzman, which represents mall owner Forest City Enterprises, said: "My 
clients will continue their time, place and manner rule, but they recognize 
that individuals have certain rights to come into the shopping center and 
engage in non-commercial activities."  
</P>
<P>
 Alan Friel, the ACLU attorney representing the Antelope Valley men, said the 
mall has agreed to narrowly restrict free speech rights and that his clients 
"are frustrated when there are any restrictions on their free speech rights." 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, ACLU lawyers distributed brochures that outline free 
speech laws in California and how they apply to shopping centers. The brochure 
states that in large, enclosed malls, the common area is "protected" for free 
speech but reasonable restrictions on time, place and manner of speech can be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get several complaints every week from activists who are having problems 
with access to private property," Friel said. "We hope to educate shopping 
center owners with these brochures on the laws concerning free speech in 
privately owned malls." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, the Supreme Court recognized that shopping centers were the 
modern-day equivalent of a town square and should be accessible to political 
activists as long as they followed reasonable rules of the owner.

RAMS IGNORE DEADLINE FOR VACATING PRACTICE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brinkmanship between the Rams and the owners of their practice facility 
continued Thursday with the football team ignoring a deadline that it vacate 
the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' refusal to move out or sign a lease extension for the practice site 
may force the Magnolia School District, owner of the property, to seek an 
eviction order in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rams officials confirmed Thursday that they have heard from the 
Orange Unified School District, UC Irvine and others about relocating the 
team's practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had 8,000 messages from people offering us places," said Jay Zygmunt, 
Rams senior vice president. "We've heard everything from the Los Angeles Police 
Academy to swampland in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the interest from other parties, the Rams did not seem to be in a 
hurry Thursday to leave Rams Park in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a hardship for us to vacate immediately," said John Shaw, the 
Rams executive vice president. "As soon as we find something suitable we will 
probably move. . . . It's going to take a while. You don't buy a house and move 
in the same day." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the team has no alternative practice site. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw added, though, that he would be "surprised" if the team was formally 
evicted. But that appears to be the direction in which school district 
officials are headed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Paul Mercier said he is "absolutely amazed" by the Rams' 
actions and "arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed and amazed that an organization like the Rams are saying 
throw us out by legal force rather than following through on their moral 
obligation," Mercier said. "I find it hard to believe that this is the way they 
want to deal with things." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia trustees will meet Monday night to review the district's legal 
options and decide whether to file an eviction lawsuit. A court eviction would 
give the team at least 30 days to move. 
</P>
<P>
 The court eviction notice might also name the city, because the city leases 
the property from the school district and then sublets it to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack L. White said the city would not try to prevent the eviction.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth said he is still "hopeful" that some resolution can 
be worked out. Nonetheless, he said the city and school district had given the 
Rams "an extremely fair offer."  
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has put the city in an awkward position. While city official want 
to prevent the team from moving out of Anaheim, as team officials have 
indicated it may, they also don't want to jeopardize city funds by making any 
unwise financial concessions to the team.

JUDGE ALTERS CANDIDACY STATEMENT OF COUNTY SCHOOLS CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what appeared at times to be more a lesson in grammar than a court hearing, 
an Orange County Superior Court judge on Thursday ordered modifications in the 
voter pamphlet statement of incumbent county schools Supt. John F. Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 minutes of reading through Dean's candidacy statement and conferring 
with attorneys on acceptable revisions, Judge Francisco F. Firmat submitted his 
final draft, just in time for today's printing of the voter pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the result of a lawsuit filed March 21 by Darrell Opp, a 
regional occupational director who works under Dean and is the incumbent's only 
opponent in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, Opp alleged that Dean falsely stated that he has reduced the 
County Department of Education budget and cut staff and administrators. Opp 
further alleged that Dean's voter pamphlet statement implied that the County 
Board of Supervisors and boards of education had endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Opp also said that Dean violated election rules prohibiting partisan 
references in nonpartisan races when he stated that he had been named to the 
"CRA Hall of Fame," which Opp contended could be mistaken to mean the 
California Republican Assembly. In this case, the acronym stands for the 
California Reading Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that only some parts of Dean's statement were ambiguous. He 
modified Dean's listing of endorsements to clarify that he is supported by 
individuals serving on several prominent boards and not by the boards as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat agreed that the acronym CRA might be interpreted by voters as 
California Republican Assembly, rather than California Reading Assn., which 
elected Dean to its Hall of Fame, and ruled that it should be spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat refused to change a sentence that detailed budget and staff cuts during 
Dean's administration, ruling that Opp's attorney, Mark Rosen, did not supply 
official Department of Education documents to prove that the figures are not 
accurate.

ANGELS TRY BEAR MASCOTS TO LURE KIDS, LEAD CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These bears are cute, they're cuddly, but more than that, they're supposed to 
pack the kids in at California Angel games. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporarily named Big Bear and Little Bear, the Angels' first-ever mascots are 
supposed to present baseball as good family entertainment and help the team's 
sagging ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Schrier, vice president of marketing for the team, said the mascots 
will be called upon to "stir enthusiasm" during Angel games. "They're going to 
be like cheerleaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The bears, he said, will be instrumental in starting "the wave" and a new 
Angel cheer called "the Halo." For that cheer, fans will be asked to stick 
their arms in the air, move them in a circular motion and shout "Halo!" It's 
the team's angelic version of the Atlanta Braves' fans controversial "Tomahawk 
Chop." 
</P>
<P>
 Schrier said the bears will greet children as they come through the stadium 
gates and then mingle among the crowd during the games. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "in no way would they interfere with the game." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the bear mascots stomped around the stadium steps trying to get 
used to the brown, furry outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their visibility and mobility were great," Schrier reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is expected to formally unveil the mascots at a press conference next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel officials chose the bear as their mascot because it is represented on 
the state's flag and because research has shown them to be "among the most 
popular" critters for children, Schrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel bears will be named by a contest later in the season.

A WILD QUARTER ON WALL STREET; DOW TAKES A BEATING, BUT CLOSES SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

<P>
 Stocks recovered late Thursday from another steep dive, closing the week mixed 
as weary traders headed out for the three-day holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average plunged more than 65 points in early trading, in 
what began to look like the third mini-meltdown session in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 But buyers returned to key blue-chip stocks late in the day, aided by easing 
interest rates. The Dow closed up 9.21 points to 3,635.96, its first gain in 
six days, and that recovery rescued the broad market as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500-index also eked out a gain of 0.22 point, to 445.77. 
Losers still trounced winners by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
however, and most stock indexes finished with small losses in very heavy 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's comeback reflected some bargain-hunting by 
investors who believe stocks have fallen too far, too fast. But some Wall 
Streeters also cautioned that technical, quarter-end asset shifts by portfolio 
managers may have suggested more bullishness than is really present among 
beleaguered investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of blood was spilled on the Street this week," said Lance Zipper, head 
of Nasdaq trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders also noted that computer-generated "program" trading continued to 
buffet the market Thursday, as stocks' rising volatility produces short-term 
trading opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow sank 138.77 points for the week, its worst loss since a 216.26-point 
descent during the week ended Oct. 13, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 399.3 million shares Thursday, the 
busiest day since 446 million shares traded on March 18 -- a "triple-witching" 
options and futures expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
 Most financial markets will be closed today for Good Friday. What happens on 
Monday, analysts say, may depend on how bullishly investors interpret today's 
government report on March employment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the number is strong, it could reignite fears that the Federal Reserve 
Board will tighten credit again soon. The Fed's decision to boost short-term 
interest rates this year, to restrain the burgeoning economy, has been widely 
blamed for bursting stock and bond markets' bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Thursday, bond yields soared anew after the Chicago Purchasing 
Management Assn. reported improved economic conditions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds jumped as high as 7.19% on the news. But 
buying later in the day pulled the yield back down to 7.08%, versus 7.10% 
Wednesday. A week ago the bond was at 6.95%. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the stock market, bond traders warned that Thursday's mini-rally may not 
mean that the avalanche of selling that began this week has run its course. 
</P>
<P>
 "That little rebound toward the end of the day didn't represent any huge 
institutional buying" of bonds, said J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced 
Investment Management in Pittsburgh. "It's just nibbling around the edges." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher Treasury bond yields were reflected in the corporate bond market, where 
companies were forced to increase yields on new issues or to delay offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, yields on some actively traded municipal bonds surged as much as 0.15 
points as concerns about high rates in the Treasury market continued to fuel 
selling of munis by mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, bargain-hunters went after many industrial and technology 
shares, as confidence improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the downturn may not necessarily be over," said Don Hays, investment 
strategist at Wheat First-Butcher & Singer. "The market is trying to hit 
bottom, but there's no real evidence that that's the case yet." 
</P>
<P>
 One positive sign was that many foreign stock markets didn't follow Wall 
Street sharply lower after Wednesday's 72.27-point Dow plunge. In London, the 
FTSE-100 index eased just 6.0 points to 3,086.4. Frankfurt's DAX index lost 
14.42 points to 2,133.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo suffered worse, with the Nikkei index falling 447.99 points, or 2.3%, to 
19,111.92. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow was pulled up by Allied Signal, up 2 1/4 to 36 1/2; GE, up 1 1/4 to 
100; McDonald's, up 1 1/8 to 56 7/8; J.P. Morgan, up 2 1/4 to 62 3/4; and 
Caterpillar, which jumped 2 7/8 to 112 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks rebounding included Intel, up 1 1/4 to 67 1/2; 
Hewlett-Packard, up 2 1/8 to 82 1/8; Autodesk, up 3 to 58; and Motorola, up 3 
1/8 to 101 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold surged $5.70 to $391.80 an ounce, on concerns over unrest in South 
Africa and on safe-haven buying in reaction to the stock market's problems. 
Silver shot up 14.5 cents to $5.79. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil rose for a third day on the New York Merc, as the market continued 
to rebound from sharp losses on Monday. Light, sweet crude for May delivery 
rose 41 cents to $14.79 a barrel.

LATINAS GAINING ON LATINOS IN MANAGEMENT, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A report to be released today by Hispanic Business magazine is adding to 
growing evidence that minority women are making greater gains in the managerial 
and professional sectors of the U.S. labor force than minority men. 
</P>
<P>
 Projections and analysis of U.S. Census data and exclusive population surveys, 
conducted by the Southwest Voter Research Institute in San Antonio, show that 
in 1994 Hispanic women should outnumber their male counterparts in the top job 
categories 50.5% to 49.5%, said the magazine's managing editor, Hector Cantu. 
"It's going to happen this year, if it hasn't already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the percentages were reversed and men held the lead; 49.5% of all 
Hispanics -- the term used by the Census Bureau -- employed in professional and 
managerial categories were women and 50.5% were men. The growth rates of 
Latinas in the workplace since 1990, said Cantu, mean that Latinos are falling 
behind "and there's no looking back." 
</P>
<P>
 If the projections bear out, Latinas and Latinos would be joining a workplace 
phenomenon experienced by other minorities, particularly African Americans: 
Women are more easily breaking through the color barriers to advancement than 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it surprising and I know how statistics can be manipulated, but if 
it's true, I think it's wonderful and it's about time," said Ruth Carranza, 
managing editor of Intercambios, a magazine published in San Francisco for 
professional Latinas. "We are, after all, 51% of the population and it should 
be reflective," said Carranza. 
</P>
<P>
 Carranza said rising to top management, as opposed to just heavily populating 
middle management ranks, is "still an issue for women in general. I know we've 
made headway, but there still is a limit as to where we can go from there." 
That limit, often called the "glass ceiling," is why many Latinas have formed 
networks to encourage and support other women to strike out on their own and 
form their own enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to Hispanic Business' report, Hispanic women will outnumber 
men in the top two job categories, professions and executive or managerial, 
because they heavily outnumber Hispanic men in the much larger pool of 
professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 Latinas still have some catching up to do in the highest job categories for 
executives and managers, where about 70,000 more Hispanic men than women hold 
jobs, Cantu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth rate of Latinas in the professions has been most pronounced in the 
category of mathematics and computer science, according to the magazine's 
report. The number of Hispanic women in that field grew 470% from 1980 to 1990, 
while the number of all Hispanics, men and women, in the overall work force 
grew 170% in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 And, like African Americans and all women, Latinas and Latinos are still very 
underrepresented in the top echelons of business and industry in contrast with 
their populations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Hispanics held one of every 22 executive and managerial jobs, 
according to Hispanic Business. That is up since 1980, when the figure was 1 of 
30, but is still out of synch, proportionally. Latinos make up 10% of the U.S. 
population and in 1990, one of every 12 employed workers in the country was a 
Hispanic. Their Rise to the Top 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the number of Hispanic* women in professions and 
management positions in the U.S. will exceed their male Hispanic counterparts. 
Some projections: 
</P>
<P>
 Number of female professionals: 670,000 
</P>
<P>
 Number of male professionals: 660,000 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, the combined number working in the United States was 430,000. In 
1994, that number is expected to be 1.33 million

LONDON PUBLISHER BUYS SOFTWARE TOOLWORKS; COMMUNICATIONS: PEARSON INC.'S 
ACQUISITION REFLECTS HOW CRUCIAL MEDIA GIANTS BELIEVE ELECTRONIC SOFTWARE WILL 
BE TO THE FUTURE OF THEIR BUSINESSES.

 Marking its first venture into the super-trendy market for interactive 
software, London-based publishing giant Pearson Inc. said Thursday that it has 
agreed to buy multimedia publisher Software Toolworks for $462 million, nearly 
four times the Novato, Calif., company's annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal reflects how crucial today's media titans believe electronic software 
will be to maintaining their stature and financial performance as new forms of 
interactive entertainment, education and information gain widespread consumer 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole way in which people are educated and entertained is changing," said 
Pearson President David Veit. "While we hope people go on buying books, we see 
interactive media as a powerful alternative. From a parent's perspective 
especially, you get more bang for the buck." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned Toolworks purchase is the latest in a series of mergers and 
acquisitions in the computer and video game software industry, driven by 
rapidly improving technology, falling computer prices and increasing 
competition. Last month, Electronic Arts and Broderbund announced a planned 
merger. Last summer, The Tribune Co. bought Carlsbad-based Compton's New Media, 
the largest publisher of CD-ROM software. And Virgin Interactive of Irvine has 
signaled that it may announce a significant investment or acquisition in coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson's diverse media holdings include The Financial Times newspaper; book 
publishers Penguin Books, Addison-Wesley and Longman; British TV producer 
Thames Television, and a 17% stake in satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The company 
hopes Software Toolworks will help it leverage its traditional properties in a 
digital world. The plan is to focus on "edutainment," a segment of the 
interactive market Pearson expects to grow at 25% annually for the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 An interactive version of the venerable Peter Rabbit tale, for example, may be 
on the horizon, since Pearson owns the rights to the renowned character. 
Penguin has published a series of fantasy books that could be converted into 
interactive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it could work the other way: Software Toolworks' hit CD-ROM titles, such as 
"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing," could be converted into books or a cartoon 
series, Veit said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Software Toolworks, the world's second-largest publisher of CD-ROMs after 
Compton's, the deal caps a three-year turnaround from a $38.9-million loss in 
1991 to a $3.5 million profit in 1993. For the first nine months of the fiscal 
year ended Thursday, Toolworks reported a profit of $6 million. Toolworks 
shares soared $4.375 to close at $14.375 on the Nasdaq market Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Toolworks Chief Executive Bob Lloyd said the acquisition would enable the firm 
-- long a prisoner to short-term cash decisions -- to make strategic 
investments crucial to future growth. Addison Wesley's distribution network in 
educational outlets such as bookstores will be a boon to the company. But he 
said a deep-pocketed partner doesn't give the firm a competitive edge in the 
crucial battle for space on retailer's shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buyers don't say, 'Oh you're part of a $2.5-billion company, now we'll give 
you more shelf space.' It's neat and cool software that gets shelf space -- 
always has been, always will be," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of CD-ROMs, shiny discs which can hold many times the data that can fit 
on game cartridges or floppy disks, are forecast to more than double this year. 
They are seen as the precursor to interactive television, and the companies 
that know how to develop, publish and distribute them are in high demand. As a 
result, analysts said the Toolworks price of four times annual revenue was not 
out of line.

NO WINNER EMERGES AFTER GRUMMAN DEADLINE PASSES; DEFENSE: NORTHROP AND MARTIN 
MARIETTA ARE TO BE INFORMED ON MONDAY WHICH SUITOR HAD THE BEST OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grumman Corp.'s deadline for final bids from defense rivals Northrop Corp. and 
Martin Marietta Corp. passed Thursday with no clear picture of which suitor 
holds the upper hand in the unusual takeover fight. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies refused to say whether either bidder submitted new offers, 
but investors left for the Easter weekend convinced that Grumman would fetch an 
even higher price. Grumman's stock rose 75 cents, to $64.625 a share, in New 
York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop already has offered to pay $60 a share, or $2.04 billion, for the 
Bethpage, N.Y.-based company, while Martin Marietta has bid $55 a share, or 
$1.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Grumman, though, asked for a last round of sealed bids to end the takeover 
fight quickly. The company plans to evaluate the offers over the long weekend 
and announce the winner Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could well be that the matter will not be resolved by Monday. Los 
Angeles-based Northrop earlier this week blasted the auction as unfair, and 
there has been widespread speculation that the company will either boycott the 
auction or go to court if Grumman embraces a new bid from Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop tried Wednesday to scrap the auction plan by giving Grumman's board 
24 hours to accept a sweetened price of $62 a share, or $2.11 billion. But the 
directors snubbed that proposal, and it expired as scheduled at noon on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Grumman closed its auction, there was debate among merger experts and those 
close to the takeover battle over the wisdom of Grumman's actions.  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop and Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta, after all, have made their 
existing bids via tender offers that are already outstanding. The question 
often asked has been: Why not just let the two companies adjust their tender 
offers as they wish, until the highest price wins?  
</P>
<P>
 By its nature, a tender offer is aimed directly at the stockholders, who 
decide whether to tender their shares for the best price regardless of what the 
company's directors think. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers think Grumman's directors chose the auction mainly to show they 
are doing their fiduciary duty to weigh all bids fairly, and protect themselves 
against any future lawsuits by jilted suitors or angry stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board is trying to keep itself from exposure to any breach of fiduciary 
duty," said Michael H. Bradley, a professor of business and law at the 
University of Michigan. This allowed them "to maintain as much control of the 
process as they can, without being overly intrusive and favoring one group over 
another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One adviser close to Grumman said the auction had another purpose: to quickly 
flush out a higher offer from Martin Marietta, which has been largely silent 
since Northrop jumped into the fray three weeks ago. "They felt this was the 
best way to get Martin to raise its bid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Martin Marietta's tender offer is due to expire on Monday, and Grumman's 
board would have had to wait only a few extra days to see whether Martin 
Marietta would have raised its price or let its offer lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 One major Grumman stockholder endorsed the auction concept on the grounds that 
it is important to avoid a prolonged takeover brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "With defense spending declining," said Harold Levy, senior vice president of 
the investment firm Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder in New York, "I don't think it's 
good for the industry to have companies fighting over each other . . . because 
that's going to cause people to think maybe we misjudged how bad things are in 
this business."

 Hasbro Named in Antitrust Suit: The complaint, filed in federal court in New 
York by Anti-Monopoly Inc., alleges that Hasbro is using discriminatory and 
predatory pricing policies to drive small board-game manufacturers out of the 
market. The suit also charges that Toys 'R' Us Inc. and Kmart Corp., two of the 
top board-game retailers, are conspiring with Hasbro to maintain Hasbro's 
monopoly in the market. Anti-Monopoly is seeking $15 million in damages, and 
has asked the court to order divestiture of all board-game companies acquired 
by Hasbro in recent years, including Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers and 
Selchow & Righter.

 GM Recalls Natural-Gas-Powered Trucks on Safety Defect: General Motors Corp. 
said it is recalling all 2,500 of its natural gas-powered pickup trucks on the 
road, after two of the vehicles' fuel tanks ruptured and exploded earlier this 
year. GM said owners of the 1992 and 1993 full-size pickups can exchange them 
for comparably equipped 1994 gasoline-powered half-ton or three-quarter-ton GM 
pickups.If the owner chooses not to exchange the natural gas-powered truck, the 
company said, it will purchase the vehicle. Despite the defect, GM said it will 
continue with its program to develop a natural gas vehicle fuel system for both 
cars and trucks. About 90% of the 1992 and 1993 trucks are used by utility 
fleets in California and Texas.

 U.S. Will Order Increases in Minivan-Pickup Truck Mileage: The Clinton 
Administration, in a move seen as favoring automotive industry concerns, today 
will order modest new increases in the fuel efficiency of new minivans and 
pickup trucks, Administration officials said. Officials said Transportation 
Secretary Frederico Pena has set standards for 1996 and 1997 light trucks at 
20.7 miles per gallon, an increase of 0.1 mpg over efficiency levels for 1995 
trucks. The vehicles coming under the new standards account for roughly 40% of 
the U.S. passenger vehicle market.

 Optimism From Euro Disney: The money-losing Euro Disneyland will not post any 
significant growth in revenue before 1996, its chairman said in a magazine 
interview. Philippe Bourguignon said in Friday's edition of L'Echo Touristique 
that Euro Disney SCA should be in the black next year, helped by a huge bailout 
package agreed to by creditor banks and parent Walt Disney Co.And barring any 
downturn in visitors, the theme park should become profitable in 1995, he said. 
Analysts, however, are skeptical of the figures. The deal includes a $1-billion 
rights issue, to which Walt Disney will subscribe to its full 49% share. Banks 
will forgive some interest and defer principal payment, while Walt Disney Co. 
will waive royalties and management fees for five years.

RISING YEN THREATENS JAPAN'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY; TRADE: STRONG CURRENCY COULD 
THWART DOMESTIC GROWTH. U.S. STUDY ACCUSES TOKYO OF MAINTAINING THE MOST 
RESTRICTIVE TRADE BARRIERS IN THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The yen, boosted by trade tensions between the United States and Japan, is 
again rising rapidly, raising new fears that Japan's economic recovery will 
fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 The currency has been gaining strength, in part, in anticipation of a report 
released in Washington Thursday that set the stage for serious trade sanctions 
against Japan. The report, necessary before the United States can invoke the 
so-called Super 301 trade law, accuses Japan of maintaining the most 
restrictive trade barriers in the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the report's release, the yen rose for the fifth consecutive day in 
Tokyo trading Thursday to close at 102.80 yen to the dollar -- within striking 
distance of its strongest postwar value of 100.40 yen to the dollar, which was 
reached last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen also has been steadily gaining ground on speculation that Washington 
may seek to boost the yen further, which has the effect of raising the price of 
Japanese exports and making foreign imports to Japan less expensive. Over the 
long term, such a shift would help cut Japan's huge trade surplus with the 
United States, which hit $59.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the immediate worry is that the strong yen may damage the Japanese economy 
just when it appears to have bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial output in February, for example, grew 0.2% from January -- less 
than many had hoped -- but still a welcome rise. In other signs that the worst 
may be over, manufacturers' inventory levels fell 1% in February and shipments 
showed a 1.2% rise, according to government figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recovery could be choked off if the strong yen cuts the profits of 
export-oriented companies. The yen's advance will hurt both the Japanese and 
the global economies, said Hideaki Kumano, vice minister for international 
trade and industry. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Japanese stock investors responded to the strong yen and Wednesday's selloff 
on Wall Street by pushing the 225-issue Nikkei index down 447.99 points 
Thursday, or 2.29%, to close at 19,111.92. It had lost 149.83 points, or 0.76%, 
the previous day. The index rebounded 197.04 points, or 1%, to close morning 
trading today at 19,308.96, helped partly by a slight weakening of the yen, 
which finished the morning at 103.05 yen to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders expressed concern that if the yen gets too strong, it will choke off 
the foreign investment that has been the driving force behind a moderate stock 
market rally the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The United State's rejection of Japan's proposed package of economic stimulus 
and market-opening measures released on Tuesday also contributed to the yen's 
strengthening and the stock market's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of the Japanese package was followed Thursday by the Clinton 
Administration's ninth annual National Trade Estimate, an inventory of global 
trade barriers. The Administration devoted 44 pages in an inch-thick report to 
detailing trade barriers maintained by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will be used by the Administration as it pursues a reopening of 
trade negotiations with Japan. At the end of September, if the talks aren't 
successful, the United States could identify Japan as a "priority country" 
under the Super 301 trade law. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, the Super 301 process would give the Administration the 
flexibility to impose high tariffs, quotas or other measures if Japan's trade 
barriers are not removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts believe that if U.S.-Japan trade tensions lessen over the coming 
months, the yen is likely to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's strength "does not reflect fundamentals," said Jeffrey Young, 
economic analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "We are looking for the yen to 
weaken from here."

 The trade office was quick to point out that the report had taken on "added 
significance" this year since President Clinton has revived a dormant sanctions 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the March 3 revival of the Super 301 measure -- which has been widely 
condemned overseas -- any of the litany of accusations leveled against Japan in 
the report could now be the basis for punitive tariffs some months down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longest section of the report relates to Japan," the trade office said in 
a terse statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The section contains examples of progress, but also documents the fact that 
the barriers in Japan to imports of manufactured goods and services far exceed 
the barriers of other G7 (Group of Seven) nations and place an unacceptable 
burden on the global trading system," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it dedicated 43 pages to Japan -- up from 27 pages last year -- and 
noted that the U.S. deficit with Tokyo last year totaled $60.4 billion, up $10 
billion from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the imbalance and a host of alleged trade barriers have 
"created enormous strains on Japan's trade relations with the United States and 
other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Trade Estimate -- a detailed indictment of 39 countries and 
regions -- is an annual report card to Congress on problems around the world. 
Japan is problem No. 1 and, for the first time since Clinton took office, this 
year's study sets a clock ticking on possible Super 301 action.

 Gross Domestic Product Up Sharply: The economy surged forward at its briskest 
clip in 10 years in the closing months of 1993, the Commerce Department said, 
and analysts said the momentum carried forward into this year.The estimate of 
fourth-quarter gross domestic product was revised from a month ago to show 
output expanding at a 7% annual rate instead of 7.5% in the last quarter of 
1993. It was the strongest quarterly growth since 1984, when the GDP gained 
7.9% in the first quarter. GDP measures all goods and services produced by U.S. 
workers and capital.

HIGH-TECH FIRMS APPLAUD EASING OF LIMITS ON EXPORTS; TRADE: OFFICIALS PROJECT 
MARKET FOR SUCH GOODS COULD REACH $150 BILLION DURING THE NEXT 10 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Technology companies large and small said Thursday that they stand to profit 
from the Clinton Administration's decision to ease limits on sales of some 
computers and telecommunications gear to former communist bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
 With officials projecting that the market for such goods could reach $150 
billion during the next 10 years, high-profile companies such as AT&T and 
California's Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics expect to 
gain as Russia, Eastern Europe and China rush to upgrade their information and 
communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller companies, many of them in Silicon Valley and Southern California, 
also will benefit, executives said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Commerce Department's announcement Wednesday that it planned to scrap 
certain export limits followed a decision by Western nations to dissolve their 
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom. The 
Cold War institution, created in 1949, imposed strict limits on sales of items 
that could aid the militaries of one-time communist foes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, 
these measures were no longer relevant. U.S. companies have complained that the 
restrictions crippled them in the battle for sales in high-growth markets, 
forcing them to ship outmoded gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a dramatic break with the past," said Herb Linnen, a spokesman for 
AT&T in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 For AT&T, the change means the ability to freely sell -- to civilian customers 
-- sophisticated fiber optics, equipment for switching long-distance calls and 
software for cellular communication. The lifting of restrictions facilitates 
$500 million in prospective sales to the countries involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 China, he noted, has the world's most ambitious telecommunications program, 
with plans to spend as much as $40 billion on its network by the year 2000. 
Under a memo of understanding, AT&T has agreed to modernize much of the 
country's telecommunications network and build factories and a Bell 
Laboratories. That agreement now "takes on new dimensions," Linnen added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, expects to reap millions of dollars in 
sales of low- and mid-range workstations and servers, according to spokesman 
Brad Whitworth. Workstations are powerful computers used for engineering and 
desktop publishing; servers are high-powered computers that provide information 
to networks of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 At International Imaging Systems in Milpitas, Calif., Chief Executive Richard 
Ashcroft figures the change will lighten the bureaucratic burden on about 40% 
of the company's annual sales of $12 million. The company bids on government 
contracts for equipment to monitor disasters and measure forest land and other 
natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the need to seek export licenses for the off-the-shelf Sun, HP and 
Silicon Graphics workstations the company uses in its data-processing systems, 
International Imaging will be able to sell them much more quickly and with far 
less paperwork. That, in turn, will make the company better able to compete 
with overseas rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ashcroft said, the company is still limited when it comes to sales to 
military customers. For example, a deal signed Thursday with China's air force 
for a flood-control management system falls under residual license 
restrictions, even though the system won't be used for military purposes per 
se. "This is a step in the right direction," Ashcroft said. "But technology 
moves faster than government." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and companies emphasized that stiff restrictions will 
remain on complex supercomputers and on any equipment that could be used in the 
development of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. And trade will be 
off-limits to nations that support terrorism: Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, 
Syria and Libya.

agreement with its lenders that will give them 70% of the company in return for 
new loan terms and a $95 million reduction in the company's $340 million 
debt.The swap of some of the debt for stock in Presley requires shareholder 
approval. A meeting has not yet been set. Under the agreement, lenders Foothill 
Capital Corp in Los Angeles and Pearl Street L.P. in New York would get three 
of nine seats on Presley's board. Presley would be left with a three-year $95 
million line of credit and a $150 million loan due in five years. In addition, 
the lenders would provide an additional $20-million line of credit to purchase 
and develop land.

 Cost of Funds Rate Declines Again: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th district cost of funds, the rate to which many adjustable-rate 
mortgages are tied, fell to 3.687% in February from 3.71% in January. With the 
exception of a slight increase last December, the rate has steadily declined 
over the past three years. The rate measures the average cost of funds to the 
financial institutions in California, Arizona and Nevada.

 Rohr Admits Faking Tests: The defense contractor admitted faking quality tests 
for parts of the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter and the Air Force's C-5 
transport.It agreed to pay a $3.6-million fine. Rohr agreed with Los Angeles 
prosecutors to plead guilty to eight counts of making false claims about the 
tests. U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. must concur with the deal. He set 
sentencing May 2. Four of the counts involved corrosion tests on metal parts 
for the C-5, and the others involved tests with adhesives on parts for the 
Navy's F-14. The tests were supposed to have been run between 1987 and 1990 at 
the Rohr's Riverside facility.

GM VOLUNTARILY RECALLS 204,000 MINIVANS

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. said it is voluntarily recalling about 204,000 minivans 
from the 1992-and 1993-model years to fix a defect in the vehicles' seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall involves all 1992 and certain 1993 Chevrolet Lumina Minivans, 
Pontiac Trans Sports and Oldsmobile Silhouettes.No accidents or injuries have 
been reported to GM as a result of the problem, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM is asking owners to check the lap belt in the center seat of the middle row 
of seats in five- and seven-passenger minivans, and the left rear seat in the 
six-seat vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 If the webbing fails to unwind from the seat belt retractor, the seat belt 
will be replaced at no charge, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners may bring their vehicles to dealers for inspection, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was detected after records showed an unusually high number of seat 
belts being replaced under warranty, a GM spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM declined to say how much the recall will cost.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: LOWER EGG PRICES AT EASTER ARE NO BARGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With Easter a few days away, grocers in Southern California are slashing egg 
prices by as much as 50% to lure shoppers during the peak egg-buying season. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean supermarkets are losing money on eggs? We don't think so. 
Retail egg prices in California are so high that a sale price here is an 
everyday low price elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In February for example, Southern Californians paid an average of $1.66 for a 
dozen large eggs, 84% more than what consumers paid nationally. A look at 
retail prices during the last 10 years shows that Southern Californians have 
consistently paid at least a third more for eggs than consumers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Riverside poultry specialist Don Bell said California supermarkets are 
making bigger profits on eggs than grocers in other parts of the country. 
That's because wholesale egg prices don't vary much with geography, he said. A 
supermarket in California buys eggs at about the same prices as a supermarket 
in Michigan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 (California eggs are U.S. Department of Agriculture Grade AA while eggs in the 
rest of the country are USDA Grade A. Bell tells us the difference in quality 
between the two grades is negligible and has no effect on wholesale prices 
because eggs are sold on the basis of size.) 
</P>
<P>
 California grocers can charge higher prices because consumer demand for eggs 
doesn't fluctuate much in response to price. Bell said there is no evidence 
that egg consumption is lower in California than in states where eggs are 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 High retail prices here are understandably upsetting for California egg 
producers, who don't share the extra profits. Said Robert Pierre, president of 
the California Egg Commission: "The supermarkets are benefiting and the farmers 
are getting robbed." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for the California Grocers Assn. said egg prices can't be 
looked at in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Egg prices might be higher in Los Angeles, but bread might be cheaper," said 
Don Beaver, president of the trade organization. "There isn't a marketing area 
in the country that is the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaver said profits at individual supermarket chains, regardless of location, 
are less than 1% of sales. "It all works out in the end for the consumer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the parent company of Alpha Beta markets said prices are 
higher to cover the cost of transporting some eggs from the Midwest, though 
economists say those costs are not a significant factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Vons, Ralphs and Lucky didn't respond to requests for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that eggs are hugely profitable for Southern California grocers. A 
rule of thumb in the grocery business is that supermarkets must charge 
consumers at least 25% more than what they pay for an item to make a profit. At 
February's wholesale price of 51 cents a dozen, Southern California 
supermarkets charged consumers an average 225% more than what they paid for 
large eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a random survey in Los Angeles County this week, we spotted a dozen large 
eggs at Alpha Beta for $2.19 (79 cents with a coupon) and at Vons-owned 
Pavilions stores for 99 cents (39 cents with a coupon). 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said egg prices nationally shot up in 1983 when a salmonella outbreak in 
chickens sharply reduced supplies. The market recovered in 1984 and retail egg 
prices dropped across the land, except in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Through most of the country, he said, "$1 a dozen is a barrier (grocers) are 
concerned about breaking." In California, he said, the price barrier is around 
$2, although supermarkets occasionally go through it. 
</P>
<P>
 And we thought only geese laid golden eggs. 
</P>

 New credit card: A community bank in Boston expects to launch a credit card 
soon aimed at the city's half a million gays and lesbians, becoming one of a 
handful of financial institutions to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Wainwright Bank & Trust Co. said it plans to offer the card in May. The bank 
will donate an amount equal to 1% of charge volume to nonprofit gay and lesbian 
organizations. People who use the affinity card will be asked to chose 
beneficiaries from a preapproved list of charitable organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wainwright Vice President Steven F. Young said the bank expects at least 1,000 
people will sign up for the card initially. Such a response would double the 
bank's card holders; it currently issues a traditional-style MasterCard. While 
Young expects many users of the new card will be gay or lesbian, he said the 
card, to be called the Freedom Card, is for "anyone who believes in social 
equity." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle-based SeaFirst National Bank, a unit of Bank of America, has the Pride 
Card, issued with Pride Foundation, a gay and lesbian nonprofit organization in 
Seattle. It has 800 active card holders.

 Odds and ends: "Under new management and ownership," shouts an ad for the 
Villas at Fox Hills in the February issue of the advertising circular, 
"Apartments for Rent." Who's the new owner? "The bank," said a rental agent for 
the apartment complex. . . . The Federal Trade Commission said the parent 
company of Popeye's and Church's fast-food chains settled charges that it 
misstated the recyclability of its food containers. The FTC said while the 
containers were capable of being recycled, virtually no collection facilities 
accept food-contaminated paper.

'CIRCUIT BREAKERS:' AIR BAG OR BAND-AID?; STOCKS: WALL STREET IS DIVIDED ON 
ANTI-CRASH RULES THAT APPLY THE BRAKES IN A STEEP MARKET DECLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the controversial "circuit breaker" mechanisms adopted by the New York 
Stock Exchange since the 1987 market crash kicked in Thursday for the seventh 
time this year -- and once again appeared to achieve its purpose of stabilizing 
share prices and staving off panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many on Wall Street are pleased with the rule, which bars computer-driven 
trading linked to stock index futures once the Dow Jones industrial average has 
fallen 50 points. Additional circuit breakers -- culminating in the suspension 
of all stock trading -- take effect in the event of more radical market 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circuit breakers are working," said Glenn Fogle, a mutual fund manager 
with 20th Century Funds in Kansas City, Mo. "They hold back the computer-driven 
business and force someone to make a conscious decision to sell. Computers 
don't have emotions, and it's better that the market reflect the emotions of 
the people who own the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many others contend that circuit breakers are a bad idea. Critics say they 
simply delay stock price changes that are bound to take place anyway, and thus 
render the markets less efficient. And, it remains unclear what the effects of 
the more Draconian circuit breakers would be, in the event of a severe 
sell-off. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best, they slow things down," said Gus Sauter, vice president for 
quantitative equity investing at the Vanguard Group, a mutual fund company in 
Valley Forge, Pa. When the Dow industrials were down 72 points Thursday 
morning, the 50-point rule actually delayed a recovery, Sauter said, by 
preventing stock prices from adjusting immediately to a rally in the futures 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the 50-point rule slows the decline of share prices, noted Jeremy 
Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School 
of Business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it makes any difference to where the market is eventually going 
to go, but it may cut back on intra-day volatility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel pointed out several pitfalls, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the market inefficiency caused by delaying price changes may make the 
U.S. stock market relatively less attractive to investors, he said. If so, the 
rules may be depressing share prices across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Siegel said, records show that price slides tend to accelerate as 
they approach the 50-point level, as investors try to beat the cut-off. This 
"suction" may be even more dramatic and damaging in the case of other circuit 
breakers, the most extreme of which suspends all trading in the event of a 
250-point decline in the Dow industrials. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, market watchers say the circuit breakers have helped to stave off panic 
on the part of individual investors. That may be especially important in the 
current market, which has been driven to new heights by hordes of first-time 
investors putting their savings into mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics question whether even that effect is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Amar Bhide, a management professor at the Harvard Business School in 
Cambridge, Mass., said the whole idea of regulatory intervention toward 
building public confidence in Wall Street is wrongheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent they contribute to the perception that Wall Street is a 
well-run, well-governed casino," Bhide says, rules such as the circuit breakers 
encourage a short-term investment mentality and attract small investors who 
should not be in the stock market at all. Putting on the Breaks 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, Federal regulators and stock 
exchange officials agreed on a series of "circuit breaker" mechanisms designed 
to prevent extreme swings in share prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 50-point rule: When the Dow Jones average falls (or rises) 50 points 
from the previous day's close, computer-driven sell (or buy) orders linked to 
stock index futures trading are blocked. This prevents automated hedging, or 
risk-reduction, strategies from accelerating a market decline. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "sidecar" procedures: When the price of the main S&P 500 stock index 
futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange falls by 12 points 
-- equivalent to about 90 points in the Dow Jones average -- trading in those 
contracts is suspended for 30 minutes. Programmed buy and sell orders for the 
corresponding stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are diverted into a special 
computer file, where they are held for five minutes. In the event of a severe 
order imbalance on a particular stock, trading in the stock is halted, and 
information on the imbalance is disseminated to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trading halts: If the Dow Jones average falls 250 points during one day, 
trading on all U.S. equity and futures markets is suspended for one hour. If 
the Dow Jones average then falls an additional 150 points, trading is suspended 
for an additional two hours.

CLINTON TRIES TO CALM STOCK MARKET JITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton sought to calm a jittery stock market Thursday, saying that 
"these corrective things will happen from time to time, but there's no reason 
to overreact." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks were aimed at preventing a panicked reaction from small 
investors, many of whom have little experience with the stock market. The 
President's comments also reflect concern among his advisers that the recent 
decline could get much worse if individuals who have invested in mutual funds 
over the last two years begin to pull out in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is to reassure people so that we don't go beyond 
skittishness," Clinton told reporters after visiting an elementary school in 
San Diego, where he is vacationing. "No one believes that there's a serious 
problem with the underlying economy. It is healthy and it is sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The market, Clinton said, "is subject to movements which may sometimes be a 
little more than is warranted by the economic circumstances one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton received a briefing on the market from his 
economic advisers, who warned that the decline could last several more weeks, 
perhaps months, before turning around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three years of fairly steady increases, the Dow Jones average 
has declined roughly 9% in the last two months as interest rates have begun to 
climb. Despite Thursday's trading, in which the market closed slightly higher 
after an initial sharp fall, Administration analysts believe further declines 
are all but certain in the weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have now is a massive indigestion problem in the market," said a 
senior Administration official, reflecting views conveyed to the President. The 
decline does not reflect any fundamental weakness in the economy, nor any real 
inflation pressure, the official insisted, but "unfortunately these things can 
go on for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent analysts believe the market could decline another 10% or 
more before stabilizing later this year -- a view that Administration officials 
do not dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market had a very rapid run-up last year," Clinton said. "It might 
have been a little bit too high, and maybe a lot of this is people just kind of 
working that out." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, senior Administration officials and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan last year discussed the problems posed by an overheated market, and 
some analysts believe that a desire to slowly let some air out of the market 
contributed to the Fed's moves so far this year to raise interest rates -- a 
view that Administration officials who have talked with Greenspan do not 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The worry now, Administration policy-makers say, is that any hope of letting 
the market down slowly could be washed away if the most recent round of 
declines triggers a panic among small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many such investors, including many elderly Americans, put money into mutual 
funds in the last couple of years as declining interest rates made money market 
funds, certificates of deposit and other forms of savings less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 There is "a real possibility" that those investors, many of whom have never 
been through a declining market, might now pull their money out -- making the 
decline even worse, the senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a sustained market decline had no impact on the underlying economy, 
officials concede that it could pose severe political problems for Clinton in 
much the same way that the last major decline, in the fall of 1987, posed 
problems for then-President Ronald Reagan. The problem could be particularly 
acute for Clinton, whose popularity among Americans seemed over the last year 
to be tied to their perceptions of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the other problems he faces and the list of proposals he has pending 
before Congress, Clinton could ill afford to deal with a serious stock market 
slump, his aides concede. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's aides do not believe there is much they can do to stem the market 
decline. The President's effort at jawboning came despite considerable 
skepticism from some officials, who believe that most of the market's recent 
decline reflects decisions made by huge traders who are more or less impervious 
to statements -- either soothing or threatening -- from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we got up and started making speeches about the market, I think people 
would just laugh," said one official a few hours before Clinton spoke. "I don't 
like it, but we're just going to have to go through this period."

THE BIZ / JOHN LIPPMAN: FOX PREPARING TO UNVEIL NEW CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Rupert Murdoch reached out to recruit Nickelodeon executive Anne Sweeney 
to head up Fox's new cable channel, he was high on enthusiasm but short on 
specifics. There were already dozens of cable networks serving niche audiences 
and it was hard to imagine anything new. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rupert felt the 18- to 49-year-old audience was underserved," Sweeney says, 
explaining how Murdoch sketched out only a bare concept. "Frankly it struck me 
dumb for a moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Sweeney quickly came around. On June 1, Fox will launch FX, its 
first foray into the highly competitive cable TV network business. The 
cornerstone of the new channel will be its seven hours a day of live 
programming, a mixture of seat-of-the-pants entertainment and reruns of campy 
old series like "Fantasy Island" and "The Green Hornet." 
</P>
<P>
 FX is being billed as the first "general entertainment" cable channel to 
launch since the industry was in its infancy 15 years ago. Since then, cable 
networks have become increasingly narrow in their focus, appealing to slivers 
of the audience. Fox plans an opposite strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are creating a concept more 1950s in style, with the faults but also the 
benefits of live TV," says Robert Redella, vice president of programming at Cox 
Cable in Atlanta, one of the country's largest cable operators. "That's what's 
lacking in today's TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox executives are cagey about how many subscribers FX will have at launch, 
but they promise it will be at least as many as the 17 million TNT had when it 
started in 1989, which was the biggest launch of a new network in cable 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 78 different cable networks already in existence and another 75 on 
the drawing board in anticipation of the 500-channel universe, the TV dial is 
becoming dangerously overcrowded. Channel "surfing" is now the preferred 
viewing method for a whole generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney says Fox is acutely aware of that and therefore has developed a format 
for FX that is designed -- in theory -- to hold the viewer's attention: "The 
premise about this network is reconnecting with the viewer, and the route to 
that is to get into the local community." 
</P>
<P>
 Originating out of New York, FX will start with a live two-hour show titled 
"Breakfast Time," and proceed through the day alternating between live 
programming and old network reruns, capping with a late-night talk show called 
"Back Chat." 
</P>
<P>
 The live segments will include old chestnuts like "The Pet Show" and more 
novel ideas such as "Personal FX," where families holding garage sales will be 
interviewed about what memories their belongings evoke -- as well as a host 
taking calls from potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 FX will also dispatch a fleet of video vans around the country to visit 
communities for a week at a time, feeding back reports that will be integrated 
into various shows. The head of original programming at FX is Mark Sonnenberg, 
who previously was executive producer for the "KTLA Morning News," the highly 
rated news show-cum-comedy troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low-budget concept of many of the shows, Fox says it is spending 
$100 million in programming during the first year. Sweeney says between $10 
million to $20 million has been allocated for promotion, with Fox-owned and 
affiliated TV stations as well as Murdoch-owned magazines like TV Guide and 
Mirabella expected to join the publicity bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on advertising support and subscriber growth, Sweeney says FX will 
become profitable between its third and sixth years. In any case, when the 
costs of programming, promotion, marketing, overhead and satellite time are 
tallied, Fox will likely have invested several hundred million dollars. FX's 
staff will total 120 employees by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 That could represent a smaller risk than other cable TV network launches in 
the past. FX was born out of last year's complicated cable TV regulations. 
Under the new law, TV stations were granted the right to negotiate payment for 
carriage from local cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, in lieu of cash payments, some stations sought a "second channel" on 
their local cable system to program themselves. Fox executives convinced their 
affiliates to give them their extra channel on the cable systems in exchange 
for sharing in FX's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is what some critics have dubbed the "retransmission channel" after 
its origins in the heavily lobbied cable TV bill adopted by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, cable TV networks started with an idea and then negotiated deals 
to be carried by local operators. In the case of FX, the anchor deal with cable 
giant Tele-Communications Inc. was made first and the idea for what the channel 
would be was hammered out later. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Murdoch's reputation and muscle behind it, committing valuable 
channel space to a new network, sight unseen, makes some operators 
understandably nervous. Indeed, with the so-called retransmission consent 
provisions in the new cable law, Cox's Redella acknowledges it would have been 
difficult to launch FX. But, he notes, ABC did the same thing to launch ESPN-2 
and NBC did it for its new cable network, America's Talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox had a window of opportunity and they took advantage of it," Redella says.

DEFECTIONS, MERGER SHAKE UP CLOSED WORLD; HOLLYWOOD: BREAKUP OF BRESLAUER, 
JACOBSON, RUTMAN & CHAPMAN CHANGES THE STATUS QUO OF MANAGERS' WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't often that the secretive world of Hollywood business managers is 
shaken up, probably due in part to its origins in the staid world of 
accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what happened this week when three partners with the elite firm of 
Breslauer, Jacobson, Rutman & Chapman chose to leave to form their own company. 
</P>
<P>
 The defections of Nancy Chapman, Terry Bird and Bonnie Grey proved the 
catalyst that prompted what remains of the Breslauer firm to merge with 
competitor Siegel, Feldstein, Duffin & Vuylsteke, a West Los Angeles accounting 
firm specializing in entertainment that has enjoyed close links to the music 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the day-to-day accounting that goes on behind the scenes involving 
millions of dollars earned by Hollywood's top stars, directors, musicians and 
executives. Despite inroads by major accounting firms over the years, the 
business largely remains in the hands of a few boutique firms that clients use 
largely because they push highly personal service. 
</P>
<P>
 The very low profile Gerald Breslauer for years has been widely regarded as 
something like Hollywood's unofficial chief financial officer, handling money 
and helping invest funds for the likes of David Geffen, Steven Spielberg, 
Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen. In large part, Breslauer's firm has 
grown thanks to referrals from prominent Hollywood lawyer Barry Hirsch and the 
influential Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Breslauer, through a spokesman, declined to discuss the events. But in a 
statement Thursday, Breslauer said that the merger with Siegel, Feldstein gives 
the firm better geographic representation in New York, San Francisco and Boston 
and "access to a larger pool of competition professions" to serve clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, partner Barry Siegel said that the merger should be completed 
by May 1. The name of the new firm has not been decided, although Siegel said 
one possibility is that there will be a new umbrella name under which each firm 
would operate as a division. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Chapman, Bird and Grey said they chose to leave because of a 
"shared business objective and mutual desire to offer more personalized yet 
sophisticated hands-on financial and business management services" to clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Which clients will chose which firm in the split up is still being decided. 
But sources note that Breslauer -- who started in the business in 1951 out of 
UCLA -- commands an unusually high degree of loyalty and trust in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, sources close to Breslauer estimated that his management company 
directly managed about $750 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Breslauer's most visible deals -- one that proved to be ill-fated -- 
involved investing in the parent of Mercantile National Bank in Century City. 
Breslauer had long dreamed of creating a business managers' bank and helped 
spearhead an investment group that included Creative Artists Agency and such 
stars as Demi Moore, Tina Turner and Richard Dreyfuss. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mercantile National, hit hard by real estate-related losses shortly after 
the investment was made, was told by regulators to improve its financial 
condition.

2 PLEAD INNOCENT IN HONDA CASE; COURTS: THE FORMER EXECUTIVES, ONE A LAGUNA 
HILLS MAN, ARE ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING THE CAR FIRM OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
KICKBACK SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former American Honda Motor Co. executives, accused in a kickback scheme 
that allegedly defrauded the company of millions of dollars, pleaded innocent 
Thursday in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for former Senior Vice President S. James Cardiges, 48, of Laguna 
Hills, called Cardiges a scapegoat but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident the evidence will ultimately show that Jim Cardiges didn't 
defraud anyone, including American Honda," said his lawyer, Philip Israels of 
Sherman Oaks. Cardiges is charged with racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Damien Budnick, 45, of Orlando, Fla., pleaded innocent to conspiracy to commit 
mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Indictments against the two men and three others charge them with accepting 
cash and gifts, including Rolex watches, luxury cars, furniture, real estate 
and, in Cardiges' case, 10 $1,000 business suits. Investigators allege that the 
kickbacks were part of a scheme involving 30 to 40 of Honda's hundreds of U.S. 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations, spanning the years from 1979 to 1992 and involving roughly 
$10 million, include people paying as much as $750,000 for the right to open 
dealerships for Hondas and the company's luxury Acura cars. In other cases, 
dealers paid to get larger allocations of popular models and executives got 
kickbacks from inflated payments for advertising and training, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The others charged are John Billmyer of Raleigh, N.C., David Pedersen of 
Roswell, Ga., and Dennis Josleyn of Penn Valley, Calif. They are to be 
arraigned within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 All five were arrested last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other former Honda sales executives have pleaded guilty to fraud- and 
bribery-related charges, including conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Magistrate William Barry set a trial date of June 7 for Cardiges 
and Budnick, who remain free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges was the top U.S. sales executive in the Honda division of American 
Honda. His lawyers say he is now in private business but would not say where or 
what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 During Cardiges' arrest, FBI agents seized corporate, banking and financial 
records from his home, as well as some gifts he allegedly accepted from Honda 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Connolly said Cardiges' lawyers 
looked through the boxes of material and removed documents they say are 
protected under the attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly said he wants to check what was taken to ensure that it is privileged 
and asked Barry to bar defense lawyers from alleging that the evidence is 
tainted if the government examines it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges' lawyers refused to go along, however, and Barry sided with them. 
Connolly thus must trust the defense or check the evidence and risk not being 
able to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're on the horns of a dilemma, sir," Barry told Connolly. "That's one of 
the perils of the job of a U.S. attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong investigation was prompted by a civil lawsuit filed in 1991 by a 
New Hampshire Acura dealer, Richard Nault. Nault alleged that American Honda 
forced him out of business by failing to deliver all the cars he had been 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was settled for a reported $5 million last year, but U.S. District 
Judge Steven McAuliffe ordered an investigation of the bribery allegations.

HOME BUILDING PERMITS JUMP 78% FOR JAN., FEB.; CONSTRUCTION: MORE THAN 1,100 
PERMITS FOR NEW SINGLE-FAMILY AND MULTIFAMILY HOUSING UNITS WERE ISSUED DURING 
THE FIRST TWO MONTHS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Signaling a welcome increase in activity after a long slump for local home 
builders, the number of residential construction permits issued in Orange 
County during January and February nearly doubled from the same period last 
year, according to figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Construction Industry Research Board, a statewide trade group in Burbank, 
found that 1,105 permits for new single-family and multifamily housing units 
were issued during the first two months this year, an increase of 78% from the 
622 permits issued during January and February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Building permits -- which must be obtained months before construction actually 
starts -- indicate a developer's intent to modify or construct a structure of 
any kind, from hotels to houses to churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County stands out as an area of increased activity. Other counties, 
especially Los Angeles, are not showing this," said Ben Bartolotto, research 
director with the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bartolotto said he does not think these kinds of gains in permit activity 
will continue throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question that comes to my mind is whether this is just a good start or a 
sustainable level," he said. "My sense is that this may not be sustainable for 
the whole year. I don't think that in 1994 we're going to double last year's 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 In commercial and industrial real estate, the gains were not so dramatic. 
Permits were issued in January and February for the construction of $16.6 
million in commercial space. That compared to $10.5 million for the same period 
last year. There were no permits issued for new industrial buildings, the 
construction research board found. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, non-residential building permits issued in January and February 
totaled $59.6 million, compared to $49 million for the same period last year, 
the board reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercial and industrial sectors remain weak in Orange County," 
Bartolotto said. "Industrial is basically nonexistent. That signals that 
there's still not a lot of job growth." Building Momentum 
</P>
<P>
 Permits in Orange County for single-family and multifamily housing units 
increased 78% in the first two months of the year, compared to the same period 
last year. The jump ends a three-year lull that began in 1991 but remains 45% 
below the 2,015 permits issued in the peak period of January-February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 New housing permits Jan.-Feb. '94: 1,105

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; IRVINE CO. MULLING POSSIBLE REPEAT OF PUBLIC STOCK 
OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After completing the Irvine Co.'s first public stock offering last year -- a 
trust consisting of much of its apartment holdings -- billionaire owner Donald 
L. Bren may be at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County real estate watchers are speculating that the Irvine Co. may be 
eyeing the feasibility of selling a real estate investment trust composed of 
its office and industrial properties and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are a way for developers to tap the 
public markets by selling shares in real estate to investors. Investors are 
attracted by the high returns and developers see REITs as a way to gain badly 
needed capital, often for expansion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've said publicly that we continue to explore the public markets," 
said Richard G. Sim, executive vice president of the Irvine Co. "We're studying 
all our options. Maybe we would do another REIT or go to the banks. We're not 
sure yet."  
</P>
<P>
 One property that could make REIT fodder is the Irvine Spectrum, an industrial 
park with an estimated 7% vacancy rate. Sim predicts that, with plans calling 
for more and more theaters, shops and restaurants, it will become the "downtown 
of South County."

AMERICA WEST CUTS FARES; OTHERS JOIN IN

<TEXT>
<P>
 America West Airlines said Thursday it is cutting advance-purchase fares on 
some flights by nearly a third, and most other major airlines followed suit in 
the latest round of fare sales. 
</P>
<P>
 America West's announcement followed moves earlier in the week by major 
carriers to expand an air fare sale. 
</P>
<P>
 United, TWA, USAir and American said they will match America West's rates and 
times in overlapping markets. Bill Gatman, a Delta marketing representative, 
said his airline was studying America West's move. 
</P>
<P>
 The America West discounts require a 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday 
night stay. Tickets must be bought by April 27 for travel through July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: New York-San Jose, $458 round trip, down from the full fare of 
$674; Seattle-Dallas, $388, down from $558; Minneapolis-Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport, $418, down from $543. 
</P>
<P>
 America West's most recent sale, similar to the new one but different in 
details, was announced Feb. 28 and expired on Thursday, as did the other major 
airlines' previous reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline has 16 flights a day at John Wayne Airport.

EASTER GIFTS MAKE RETAILERS HOP FOR JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Easter Bunny arrives on Sunday, handing out chocolates and 
marshmallow eggs, he'll also give many children -- and toy makers -- a second 
chance for those presents that Santa never left under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Easter has become another occasion for children, especially young children, to 
receive toys and other gifts. It's unlikely to reach the magnitude of 
Christmas, but the holiday still gives retailers and manufacturers a small but 
welcome lift in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have been giving children plush bunnies and similar toys for Easter 
for years -- it is the biggest holiday in the plush business. But other toys 
increasingly are making their way into Easter baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 For some families, Easter gifts are a new tradition. Donna Weber, a Greenlawn, 
N.Y., mother of two, said she started giving Easter gifts to her children 
because "what we're trying to do is stay away from all this candy." She buys 
small gifts such as books and crayons. 
</P>
<P>
 Easter gift-giving is not limited to children. Mervyn's, the 276-store chain 
owned by Dayton Hudson Corp. that sells mostly clothing, stocks up on ceramic 
gift ware and plush items for the holiday. "We have seen the business in toys 
and gifts increase over the last few years," spokeswoman Kathy Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's and other upscale stores are advertising Waterford crystal 
Easter eggs and other trinkets aimed at adults. Hallmark sells Easter tree 
decorations and other collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is the toy business that sees the biggest opportunities at Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us Inc. circulated its spring catalogue well before the holiday and 
placed inserts advertising a range of toys -- including prominently displayed 
pastel-colored bunnies -- inside Sunday newspapers. John Taylor, a toy industry 
analyst for L.H. Alton & Co., called the advertising "the first major effort 
that people have made in a while" to encourage toy-buying for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Playmates Toys Inc. is using Easter to relaunch the Pound Puppies line of 
plush mutts and another stuffed toy line, Magic Heart Helplings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toy manufacturers have noticed that for a long time, there's usually a 
(sales) blip around the Easter season, partly because there's more retail 
traffic," said Diane Teigiser, director of merchandising for Playmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Toy makers are "taking advantage of the fact that more people are in the 
stores buying clothing for the Easter holidays," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade group, said that last year 
manufacturers shipped 9% of their merchandise during March in preparation for 
Easter. That compared to 6% in February and 5% in April. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Tiger Electronics Inc. offered a $10 rebate on its popular Toby 
Terrier toy specifically for the Easter season, spokesman Mark Rosenberg said. 
The company also is bringing out a line of preschool electronic games in time 
for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really something we've focused on in the last three or four years 
because Easter has become a major buying holiday," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the toy makers' push at Easter comes from their desire to spread the 
risks of a business that historically has been concentrated at Christmas. Most 
of their new product introductions are scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry "latched on to other seasons for people to buy toys," said Bruce 
Maguire, a spokesman for Tyco Toys Inc. Tyco sells plush toys around Easter, 
but it has also promoted Magna-Doodle, a drawing toy, as an Easter gift in 
commercials this spring.

SHE SAID, HE SAID / ANN CONWAY AND PATRICK MOTT: WHEN IT COMES TO THE SARTORIAL 
EASTER PARADE, SPRING IS IN THE FLAIR

 S urprise! They're bickering again. She wants to dress up for Easter brunch; 
he's thinking about wearing Bermudas and one of his you-know-what shirts. She 
puts "Easter Parade" on the VCR, begs him to get a load of natty Fred Astaire 
strolling on "the Avenue, Fifth Avenue . . . ." He, well , comes around.  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: An aloha shirt on Easter? I bet Don Ho doesn't even wear one. Look at 
Fred -- all elegance and panache. Those were the days.  
</P>
<P>
 I know we're hitting a poolside brunch. But why not Vogue it? I can't wear my 
ecru linen suit, white straw hat and pearls if you look like you just jumped 
off an outrigger. Maybe we should do brunch in Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Since you put it that way (big travel bucks or a new suit), I'll dress 
like Robert Redford in "The Great Gatsby." Which, now that I think about it, 
doesn't sound like a bad idea. Those ice cream suits can be pure hell if they 
come near anything that resembles dust (on an outdoor bench, say) but as long 
as you remain indoors or vertical most of the time you can cut a pretty fair 
dash. How about blazing white cotton with a powder blue shirt with a white 
collar and a fairly bright primary-colored tie? Or would that show you up (hee 
hee)? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: And your Panama? Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't help thinking about Easters gone by when I start planning my Easter 
Day ensemble. I see a parade of my old hats -- the goofy white number that 
looked like an inverted lampshade covered with rose petals, the pink pillbox 
that made me feel so sophisticated because it had a wisp of net that covered my 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the clear plastic one I made out of the top of a hatbox when I 
was in eighth grade. I wasn't the most imaginative student around, so when our 
teacher asked us to create hats for an Easter parade at the local park, I 
pulled a lid off my mom's hatbox, threaded it with blue ribbon and topped it 
with blue silk roses. I didn't win any prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: But you were acting in accordance with a very old tradition: the wearing 
of brand-new clothes on Easter. And that's not just something dreamed up by 
Macy's a few decades ago. It goes back to the time of the early Christians, 
when the wearing of new clothes at Easter time symbolized a cleansing from sin 
and a new, pure life. 
</P>
<P>
 Think that's why we tend to get a little lift every time we wear new clothes 
for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Indeed. Especially at Easter. They talk about spiritual renewal; why not 
sartorial renewal? I'll take a little lift wherever I can get it. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, my mother made my Easter outfits. I'll never forget those moments 
of standing perfectly still while she fitted each dress -- the blue and white 
striped cotton one, the pale yellow organza, the tea-rose polished cotton -- to 
my scrawny frame. Such a labor of love. How I wish I'd saved those dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I learned to tie a necktie for the first time at Easter. It's a little 
rite of passage for every boy, but this one had comic overtones. My dad had 
bought me my very own long tie, but he discovered that he couldn't tie it 
unless he was looking into a mirror. So in order to show me how it was done, he 
had to plant me in front of a mirror, stand behind me and reach around with 
both hands to knot the tie under my own collar.

 Weird science: Apparently it's hereditary. I can't do it without a mirror, 
either.

 SHE: Bring on those ties -- in pastels, stripes, zigzags, even cartoon images. 
They are to a man's face what a ruby or emerald necklace is to a woman's. I 
know they're a pain, and awfully expensive, but a perfectly chosen tie lights 
up a man's face. They also tell a woman: "I care enough about myself to go the 
extra mile." 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Hey, I'll cinch up that noose every time if I can be assured of seeing a 
big roomful of women wearing print dresses at Easter time. Those dresses seem 
to get better every year. I don't know what it is about print dresses and 
Easter, but springtime would fall completely flat without either of them. 
Besides, they both go together like May and baseball, June and picnics, July 
and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell you, a bright, flowing print dress being stirred by a spring breeze is 
a better tonic for me than Dodger season tickets and, believe me, that's saying 
a lot. If they appear at a wedding, I think they upstage the bride. On Easter, 
they just plain make me feel good. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: We love them too. Floaty print dresses bring out the girl in us. Too 
often these days, we women think we need to look like a man. We can have it 
both ways. A flirty print dress paired with a soft linen blazer gives us 
femininity with a tailored touch. 
</P>
<P>
 I think women have learned what men have known for ages -- stepping into pants 
and a jacket is a snap. So we're doing it too often. Tell you what, guys. You 
wear more ties; we'll wear more dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: My Easter tie is on my shopping list even now: the one with the huge 
iridescent bunny on it. And if I see, say, 25 print dresses in church on 
Sunday, I'll consider your part of the bargain kept.

 Hems may rise and fall, but the one to take note of this year does both: the 
asymmetrical skirt. Karl Lagerfeld offers it exquisitely for the House of 
Chanel, in crepe, wool gabardine or georgette. "It's one of the most important 
skirt silhouettes to date," notes Roger Martin, director of the South Coast 
Plaza Chanel boutique. Wear it as a separate or combine it with a classic 
single or double-breasted jacket (as pictured, $2,760). Talk While You Walk

 First they pumped. Then they lit up. Now sneakers enter a new domain with 
Talkables from E.S. Originals. At the press of a button, these kid's shoes, 
size 5 to 12, emit sounds with the aid of a micro chip. "We figured, if 
children liked the light, they definitely would react to sound," says spokesman 
Charles Becker. Girls can announce "I love you" from their saccharine-sweet 
shoes covered with hearts, flowers and a teddy bear. Boys, on the other hand, 
will have to settle for the simulated sound of a "vrooming" engine coming from 
their black racing car shoes. In the works are tennies featuring the ABCs and 
barnyard sounds. They're available at Kmart for about $17. Beanie Boy

 The Mecca New Yorkers visit for headgear? Billy Mecca, hat designer and king

hats, beanies have shown up in a variety of fabrics, from wool to cotton, and 
renditions -- such as the minimal skull cap and the grunge sock cap -- much to 
the credit of Mecca. "This sounds so cliche, but a whole wardrobe can change 
with a hat," he says. "It's a very personal thing." His puckered, floral 
georgette caps for spring ($32) are leading in both the adult and kid 
divisions. His full line sells nationwide from $18 to $45. D-Day

 In offices nationwide, Friday is celebrated as the last day of the workweek, 
the one before the weekend, the day nothing can go that wrong. But worker bees 
revere it, too, as "casual day," when they can exchange their fancy dress for 
denim. "The idea of Friday dressing was really born out of changing 
lifestyles," notes Peter Corritoria, president of Bass Shirtmakers. Because 
some industries have even adopted the trend throughout the week, the dress 
shirt company offers a denim twill cut that looks great with a tie. ROSE

SILK; SAVOR YOUR $9.95 T-SHIRTS WHILE YOU CAN. THIS RICH FABRIC MAY ONCE AGAIN 
BECOME THE CLOTH OF KINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is as precious as gold, as strong as steel, as light as gossamer. And, as 
the label says, it must be dry-cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's a myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Silk has been around for 4,600 years, dry cleaning only since the 1920s. But 
it is exceptionally light, exceptionally strong, and it may be on the verge of 
once again becoming the cloth of kings. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade, silk and silk garments have been flooding in from a newly 
industrial China, driving down prices to the humble realms of cotton and 
polyester. But that could change starting today when new U.S. restrictions on 
imports of silk apparel from China kick in. The days of the $9.95 silk T-shirt 
may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Silk's image has always been at odds with the casual, inexpensive merchandise 
worn by the masses in recent years to the grocery store or the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather, whose family made silk in Italy in the 1700s, associated silk 
with the age of Persian princesses," says John Sullivan, head of American Silk 
Mills in Plains, Pa. "It's regal and lush and special." 
</P>
<P>
 Most consumers would agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the customer's mind, silk has always been a prestige fabric," says Patty 
Sapp, a buyer for the Broadway stores, where silk blouses have sold for as 
little as two for $30. Such low prices have raised the question, "Can this be 
real silk?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes. But in many cases, it's not the fabric it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 In 2640 BC, the legend goes, the young Chinese empress Hsi Ling Shi discovered 
a blight on the royal mulberry trees. Gorging on their leaves were white worms 
that later entombed themselves in cocoons. When one of the cocoons dropped into 
her tea, the empress watched, fascinated, as a delicate, shining filament 
unwound in the hot liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 In no time, she and her minions developed a process of reeling the cocoon 
filament into threads, weaving the threads into fabric and sewing the fabric 
into finery. Then, voila, they turned the whole business into a closely guarded 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At its core is the silk moth, Bombyx mori, which flies a little, mates a lot, 
and produces hundreds of eggs in its short moth life. The eggs produce 
caterpillars that eat their weight daily in mulberry leaves, growing about 70 
times their original size. They then weave cocoons, extruding liquid silk and a 
gummy sealant called sericin at the rate of a foot a minute, and go to sleep -- 
or whatever you call the suspended animation of a chrysalis, or pupa. 
</P>
<P>
 If left alone, the moth would break through the cocoon and repeat the whole 
cycle. But nature's way would snap the single continuous thread -- sometimes a 
mile long -- and trip up production. So the chrysalis is killed by heat or 
steam, the cocoon is soaked in hot water to soften the sericin, and the silk 
thread is unwound and reeled off, together with the threads from several other 
cocoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's process differs only in the quantities produced and in high-tech 
improvements made in the worms' environment, incubation and feeding. Secrecy 
still shrouds rituals and "proprietary information known only to the Chinese 
and secret since the days of Marco Polo," says Cass Johnson, assistant director 
of international trade for the American Textile Manufacturers Institute in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 For 3,000 years, the Chinese trekked their silk cloth west over the deserts 
and mountains of the old Silk Road toward the gateways of the Mediterranean 
civilizations. Outsiders had no clues about its origin; some thought silk floss 
grew on trees. And its cost was great, controlled by Persian traders at the 
other end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But in AD 550, two spies sent by the Byzantine emperor brought back cocoons, 
and the secret was out. Tracing silk production from that point is like taking 
a subway ride through the ancient world. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, the business of weaving silk into cloth was dying out in many 
places, "killed off by the Japanese, who did it cheaper," says Hans Baumann, 
executive vice president of the Rudolph-Desco Co., a New Jersey-based importer 
of silk yarns. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. China, dormant during the decade-long Cultural Revolution, 
was "opened" by President Richard M. Nixon in the early 1970s and granted "most 
favored nation" status for trade by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, giving it 
widespread access to U.S. markets. With production facilities and a labor force 
in place, it was soon supplying much of the world's silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese silk has been imported to the United States without quotas and with 
low or no duties because the silk industry here -- unlike cotton or polyester 
-- is very small. "The purpose of duties," says U.S. Customs spokesman Greg 
Doss, "is to make money and protect what we make here. If we don't make it, it 
comes free." 
</P>
<P>
 The duty on finished apparel has been negligible, particularly contrasted with 
other fabrics -- 6% on silk sweaters and shirts, for example, 17% for wool, 21% 
for cotton, 34% for synthetics. Buoyed by investments and advice from business 
interests in Hong Kong and Taiwan, China last year sent us more than $1.8 
billion in silk garments, or about 75% of the $2.4 billion worth we imported, 
reports the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is now the largest overall supplier of apparel of all kinds," says Jim 
Langlois, director of the Seattle-based National Apparel and Textile Assn., 
representing importers and wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Chinese silk may be plentiful, but much of it is not of the quality 
you'd offer Persian princesses. These are fast-production goods with a 
mass-market goal -- heavy on plain, collarless, pocketless designs -- the realm 
of the silk T. Many of the items are labeled "washable," a confusing 
designation in that silk has always been washable if "you don't get aggressive 
with it," says Sullivan, who is also president if the International Silk 
Assn.'s U.S. chapter (See tips on care, this page.) 
</P>
<P>
 What's new about washable silk is that it's pre-washed and has presumably 
shrunk as much as it's going to -- up to 50%. It has already been dealt with 
aggressively, so it will probably take more of the same, including machine 
washing. 
</P>
<P>
 The very low-priced silk is almost always washable, says Roger Shatafian, 
president of Creative Natural Fabrics in Los Angeles, noting that "at those 
prices, it doesn't pay to send it out for dry cleaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, silk garments often bear "Dry-Clean Only" tags. In some cases, 
special handling is required, more likely because of the dyes involved than the 
fabric. In others, the company advises "Dry-Clean Only" to avoid returns, 
Baumann says. If something goes wrong, it's the dry cleaner's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Popularly priced silk has been a boon for retailers over the last few years. 
Now, something "always hard to get and very pricey has become available," says 
Sapp, of the Broadway. Chinese silk "went into blouses, jog suits, two-piece 
dresses, pants and tunics," she says, "and the growth of the silk business in 
(moderately priced) clothing has been exponential. It used to be all 
polyester." 
</P>
<P>
 The market for "all silk" businesses has also expanded. WinterSilks, a 
Wisconsin-based mail-order catalogue, was founded 14 years ago on knitted silk 
underwear, an upscale cold-weather accouterment appealing to skiers, outdoor 
types and the "dominant user" -- urban career women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's lightweight, and insulates well and wicks moisture away from the skin," 
explains John Jeffery, company president. With up to 15 Chinese factories under 
contract to supply garments, WinterSilks -- now a $30-million business -- has 
added another catalogue, Silk Collection, of dressier garments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chinese dominance has also meant hard times for would-be competitors in 
the United States, which is lacking in silkworms and low-cost labor. The last 
of U.S. companies that made thread from silk fiber closed six years ago, and 
makers of silk fabric have bailed out of the apparel market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mill door cost (labor and materials alone) now is higher than the selling 
price of Chinese fabric," says Sullivan of American Silk Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 His company -- one of only a dozen U.S. silk manufacturers left -- instead 
weaves its silk for home furnishings, such as upholstery and draperies. 
"Sadly," he said, "the Chinese goods are as low-grade as possible. I feel for 
them -- they need to employ people there -- but it has caused the loss of a 
high art form." 
</P>
<P>
 Other arms of the industry have their own troubles. Shatafian, who imports 
better-quality silk fabrics from South Korea and China, sells mostly to 
high-end clothing manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the low end, our manufacturers can't compete with the low-quality finished 
garments coming in," he says. "In the last two or three years, China is 
actually selling garments cheaper than we can sell fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 The quotas on imported Chinese silk, announced by Clinton Administration trade 
officials in January, will apply to finished clothing, not to silk fiber, 
thread or fabric. But U.S. makers and importers of silk say they didn't seek 
the change and were not the primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade officials confirm that the quotas are designed to protect low-priced, 
non-silk apparel made here. In other words, Jeffery says, "(U.S. Trade 
Representative) Mickey Kantor was protecting cotton." Or, others say, 
polyester. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction is mixed. Speaking for manufacturers, Sullivan says it may 
"encourage more people to manufacture their garments here, if we could compete 
on price points. Maybe it will encourage Seventh Avenue to look to do more with 
American mills." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for importers, Langlois of the textile association says: "We aren't 
pleased because we don't like to see any limits on the trade." 
</P>
<P>
 No one is sure how much or how soon the quotas might affect prices here. But 
if ever there was a time to hoard silk Ts, it's now. Silk / The Delicate Cycle 
</P>
<P>
 A silk garment is the culmination of a long process that begins with a 
brightly colored caterpillar. Raised on farms throughout the world, the Bombyx 
mori, or silkworm, spins a cocoon that yields a strong, elastic, lightweight 
fiber. The thread is then dyed and woven into the cloth people love for its 
soft, luxurious feel. 
</P>
<P>
 1. A female silkworm moth lays 300 or more eggs in early summer, depositing 
them on strips of special paper, then dies. The eggs are placed in cold storage 
until the following spring, then moved to an incubator. After about 20 days, 
the eggs hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The tiny worms, kept on trays, eat fresh mulberry leaves almost continually 
around the clock. After four to five weeks, they have grown about 70 times 
their original size and shed their skins four times. About 3 inches long and 1 
inch thick when full grown, a worm has 12 body sections and three pairs of 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Now ready to make their cocoons, the worms creep into compartments 
containing twigs or straw. They attach themselves to the sticks, then -- 
swinging their heads from side to side to release the fluid that hardens into 
silk thread -- form cocoons. After about three days, the cocoon is completed 
and the worm changes into a pupa. Farmers allow a small percentage of pupae to 
develop into moths. The rest are killed. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The cocoons are shipped to a factory to unwind. They are placed in a basin 
of hot water to dissolve a gummy natural substance, sericin, that holds their 
threads together. The filaments are then drawn together and pulled through a 
tiny guide. The melted sericin binds several filaments into a single thread, 
which is wound on to a reel. The silk is later rewound into skeins. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Because the raw silk is still too weak for weaving, it must be strengthened 
through "throwing," or the twisting of strands to produce specific weights of 
thread for weaving. After throwing, the silk is boiled in hot soap to remove 
the sericin. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Dyes are applied to silk either before (skein dyeing) or after (piece 
dyeing) weaving. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Silk yarns are woven into cloth on automatic power looms, which can produce 
designs and patterns.

 As import rules have relaxed, so has the price of silk. A sampling of blouses

</P>
<P>
 How to Keep It Clean 
</P>
<P>
 Although some manufacturers recommend dry-cleaning, silk can be hand-washed. 
Observe these guidelines for best results: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash separately in lukewarm water with a gentle detergent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse in lukewarm or cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove excess water by rolling garment in a towel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hang in a cool, dark place to dry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Iron at low temperature on the reverse side while still damp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Tips 
</P>
<P>
 * Always apply perfume or deodorant before donning a silk garment 
</P>
<P>
 * Never expose silk to strong, direct light for a long time period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never soak silk in water for a long time period.

 Santa Ana winds can leave you plagued with dry, itchy skin. The condition is 
the result of dehydration (lack of moisture) or a lack of natural skin oils, 
according to Joey Marie, owner of Unique Impressions skin-care salon in Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people with extremely dry skin have a combination of the two conditions, 
and treating the problem on both fronts will bring about rapid improvement. 
"Men are particularly susceptible because some rarely use moisturizers," said 
Marie. According to a 1991 Simmons Market Research Bureau report, only 49.1% of 
men use hand and body lotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things people do to treat the problem can actually make it worse, 
like taking a long, hot bubble bath or scrubbing at flaky skin." Here are her 
suggestions on improving skin condition in preparation for warm-weather months 
when you'll want to bare a little skin that doesn't look and feel like 
sandpaper. Dehydration and Oil Depletion 
</P>
<P>
 Adding Moisture 
</P>
<P>
 * Drink up: Keep a bottle of fresh water with you at all times. Sipping 
throughout the day replenishes moisture lost from exposure to sun, wind and 
heated rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid cigarettes, coffee, tea and cola: These deplete your system of 
necessary fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Protect from sun and wind: Most of us use sun block during hot summer 
months, but in Southern California, exposure to sun is a year-round concern. 
Use a moisturizer with sun block and reapply lipstick or lip protectant 
frequently on windy days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create humidity: Forced-air heating depletes moisture from the air in your 
home, office and automobile. Sleep with a humidifier near your bed to make up 
for this imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining Natural Oils 
</P>
<P>
 * Mealtime: Not enough fat in the diet affects the body's ability to produce 
enough sebum to lubricate skin surfaces. Skin lacking this natural protectant 
is overly sensitive and easily damaged. Its natural moisture evaporates 
quickly, undermining efforts to improve moisture balance. Supplements 
containing vitamins A, C and E also help build beautiful skin from the inside 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bath time: Contrary to popular belief, a long, hot session in the tub or 
shower will not help dry skin. Prolonged exposure to hot water can deplete 
oils. Stay away from bath salts and bubble bath, because many contain harsh 
alcohol-based solutions that only add to your skin problem. Likewise for 
chlorinated pools and spas. Be sure to wash off thoroughly and apply lotion 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bedtime: Don't sleep with your face buried in your pillow. Your skin 
replenishes itself while you sleep, and your pillow could be absorbing oils and 
moisture beneficial to your face. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dryness Persists 
</P>
<P>
 * Switch detergents: Harsh cleaners leave a residue in clothing that is 
irritating and drying for sensitive skin. Shop around for a mild formula or use 
a minimal amount. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse out fabric finishes: Many people complain of itching and dryness after 
wearing new clothes that are treated with a protective finish. Always wash new 
clothes before wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * See a doctor: A dermatologist or internist can determine if your dry skin is 
caused by a medical problem, such as allergies or a thyroid condition. Skin 
Care Products 
</P>
<P>
 An assessment of your skin care routine at a specialty salon such as Unique 
Impressions will also help you improve the condition of your skin. "Products 
that work well for a friend might not work well for you, since each person 
needs to find the right combination for their skin," Marie said. "It is also 
important to make adjustments based on your progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Unique Impressions features the Dermologica line, developed by the 
International Dermal Institute. "It's emphasis is on natural ingredients and 
maintaining the skin's proper acid mantle," Marie said. "There is no 
formaldehyde, artificial color or fragrances or alcohol in the products." 
</P>
<P>
 A basic Dermologica skin care kit for your face or body costs $37. The 
products are also available separately. Each are packaged in 
contamination-proof bottles, which allow you to squeeze out the amount needed, 
without sticking your fingers into a jar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soap is a four-letter word: The pH level (acid to alkaline ratio) of soap is 
much too acidic for the face. "That tight feeling you get after using soap is a 
result of your skin being stripped of oils and moisture," Marie said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alternative: Dermologica's cream- or gel-based cleanser, depending on your 
skin type. ($20 for 8 oz.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid astringents: Especially those with specially denatured alcohol or 
witch hazel. Dermologica offers a spray-on herbal toner ($21 for 8 oz.) for use 
after cleansing that will help your skin retain moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a mild scrub: "Dry skin lookslike a layer of dead skin, so many people 
will try to remove it by using a harsh almond or apricot scrub," Marie said. 
"But this can worsen the problem." A skin prep scrub made of corn cob meal 
($21.50 for 2.5 oz. tube) with soothing skin conditioners is recommended 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moisturizers: "It should be lightweight, so it won't clog pores. Moisturizer 
also protects against wind, sun and pollution. Men should use it too," Marie 
said. Dermologica offers moisturizers for three skin types ($25-$30). 
</P>
<P>
 * Specialty products: The Dermologica line also includes masques, concentrated 
skin boosters and an intensive oil replacement product for occasional use. 
"These go beyond the daily routine to help achieve and maintain the condition 
of your skin". 
</P>
<P>
 * Salon treatments: Unique Impressions offers hydrating treatments to plump up 
your parched skin cells. Techniques include warm masks, gentle steaming and 
penetrating moisture creams. Facials range from $35-$55. These may include a 
hydrating hot paraffin treatment for the hands or feet. The paraffin treatment 
is also available separately ($10 for hands, $20 for feet and $25 for both).

FAUX PAS REPORT: WELL-HEELED WOMEN LEAD THE PACK NOW THAT IT'S BELL WEATHER 
</P>

 Everyone's wearing their new spring outfits, if you haven't noticed already, 
and the popular choice of the season is the billowy pantaloon. But these wide, 
bell- and flare-bottomed trousers are being paired with some odd shoe choices, 
including tennis togs and massive Doc Martens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general rule with those type of pants is, if you're tall, you can wear 
either high, clunky heels or flats," says Liz Menzies of Swept Away Clothes to 
Go in Irvine. "If you're short, you're better off with heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides your altitude, another factor in deciding what shoes to wear is where 
you'll be going. A reception at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa may require some traditional, dressy heels, while at a party at the 
Hard Rock Newport Beach, you could wear the same pants with high tops. 
</P>
<P>
 The clunky as well as the low-heeled strapped sandal are both big items this 
spring, and both are good choices for the pantaloon. Just be choosy when it 
comes to heel height. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford blues: There seems to be one in every office. He's the guy who shows up 
for work on time every day and gets the job done. He's the one you count on 
when you need him. He's good, steady, and wears only button-down Oxford dress 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys start wearing these and never wear anything else," says Tom Fuller 
of Fullers Fine Clothing for Men and Women in Laguna Niguel. "They should know 
there are other options in terms of dress shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 To break out of the Oxford habit, you may want to try a slight variation with 
a pinpoint Oxford, a smoother, tighter woven fabric that comes with or without 
those little collar buttons. They also come in a wider range of colors than the 
traditional Oxford cloth. And for those willing to completely break the mold, 
try a smooth broadcloth with (gasp!) a pattern. Now's the time to do it, 
considering the bright spring colors available. 
</P>
<P>
 In or out?: Perhaps it's lost its sophistication now that it's usually worn by 
waitresses in tiny cafes along the desolate stretches of I-15, but the ankle 
bracelet remains part of our jewelry culture. The eternal question: Does one 
wear it outside hose, or inside? 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither," says Carol Steele, a clothing designer in Newport Beach. "An ankle 
bracelet is fine if you're wearing shorts or jeans, but in a dress with nylons, 
take it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's a piece of casual jewelry and nylons are dressy, you could be 
sending mixed messages, she explains.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A TOAST FOR KURALT AND ONE FOR THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every kid in Belmont, N.C. , seems to be riding a bike, and that's the story I 
want to tell you next. The one thing kids want, and parents want to be able to 
give them, is a bike. But here in this little town, as elsewhere, there are 
parents who just can't afford to do it. It hurt Jethro Mann to see kids growing 
up without bikes. See, he grew up without a bike.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus did Charles Kuralt introduce "The Bicycle Man," his memorable television 
profile of a kindly old fellow who maintained a "lending library" of 35 
bicycles, all of them throwaways that he salvaged himself and made available to 
any kid who wanted one. They signed them out, then signed them in the same 
evening. With a dog barking in the background, Kuralt ended his story this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "Good night, Mr. Mann." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many of Kuralt's signature "On the Road" pieces, this one hovered in 
your thoughts as television rarely does, a bright orb of honest sentimentality 
that radiated hope and warmth while almost moving you to tears. How 
invigorating -- a few minutes that choked you up instead of making you choke. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt spent two decades being television's Norman Rockwell. He and his crew 
were all over the U.S. map, becoming a prototype for all the junior Charlies 
who sprang up like weed patches at local stations everywhere in the '70s and 
early '80s -- reporters assigned to unearth the Americana in their own back 
yards the way one digs up some soil and discovers the fascinating insect life 
teeming just below the top layer. 
</P>
<P>
 They were mostly less-talented, soft-news copycats, the human pet rocks and 
Hula-Hoops who were destined to vanish like fads when their bosses got bored 
with them and turned to techno toys and other journalistic gimmicks. Yet Kuralt 
endured, remaining a road warrior on "The CBS Evening News" until 1987 while 
also anchoring "CBS News Sunday Morning" since its inception in 1979 and 
hosting one of the many CBS News morning show experiments in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
 When he retires from CBS News at age 59 after Sunday morning's telecast, he'll 
pass the "On the Road" torch to . . . to . . . well, no one. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when news on television increasingly consists of everything gory and 
gossipy that's fit to articulate in nine seconds, and when thoughtfulness is 
confined to fine print, an eloquent calligrapher like Kuralt is tragically out 
of place and archaic in a traditional newscast, a medieval scribe in the wrong 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 From Eric Sevareid to Bill Moyers, there have been many capable writers in 
television news and documentaries through the years. Still on my wall is a 
quote from a script by Marshall Frady for a 1985 ABC News program on the 
possibility of nuclear holocaust, because it captured for me the essence of 
despair and the utter desolation facing a globe whose superpowers had whipped 
themselves into an arms-race frenzy. John Leonard's media criticism continues 
to flourish on "CBS News Sunday Morning," and let's also be thankful for Roger 
Rosenblatt, Richard Rodriguez and some of the other regulars who contribute 
sparkling essays to "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one in television has had Kuralt's talent for word-and-picture 
coordination, his gift not only for meticulously crafting and delivering 
exquisitely simple, minimalist narrations, but also for applying these words to 
pictures in ways that recall the shapes-and-colors perfection of a Matisse. 
Everything just fit. 
</P>
<P>
 You think of Walter Misenheimer's garden, "a paradise, a beautiful garden of 
13 acres, bright with azaleas, thousands of them, and bordered by dogwoods in 
bloom, and laced by a mile of paths in the shade of tall pines." And the old 
prospector who staked out his mine in 1962, proving to Kuralt that "the dream 
of gold dies hard. There are a few old dreamers who haven't quite given up, 
living in a few old towns that haven't quite fallen down. I'm in one now. It 
has a name, but we cannot tell you what it is. We promised not to." 
</P>
<P>
 You remember 89-year-old Ansel Toney, who "turned to a pleasure of his 
boyhood: flying kites." And Arkansas dirt farmer Eddie Lovett, whose library -- 
a lifetime accumulation of thousands of books -- "transformed the unlettered 
son of a sharecropper into an educated man." And of course, the Thanksgiving 
reunion of the Chandler family of Prairie, Miss., where nine offspring of a 
sharecropper couple had risen from the cotton fields to become college-trained 
teachers and academics and were now returning home to celebrate their parents' 
50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Kuralt said, when he hears that the family is a dying 
institution, "I'll think of them. Whenever I hear anything in America is 
impossible, I'll think of them." 
</P>
<P>
 So rich were Kuralt's "On the Road" pieces, so infused with feeling and 
eye-misting poignancy, that watching the occasional CBS specials that gathered 
bunches of them in a single hour was almost too much to digest. It was like 
tripping out on chocolate fudge. Better to experience and savor them 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no indication at all that Kuralt was forcibly evicted from CBS. He 
says he's leaving to write a book and to try new ventures. Nonetheless, his 
departure is a powerful metaphor. These are not happy times for old guards in 
television news. The faces are ever younger, the resumes ever shorter and, 
correspondingly, the payrolls on regular newscasts ever smaller, give or take a 
few multimillion-dollar superstars. 
</P>
<P>
 Age and experience are unfashionable. On April 18, former CBS News 
correspondent John Sheahan's age-discrimination suit against the network is 
scheduled to go to trial in New York. Sheahan claims he was unjustly fired in 
1991 at age 53, after a 23-year career with CBS, during which he won numerous 
awards and was the network's bureau chief in Warsaw from 1983-85 and in Beijing 
for six years after that. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to The Times from his home in Germany, Sheahan says his witness 
list includes eight former on-air colleagues "who will testify that they, too, 
were fired or forced to retire because of age." He asks: "How many of us over 
50 does CBS News have left?" 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday, one less. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it hurt Jethro Mann to see kids growing up without bikes, it hurts to 
see CBS News growing older without the man behind "The Bird Lady," "The Singing 
Mailman," "The Canoe Maker," "The Prospector," "The Gumball King," "The Kite 
Flyer," "The Balloon Man," "The Toy Fixing Man" and "The Bicycle Man." You 
think about the stories he would want to tell you next. 
</P>
<P>
 Good night, Mr. Kuralt.

TOP BRITISH SCREENWRITER TERMINALLY ILL; TELEVISION: DENNIS POTTER, THE CREATOR 
OF 'SINGING DETECTIVE' AND 'PENNIES FROM HEAVEN,' HAS CANCER OF THE LIVER AND 
PANCREAS. HE HAS TWO WORKS FOR TV THAT HE IS RUSHING TO COMPLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRITTEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Potter, Britain's best-known and most controversial screenwriter, has 
disclosed that he is suffering from terminal cancer of the liver and pancreas 
and has only months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter, 58, whose widely acclaimed successes include the television series 
"The Singing Detective" and "Pennies From Heaven" (both seen in America on 
PBS), has known of his condition since February. 
</P>
<P>
 A heavy smoker and drinker, Potter has suffered from ill health for much of 
his life. In 1964, he contracted the skin disease psoriatic arthropathy, which 
causes his joints to swell and his skin to crack, flake and blister. His hands 
are gnarled and twisted as a result of the ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter discussed his terminal disease on a TV arts program, "Without Walls," 
which was recorded last week, and will be broadcast in England Tuesday. In an 
extraordinary final interview with presenter Melvyn Bragg, Potter was 
reportedly in typically irascible form, alternating between drinking white wine 
and liquid morphine, and smoking profusely. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain Potter is known equally for his ground-breaking work as a dramatist 
and for his mordant humor. "Pennies From Heaven," his play about a sheet-music 
salesman set in the 1930s, extended the boundaries of television because its 
characters suddenly burst into song, lip-syncing to records from that period. 
Potter later adapted his screenplay for Herbert Ross' 1981 film starring Steve 
Martin, transferring the story to America; it failed at the box office, though 
some critics found it brilliant and provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter adapted another of his TV plays for film the following year. "Brimstone 
and Treacle" starred Sting as a malevolent young man who inveigled his way into 
the lives of a suburban family. In one controversial sequence, he raped the 
family's daughter, who was lying in a coma. The TV version of the play, which 
was completed in 1976, was banned by the BBC whose then-director of programs 
Alasdair Milne, described it as "diabolical and nauseating." It was only shown 
11 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter's arguably finest hour was his TV series "The Singing Detective," which 
also featured characters lip-syncing to period music, this time from the 1940s. 
The lead character (played by Michael Gambon) is a writer of pulp detective 
fiction, who is lying in a hospital bed, stricken by a disease similar to 
Potter's own psoriatic arthropathy. It is partly a private-eye thriller in this 
character's mind, partly a psychological investigation into his own illness and 
partly an exploration of his traumatic childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was first shown on PBS in 1988, many critics hailed it as one of the 
finest series ever made for television, although in Britain many tabloid 
newspapers also complained about the explicit sexual content of "The Singing 
Detective." Potter still owns the rights to the work, but despite rumors of a 
big-screen adaptation starring Dustin Hoffman or Robin Williams, no deal has 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The British tabloids finally declared war on Potter in earnest in 1990 when 
his last series, "Blackeyes," aired on the BBC. It concerned the sexual and 
literary manipulation of a beautiful, passive model and was intended as a 
critique of how society uses women as sexual objects to sell merchandise. 
Because Potter narrated the voice-over to "Blackeyes" himself, critics 
immediately charged that he was guilty of the same kind of leering voyeurism he 
deplored in others. The tabloids nicknamed him "Mr. Filth." 
</P>
<P>
 He has since written another series, "Lipstick on Your Collar," featuring 
characters lip-syncing to '50s rock 'n' roll songs, which was broadcast in 
Britain last year. The film of the screenplay "Mesmer," about the 18th-Century 
Viennese hypnotist, has also been completed. With Alan Rickman in the title 
role, it is to be released later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter worked briefly in newspapers before his illness restricted his mobility 
-- at which point he became a TV critic and then turned to writing TV 
screenplays. "Son of Man," for example, attracted flak from religious leaders 
for its portrayal of Jesus Christ as a highly flawed human being. Potter admits 
he is probably too outspoken to work in Hollywood with much success, though his 
screenplay for the 1983 film "Gorky Park" was highly regarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his illness, Potter remains feisty, and his interview with Bragg shows 
him in typically combative mood. He continues to rail against elements in 
British society that he believes have eradicated all that is best about the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading villain in the Potter pantheon is 20th Century Fox boss Rupert 
Murdoch, who also owns the sensationalistic British tabloid newspapers the Sun 
and the News of the World. Potter deplores the increasingly concentrated 
ownership of the British media, spearheaded by Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
 "No man is more responsible for polluting the press, and, in turn, polluting 
political life," Potter says of Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he told the London Observer, he has nicknamed his own diseased pancreas 
"Rupert," and curses it when it gives him pain.  
</P>
<P>
 Potter has two remaining screenplays for television to complete in a rush. 
"Karaoke" uses the metaphor of a karaoke machine for mapping out relationships, 
while "Cold Lazarus" combines the ideas of virtual reality and cryogenics. It 
is about a head frozen at death. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter has urged the BBC and Channel 4 television to show the works after his 
death -- a wish they have said they will honor. "I want my last work to be a 
memorial," he said. "I have the same feeling about these two as I had about 
'Pennies From Heaven' and 'The Singing Detective.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could do that, I will go out with a fitting memorial. My only worry is 
that I die four pages too soon."

KCBS CRITICS SEE PROGRESS IN NEWSROOM; TELEVISION: COUNCILMAN ALATORRE AND 
CIVIC LEADERS SAY THE STATION'S MANAGEMENT CLAIMS TO BE TAKING STEPS TO IMPROVE 
THE TREATMENT OF MINORITIES, WOMEN AND GAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre and leaders of several community 
groups who complained recently of sexism and racism at KCBS-TV Channel 2 say 
that station management seems to be responding to concerns about the treatment 
of minorities and women in its newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre and officials with the Los Angeles Urban League, the Gay & Lesbian 
Alliance Against Defamation/L.A. and the National Hispanic Media Coalition have 
held closed-door meetings during the past few weeks with KCBS General Manager 
William Applegate and other station executives to discuss their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alatorre and the organization leaders said that KCBS management 
denied the charges and admitted no wrongdoing, they said they were told by 
Applegate and others that the station was taking steps to improve the 
atmosphere in the newsroom. Among those changes, they said, would be the hiring 
and promotion of minorities, the launching of an advisory committee of 
reporters to monitor the coverage of ethnic communities, and participation in 
workshops to improve relations between gay and non-gay employees. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS executives did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the meetings, Alatorre and the other leaders said they are taking a 
wait-and-see approach to determine whether management follows through on the 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in this for the long run, and I told them I'm not interested in 
short-term solutions," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 19, the councilman filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights, saying that there was a "systematic effort to deny equal 
treatment to Latinos, other ethnic minorities, women and the gay community 
employed in the broadcasting industry." He singled out KCBS in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission subsequently said it would investigate conditions in all seven 
major local television newsrooms. Philip Montez, western regional director of 
the commission, said that he had heard complaints about conditions at KCBS and 
other stations for several months. Among the accusations were insensitive 
racial comments by management, favored treatment of white male reporters, lack 
of promotion for minorities and negative coverage of ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mack, director of the Urban League, has met with KCBS management twice in 
the last two weeks about the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very encouraged by our meeting, and the station is seemingly being 
responsive to our concerns," Mack said. "They seem to have the recognition that 
there is some work to do. They seem to know that there are some serious 
problems involving past practices toward African Americans, and there has been 
some specific commitment made to address some of those issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack declined to say what changes management had promised. "But I will stay 
unsatisfied until there is a follow-through on their commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the National Hispanic Media Coalition said Wednesday that 
KCBS is out of compliance with an agreement signed with the group to include 
Latinos as finalists for vacant positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition is absolutely livid," said Esther Renteria, head of the group. 
"This agreement was filed with the Federal Communications Commission. It's 
obvious that Applegate has not even read the agreement. Since last year, 10 
white males have been hired in management. At the same time, four African 
Americans, four Asians and six Latinos have left." 
</P>
<P>
 Renteria said that Applegate has pledged to implement the agreement, and has 
recently hired or promoted four Latinos at the station.

SUIT FILED OVER TROUBLED 'JACKSON FAMILY' BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmy-winning producer Gary Smith filed a lawsuit Thursday against Jackson 
family members charging fraud and breach of contract in connection with the 
financially troubled "Jackson Family Honors" musical benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-page complaint filed on behalf of Smith-Hemion Productions Inc. in Los 
Angeles County Superior Court alleges that Jackson family-affiliated firms 
refused to pay an estimated $2 million in outstanding bills and misrepresented 
information regarding past debts that allegedly jeopardized the fiscal state of 
the production. Ten family members are named individually as defendants, 
including superstar Michael Jackson, as well as the family's Jackson 
Communications Inc. and Jackson Jubilee, plus Transworld International, the 
firm that negotiated the foreign broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackson firms, the complaint said, are "mere shell corporations" and that 
they and their shareholders are responsible for "the commingling of personal 
assets and funds."  
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my entire career have I had to deal with such an unprofessional mess 
as this," said Smith, producer of the telecast who along his partner Dwight 
Hemion has won five Emmys since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jacksons asked me to hire people to work on their show and now, six weeks 
later, they refuse to pay them. And frankly, they've been very arrogant about 
it. This is an extremely difficult step for me to take, but the Jacksons have 
left me no choice but to sue." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's suit alleges that the Jacksons pledged the same funds raised from 
ticket proceeds and foreign broadcast fees to at least two separate entities. 
It also alleges that members of the Jackson entourage charged $69,000 in 
expenditures for wardrobe and room service at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas 
where the Feb. 19 musical benefit was taped to be aired three days later on 
NBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Jermaine Jackson, executive producer of the show and president of Jackson 
Communications Inc., said he had not seen a copy of the suit, but denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Gary Smith to sue us is unjust and unfair," Jackson said. "For him to say 
we are arrogant is very unprofessional. But what's new? It's just another 
dagger being thrown at the Jacksons in public." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges that Michael Jackson has failed to pay Smith-Hemion 
$110,000 for tickets he purchased and claims that the event's financial 
problems stem in part from the superstar's refusal to appear at the special's 
originally scheduled date of Dec. 11 in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was postponed after Jackson fled to Europe in November to reportedly 
treat a drug addiction that he said stemmed in part from a 13-year-old's 
allegations of sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of complications resulted, including the loss of corporate 
sponsorships, debts incurred by postponing and moving the event to Las Vegas 
and slow ticket sales. Since the event, financial disputes over possible ticket 
refunds have tied up concert proceeds and revenues from foreign broadcast fees 
are still forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for Michael and Janet Jackson said the two superstars had 
nothing to do with the event's finances.

'MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER,' 'HOMICIDE' WIN PEABODYS; RADIO/TV: AWARDS FOR 
EXCELLENCE ALSO GO TO 'SILVERLAKE LIFE,' '60 MINUTES' AND NPR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prime-time cop drama, a documentary on AIDS, an investigative report on "60 
Minutes," a cable comedy series and an animated children's show were among the 
programs honored Thursday by the prestigious Peabody Awards for excellence in 
radio and television during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29 winners, selected by the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College 
of Journalism and Mass Communication from more than 1,000 entries, will be 
honored at a ceremony in New York on May 16. 
</P>

CBS LEADS LUCCI-LESS DAYTIME EMMY PACK; TELEVISION: THE 'ALL MY CHILDREN' STAR 
IS SHUT OUT AFTER 14 LOSSES, BUT STILL GETS TO HOST AWARDS TELECAST MAY 25. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They won't be able to kid Susan Lucci about yet another loss at the Daytime 
Emmy Awards this year. After 14 nominations without a win, the actress who 
plays Erica Kane on ABC's "All My Children" wasn't among the finalists unveiled

 Instead, the nominations for best actress in a drama series went to Julie Barr 
of "All My Children," Kathleen Widdoes of CBS' "As the World Turns," Hillary B. 
Smith of ABC's "One Life to Live," Fiona Hutchison of CBS' "Guiding Light" and 
Linda Dano of NBC's "Another World," who won last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucci won't be absent from the Emmys. As she did last year, she'll be 
hosting the national telecast to announce the winners, which will be carried on 
ABC in prime time May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, which dominates the daytime ratings, also dominated the nominations for

</P>
<P>
 CBS' "The Young and the Restless," which won last year, was nominated again as 
best drama series, along with "All My Children," "As the World Turns" and 
"Guiding Light." The latter series picked up 16 nominations in all, the most of 
any program this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated as best actor in a drama series were Charles Keating of "Another 
World," Peter Simon and Michael Zaslow of "Guiding Light," Robert S. Woods of 
"One Life to Live" and Peter Bergman of "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 First-year series "The Ricki Lake Show" was named a finalist in the talk-show 
competition against veterans "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "Donahue," "Vicki!" and 
"Live With Regis & Kathie Lee." Appropriately, the stars of each of those 
programs also was nominated as best talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new category that previously was combined with talk shows, ABC's "Home," 
PBS' "This Old House" and Lifetime's "What Every Baby Knows" were nominated as 
best service show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations for best game show went to "Wheel of Fortune," "Jeopardy!" and 
"The Price Is Right," with Alex Trebek of "Jeopardy!" and Bob Barker of "The 
Price Is Right" getting the only nominations for game-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS garnered all five nominations for best children's series: "Lamb Chop's 
Play-Along," "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," "Reading Rainbow," "Sesame Street" 
and "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?" 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for the Emmy as best performer in a children's series will be George 
Carlin of PBS' "Shining Time Station," Shari Lewis of "Lamb Chop's Play-Along," 
Ruth Buzzi of "Sesame Street," LeVar Burton of "Reading Rainbow" and Lynne 
Thigpen of "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fox picked up three nominations in the category of animated programming for 
children, for "Animaniacs," "Batman: The Animated Series" and "Where on Earth 
Is Carmen Sandiego?" Also nominated were Nickelodeon's "Rugrats" and the 
syndicated "Halloween Tree."

<P>
 A board of volunteers working to establish a countywide arts council has 
applied for a technical assistance grant from the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has asked for about $30,000, said Joe Felz, director of the 
Fullerton Museum Center and a board member.A CAC spokeswoman said the grant, if 
approved, probably would total about half that much, in accordance with 
previous technical assistance grants. The grant would be good for the 1994-95 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 About $10,000 in technical assistance funds transferred to the board from its 
predecessor, the Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council, has been used 
to hire local arts consultant Bonnie Brittain Hall as a part-time coordinator, 
Felz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the new board include Jose Aponte, principal administrative 
librarian of the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, and Julie Mayer, 
president of the Anaheim Arts Council. Its funds, Felz said, are being handled 
by the Orange County Community Foundation, which assists with local charitable 
efforts.

 Los Alamitos -- A story Thursday about a Lake Tahoe conference attended by Los 
Alamitos County Water District directors misinterpreted a statement by Los 
Alamitos Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi. In a quote in the last paragraph of the 
story, Selvaggi said, "Nobody is suggesting it was illegal." He clarified 
Thursday that he was not referring to the trip itself but to salaries paid to 
the directors for attending the conference.
