 In listing the James Beard Award winners May 2, we failed to mention two 
Californians who won in broadcasting categories: Diane Worthington for Best 
Radio Show ("The California Cook," KABC) and Martin Yan for Best TV Show ("Yan 
Can Cook," PBS). We weren't going to mention this, but while we're up, The 
Times' Food Section also achieved some notice. Former Food Editor Ruth Reichl 
won for Best News Feature ("How to Buy Fresh Fish") and Times Staff Writer 
Daniel P. Puzo was runner-up for Food Reporting. CHARLES PERRY

 PLAYING DEFENSE: Another round of military base closings in California could 
come as early next spring, although mounting pressures in Washington may 
postpone further bloodletting for two years (A26). . . .Even local defense 
contractors suddenly realize that base closures could sacrifice jobs at Point 
Mugu and Port Hueneme. Industry executives meet this week with lobbyist Jack 
Connell from the Navy base at China Lake. He urged a united front: "We need to 
get all of Southern California to come together on this."

 ONCE BURNED: Pepper spray continues to be one of the hottest selling items in 
gun shops and uniform stores. But Daniel Patrick McDougall won't touch it. . . 
. The co-owner of Army, Navy, Etc. in Simi Valley still feels burned by his 
arrest last year for allegedly selling a can to an undercover officer. The 
D.A.'s office dropped the matter. And a few months later, the state attorney 
general agreed to allow the sale of pepper spray. "I won't sell it," McDougall 
said. "I got in trouble before. They've made it more difficult than it's 
worth."

 WHO'S ON BOARD? For more than 18 months, Metrolink commuter trains have been 
shuttling Ventura County passengers into Los Angeles. Compared to the 
nerve-testing drive through rush-hour traffic, the trains offer commuters a 
tranquil time to read, catch up on some work or simply daydream while looking 
out the window. (Ventura County Life, Page 8) . . . . An Oxnard clergyman 
enjoys the peaceful commute. "Before the Simi Valley stop," said Father Richard 
Loomis, "it's quiet enough to do my morning prayers."

 TIME SHARE: Mark Magdaleno works full time for Cal Lutheran University, 
juggling two dream jobs. . . In the morning, he's a horseman, managing the 
school's equestrian center and 85-acre hay farm. In the afternoon, he's 
assistant coach and hitting instructor for the championship-winning Cal 
Lutheran baseball team. (C10) "As a little boy," he said, "I grew up dreaming 
of cowboys, horses and baseball.

SCOTT HARRIS: VOLUNTEERS WITH PERFORMERS' SOULS AT HEART OF AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russ Fox wears a bib when he reads. So does Bill Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They drool a lot," Mort Feingold explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the bibs assure that the microphones hanging from their necks don't 
tap against their shirt buttons. On this evening at the east Hollywood 
headquarters of Recording for the Blind, Fox is reading a selection from a book 
titled "Chemical Process Controls." 
</P>
<P>
 "A thriller," he says from the sound booth. He's on Page 228. Feingold gives 
the cue and starts the tape recorder. Fox begins: "Consider the three storage 
tanks in Figure P.III.1. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And then -- no small feat -- he ad-libs a description of diagrams A, B and C. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are nine sound booths here, and once in a while, every one of them is 
busy. Someday, a master tape of "Chemical Process Controls" will join the 
80,000 other titles on file at RFB's national headquarters in Princeton, N.J. 
-- a monument to the painstaking efforts of thousands of people like Fox, 
Jackson and Feingold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are powered by our volunteers," says Carol E. Smith, executive director of 
RFB's Los Angeles operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age when people justifiably worry about where their donated dollar winds 
up, it's heartening to witness a nonprofit agency like RFB at work. Money 
magazine recently listed RFB as one of the most efficient educational 
nonprofits in the country; in the Los Angeles office last year, administration 
and fund-raising costs accounted for only 6.5% of the expenses. Meanwhile, 
volunteers logged 32,175 hours in RFB's studios in Hollywood and Manhattan 
Beach, produced 5,958 recorded tracks -- more than any other RFB unit in the 
country. Smith is now seeking office space in the west San Fernando Valley in 
hopes of attracting more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1948 as a way to help veterans who were blinded in World War II 
take advantage of the GI Bill, RFB is filling a niche not addressed by the 
renowned Braille Institute. Today, RFB specializes in the recording of 
textbooks, from the fourth grade through postgraduate studies. The Braille 
Institute and commercial concerns are more apt to tape recreational reading. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are born without eyesight or are blinded young typically learn 
Braille. Those who lose eyesight later in life, or have learning disabilities 
such as dyslexia, are more likely to rely on tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, RFB serves more than 2,000 clients who are blind, 
visually impaired or have learning disabilities. A one-time registration fee of 
$37.50 provides them access to the RFB library and entitles them to request 
that new titles be recorded. At any time, hundreds of books are in the process 
of being taped at RFB facilities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just anybody is cut out to be an RFB volunteer. Each must have the soul of 
a performer. Russ Fox, a 32-year-old general manager for a paging company, was 
a play-by-play sports announcer on his college radio station. Mort Feingold, a 
retired civil engineer, used to give public tours of DWP facilities. Bill 
Jackson is an actor and a voice on AM 540 -- the station that provides traffic 
info around LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, who has a degree in chemical engineering, is one of the few volunteers 
who can handle such a technical text. Feingold is one of the few who can serve 
as the "monitor" -- the director who operates the four-track recorder while 
reading along, always checking for errors that must be recorded over. If Fox is 
the Robert De Niro of "Chemical Process Controls," Feingold's the Martin 
Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, not all the readings are so dry. Maury Hill, a thespian who is in 
his 40th year of volunteering at RFB, revels in "Hamlet." "Where else can I be 
King, Queen and Laertes all at the same time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gelman, 61, used to do stand-up under the stage name "David Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to read 'Kiss of the Spiderwoman' in Spanish," he recalls. "I learned a 
bunch of new words." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's something that bugs Gelman. Just the other day, he met a blind woman 
on the bus who wasn't aware of RFB. The nonprofit is so obscure, he says, that 
people routinely assume it's part of the Braille Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 They're trying to change that. That's why this Saturday, RFB will open its 
doors at 5022 Hollywood Blvd. for its second "record-a-thon" fund-raiser. 
Feingold and seven other volunteers are planning to read for 15 hours. 
Meanwhile, the former David Who? is delighted at the chance to direct James 
Earl Jones in a reading of some Maya Angelou short stories. Other celebrity 
readers include actors William Windom and Lloyd Bochner and radio personalities 
Gary Owens, Mother Love and, of course, Bill Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're really lucky, maybe someone will read "Chemical Process 
Controls."

HIGH COST OF HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been following with great interest the political rhetoric, both pro 
and con, regarding the issue of health care for all citizens of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I are members of an HMO system operated by a multibillion-dollar 
private insurance organization. Because of our ages, the plan cost is $500 per 
month. Recently, we discovered that my spouse has developed cataracts in each 
eye. For the past several months we have been endeavoring to have the condition 
corrected by surgery. I have not studied the Clinton proposal for universal 
care in great detail, but let me state that nothing that Bill and Hillary 
Clinton have devised could be as abysmal as what our private insurer provides. 
</P>
<P>
 We have been subjected to unbelievable harassment and delays and forced to 
jump through hoop after hoop in order to obtain the medical treatment for which 
we pay dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 The interesting thing is that the doctors with whom we are dealing have all 
been first-rate. However, what our HMO is, essentially, is a system of medicine 
by clerk. Decisions are not being made by medical professionals but by clerks 
somewhere deep in the bowels of the insurance bureaucracy. What is particularly 
frustrating is that they have so organized themselves that it is impossible to 
establish contact with the people who make the real decisions regarding our 
health. One can only reach a person who is obviously trained to fend off and 
divert questions into a labyrinth of uncaring clerks.  
</P>
<P>
 Go for it, Bill and Hillary. What you are proposing just has to be better than 
what I have now. 
</P>

 * So Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) sees a need for "some broad-based tax 
increase" to fund health care reform (May 11). Rostenkowski predicts a 
$40-billion "hole" by the year 2000 and says, "If Americans want new benefits, 
they must pay for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me! As I recall, President Clinton is the person requesting reform. I 
also recall that the driving force behind health reform was to reduce the 
deficit, not increase it by $40 billion. One more example of how Washington 
politicians twist the facts to suit their needs and not the needs of the 
American public. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, am getting really tired of working to support those who cannot or 
will not support themselves. I guess the only solution for me would be to quit 
work, declare bankruptcy and live off others' hard-earned dollars too. Gee, I 
hope no one else gets this idea. Imagine how that would affect the deficit.

 * Where exactly are health-care dollars going? An outpatient surgery at St. 
Vincent Medical Center last fall incurred $4,734 in hospital charges alone. I 
requested an itemized bill and checked the pharmaceutical and supply charges 
against the Medispan Average Wholesale Price (AWP). Most big purchasers pay 
less than AWP. St. Vincent's charges to me were 7.4 to 8.2 times the AWP. This 
includes charges of $60 a liter for intravenous fluid which wholesales at $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all drugs used were generic; I can't blame the drug manufacturers. The 
physician fees were reasonable. (My and many of my colleagues' income was down 
one-third in '93). When I asked St. Vincent about their markup, their response 
was, "That's what we charge everybody." The problem is when you enter the 
hospital, you're signing a blank check.

OVERPOPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Alexander Cockburn accused me and the Sierra Club, among others, of being 
"potential mass murderers" (Column Left, March 29). His accusation is made as 
he discounts this century's overwhelming human population growth and its 
related environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 World population will reach 5.6 billion this year. Demographers' projections 
are that global population may double within the next 50 years. The human 
population already is, or will soon be, beyond the capacity of the Earth to 
support it. The natural environment is being degraded and destroyed, including 
a tremendous loss of other plant and animal species.  
</P>
<P>
 We believe that stabilizing population growth is an essential component of 
protecting the environment and enhancing the quality of life for all humans on 
the Earth. Providing family planning is not the complete answer, but it is 
essential that it be available to all people. The Sierra Club has worked 
closely with members of Congress over the past four years to substantially 
increase the United States' support for international family planning programs, 
with the goal of universal access to birth control for everyone on the planet 
by the year 2000. Thanks to our work and the bipartisan support of many others, 
U.S. funding has increased each year.

ARMY'S SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Colman McCarthy's attack against the U.S. Army School of the Americas 
(Column Left, May 3) is so one-sided it cannot be justified. McCarthy presumes 
that, because a handful of SOA's 58,000 graduates are accused of ignoring civil 
rights, SOA and its thousands of outstanding graduates deserve condemnation.  
</P>
<P>
 His attack ignores basic facts about Latin America and the Caribbean. The 
military forces in most of those countries have had -- and undoubtedly will 
continue to have -- an influential role in the stability of emerging democratic 
governments. In 1946, 13 of those countries were dictatorships. Now only two 
are not democracies: Cuba and Haiti (neither has sent students to SOA since the 
early 1960s). President Kennedy's reorganization of SOA under the Alliance for 
Progress helped make this possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere does McCarthy mention the positive role so many SOA graduates have 
played in this transition to democracy. Nor does he mention that every SOA 
attendee today is selected at the specific request of a democratically elected 
Latin America government. Consistent with SOA's basic ethic, militaries in 
Guatemala, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and Paraguay, instead of assuming 
power, recently supported democratic civilian leadership in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by focusing on less than half a percent of SOA graduates can McCarthy 
ignore the overwhelming number of outstanding SOA graduates. And, even as to 
this one-half percent, he fails to factually link SOA or its curriculum to what 
he must admit are aberrational acts. As he can confirm by visiting the school, 
to imply that SOA, with 268 U.S. instructors, including U.S. Army, Air Force 
and Marines, teaches or encourages non-democratic values is unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy fails to mention the countless SOA graduates who have been 
instrumental in bringing to justice fellow countrymen who failed to respect 
human rights and democratic values. Nor does he note SOA's integration of 
democratic values and respect for human rights in all its courses, unique among 
military schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The School of the Americas deserves recognition and support as an invaluable 
contributor to human rights and democracy in this hemisphere. I am confident 
McCarthy will confirm this if and when he visits the school, reviews its 
curriculum, or speaks with its instructors and students.

SOMEWHAT CLEARER FISCAL FUTURE; FED INDICATES IT WON'T BOOST INTEREST RATES 
AGAIN SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the occasion was unwelcome by some -- the announcement of a new 
hike in short-term interest rates -- the Federal Reserve spoke with surprising 
clarity. In a highly unusual move it told the public, in so many words, that 
it's unlikely to raise the rates anytime soon after this boost, the fourth 
since March. 
</P>
<P>
 That offers at least some relief from the uncertainty that has gyrated 
financial markets ever since the Fed began ratcheting up interest rates in 
February. The Fed, moving aggressively on Tuesday, raised the federal funds 
rate and discount rate (for the first time since 1991) by half a percentage 
point each.  
</P>
<P>
 The increase was double the size of each of the Fed's previous increases in 
the federal funds rate. "These actions . . . substantially remove the degree of 
monetary accommodation which prevailed through 1993," the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is widespread worry about the Fed's anti-inflation policy, worry 
that we share, the Fed's suggestion that rates will be held steady was 
applauded, especially on Wall Street and maybe even more especially in 
California. Any more rate hikes by the Fed would hurt California, which is 
crawling out of a terrible recession. Only time will tell whether the latest 
hike, which some banks are passing on to their customers, will dampen business 
and home sales here, which of course is the big risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Fed's actions appear to be pushing down long-term bond rates. 
That, in turn, has started to trigger some lowering of mortgage rates. If 
that's the beginning of a trend, that is good news for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed, please stay on hold.

UNIVERSITY WATCH; A GEM ON THE RIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA celebrates a milestone on Friday. Seventy-five years ago, California Gov. 
William D. Stephens signed the legislation that created the "Southern Branch" 
of the University of California.The branch became a tree of its own, as the 
University of California at Los Angeles. The acronym UCLA became official once 
it won the blessing of former Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is now as much a part of the life -- and image -- of this city as 
sunshine. The great universities of the East Coast may loom larger in the 
European imagination; but around the Pacific Rim, coming to America means 
landing in California, and no college sweat shirt is a more prized souvenir 
than the one with these four letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Natives sometimes smile at visitors stocking up on the paraphernalia of a 
place locally taken so much for granted, but the university's extraordinary 
achievement -- achievement in virtually every area of intellectual endeavor -- 
is what underlies the mystique that sells all those souvenirs. And for 
maintaining that level of achievement, credit must be given to literally 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Charles E. Young, whose 25th anniversary as UCLA's chancellor 
coincides with the university's own anniversary, credit goes to the 
extraordinary faculty, with its commitment to excellence. That explains its 
phenomenal ability to inspire thousands of young people each year, from 
California, from all over the world, to come to its vibrant campus to luxuriate 
in one of the finest higher educations America can offer.

EVERY MINE A GOLD MINE; OVERLY GENEROUS 1872 LAW NEEDS UPDATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt calls it "the biggest gold heist since the 
days of Butch Cassidy," but the deal was all legal. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a deal it was: For a pittance, a Canadian company was able to secure 
title to one of the world's richest veins of gold -- a federally owned Nevada 
lode valued in the billions of dollars. Imagine gaining 1,800 gold-rich acres 
by paying only $9,000 to the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous, yes? And yet more evidence that reform in the law governing mining 
on federal lands is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts in Congress to revise the 19th-Century law failed for years. Then, 
last November, the House passed a decent reform; unfortunately, a reform 
cleared recently by the Senate was merely a milquetoast measure. 
</P>
<P>
 REAL RELIC: The mining law, virtually unchanged since signed by President 
Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, was conceived to promote settlement and economic 
development in 12 Western states and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Under it, mining companies, speculators and independent prospectors may mine 
hard-rock minerals ranging from gold to uranium on American federal lands in 
exchange for a onetime patent fee of between $2.50 and $5 an acre. A patent 
holder owns the land in perpetuity whether the property is mined or not. And a 
patent holder need not pay the government any royalties -- charges based on a 
percentage of the value of the minerals extracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the law is archaic. The West is well-settled. What once benefited the 
nation now costs it dearly. The technology of mining has changed vastly, with 
immense environmental and public health implications. Where mining once was 
confined to small surface and subsurface areas, today's process allows 
retrieval of microscopic mineral particles from vast pits: A ton of ore yields 
a third of an ounce of microscopic gold fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary Babbitt had sought legal support for a moratorium on awarding of 
mining patents until the law was changed. He was ordered by a federal court to 
grant the patent to the Canadian firm, American Barrick Resources Corp. The 
company had applied under the Bush Administration's fast-track patent process, 
which has since been spiked by Babbitt. The Department of the Interior has 
about 612 patent requests pending -- 102 from California (most of these for 
gold mining). 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ROYALTY: The mining industry endorses the need for reform -- but not the 
House's version. That legislation would drop the patent system, replace it with 
an 8% royalty, establish national reclamation standards and a much-needed fund 
for cleanup of closed mines and provide for national ownership to resume after 
the lands are mined out. The industry prefers the much weaker Senate bill, 
which would keep the patent system but raise the fee and impose a 2% royalty. 
The two versions are headed to conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of 1994 is enormously different from the world of 1872. That 
difference should be reflected in a modern mining law. The current law is the 
absolute pits.

STAY ON THE MORAL HIGH GROUND; U.S. IS RIGHT THAT IRAQ MUST DO MORE IF 
SANCTIONS ARE TO BE LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion and brutal 
occupation of Kuwait are still in force, but support for the measures is 
faltering. Three permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- China, 
France and Russia -- have signaled they are ready to think about easing the 
restrictions, which are now in their fourth year. All, surely by no 
coincidence, have reportedly lined up contracts to help rebuild Iraq's 
infrastructure once commerce with Baghdad again is made legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Britain, the other two permanent members of the council, 
rightly insist that Iraq must comply more fully with U.N. resolutions before 
any changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically they say Saddam Hussein's regime must recognize Kuwait's 
independence and stop waging ruthless war against Iraqi Kurds and Shiites. 
These are valid and honorable demands, and Washington shouldn't hesitate to use 
its Security Council veto to enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq does appear to have complied with U.N. orders to halt and destroy its 
programs to build nuclear and chemical weapons; whether it has also done so 
with its biological weapons program is less clear. Iraq argues that by ending 
its production of unconventional weapons it has earned the right to be freed 
from sanctions. But Washington and others question whether Iraq has in fact 
made the decision to adopt more responsible policies, domestically and in its 
foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq could hardly have resisted the internationally supervised destruction of 
its chemical and nuclear weapons programs without inviting harsh reprisals, 
since defiance of the Security Council would have constituted an unmistakable 
threat to peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many U.N. members appear ready to regard Iraq's actions against its 
Kurdish and Shiite citizens and its refusal to accept Kuwait's independence as 
matters of much less international concern. The United States and Britain, 
taking the moral high ground, don't see it that way at all. They are right to 
continue demanding that Iraq must end its internal persecution and recognize 
Kuwait's border before the sanctions are lifted.

PALESTINIAN POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pictures of large crowds of Palestinians joyously welcoming the new 
Palestinian police force to Gaza and Jericho (May 13) as conquering heroes 
after 27 years of Israeli rule are nice but I wonder if the Palestinians may be 
celebrating too soon. Now comes the task of establishing a government and 
stable economic and strategic relationships with Israel and their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that soon the Palestinians and their leadership will realize that 
celebrations are nice, but the proof is in what they are able to accomplish in 
the next weeks and months. Talk is cheap if all the Palestinians gain is 
sovereignty over an ungovernable territory. 
</P>
<P>
 It bodes well for Israel to be rid of the responsibility of governing Gaza. It 
also bodes well for Israel to see a stable government and a sense of prosperity 
come to the citizens of Gaza and Jericho.

COLUMN LEFT/ JAMES BISHOP JR.: BRUCE BABBITT: CONFRONTING TOURIST HERDS URBAN 
REFUGEES ARE THE REAL THREAT TO OUR PUBLIC LANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BISHOP Jr., James Bishop Jr. served in the Energy Department in the 
Carter Administration and wrote Epitaph for a Desert Anarchist, the Life and 
Times of Edward Abbey, to be published by Atheneum in June. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mining West . . . the timber, the grazing, and the homestead West were 
raided, not settled . . . by different breeds of raiders -- Wallace Stegner 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly more than a New York minute ago, Bruce Babbitt, scion of a vintage 
ranching and mercantile family in the high canyon country here, was regarded 
widely as the brightest star in President Clinton's Cabinet firmament and every 
environmentalist's poster boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Babbitt did appear to have all the right stuff to be the landlord 
of the nation's troubled 500-million-acre public domain of parks, rangeland, 
deserts and wildlife refuges. Here was a seasoned pol able to navigate the 
turbulent rapids -- from the mythological Old West, once dominated by the three 
Cs, copper, cattle and cotton, to the New West -- supposedly populated and 
visited by more environmentally sensitive folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the first of a series of setbacks befell him, beginning with the 
Administration's humiliating defeat in Congress over raising the grazing fees 
ranchers pay on public lands, resulting in a proposed rule-making that has 
generated accusations from ranchers and environmentalists that Babbitt had sold 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the political Bowie knives are flashing and the mere mention of his name 
in many Western states, whether in cowboy bars or country clubs, can start a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Another indication of his waning popularity was a bumper sticker seen on the 
four-wheel trucks of environmentalists reading, "Babbitt for the Supreme 
Court." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute! Don't write Babbitt's political obituary yet. Now that a 
seat on the Supreme Court has been ruled out for the present, he's free to get 
back to business at the Interior Department where his plans to reform 
public-lands practices are still alive, and where he's preparing to face the 
most difficult dilemma of all: what to do about the explosion, not of cows and 
sheep, but of two-legged recreationists. "Fun-hogs," Charlie Peterson, a county 
commissioner out of Moab, Utah, calls them, the real thundering herd, capable 
of causing more damage to public lands that any combination of sheep and 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Woody Guthrie was correct. This land is their land, but in the West 
today, virtually every town and national park faces these new raiders: bikers, 
jeepers, yuppies, New Agers and other refugees from deteriorating urban 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask any park ranger. Far too many of these fun-hogs are defacing and 
plundering ancient Native American ruins, fouling overcrowded campgrounds, 
destroying back roads with $50,000 high-powered Jeeps, violating the very 
sacred places they leave New York and California to worship. Even gun-toting 
teen-age gangs from the cities are raiding campgrounds near Flagstaff, 
Babbitt's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes word that the Interior secretary plans to take a page from "Desert 
Solitaire," first published nearly 30 years ago and the late Edward Abbey's 
poetic, prescient warning of the manifold dangers of "industrial tourism," the 
invasion of wilderness and public lands of the West by a new breed of 
aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the industrial tourists, at once the creators and the prisoners of 
smoggy traffic jams at besieged parks like the Grand Canyon and Arches National 
Monument. "For my own part," Abbey wrote, "I would rather take my chances in a 
thermonuclear war than live in such a world." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey's solution in "Desert Solitaire": No more cars in national parks. "Let 
the people walk. Or ride horses, bicycles, mules, wild pigs -- anything -- but 
keep the automobiles and the motorcycles and their motorized vehicles out. 
We've agreed not to drive our cars into cathedrals . . . art museums . . . We 
should treat our national parks with the same deference, for they, too, are 
holy places." 
</P>
<P>
 A radical idea in those days. But Babbitt, faced with projections that Grand 
Canyon visitors will double to 10 million annually in a decade, will soon set 
this idea adrift in the mainstream. As part of the Grand Canyon Management 
Plan, he has decided that cars must be banned along the Grand Canyon's South 
Rim and a system of shuttle buses or light rail developed to ferry in 5 million 
visitors a year. As Babbitt put it recently: "We simply cannot continue to 
build parking lots from Havasu Falls to the Little Colorado River . . . How 
much can we love places like the Grand Canyon? Isn't there a point where we 
risk destroying the very values we cherish?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps critics of the nation's 47th Interior secretary should back off, for 
he has realized, as none of his predecessors did, that "it's not the cows, 
stupid"; that the real danger facing the New West is that it is being loved to 
death.

PLATFORM; MALCOLM AND HAJJ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALAM AL-MARAYATI, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los 
Angeles, commented on the anniversary of the birth of Malcolm X and the season 
of Hajj, the pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca, against a backdrop of the 40th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court decision against school segregation in 
America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During Hajj, Malcolm realized the need for human understanding to overcome his 
personal problems about racism. The absence of racial images in Islam deters 
supremacy and facilitates pluralism within society.Malcolm manifested this 
doctrine, and his example for society went even deeper. He eliminated the inner 
oppressor to enable himself to fight the oppressors of the world. His 
introspection and intellectual honesty were the main driving forces for his 
evolution from a community activist to a world leader. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has called for racial equality this week and said that we 
could no longer be two nations, separate and unequal. We can all enrich our 
human understanding by accepting Malcolm X as a living example of the Koranic 
principle: "God created you all out of a male and a female, and has made you 
into different nations and tribes, not to despise one another, but to learn 
from one another."

HOLD HANDGUN MAKERS AND SELLERS LIABLE; GUN CONTROL: COURTS COULD HELP CUT 
VIOLENCE WITHOUT RESTRICTING RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERWIN CHEMERINSKY and RICHARD M. MOSK, Erwin Chemerinsky is a law professor 
at USC. Richard M. Mosk, a Los Angeles attorney, was on the staff of the Warren 
Commission investigating the death of President Kennedy and a member of the 
Christopher Commission, which studied the LAPD. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under established law, manufacturers and sellers are "strictly liable" for the 
harms caused by their ultrahazardous products and activities. Such products, 
even if made properly and without negligence, can be deemed defective and 
therefore abnormally dangerous.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, those who manufacture, distribute or use explosive or toxic 
materials or who keep dangerous animals are subject to strict liability. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to extend to handguns the legal doctrine that distributors of 
dangerous products are strictly liable to those injured by such products. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind holding distributors of dangerous products strictly liable 
is that although they may engage in lawful, non-negligent activity, 
manufacturers should not subject innocent victims to risks and injuries that 
the use of their products uniquely causes. There seems to be little 
justification for not applying this principle to those who engage in the 
distribution or manufacture of handguns, which are annually used in 650,000 
violent crimes. More than 38,000 Americans die each year from injuries related 
to firearms.  
</P>
<P>
 Handguns are designed primarily to inflict injury or death. Many are made so 
that they can be converted into automatic weapons, others so that they would 
likely be used only in criminal activity. Handgun distributors, who profit from 
sales, should bear the enormous costs resulting from the use of handguns -- 
costs now borne by victims, insurance companies and taxpayers, none of whom 
benefits from sales. 
</P>
<P>
 A handgun is an abnormally dangerous product, and its manufacture and sale are 
ultrahazardous activities. Under either of these theories, strict liability 
follows. It should not matter if there is an intervening criminal act by a 
third person, because the distribution of the handgun itself creates the risk 
of that act. Moreover, under normal tort law, only the innocent victim could 
recover, not the criminal who is shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, such strict liability will result in higher insurance premiums or 
self-insurance, which in turn will force handgun distributors to increase the 
price of their products to reflect these social costs. Higher prices will mean 
that those who buy handguns will be paying for the costs of the product they 
are using. This is the way the law treats virtually all other dangerous 
products and activities, such as risky equipment and even oil wells in 
populated areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the increased price of handguns, demand would decline. Many 
marginal and less responsible manufacturers and sellers would be forced out of 
business. And those remaining, to reduce their liability exposure, would 
exercise more care in the distribution of handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 How could this change in the law be accomplished? In many states, it could 
result from court decisions. Courts have thus far been unwilling to hold 
handgun manufacturers or sellers liable to innocent victims for the harm those 
guns cause. The only exception is one case in Maryland, in which a court held 
that the manufacturer of a "Saturday night special" could be strictly liable to 
a victim. Expanding tort liability to allocate certain social costs is a 
historic function of our common law and an appropriate role for the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a 1983 state law exempts firearms from product-liability law 
applicable to abnormally dangerous products. This law would have to be repealed 
before California courts could extend strict liability to handguns.  
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Congress and state legislatures throughout the country could 
pass laws holding handgun manufacturers and sellers strictly liable. Such a 
bill is pending in Congress, which is the only way to effect such a change 
federally.  
</P>
<P>
 Strict liability for handgun injuries would not eliminate all guns. It does 
not restrict any person's right to own a gun. It would not eliminate all gun 
violence. But it is one way to begin dealing with the human and financial costs 
of the epidemic of gun-caused injuries and deaths.

RSVP; LAYING DOWN THE LAW FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Alliance for Children's Rights has a T-shirt with a lion printed on the 
back, a tribute to one of the young children the organization helped and who 
thought it was the Lions for Children's Rights that had provided the legal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Lee Edmon's comment, as she presented one of the awards at the 
organization's first Service to Children Awards dinner: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I like to think of us, as defenders and protectors of the 
children of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 attorneys volunteer their services to disadvantaged children 
through this nonprofit organization, founded two years ago by Pamela Mohr, who 
was thrilled to hear "How can I help you?" from even non-lawyers in the crowd 
of 380 attending the dinner in the ballroom of the Olympic Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a no-frills affair. The food was simple -- salad, chicken, cake. There 
were no centerpieces, just a printed card noting, "Flowers are beautiful but 
expensive." The evening's emcee, Alliance President Frank Wheat, kept reminding 
the speakers to keep the program on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "How much time, Frank?" teased Supervisor Edmund Edelman as he stepped up to 
the podium to state his thanks on receiving the Lifetime Service Award from 
Mayor Richard Riordan. He was allowed five minutes but came in under the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's program included a video, "Make a Difference in a Child's Life," 
which told the stories of an abused young girl and a physically disabled boy 
who had benefited from legal aid. These children, Louise LaMothe stressed, 
"could have been lost, but were found." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these children have stories to tell, stories which break your heart, 
bring a smile to your face or infuriate the hell out of you. In other words, 
everything which can enrich your life," said Nancy Shea, senior attorney at 
Mental Health Advocacy Services. 
</P>
<P>
 She and MHAS Executive Director James Preis shared an Alliance award. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored were the law firm of Morrison & Foerster, represented by Barbara 
Reeves, and the Rotary Club of Los Angeles, represented by Adrian Heryford. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Patrick Morris -- wearing, as he pointed out, a "Save the Children" tie 
-- was allowed to bend the "keep it short" rule a bit during his key remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said dealing with the current "three strikes and you're out" aspect of the 
law -- "the dark side" -- can be very disillusioning, but that coming to this 
event had renewed in him some sense of optimism because "your work here 
represents the light."

</P>
<P>
 The Setup: A Wild West poker championship is at stake, and con man Bret 
Maverick (Mel Gibson, pictured), con woman Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster, 
pictured) and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner, pictured, who starred as 
Maverick in the 1950s television series of the same name) are holding the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: April Ferry, whose credits include the television movie 
"My Name Is Bill W." and the feature films "Free Willy," "The Big Chill," "The 
Babe," "Big Trouble in Little China," "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and 
"Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Frivolity on the frontier. Glossy silks, brocades and lace -- and 
that's just for the guys -- in no way reflect the dirt, dust and grim realities 
of living in the untamed Old West. Part card shark, part fop, Maverick is never 
without a luxurious vest or a laundry-fresh white shirt. (A ruffled shirt 
provides a running gag, but it's actually quite nice.) Ferry pulls off the 
folly without sacrificing historical correctness, working particular wonders 
with money-happy Annabelle Bransford. Her most winning number is her "grape 
dress" of purple silk with a garland of hand-sewn and stuffed grapes and grape 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: All said, the best fashion moments may have been stolen by Maverick's 
adversary, Angel (Alfred Molina), as dirty and dusty as they come in cavalry 
jackets and frock coats adorned with gorgeous period Native American beading. 
"My back story for him was that he was in the cavalry at one time, became a 
deserter and outlaw, and now he lives with an Indian woman who beads his 
clothes," Ferry explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Maverick's flashiness stems from Garner's first "Maverick" 
television costume -- a silver brocade vest, black frock coat, gray pants and a 
string tie -- which, in turn, was lifted from early movie Westerns. Garner's 
original wardrobe, Ferry says, was pulled from studio stock; the vest bore Gary 
Cooper's name, the shirt, Monty Wooley's. Ferry turned to historical photos of 
dapper lawman Bat Masterson when dressing Cooper, and a photo of Annie Oakley 
served as partial inspiration for Bransford. Books and period fashion magazines 
offered other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Jodie Foster had no complaints about squeezing into corsets. "She was 
used to them from 'Sommersby,' " Ferry says. "We could pull her into a 22-inch 
waistline. That's ridiculous, like 'Gone With the Wind.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Bransford's clothes were by costume maker John Hayles. Men's clothes 
were made at several costume houses. Fabrics came from International Silks and 
Woolens and F & S Fabrics. BETTY GOODWIN

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIR; THE CLOUDY SYNTAX OF WRITER AS POLITICIAN; A FISH IN THE

<P>
 Mario Vargas Llosa's wife, Patricia, was angry with him for a whole year. For 
one of Latin America's two greatest novelists to throw himself into a bloody 
campaign to become president of Peru, she argued, was to sacrifice both his art 
and his family. Surely, he was only in it for the excitement, for the notion of 
writing a great novel -- not on paper, but in real life.  
</P>
<P>
 Having argued, though, she turned wholeheartedly to helping him. Perhaps she 
thought that the more thoroughly he went at it, the more completely he would 
get over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Fish in the Water" seems to be part of the still-shocked ordeal of getting 
over it. Possibly the title of this curious hybrid of campaign journal and 
childhood memoir is ironic. "Fish Out of the Water" would be truer -- if not to 
what Vargas Llosa means to say, then to what he actually manages to say. 
</P>
<P>
 After an early enthusiasm for Marxism and the Castro revolution, Vargas Llosa 
drifted to the right side of the divide that works to place Latin American 
authors politically, quite regardless of the character of their art. (By their 
writing you would have a hard time making a political distinction between 
Vargas Llosa and Garcia Marquez -- across the gulch -- or between the 
"conservative" Jorge Luis Borges and his "leftist" compatriot, Julio Cortazar.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, convinced that the capitalist examples of South Korea, Japan and 
Taiwan offered a better hope for his country's misery than the distributive, 
government-directed economies traditional to Latin America's democratic left, 
Vargas Llosa wrote a fierce attack on Peru's president, Alan Garcia. There was 
a lot of response, and before long the writer found himself the presidential 
candidate of a middle-class and professional civic movement allied with two 
established parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Running against the government candidate and a Socialist, Vargas Llosa soared 
in the polls for a while, then declined and was finally humiliated in two 
rounds of voting. The victor was Alberto Fujimori, an agriculture professor who 
shot up out of political obscurity at virtually the last minute. Riding on the 
swell of anti-politician feeling that Vargas Llosa's group had set going and 
then fumbled, Fujimori won with an ironically similar program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those allied with Vargas Llosa -- including the business and financial 
groups whose backing turned his initial popular support into popular distrust 
-- now back Fujimori and the dictatorial powers he has assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas Llosa is a bitter opponent -- and the most bitter thing is when 
ignorant acquaintances congratulate him on the "triumph" of his ideas. In Latin 
America, after all, such ideas have traditionally been associated with 
authoritarians and dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians blur distinctions; writers live by them. In the anti-guerrilla 
fight, for example, Vargas Llosa wanted to arm the peasants -- not to serve the 
army but in part to replace it.  
</P>
<P>
 So the half of "A Fish in the Water" that is political memoir is the record of 
a quixotic endeavor. But Don Quixote was luckier. He tilted at windmills, 
thinking them giants, and ended up up-ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas Llosa, trying to write himself into a politician, thought he could 
acquire the windmill and turn it into a giant. And he ended up -- what with his 
associates easing a crusade into a thoroughly conventional political operation 
-- juggling cogs, paddles and grease, paying dues to the millers' consortium 
and quite covered in flour. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Fish," he is not yet dusted back into writing form. There are useful 
things to be learned, but these are clouded by a swollen volume of detail: 
campaign trips, excoriations of a few associates and many enemies, and a 
structure that goes "and then . . . and then." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign chapters alternate rather forcedly with others recalling his 
childhood and growing up. There is a notable portrait of his father, who 
abandoned Mario's mother before he was born and returned 11 years later to turn 
his golden childhood into an eccentrically terrifying one.  
</P>
<P>
 There are accounts of military school, university, early attempts at 
journalism and writing, and his scandalous marriage to the sister of an uncle's 
wife (fictionalized in "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"). 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the material here is interesting, and there are passages of brilliant 
evocation. But, as in the campaign journal, the writing seems loose and hasty, 
as if Vargas Llosa's artistic heart were not entirely in it. He writes that 
during the campaign he had to give up serious writing because his "beloved 
demons" had fled. In "Fish," they have not quite returned.

APPRECIATION; ADJOURNED!; THE ROAD ENDS FOR A BIT OF TV HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "L.A. Law," which ends its mostly distinguished eight-year run tonight, 
changed television series about attorneys the way "Hill Street Blues" altered 
shows about cops. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional tones of TV lawyer series such as "The Defenders" and "Perry 
Mason" were, if not outdated, suddenly displaced by a rowdy, behind-the-scenes 
workplace drama in which the attorneys were as fallible and human -- and 
sometimes just as dreadful -- as they were, in their best moments, noble. 
</P>
<P>
 Overriding everything else was the writing. The words were like speeding 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Action shows such as "Magnum, P.I." and "The A-Team" had had their day, and 
now series like "L.A. Law" and "Moonlighting" were showing that great dialogue 
was infinitely more satisfying than car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, "L.A. Law," which debuted in October, 1986, and went on to win four 
best drama Emmys -- tying "Hill Street Blues" -- broke totally from the aura of 
series about attorneys, combining important issues with the human comedy, and, 
at its best, pulling off a kind of legal circus atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The show served notice right at the start that it was going to change things 
in television. A woman private eye checking out a divorce case returned to the 
law office, turned over some photographs of a couple and noted that they had 
engaged "in a sex act usually described by a two-digit number." 
</P>
<P>
 That line was one of the most significant in television history because it was 
a major signal that new standards were about to turn traditional network policy 
on its ear. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, it is common knowledge that after its first five years or so, "L.A. 
Law," while still better than most shows, had suddenly started to wobble 
uncertainly. It came back much stronger in concept and delivery this season -- 
a fitting finale -- but for a while, it was like trying to stay loyal to a 
baseball team that kept changing its lineup as free agents were picked up to 
replace old favorites. They may have been good, but it just wasn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a dissenter, I guess, because I thought the famous fifth-season episode 
in which nasty lawyer Rosalind Shays (Diana Muldaur) was disposed of by having 
her step into an open elevator shaft was, while shocking and somehow wildly 
deserved, a creative misstep that seemed like a desperate audience-grabber. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, like "Saturday Night Live," "L.A. Law" was often at its best when it 
was most tasteless. Or just plain off the wall. There was never better humor on 
the show than the episode in which attorney Stuart Markowitz (Michael Tucker) 
learned the sexual secret -- never revealed, by the way -- of "The Venus 
Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
 However, amid all the important social issues, the zany goings-on, the 
dramatics of the courtroom and in the law office's various conferences, I will, 
most of all, remember Benny. 
</P>
<P>
 Benny Stulwicz. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said he was simply retarded. Others used the term "developmentally 
disabled." Like Susan Dey, Larry Drake -- who portrayed Benny -- was not a 
member of the original cast. But the addition of these two characters was 
utterly essential to the success of "L.A. Law" as they blended with such 
television originals as Corbin Bernsen's sex-obsessed, cynical divorce lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Benny was another breakthrough for TV, showing a disabled person, warts and 
all, as a total human being. Drake was so good in the part that, at first, many 
viewers thought he really was retarded. But he wasn't. The television academy 
recognized his work by giving him the first two Emmy acting awards won by a 
regular member of the cast. (Alfre Woodward won a guest performer Emmy for the 
pilot.) 
</P>
<P>
 The basic strengths of the series -- the writing, directing, producing and 
ensemble playing of the irresistible characters -- were underlined by the fact 
that "L.A. Law," created by Steven Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher, actually won 
very few Emmys in acting categories. Aside from Drake and Woodard, only Jimmy 
Smits and Richard Dysart won Emmys for their performances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think the show was never quite the same after Dey, Smits and Harry Hamlin 
left. Despite the abilities of the other performers, the departing actors were 
all essential leading characters with a special kind of magnetism. Alan 
Rachins, Jill Eikenberry, Blair Underwood, Amanda Donohoe and Michele Green 
were part of a pretty impressive group as well, but the turnover took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as I admired the impact of Benny's character -- with his childish 
innocence a perfect counterpoint to the hard-edged, cynical doings at the 
office -- I had a similar feeling about Susan Ruttan, who, as Roxanne Melman, 
brought a kind of astonishing sense of level-headedness to the surroundings of 
her richer, more flamboyant colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a classic scene in which Ruttan walks in on Bernsen as he is 
engaging in sex with a blonde -- and, matter-of-factly, without preaching, 
quickly takes charge, whisks him away and gets him into shape for a birthday 
party being held for him outside the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its soap-opera-ish diversions, especially in its sixth and seventh 
seasons, when audiences were wondering about what had happened to this weekly 
classic, it is still on my all-time schedule. It was simply great enough for 
long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Bernsen says in a video of interviews with the cast distributed by NBC 
the other day, "L.A. Law" may have "antiquated a bit" but it reflected 
wonderfully the excesses and greed of the 1980s. Quite rightly, Bernsen notes 
that Bochco's controversial new police series, "NYPD Blue," deals with the 
dysfunctional society that now has followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain shows capture an era," said Bernsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Law," long a Thursday fixture, is still good, says Drake, but he 
concedes it is no longer appointment TV. Adds Eikenberry: "When we were at our 
hottest, people were talking about it" in offices across the country on Friday 
mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good run, and because it is indeed still better than most shows on 
TV, you could make a pretty fair case for continuing it for that reason alone. 
But the magic of those Friday morning water-cooler discussions is long gone, 
and it seems just about time to call it a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * "L.A. Law" airs at 10 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

However, one work that originated in Los Angeles, "Twilight: Los Angeles,

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; THE BRAND NEW HEAVIES PARTY DOWN AT THE PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a scene in "Crooklyn" in which Spike Lee's early-'70s family dances 
along to the funky steps on TV's "Soul Train." Were that family to be 
transported two decades forward in time, the group they'd no doubt recognize 
and love best would be the Brand New Heavies, whose soul sound is neither heavy 
nor brand-new, but who still very effectively manage to shake the dust off the 
sucker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palace was packed Tuesday with a sell-out crowd of evenly dispersed racial 
diversity, prompting one record exec to describe the throng as "very Benetton." 
Anglophiles mixed freely with R&B freaks and though leggy singer N'Dea 
Davenport hails from Atlanta, the three mod-ish blokes who make up the 
remainder of the core quartet (augmented live by six more players) are Brits. 
Even knowing that, it still seemed a shock the first time bassist Andrew Levy 
accentedly spoke up, so indigenously ours is their sound. 
</P>
<P>
 So leave it to the English to again feed us back what we've forgotten, and 
good. After keeping the sardines waiting an unaccountably long time, the 
Heavies arrived with a relatively-worth-the-wait 90-minute set firmly on the 
axis extending from James Brown staccato horn riffs) to War (wah-wah funk 
guitar) to Chic (good-timey disco) to fellow revivalists Lisa Stansfield and 
Soul II Soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport's athleticism was more celebratory than sultry, and the tight band 
harked back to a more carefree time of rampant trombone solos. If undeniably 
featherweight, this is the all-purpose party band of the moment. CHRIS WILLMAN

ART REVIEWS; FINDING MEANING IN THE MUFFLED MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suzanne McClelland's paintings look dirty. Some have the presence of soiled 
linens. Others resemble bodily orifices, bulbous organs or poisonous oil 
spills. A few seem to be suffocating in thick, pungent smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 At L.A. Louver Gallery, messy gestures scrawled across raw canvas, carved into 
plywood and smeared over sandpaper resound with immediate visceral impact. 
Unlike much current art aimed at our bodies, however, the young New Yorker's 
predominantly black-and-white abstractions don't punch you in the gut or club 
you over the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, her mature, powerful works feel as if they get stuck in your throat. 
After spending a little time with McClelland's paintings, letters and words 
begin to emerge from their glutinous stews of charcoal, paint, clay and 
synthetic resin. You catch yourself stuttering and mumbling along with them, 
struggling to make sense of their muffled articulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But McClelland doesn't let you get much out of her art by reading it. Each 
cacophonous painting contains only one word, such as more , anymore or sure . 
Their meanings depend on their placement in sentences and the tone in which 
they're spoken. "More" is always relative; "anymore" compounds the ambiguity; 
"sure" signifies anything from sarcastic dismissal to eager agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 McClelland paints each word so irregularly and repeats it so many times that 
its significance dissolves into an abstract composition with its own rhythm and 
diction. You can almost hear her images. 
</P>
<P>
 One seems to describe a defiant shout in the night. Another evokes a barbed 
reply muttered under one's breath. A third has the feel of a cascade of 
syllables pouring out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The content of these utterances is never specified. McClelland's paintings 
pull words apart until language breaks down. In the end, speech is experienced 
more like a burp than a tool for communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a tenacious cough that causes your whole body to convulse, or a notion so 
distasteful you cannot say it out loud, her work gives emphatic physical form 
to the invisible force that binds bodies to language. Speaking becomes a type 
of oral gratification in which coherence isn't always important. 
</P>

 Abstract Studies: The previously unexhibited suite of 21 charcoal drawings by 
David Smith (1906-65) at Margo Leavin Gallery offers an encyclopedic glimpse 
into his well-known oeuvre. Sketched over two months in 1958, with more than 
half the drawings dating from just two days, these approximately 17-by-11-inch 
works are the only charcoal drawings Smith is known to have made. 
</P>
<P>
 This curious group of abstract studies is intriguing because it is at once 
casual and comprehensive, uncharacteristically loose and remarkably thorough in 
its survey of the Modernist sculptor's artistic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they lack the stately composure of his handsome ink washes, their 
offhanded draftsmanship gives them a tentativeness and vulnerability both 
awkward and charming -- qualities rarely seen in Smith's scrupulous ink 
drawings and never present in his spray-painted or polished steel sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 The charcoal sketches fall into three categories. The least captivating most 
closely resemble the sculptures he made in the 1950s and 1960s, tight clusters 
of geometric shapes that resist gravity and attempt to lift off their 
pedestals. More volumetric than his other drawings, these nine images consist 
of vigorously shaded rectangles and circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The next group is nine abstract landscapes. Although the shaky, coloring-book 
contours of one are filled in with autumnal watercolors, the rest trace 
fragile, spidery lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The three remaining drawings are the oddest and most interesting. Two 
abstract, supine figures resemble beefy and benign versions of Giacometti's 
nightmarish sculptures. The third is Smith's weirdest: It appears to be a 
cartoonish cross between an aardvark and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 With a few quirky turns, Smith's charcoal drawings concisely summarize his 
development as a sculptor, offering a compressed overview in a medium that was 
as fresh to his hand as it is to his viewers.

 Fluid Abstraction: The selection of paintings and drawings by Jack Tworkov 
(1900-82) at Manny Silverman Gallery offers a quiet reminder that gestural 
marks and geometric structures are not antithetical ways of organizing an 
image. It also suggests strong connections between highly emotional Abstract 
Expressionism and the cool restraint of Minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tworkov is most remembered for his fluid, brightly colored gestural 
paintings from the 1950s, the linear compositions he made throughout the 1970s 
and into the 1980s are also significant for their capacity to fuse the 
spontaneous energy of swift brush strokes with the solid pictorial order of 
gridded planes. 
</P>
<P>
 His late paintings are actually large drawings on canvas and linen. Their 
simple, hard-edged structures are belied by the myriad handmade marks that 
constitute them. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few moments, Tworkov's tight, diagonally oriented fields loosen up: 
They appear to float free of their borders and to drift away from the 
picture-plane. Their muted tones and porous lines create the impression of 
light filtering through from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Tworkov's subdued paintings serve as a bridge between Joseph Albers' rigorous 
studies of color, Sol LeWitt's quirky clusters of shape and Agnes Martin's 
fluid grids. His late works link disparate tendencies and flesh out an often 
forgotten strand of Modernist abstraction.

TV REVIEW; 'WORKFORCE' ACCENTS COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Granted, the U.S. economic recovery needn't be as exciting as the Denver 
Nuggets and the Utah Jazz battling in double overtime, but does it have to be 
as boring as the KCET-produced report "The New American Workforce"? 
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms, the disease and the cures to what ails American business and 
labor have long been well-documented on public television, with current Labor 
Secretary Robert Reich's "Made in America?" and reporter Hedrick Smith's 
"Challenge to America" leading the way. "The New American Workforce" is pretty 
old stuff, lagging as far behind TV reporting trends as old-style U.S. 
corporations have lagged behind their international competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The history lesson recounted here is a familiar one. Once the dominant world 
economic power, the United States and its business culture ultimately rested on 
its laurels. The defeated nations of World War II came back strong, and, while 
Japan and Germany began grabbing market shares of costlier production in the 
'70s and '80s, low-wage work began to go south to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Robert Dean's and Lew Allison's concerns, at least, look past what 
went wrong and toward current examples of how American management and labor are 
inching toward new cooperation. The mantra, spoken by host Lindsay Wagner with 
none of the verve of her car ads, is that cooperation and shared workplace 
power breed productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the report reels out various examples of the philosophy, including 
two Los Angeles-based ventures, El Rey Sausage Co. and Toyota's Automotive 
Training Center. At Whirlpool Corp.'s main Fort Smith, Ark., plant, the 
recession forced standard union-management war councils to evolve into work 
committees. At Intel Corp., the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer 
keeps pummeling the competition with constant retraining and a perfectionist 
work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only imagine, though, what KCET's often creative "Life & Times" 
production unit might have done portraying the local Toyota project, which is 
inspired by the German apprentice system -- that nation's key for a productive, 
high-skill work force. We're served up a feel-good sensibility rather than an 
honest, hard look at how the program is actually changing the lives of formerly 
aimless kids and gang members. If a new work ethic is truly taking hold, show 
us, don't tell us. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The New American Workforce" airs at 8 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

NEWS BITES : BRING ME ANOTHER SHIRLEY, BARKEEP -- IT'S AN ANNIVERSARY 
</P>

 This year is the 60th anniversary of Shirley Temple (who's still incredibly 
popular -- witness Fox's colorized reissue of her films on video) as America's 
most beloved movie moppet. She made patent leather tap shoes de rigueur for 
little girls in the '30s, and the Shirley Temple Cocktail, a non-alcoholic 
drink created in her name, was the Virgin Bloody Mary of its day. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SHIRLEY TEMPLE COCKTAIL 8 ounces club soda or 7-Up 1 ounce grenadine syrup 
1 slice orange 1 red maraschino cherry 
</P>
<P>
 Mix soda and grenadine syrup. Serve in tall glass with straw, garnished with 
orange and maraschino (and, unless your heart is made of stone, a little paper 
parasol as well). Liqueured Up 
</P>
<P>
 New, gracefully named cocktails which reconfirm one's troubled faith in the 
college generation: Nazis from Hell (based on two liqueurs, herbal 
Jaegermeister and mint-flavored Rumple Minze); Liquid Cocaine (ditto plus 
151-proof rum). Warning: Contains Book 
</P>
<P>
 "The Road to Wellville," T. Coraghessan Boyle's hilarious novel about 19th 
Century health-food fanatics, is now available in paperback. You can't miss it 
-- the book comes in a box just like a cereal package, down to the nutritional 
information panel: "Serving size: 10 oz (283.50 g; about 1 novel). Servings per 
book: 1." Listed ingredients include dried wit, partially amalgamated Faulkner, 
sex ("a flavoring ingredient") and certified historical nuts. Lactosecream 
</P>
<P>
 Slurpy news for the lactose-intolerant: Edy's Grand Ice Cream has just 
introduced five flavors of ice cream containing less than 1 gram of lactose per 
serving. The reduced-lactose flavors are vanilla, almond praline, rocky road 
and two "'n" flavors (cookies 'n cream and strawberries 'n cream). Available at 
Safeway markets. The Psyllium Season 
</P>
<P>
 LiFiber is a drinkable dietary supplement with eight times the soluble fiber 
of oat bran by weight (derived from psyllium, the same source as laxatives such 
as Metamucil) plus a chicory root derivative called fructo oligo saccharide, 
used as food by the beneficial bacteria in the colon. You can order by calling 
(800) 748-8288. (Incidentally, before its fibrous qualities were discovered and 
people started calling it by its relatively dignified present name, psyllium 
was known as fleawort.) We're Number Three! 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of total pasta consumed, the U.S is now the No. 1 pasta-eating nation 
on earth. However, each of us only eats an average of 20 pounds a year, so on a 
per capita basis we're only No. 3. And we've got a long way to go before we 
catch up with Italy, where people eat about 60 pounds a year, or even 
Venezuela's 28-pound level. CHARLES PERRY

CALIFORNIA'S LOST WINE COUNTRY; COOKING FROM A WORKING WINERY KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I wish I knew how to make a casserole," says Mary Margaret Capellino 
Galleano. Fortunately, that urge occurs only when she's invited to a potluck. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time this energetic, plain-speaking 76-year-old is whipping out 
dishes such as risotto, polenta, osso buco and gnocchi. It's in her blood -- 
her family came from the far north of Italy, the Alpine region where gutsy food 
warms soul and body. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano lives in Mira Loma next to the winery owned by her son, Don. For 
years, she supervised the tasting room. Now she's busy with bowling, cruises -- 
and cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say I'm a good cook," she tells you, although, of course, she is. 
"But I love to cook." This day, she is making veal scaloppine with Marsala wine 
and Sherry; risotto with dried and fresh mushrooms, a green salad with 
oregano-spiked tomatoes on the side, and a lemon-flavored Sherry wine cake 
accompanied by strawberries. A couple of guests are coming for lunch, and her 
son will bring over the wines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano's house is the sort of place you can relax in. "I can't be a 
fuddy-duddy about having everything in place. Men from the winery troop in and 
out," she says. Complete with claw-foot tub and pull-chain toilet, the old 
house was moved to the vineyards from a river bottom in San Bernardino. The 
kitchen and living room overlook the vines. There's a bottle of olive oil and a 
couple of wine bottles on the back of the Magic Chef range. And the big dining 
table is the sort that you can picture Italian families gathering around, 
talking with lots of energy, emotion and gestures, just like in the movies. The 
atmosphere is homey Italian right down to Jocco the cockatiel, who can chirp 
out "O Sole Mio." 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano cooks as only a genuine Italian can. In other words, she's not 
uptight about authenticity. When she doesn't have Arborio rice, she makes 
risotto with Uncle Ben's converted rice. And it tastes wonderful. For polenta, 
she uses Albers yellow cornmeal instead of polenta flour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't cook by recipe," she says. "I just sort of ad lib." So when Galleano 
Marsala seemed too sweet for veal scaloppine a la Marsala, she cut it with 
Sherry. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano's pesto is definitely unorthodox. It's a brilliant, dark-green fluid 
mixture that she freezes in ice cube trays, handy to drop into soup or 
spaghetti sauce. Missing are two customary ingredients -- nuts and cheese. That 
makes it more versatile as a seasoning, she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poultry seasoning may not be in most Italian larders, but Galleano uses it 
frequently. It goes into spaghetti sauce and into the flour that coats the veal 
she has pounded flat for scaloppine. "I remember my mother doing it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano is a purist about some things, though. One is fresh garlic. "I never 
use garlic salt," she says adamantly. On the other hand, she has taken to 
conveniences such as the microwave. She's eager to show how she microwaves 
chopped onions and stores them in the refrigerator ready to use the next day; 
she does the same with mushrooms. "I've learned a few tricks in my 76 years," 
she tells you. 
</P>
<P>
 In good Italian tradition, she uses lots of home-grown foods, like vegetables 
and home-cured olives. Son Don cures the olives and they store them in the 
freezer. Greens for the salad she is making came from friends' gardens. The mix 
includes dandelion greens, curly endive and romaine. Galleano adds the winery's 
own red wine vinegar to the hard-boiled egg she is crushing for the dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing she does not do is bake, except for easy things like the Sherry 
wine cake, which is made with mixes. In her family there was no time for such 
pursuits. "I guess they had to struggle, so they never baked," she says, 
talking about her grandmother, who had eight children. 
</P>
<P>
 The family emigrated to Canada, then the United States. Galleano was born in 
North Beach, San Francisco. When she was 3, her parents moved to Redondo Beach 
and took up poultry farming. "I had to help. In those days you didn't come home 
from school and watch TV," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When making risotto she crumbles in an Italian sausage, although ordinarily 
she would use chicken giblets. She remembers the stew her grandmother would 
make from giblets, livers, cocks combs and feet "in the old days when times 
were tough." It may sound like hardship food but "it was delicious," Galleano 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, she married Bernard "Nino" Galleano, whose father sold wine grapes to 
her father. Bernard died in 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 Family history told and dishes ready to eat, she calls to her son, "We're 
gonna eat, Donald." And in he comes with the wines for lunch: Zinfandel from 
old vines; a white wine blended from Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and 
Chardonnay, and a sweet, almond-flavored wine for the cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Galleano talks enthusiastically about his mother's cooking. He's obviously 
devoted to her, and he hands out a booklet that tells her life history, with 
photographs. The booklet was compiled for her 70th birthday celebration, which 
involved days of partying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think, after all these years of cooking, that Mary Galleano would regard 
a restaurant dinner as a treat. But no. "When you cook Italian at home, you are 
not too crazy about going out to eat," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 MARY'S PESTO 1 cup Italian parsley 1 cup fresh basil leaves 5 cloves garlic 
3/4 cup olive oil 
</P>

CALIFORNIA'S LOST WINE COUNTRY; COTES DE CUCAMONGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although it was a successful wine-growing region as early as 1902, the 
Cucamonga Valley's greatest claim to fame would occur much later, in the 1950s, 
in train station sketches on Jack Benny's Sunday night TV show, when unseen 
actor Mel Blanc would announce, "Train leaving on track 5 for Anaheim, Azusa 
and Cuc- (pause)-amonga." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Gino Filippi hopes to gain more formal recognition for the area. He has 
filed a petition with the federal government seeking approval to use a 
Cucamonga Valley viticultural appellation. It would permit wineries using 
grapes from the area to say so on the front label of their wine bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Filippi is the grandson of Joseph Filippi, founder of the J. Filippi Winery, 
which once had eight tasting rooms sprinkled around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 His petition seeks to make formal the area known as Cucamonga Valley, 15 miles 
west of San Bernardino. The proposed 171-square-mile area is bounded on the 
north by the San Gabriel Mountain foothills and on the other three sides by 
various natural boundaries including creeks and watershed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If the petition to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is approved (in 
about a year), the greatest beneficiaries will be Don Galleano, owner of the 
largest winery in the area, Galleano Winery, and brothers Gino and J. P. 
Filippi, who operate J. Filippi Winery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest benefit is more local identity," says Galleano. "People here 
need to take pride in the work that has been done, to realize that the people 
who lived here before literally turned sagebrush and wild country into a 
cultivated paradise, and they did that with a lot of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the Cucamonga Valley appellation will pay a tribute to those 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gino Filippi looks at it from more of a business angle. "We can produce nice 
wines from our grapes," he says, "but because we had no appellation, we've been 
bypassed by the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 Without a regionally specific appellation, all wines coming from the area had 
to carry the appellation of "California," which Filippi says leads people to 
think it is a lower quality wine blended from a variety of areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Filippi family sold the J. Filippi Winery property to a development 
company last December, but the Filippi brothers intend to revive the wine 
business. Gino Filippi says the winery will move from its original site in 
Fontana to the former Regina Winery in Etiwanda, which for the last 30 years 
has been a vinegar-producing plant. The Regina facility is being leased to the 
Filippi family by the city of Rancho Cucamonga. The municipality, with 115,000 
residents, has done much to protect the viticultural history of the area, 
acquiring Regina (as well as other historic, wine-related properties) in its 
quest to maintain the wine history. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers have redesigned the J. Filippi Winery label, but even if the AVA 
request is granted, most of their wines wouldn't be able to use the "Cucamonga 
Valley" appellation. Their current releases include fruit grown in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other active bonded winery premise in the area is Rancho de Philo in 
Alta Loma, owned by 85-year-old Philo Biane, former chairman of Brookside 
Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Biane produces a few hundred cases of Sherry each year here. He is beloved 
locally and is praised for being the first to widely plant grapes in the 
now-thriving Temecula Valley in southern Riverside County. That came in the 
1960s, when Brookside grew to become the largest winery in Rancho Cucamonga, 
with storage capacity of 8 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookside pioneered the off-site tasting rooms that once dotted many Southern 
California communities' shopping centers. At its peak, Brookside had 35 such 
tasting rooms, including some in Arizona and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was acquired in the early 1970s by Beatrice Foods of Chicago, 
which closed it in the late 1980s. DAN BERGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The low-lying, weathered buildings show cracks; the sun-splashed courtyard is 
dotted with turn-of-the-century winemaking equipment, partially rusted and 
covered with cobwebs and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Galleano Winery in Rancho Cucamonga, an area roughly 60 miles east of 
Los Angeles that once was the largest wine-growing region in the United States. 
The winery looks pretty much as it did decades ago, and Don Galleano wants to 
keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have refurbished the place with a coat of paint, a repaved parking 
lot, and perhaps even a neon sign for the tasting room, with a flashing hand 
pointing the way. But Galleano sees his winery as a living example of one of 
the most vital and energetic wine districts in U.S. history, a district that 
has steadily dwindled in recent years.

<P>
 Galleano, caretaker of the last remaining family-owned and family-operated 
winery exclusively using grapes from Rancho Cucamonga, vows his property will 
always be here to represent the hard work that came before. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century ago this east-west valley was home to more than 35,000 acres of 
vines (greater even than the Napa Valley is today) and more than five dozen 
wineries. Its decline was caused by a change in consumer tastes, real estate 
development and a lack of winemaking technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1800s, this flat land in western San Bernardino County was a 
barren place of high sand dunes and an apparent lack of water. But by 1900, it 
was on the road to becoming a haven for Italian immigrants seeking to recraft 
the red-wine tradition of their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Its subsequent decline saddens Galleano, who believes he must preserve its 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 To speak with Galleano -- which anyone can do by showing up most Sundays for a 
tour -- is to get a history lecture. First, however, you must get here, to the 
modest buildings along Wineville Road. And don't drive too fast or you'll miss 
the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'You're the guy with the stories,' and I like tellin' 'em," says 
Galleano with a broad smile. He often starts his stories in front of his house, 
across the street from the winery. 
</P>
<P>
 "This house was built in 1895 by Col. Esteban Cantu, the governor of Baja 
California Norte," Galleano says. "It was one of a series of summer houses he 
owned in this country, and my grandfather, Domenico -- he was called Nino -- 
bought it in 1927." As Galleano talks, he continues through the winery with its 
huge, square concrete fermentation tanks -- one so large that, with its wall 
removed, it is now a private tasting room. 
</P>
<P>
 The cellar also contains giant redwood vats of red wine, white wine, Sherry 
and Port. The smells are heady. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best place to catch Galleano's act is inside the small, history-drenched 
tasting room. Nostalgia lurks in every cranny. 
</P>
<P>
 "See that clock?" he says, pointing to a huge, circular timepiece you couldn't 
miss from a mile away. "I got it from Brookside (Winery). It had been at the 
old Italian Vineyard Co. Why, it was probably bought by Mr. (Secondo) Guasti 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Guasti, a visionary from Piedmont, Italy, who, legend has it, upon 
observing one day in 1900 that winter rainfall runoff disappeared into the 
sand, discovered a lone grapevine in the desert floor. He dug down 24 feet 
before finding the tip of the roots in soil moist from the water table. 
</P>
<P>
 "This valley has exceedingly deep sand, so vines could send roots down to such 
depths that superficial drought couldn't affect them," says Thomas Pinney, a 
professor of English at Pomona College and author of "A History of Wine in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinney says the sandy soil and accessible water table persuaded Guasti that he 
could develop the land into vineyards, so he bought eight square miles of land, 
founded the Italian Vineyard Co. and planted European vines -- such 
warm-climate grapes as Grenache, Mourvedre and Syrah. He also brought entire 
families from Italy to settle the town he named for himself and to work the 
vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts would one day become the world's largest contiguous vineyard, 
5,000 acres, surrounding Guasti. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather sold a lot of wine to the fishermen from San Pedro, mainly 
Yugoslavs and Italians," says Galleano. "They would drive out here for two, 
three days at a time and have jack rabbit drives (hunts) in the sand dunes, and 
they'd eat at the local restaurants and they'd drink a lot of wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the history of this region is of just this sort -- anecdotal. Few 
books exist on the area, and those that do are skimpy and poorly organized, 
with dates and even spellings tossed about rather casually. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1976 article on the region for the Claremont Courier, Pinney wrote: "It 
is not easy to form an accurate picture of the (wine) industry in Cucamonga 
since it is so unsettled and no currently available guide is even approximately 
trustworthy." 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear, however, that much of the wine tradition that existed here prior 
to 1920, the onset of Prohibition, was lost during the next 13 years. Galleano 
says many of the winemaking families gave up and left the area. A few, such as 
his, stayed on and sold grapes for home winemakers. (Prohibition laws permitted 
a head of a household to make 200 gallons of wine for personal use each year.) 
</P>
<P>
 When Prohibition ended in late 1933, the Galleano family was among the leaders 
in a second wave of development here. Over the next quarter century, Cucamonga 
Valley grew faster than any other wine region. Grape planting took off in 
earnest as wineries girded for increased demand. And the demand was largely for 
sweeter wines, such as Port and Sherry, which then were far more popular with 
Americans than table wine. And Cucamonga made excellent dessert wines. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in the early 1950s, more than 60 wineries sold wine to local and 
national accounts; winery sales rooms were busy on weekends with visitors from 
Los Angeles (Galleano has old cask cards showing that wine was $1 per gallon, 
but you had to bring your own empty jug). Grapes were shipped near and far for 
commercial and home winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1962, the valley was producing the equivalent of 4 million cases of wine a 
year, more than 5% of all wine sold in the United States, including imports. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bubble was soon to burst. Only five years later, in 1967, 
statistics show, more dry wine was sold nationally than sweet. And winemaking 
technology hadn't yet advanced to the point where good table wine could be made 
from such warm-climate grapes. Thus began the rapid decline of Rancho Cucamonga 
as a vine capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of demand for Cucamonga wine came at the same time that demand rose 
for land for housing and office buildings, spurred by the development of 
Ontario International Airport and other projects. And the vineyards were ripe 
for the picking. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano, 42, nearly gets misty-eyed when he speaks of the decline of the area 
as a wine center: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, I was looking at all these guys in the twilight of 
their lives, still growing grapes and still making wine," he says. "They were 
tired. They were looking at real estate. You know, farming for most people is a 
way to hold onto the land until you can sell it for a price much higher than 
what you bought it for. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather lived a perfectly happy life growing grapes and making wine. 
But in the 1960s, when it became tough to sell the wine, when they knew they 
had bought the ground for $500 an acre and they were offered $5,000 an acre to 
sell it for development, well, can you blame them?" 
</P>
<P>
 So the vineyards with their ancient, gnarled vines and small wine cellars all 
became expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Galleano Winery can't avoid the sounds of a busier world. Trucks gazoom 
along I-15 on the other side of the ancient vines; jet engines shriek into 
Ontario Airport, a couple of miles northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the winery buildings, sitting under the flight path and in front of the 
winery's three acres of old vines, cluster alone. The only neighbors are 
grazing cattle. A car passes so infrequently that, when one does, you wonder 
whether the driver is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the J. Fillippi Winery in Fontana, across the 10 and 15 
freeways to the northeast, was sold to developers and will move to another 
location, leaving Galleano as the last holdout making wine at its original 
site. But his decision to preserve the heritage here was made long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the decision in 1977," he says. "This history has to be preserved, 
it's going so fast. I've been given an opportunity, and I'm not gonna blow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, however, it is development -- a word that is otherwise anathema to 
Galleano -- that permits him to save his little five-acre rancho and, with 
luck, 62 acres of vineyards nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano is involved in the development of a 50-acre parcel on Aero Highway in 
Rancho Cucamonga that is just a half-mile from the $11-million Epicenter, the 
stadium of the local minor league baseball franchise, the Quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The vines on Galleano's development site are gone now; the land is graded and 
has curbs, gutters and sewers; buildings of 12,000 square feet to 25,000 square 
feet are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 More vineyard land sits adjacent to the Epicenter. Galleano swears it will be 
buildings before long. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges the irony of using the funds from a destroyed vineyard to save 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds odd that I would be developing a vineyard into buildings, 
but it's to save one. That five acres," he says of his own ranch with finality, 
"don't move." 
</P>
<P>
 And he intends to convert more land to agriculture. One parcel adjacent to his 
home was zoned for industrial use some years ago. When the economy turned sour, 
he says, "Bank of America took the property over. I'm trying to buy it. If I 
can, I'll change it into an agricultural preserve.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for areas that have been designated as open space. I want to 
plant grapes to take care of the needs of this winery and other wineries that 
think we're doing something right here." He becomes passionate when he speaks 
of the great quality of Mourvedre, Grenache and Muscat of Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Galleano processed virtually all the grapes grown on the last 
remaining 1,850 acres of vines in the Cucamonga Valley, and he sold a third of 
a million gallons of wine in bulk to other wine companies, such as Bronco, 
Franzia and Delicato. R.H. Phillips Winery in Esparto, near Sacramento, 
annually buys large amounts of Galleano's red wines to blend into its 
successful "Night Harvest Cuvee Rouge," which sells for about $6 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Says R.H. Phillips' winemaker, Ron McClendon: "I'm surprised at the color he 
gets in his Grenache. It's really a powerhouse, full of fruit. And the 
Mourvedre has a special character, fresh fruit and smoke." He says nearly a 
fourth of the "Night Harvest Cuvee Rouge" is Galleano's Cucamonga wine, "and 
that wine needs his fruit," says McClendon. "It's the signature of that wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the wine Galleano markets in bulk comes from vineyards owned by 
developers waiting until the real estate market improves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a wonderful vineyard right down the street that's owned by General 
Dynamics," says Galleano. "It's got old dry-farmed Grenache and Zinfandel. 
They're thinking of putting a golf course on it, but until they do, we get the 
grapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those grapes go into the table wines Galleano sells at his tasting 
room. The red wines are rustic and rough-hewn but they are nowhere near as 
coarse and earthy as many of the country wines of the past. Still, they are 
wines happily at home in a water glass aside a hearty stew. Galleano uses no 
small-oak aging, preferring to leave the wine in large upright redwood vats for 
a year to soften before bottling. 
</P>
<P>
 One classic example is the 4-liter bottle of Zinfandel for $7.75. Customers 
may also buy a ceramic crock with a spigot, for dispensing the wine. Galleano 
also sells his gutsy red wines to Basque sheepherders, who, he says, love his 
wines. He also makes the house wine for Central Basco, a popular Basque 
restaurant in nearby Chino. Galleano's white wines, particularly the Muscat, 
are fresher than they were in the past, but most of them offer a trace of 
residual sugar, so they are aimed more at picnics, patios and parties than fine 
dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleano may not be crafting Chateau Latour. But he is honoring his 
great-grandfather's heritage by preserving a trace of what once was a huge and 
flourishing industry now fast evaporating -- a blessing still on view down 
remote Wineville Road.

CALIFORNIA'S LOST WINE COUNTRY; OUT OF THE PAST: CUISINE DE GUASTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its heyday, the Italian Vineyard Co. boasted more acreage than any vineyard 
in the world. Now it's only a memory that surfaces when one hears the name 
Guasti. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondo Guasti was an Italian immigrant who built his wine empire in the 
Cucamonga Valley and created the town of Guasti. Born in Mombaruzzo in the 
province of Piedmont, he arrived in Los Angeles in 1883 and founded the 
vineyard company in 1900. He died in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Penniless when he arrived, Guasti later lived in a mansion on West Adams 
Boulevard in Los Angeles that was said to have cost $500,000 to build. In the 
first decade of this century, that was an extravagant sum. 
</P>
<P>
 During his lean years, Guasti worked for a time in a restaurant. In his 
showplace home, the food was eclectic, a mix of Italian, Chinese, Mexican, 
French and sophisticated American, judging by the recipes of his wife and 
daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These recipes appear in a privately printed cookbook published in 1930. "The 
Junior League Recipe Book," riddled with names of prominent Angelenos, includes 
recipes by Mrs. Secondo Guasti (Louisa Anna Amillo) and Mrs. Secondo Guasti Jr. 
(Gertrude Orcutt). 
</P>
<P>
 The Guastis also contributed a full-page ad that promoted their cooking 
Sherry. "For foods that linger long in memory, try Sherry -- the flavor secret 
of master chefs," the ad said. (During Prohibition, the wine was salted to make 
it unfit for drinking but legal to sell.) 
</P>
<P>
 The ad also mentions "the famous Guasti Wine Jellies," and the book includes a 
wine jelly recipe from Mrs. Guasti Jr. Light in flavor and texture, it is more 
like a dessert than a stiff jelly to spread over toast. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Guasti dishes are simple, such as "Little pig canape" from Mrs. 
Guasti Jr., which consisted of broiled baby sausages rolled in small French 
pancakes. Others were extravagant, such as the senior Mrs. Guasti's 
bouillabaisse that required barracuda, lobster, clams and oysters. The lobster 
was to be cut in pieces "like cubes of sugar," she specified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Guasti Jr. liked to experiment with ethnic foods. She contributed 
enchiladas that were filled with cheese, olives and hard-boiled eggs and topped 
with a red sauce that required several dozen dried chiles. Her chop suey called 
for chicken breast meat at a time when packaged parts weren't available. One 
had to buy a whole chicken and cut it up to get the breast, as the recipe 
instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Italian contributions included minestrone, spaghetti sauce, fritto misto 
(which was a mixed fry of lamb chops, veal brains, sweetbreads, chicken livers, 
artichoke hearts and mushrooms), stuffed zucchini, artichokes stuffed with 
anchovies and bread crumbs, spinach frittata and zabaione , an airy dessert of 
egg yolks, sugar and Guasti Sherry beaten over hot water until light and 
thickened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guasti way of life was disrupted within a few years of publication of the 
cookbook. Secondo Guasti Jr. died in Santa Barbara on April 6, 1933 at the age 
of 42. His widow remarried in 1935 and moved to New York. The elder Mrs. 
Guasti, who was only 15 when she married, died in 1937, 10 years after her 
husband. Her luxurious home and its contents were sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are four of the Guasti recipes, adjusted to contemporary ingredients and 
cooking procedures to make them usable today. MRS. SECONDO GUASTI'S MINESTRONE

LAMB FOR THE SACRIFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Id al-Adha, also known as Kurban Bayram or the Feast of the Sacrifice, falls 
on May 21 this year. In Mecca it is the culmination of the pilgrimage, the day 
the pilgrims sacrifice sheep to commemorate Abraham's willingness to offer up 
his son on God's command and God's acceptance of a ram in his stead. (Muslims 
believe that the son who was ransomed in this way was Ismail -- that is, 
Ishmael -- rather than Isaac.) 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, Muslims around the world are also expected to sacrifice an 
animal. In practice, most make arrangements with a butcher who deals in halal 
meat from animals licit for Muslims to eat (such as sheep, goats or cattle) 
slaughtered in accordance with Muslim law. The meat is to be shared with 
friends, neighbors and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans tend to think of Islam as the religion of the Near East, but it long 
ago spread beyond the Arab countries and Iran. More than a third of all Muslims 
live in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), and 
one-sixth, or 170 million, live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudi Mampir is a North Hollywood restaurant specializing in the cuisine of 
chef Mimin Rijker's home, west Java. The decor actually suggests the 
predominantly Hindu island of Bali, but Rijker's Islamic roots are indicated by 
the graceful Arabic calligraphy of a wall plaque and the note on the menu that 
only halal meat is served. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may surprise some people that sheep are raised in the tropical environment 
of Indonesia, but they are, and Sudi Mampir always features lamb dishes such as 
miniature kebabs ( sate ) and gule kambing , a sort of curried soup. Mimin 
Rijker's version is particularly vivid and spicy. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional special-occasion dish of Java is tumpeng selamatan , a steep 
conical mountain of coconut rice surrounded with fried fish, fowl and meat, 
garnished with cucumbers, tomatoes and hard-boiled eggs. Lamb sate might be 
included, but gule would not be served with tumpeng selamatan , because it's 
too rich -- both the soup and the rice contain coconut milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some parts of Indonesia you mix rice into your gule, but in western Java 
it's traditionally served accompanied by lontong, which is a sort of rice 
tamale made by parboiling rice, wrapping it in bamboo leaves and steaming until 
done. Fresh galangal can be found in Thai markets, where it is called kha; 
fresh ginger can substitute. These days, fresh lemon grass is often available 
in supermarkets, and dried lemon grass is sold in Latin markets or food 
sections as te de limon. Candlenuts, daun salam leaves and fried onion flakes 
are available in Dutch or Indonesian import stores such as Ann's Dutch Imports 
in Studio City. JAVANESE CURRIED LAMB SOUP (Gule Kambing) 2 pounds lamb or kid 
leg or shoulder Water 4 candlenuts (kemiri) or macadamia nuts 1/2 teaspoon 
crushed red pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1 
(3-inch) piece fresh galangal or ginger, peeled and diced 1/2 teaspoon ground 
turmeric 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 stalk lemon grass, minced 1 tablespoon oil 1 
teaspoon brown sugar, packed 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 daun salam leaf or 
bay leaf Salt 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk (santen) 1 1/2 tablespoons fried 
onion flakes or 1/2 onion, diced and fried brown 
</P>
<P>
 Cut lamb into small pieces. Place in pot with water to cover, bring to boil, 
skim and simmer until meat is tender. Remove meat with slotted spoon and 
reserve cooking water. 
</P>
<P>
 Pound candlenuts into paste. Add red pepper, cayenne, black pepper, galangal, 
turmeric, cumin and lemon grass. Mix well. Heat oil in skillet and fry paste 1 
minute. Add brown sugar, coriander, daun salam leaf, reserved cooking water 
plus additional water if necessary to make 2 1/2 cups liquid, and salt to 
taste. Cover and bring to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower heat to simmer and add meat. Stir until meat is warmed, then add coconut 
milk and stir continuously until liquid is very hot (be careful: if coconut 
milk boils, it can curdle). Sprinkle fried onion into soup. Taste and correct 
seasonings. Remove daun salam. Serve with rice. Makes 6 servings.

 These versatile little snacks look a little like peanut brittle but taste more 
like potato chips with peanuts in them. The name is pronounced rum-PEH-yek 
KAH-chahng. PEANUT CRISPS (Rempeyek Kacang) 1/4 pound shelled peanuts 1/2 cup 
water 3/4 cup rice flour 1 teaspoon salt 2 green onions, green part only, 
minced Oil Split each peanut in half. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly add water to rice flour in bowl, little at time, stirring and mixing 
thoroughly. Batter should be thick but able to run. Stir salt, peanuts and 
green onions into batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat small amount of oil in skillet and simultaneously heat larger amount in 
wok. Drop 1 tablespoon batter, including some peanuts and green onions, into 
skillet. Fry about 30 seconds, then remove half-cooked crisp with spatula and 
put in wok to deep-fry. (You should be able to fry 3 to 4 crisps at a time.) 
Remove from wok when crisp and golden-brown, about 1 minute. Continue until all 
batter is used. Let cool before serving. Makes about 20 crisps.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: CHINA LAMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One strange thing about eating a lot of Chinese food in Los Angeles is that 
you become blase about places that would be restaurant Meccas in Chicago or New 
York, oversaturated as we are with grand seafood palaces or joints serving 
exemplary New Wave Shanghai cuisine. China Islamic is a small, sweet restaurant 
in the western corner of Rosemead, with the usual upscalish lime-green decor 
and faux marble, with window cutouts that resemble minarets and fish tanks 
whose inhabitants are not destined to be eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't bothered to reserve, you may have to wait a half-hour for a 
table. And although China Islamic may be only the second best Muslim Chinese 
restaurant in the area -- Tung Lai Shun, in the great Chinese mall up the road, 
might edge it out on points -- it can be almost better than anyplace else. 
Islamic Chinese food, nomad-influenced and ultra-popular in Beijing, is a hard 
thing to burn out on. 
</P>
<P>
 But where China Islamic restaurant is a stronghold of Muslim-style Chinese 
cooking, it also prepares many of the standard suburban-Chinese dishes -- egg 
rolls, sizzling-rice soup, kung-pao shrimp -- sort of lackadaisically, but 
according to the Muslim dietary laws. China Islamic may be the only Chinese 
restaurant I've ever seen where Pakistani customers sometimes outnumber the 
East Asians.  
</P>
<P>
 The green-onion pancakes are pretty nice, chewy crepe-like things in contrast 
to the usual fried Frisbees; the intensely flavored steamed vegetable dumplings 
are fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, almost as soon as you walk into the restaurant, you are asked if you 
want sesame bread (you do), which is a thick disk of flatbread made to order, 
the size of a Chicago-style pizza, crust baked to a shattering crispness that 
encloses a dozen layers of steamy, scallion-flecked bread. Most people seem to 
order sesame bread here instead of rice, making little pocket sandwiches, 
dragging it through sauces, daubing it with a little vinegar and chile and 
eating sesame bread straight. Sesame bread, probably the spiritual descendant 
of the stone-baked flatbread of ancient nomads, is sort of the center of this 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of cold dishes that go very well stuffed into the sesame 
bread, cool smoothness contrasting with the bread's crunchy heat, cool, 
translucent slices of pressed beef tendon that start out the texture of hard 
rubber but melt into a rush of beef and garlic; "home-style" roast chicken, 
fragrant with spice, a little greasy, a little like perfect picnic chicken; 
strips of rich, tender beef tripe flavored with a tincture of chile and soy, 
mercifully ungamy -- for the first time I can remember, a tripe dish was the 
first thing to disappear from the table. There is a swell ox-tripe salad, 
tossed with slivered cucumber, hot mustard and a delicious, slippery flat 
noodle made from pulverized mung beans; the version of the salad made with 
slivered white-meat chicken instead of tripe is perhaps even a little better. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetables include ong choy fried with chile, green-pea leaves sauted with 
garlic, string beans charred in a very hot wok with a pungent mix of dried fish 
and black beans. There is a nice dish involving wedges of bean curd deep-fried, 
then braised in a sauce of ground beef and hot chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Muslim restaurants, China Islamic has a minor specialty in lamb, 
sliced thin and quickly fried with green onions, garlic and crunchy bits of 
fresh ginger; fried with the thick, resilient homemade noodles called "dough 
slice chow mein"; served in a cloying "sa cha" sauce. Lamb stew warm pot is an 
enormous thing, served seething in a clay vessel the diameter of a basketball 
hoop, with thick, murky broth, cellophane noodles, cabbage and the most 
extraordinary lamb red-cooked on the bone, chopstick-tender and pungent with 
soy and star anise. * China Islamic Restaurant

HOME COOK: TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home cooking is becoming an endangered skill. Every day fewer people take a 
couple of basic ingredients and make them into a nice meal. Is it because so 
many adults are working outside the house and come home too tired to fix meals 
from scratch? 
</P>
<P>
 Step by step, we have accepted cooking shortcuts -- canned foods, box mixes, 
frozen foods, microwave ovens, take-out -- to make dinner easier. But in the 
process, much of what Americans eat has become impersonal, mass-produced food. 
</P>
<P>
 For the end result of all this time-saving has not been more time with our 
families but the opposite, the end of the communal table. Today, for many 
people the dinner hour is 15 minutes of eating alone -- standing, walking or 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the great loss, far more important than not having a home-cooked meal. 
We have lost our greatest opportunity for daily communal life, the vital 
element of being nourished and civilized at a shared table. The best hope we 
have to cure this loss is to teach our children to cook simple, real food. 
</P>
<P>
 I emphasize real food. Don't entertain them by sculpting animals out of cookie 
dough; in teaching many children's cooking classes, I have found they are 
naturally fascinated with cooking. The transformation of raw ingredients is 
magic. One egg can do amazing things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following recipes can easily be done by children aged 7 through 11 -- and 
older, of course. Watch and advise the child in the beginning because of the 
danger of cuts and burns. Of course, children don't like pain any more than 
adults, but they quickly learn to be careful. And their own home-crafted food 
will be genuinely appreciated by the other members of the household. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the best way to bring the family together once again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled, but it is purposely done in a 
small amount as a beginning lesson. The best knife for beginners is a serrated 
paring knife with deep grooves that grip the vegetable for slicing.  
</P>
<P>
 SIMPLE VEGETABLE SOUP 2 tablespoons butter 1 small onion, cut in half 
lengthwise and chopped into small pieces 1 small carrot, peeled, cut into 
slices 1 rib of celery, rinsed and sliced Salt 2 cups chicken broth 1 small 
tomato, stem end cut out and chopped 1 small zucchini, stem ends cut away and 
sliced Pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in 1 1/2-quart saucepan. Swirl pan around so butter covers bottom. 
Add onion, carrot and celery. Season to taste with salt. Cook over medium heat, 
stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add broth and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmer over low heat 10 minutes, stirring often. Add zucchini. Cook 3 minutes. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve soup hot. Makes 6 servings.

 It's important to not only rinse lettuce leaves but to dry them before 
dressing; if you don't, the dressing won't coat the leaves. Always use a large 
salad bowl so there is plenty of room to toss the leaves with the dressing. 
Serve the salad right away after tossing; salads kept with dressing on lose 
their crispness. BASIC LETTUCE SALAD Lettuce leaves, about 8 cups Basic Oil and 
Vinegar Dressing Salt, pepper, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse lettuce and dry with paper towels. Put into large salad bowl. Cover with 
damp paper towel. Cover bowl and refrigerate.  
</P>
<P>
 Just before serving salad, sprinkle about 1/2 of Basic Oil and Vinegar 
Dressing all around top of lettuce. Toss well using 2 large spoons. Add more 
Dressing, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes 4 servings.

</P>
<P>
 Basic Oil and Vinegar Dressing 2 teaspoons lemon juice 2 teaspoons cider 
vinegar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
 Put lemon juice and cider vinegar into 1-cup jar with lid. Add salt. Let 
mixture stand 1 minute. Then put lid on jar and shake well. Remove lid, add 
olive oil and water. Put lid back on and shake jar to mix dressing. BAKED 
VANILLA CUSTARD Butter 2 egg yolks 3 eggs 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 3 
cups very hot milk 2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 Butter 1-quart baking dish or 8 custard cups. Set shallow pan large enough to 
hold baking dish or custard cups in 325-degree oven and add 1 inch hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 Put egg yolks and eggs in bowl. Beat with fork until completely blended. Add 
sugar and salt. Stir until mixed in. Add hot milk, little at time, stirring 
with spoon until all milk is blended into egg mixture. Add vanilla and stir. 
Strain custard mixture into 1 quart or larger measuring cup or pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour custard mixture into baking dish or custard cups. Take pan of hot water 
from oven, put cups or baking dish carefully into it, put pan back in oven and 
bake until custard is set, about 45 minutes. Custard is done when knife 
inserted in center comes out almost clean.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove from oven. Serve warm. Or let custard cool, then cover and refrigerate 
until serving. Makes 8 servings.

OH, LARDY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found the Theory of Relativity as interpreted in the feature "Lard Whips 
Butter" (April 28) to set an interesting new standard in comparative analysis. 
According to The Times' Food section writers, lard is better than butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, sure . . . and Eric is cuddlier than Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Butter is evil stuff. That lard is a trace less evil should not constitute its 
recommendation. As a 44-year-old who's been a vegetarian half her life, I can 
state from personal experience that changing to a plant-based diet was the 
kindest act I could perform -- for my own health and that of the animals who 
don't get eaten by me. 
</P>
<P>
 Lard eaters like Michelle Huneven ("Everything but the Squeal") are prone to 
rationalize the killing of pigs like her late pet Joey by nostalgically 
recreating memories of pigs at play in pastoral settings. Today's reality for 
pigs is a rotten life of confinement within concrete and metal-slatted modules. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the hard-of-heart (and arteries) regard lard-laced chocolate chip 
cookies as comfort food, but that's damn cold comfort for pigs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a vegetarian -- I do eat meat. But I do not understand how you could 
publish an article ("Everything but the Squeal") that is so cold and inhumane. 
Everyone I know would consider killing and eating a pig totally unthinkable, 
even if the pet is a pig. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has many organizations that are concerned with animal rights. Get 
with what is happening in 1994 in Los Angeles. This is a modern city with 
enlightened people who have enlightened ideas -- one of which is humanity 
toward animals. How could you print an article so disgusting and backward? The 
Food section needs to catch up with the times.

 Thank you for having the courage to take a stand against the nutrition 
fascists who are trying to take the flavor out of American cooking. As if it's 
not bad enough that American manufacturers have given us tasteless, 
pre-packaged "food" to raise our kids on, now we've got nutrition experts, 
supposedly looking out for our own good, telling us that all fats -- especially 
flavor-giving fats like lard -- are evil. But it's not the fats themselves that 
are evil, rather it's sheer overindulgence, gluttony, that should be avoided. 
Moderation in all things -- lard included -- is the key to a happy life.

 Thank you so much for refreshing my memory on why I no longer subscribe to The 
Times. The April 28 issue was bizarre to the point of gross! Lard, of all 
things, is being touted as a preferred ingredient in recipes? There is no way 
you could convince me that lard is great. Perhaps you have some connection to 
those who make pacemakers and bypass instruments!

salad with raisins and apples from Gelson's in the Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>

 DEAR SOS: I've been commissioned by various family members to make anise 
biscotti. However, I've misplaced the recipe I clipped from The Times. Would 
you reprint it so I may appease my family? 
</P>
<P>
 -- DESPERATE  
</P>
<P>
 DEAR DESPERATE: The Low-Fat Cooking column by Donna Deane produced this 
twice-baked, fat-shy biscotti. 
</P>
<P>
 ANISE BISCOTTI 3 cups flour, preferably unbleached 3 teaspoons baking powder 2 
1/2 teaspoons anise seeds Grated zest 1 orange or lemon 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
optional 3 tablespoons butter or light margarine, cut up 1 1/2 cups sugar 3 egg 
whites 1 egg 2 teaspoons vanilla 2 to 4 tablespoons pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour with baking powder, anise seeds, orange zest and salt in bowl. 
Stir to mix. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate bowl, cream butter with sugar until light. Beat in 2 1/2 egg 
whites (reserve 1/2 for glaze), egg and vanilla until blended, about 1 minute. 
Reduce speed to low and slowly stir in flour mixture. Mix in pine nuts. Dough 
will be rough and crumbly. 
</P>
<P>
 With lightly floured hands, gather dough and divide into 2 parts. Shape each 
dough on floured surface into loaf about 11 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide. 
(Work quickly. Dough does not have to be smooth.) Place 2 rolls, about 3 inches 
apart, on parchment-paper-lined baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly beat remaining egg white and brush top surface of dough. Bake at 350 
degrees about 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from oven and let stand 
about 5 to 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees. Using serrated 
knife, cut biscotti logs at slight diagonal, 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. Place 
slices, cut-side down, on baking sheet and return to oven. Bake about 10 
minutes longer until golden brown and dry. Makes about 30 cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cookie contains about: 64 calories; 38 mg sodium; 65 mg cholesterol; 1 
gram fat; 12 grams carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.04 gram fiber.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: SHIFTING ALLEGIANCES AS AUTOLAND COMMUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those of us raised in Southern California know that the brown bear doesn't 
really belong on our state flag. I mean no disrespect to wildlife enthusiasts 
or stuffed bear collectors when I say this, but it seems to me that the more 
appropriate symbol would be a car -- say a Toyota or a Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, means putting a foreign import on a domestic flag, and I also 
don't want to offend Rush Limbaugh acolytes or other superpatriots. 
</P>
<P>
 So we might want to think about putting a Ford Escort, a GM Saturn or some 
other American car on the flag. But can we really speak with any confidence 
about there being a bona fide American car anymore, what with so many of their 
parts being made in other countries, and the cars themselves being assembled 
here and there? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a better idea would be to allow each community to choose its own auto 
symbol. Westlake Village might go for the Infiniti, while Santa Paulans might 
opt for a pickup truck. Residents of Ojai might like a Jeep, while Ventura, 
being the county seat, might go for a fleet-type car, like a Pontiac Grand Am 
or a GM Caprice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, many residents of Moorpark, Simi Valley, Camarillo and now Oxnard, 
might choose a little train car, a symbol of Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 What? A commuter symbol in Autoland? It still seems like a silly idea to most 
people, judging by the crowds that can be found just about anywhere on the 101 
at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 It also seemed like an odd notion to freelance writer Barbara Weldon Tone, 
who, along with a couple thousand other Ventura County riders, climbed onto a 
train at the recently opened Metrolink station in Oxnard, to do this week's 
Centerpiece story on the new breed of Southern California commuter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been hearing this train whistle from my house," said Weldon Tone, who 
lives in Simi Valley. "One day, I was caught at the Metrolink crossing and I 
thought to myself, 'I wonder who rides this thing? Somebody must be using it or 
it wouldn't still be here after a year and a half.' I decided to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Tone said it didn't take her long to become a convert to commuter 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm something of an environmentalist, and I had great hope after riding it 
that this might actually catch on," she said. And she even took an active role 
to help ensure that it would -- she purchased some tickets for herself and her 
daughter to go to downtown Los Angeles for next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But she's still suffering a sort of cultural shock. It might take some time 
before she is really comfortable with the idea of wholesale abandonment of the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in Southern California for 27 years," she said, "and I really 
thought I'd never see the day when Californians would ride the train to work 
like they do in New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey put its coat of arms on the state flag and they manage to do the 
right thing. Maybe we should just stick to our brown bear.

 It was by no means a typical salutation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy 25th anniversary to Jenny and Jim Colb . . . Colborn." That was what 
the man with the microphone said to the 6,000-plus folks squeezed into a 
baseball stadium in Comstock Park, Mich. "Hey," he said, upon further 
consideration, "that's our manager." 
</P>
<P>
 The guests had come together not to celebrate the silver anniversary of the 
Ventura County couple, but rather for an equally (although some would say more) 
special occasion. It was opening day at Old Kent Park, the new home of the West 
Michigan Whitecaps, a Class A minor league team in the Oakland Athletics 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 No, that April 12 evening certainly would not be normal for the average 
husband and wife, but it was routine for the Colborns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny, Jim and their four children have spent many anniversaries away from 
home, but not far from home plate at one baseball diamond or another. That's 
what happens when life surrounds baseball, as it does for Jim and, as a result, 
Jenny. The couple married the year Jim signed his first professional contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I a baseball fan?" asked Jenny. "It's what puts the bread on our table. 
I'd be a baseball fan even if I didn't want to, because I like to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jim, the commitment is considerably stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time that he signed his first contract with the Chicago Cubs 25 years 
ago to the present, the Santa Paula native has devoted himself to the sport -- 
never mind the 4 1/2-year detour to sell Ventura County real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Colborn, who will be 48 Sunday, pitched in the major leagues until 1978 -- 
playing for Chicago, Milwaukee, Kansas City and Seattle -- and compiled a 
record of 83 wins and 88 losses. His best season was with Milwaukee in 1973, 
when he won 20 games and lost 12. He retired as a player in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1983, Colborn was back on the field, again with the Cubs organization, 
but this time as a coach. During a six-year span, Colborn served as minor 
league pitching coach, pitching instructor and field coordinator. Then in 1990, 
the Colborn family moved to Japan, where Colborn coached for the Orix Blue Wave 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Colborn's first season with the Whitecaps and his first as a manager 
at any pro level. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his time on the field and in the dugout, perhaps Colborn's largest 
contribution to professional baseball, at least locally, was made in an 
executive office. In 1986, he took on partial ownership of the Ventura Gulls, a 
minor league team in the Toronto Blue Jays chain that played its home games at 
Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't go well. Attendance wasn't what it needed to be -- the college 
venue didn't allow for night games or beer sales and, Colborn said, promotion 
of the team was not particularly strong -- so the Gulls' first year was also 
its last. Losses, he said, amounted to about $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, eight years later, and despite the sour experience, Colborn again is 
pleading the case for a local professional baseball team. This time, he and 
others are urging the county to build a stadium and bring in another team. But 
unlike the 1986 venture, the push for baseball is being led by city leaders in 
Oxnard, Camarillo and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Jim Gose, Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom and Oxnard 
Councilman Bedford Pinkard are gathering support on the local level. The 
Colborns and others united as Fans of Professional Baseball in Ventura County 
are working on getting the general population involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Colborn's role in the effort isn't as large as it was when he had the Gulls, 
but those involved say he has been crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is a baseball man. He's been in baseball all of his adult life. And he's 
an educated man (Whittier College, University of Edinburgh, Scotland). He's not 
just a dumb jock," said his wife. "Regardless of the failure before, he 
wouldn't be anything but a plus to this group." 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said Colborn discussed the possibility of a minor league team with 
him as the councilman was searching for a project to share with Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started this, I had a meeting with Bedford Pinkard and we 
discussed what the cities could do together that wouldn't be controversial," he 
said. "Within a few days, coincidentally, Jim called me. He said, 'Do you think 
it's possible to ever have a minor league team here again?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I provided a catalyst," Colborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get used to living with things like occasional violence, graffiti on the 
walls, having things stolen. That's a part of our culture that we sort of 
accept," he said. "Japan doesn't have those things, and one of the reasons is 
that they have a culture more oriented to the group. American culture is 
oriented to the individual. I think things that show community togetherness, 
things families do together, are what we need more than ever. . . . I think 
baseball can provide that. It's certainly no cure-all, but it's a positive 
step." 
</P>
<P>
 Colborn said a Ventura team could attract an average of around 2,000 people 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could bring what they have (in Grand Rapids) back to our area, it would 
be fantastic," Colborn said. "There's Whitecap souvenir stuff everywhere. 
Everyone's talking about the team. It's given the area a real shot in the arm 
on those dreary spring days." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Colborn's ulterior motive. "When I think of the ideal situation 
for me," he said, "it's living in my home town and having a job in baseball."

SOUNDS: MUSIC SEASON FOLLOWS A HARMONIOUS PATTERN; OJAI FESTIVAL IN JUNE WILL 
SERVE AS THE FINALE. THE COUNTY SCENE REMAINS SECURE, AND LIST OF AVAILABLE 
RESOURCES CONTINUES TO EXPAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In Ventura County, the musical calendar ebbs and flows in comforting, reliable 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 As it has for many years now, the fall-to-spring season leads up to the finale 
of the Ojai Festival, the first weekend of June. Eminent conductor Michael 
Tilson-Thomas, this year's visiting music director of the Ojai Fest, will 
effectively cap off the season -- however unofficially. 
</P>
<P>
 The music scene in the county stays relatively secure, and the list of 
contenders continues to grow. This past season, the available musical resources 
expanded to include the Ventura County Symphony, the Conejo Symphony, Los 
Robles Master Chorale, the Ventura County Master Chorale -- which is presenting 
opera highlights at Ventura College this weekend -- and the Ventura Chamber 
Orchestra, in its first full concert season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, up in Ojai, the Ojai Camarata, directed by founder Charles 
McDermott, will be concluding its third season Friday. The concert will feature 
celebrated violist Donald McInnes on Ralph Vaughan Williams' "Flos Campi." Also 
on the program are a Bach cantata, Benjamin Britten's "Rejoice in the Lamb," 
and the "Joyous Processional" by Lou Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian-influenced Harrison's music has been making the regional rounds this 
year. The sound of Harrison was heard in the "Music Alive!" series put on by 
the Ventura County Symphony and, last month, Harrison was the featured visiting 
composer of the third annual New Music Festival at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, now 77, is one of those worthy American composers who may have 
finally arrived as an accepted contributor to concert life, after years of life 
on the fringes of classical repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Ventura County Symphony front, the season, as such, wrapped up with its 
Tchaikovsky spectacular early in May, but the orchestra makes its last 
appearance Saturday in the Discovery Artists Concert. The featured soloists, 
chosen from an audition process last spring, will be violinist Elise Goodman, 
13; pianist Jonathan Graehl, 16, and pianist Jeffrey Francom, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 In its second official season with Boris Brott at the helm, the symphony 
extended its sights considerably with the successful "Music Alive!" sub-series, 
presented in casual settings around the county. Blending world music and 
20th-Century classical strains, the series drew healthy audiences and put some 
provocative cross-cultural sounds into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular note was the "China Alive!" program in Ojai in March, 
highlighted by Chinese-Canadian composer Alexina Louie's striking work "Music 
for a Thousand Autumns." 
</P>
<P>
 The series came to a somewhat uneasy close in April with the "India Alive!" 
program, in the opulent context of Camarillo's Spanish Hills Country Club. 
While the least successful and coherent of the three concerts, the program did 
include a memorable performance of George Crumb's enigmatic "Lux Aeterna," 
replete with masked musicians and an aura of cool, muted mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Global cross-talk is inevitable in today's information-rich world. But finding 
clear communicative channels between Western and Eastern ways can be risky 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the general effect of the series was invigorating and lateral-minded, 
and one we hope to hear much more of. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from the burden of having to impose new and unusual sounds on its 
subscription audience, the symphony managed to keep up its contemporary music 
moratorium on the main stage of the Oxnard Civic. The most interesting piece of 
new music was Miguel del Aguila's "Toccata," performed in February. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, though, the symphony pulled off another fine season of music-making 
and helped to expand the area's musical overview. MEANWHILE, OFF TO THE LEFT OF 
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
 What would Ventura's musical season be without a new, outlandish work by 
can-do independent composer Jeff Kaiser? This year, the enterprising enfant 
terrible unveiled a chamber opera entitled "Aurea Cantena" ("The Golden 
Chain"), staged in the Oddfellows Lodge in Ventura on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 New music is notorious for inspiring the sound of only a few hands clapping, 
but Kaiser's event attracted nearly a full house to the claustrophobic quarters 
above the Ventura Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 In some way, the stuffy venue contributed the generally cramped, hermetic 
atmosphere of the piece, adapted from ancient alchemical texts by Kaiser and 
Keith McMullen, and lined with effectively creepy musical means. An abstract 
patchwork of sound and a thick, soupy libretto added up to a dark theatrical 
feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser's oddly fascinating electronic handiwork, some of his most intriguing 
yet, involved a welter of ambiguous sampled and synthesized sound. In sharp 
contrast, we heard the refreshing real-time physicality of Jim Connolly's bass 
and Deborah Schwartz's marimba, putting forth avant-bluesy murmurings 
reminiscent of Captain Beefheart or Tom Waits. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Elizabeth Stuart, one of Ventura's most intrepid and gifted musical 
regulars, was the sole human presence on a stage swathed in mythic motifs and 
day-glo kitsch by designer Jeff G. Rack. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the evening's highlights came as a respite from the onslaught of 
ominousness, an atonal "Gloria" sung with dry passion by Stuart, while Kaiser, 
off-stage, repeatedly droned "things as they are." Hence, the singer's pearly 
sonorities endured friction from the disembodied, omniscient voice -- that of 
God? Or the composer / trickster incarnate? 
</P>
<P>
 On this Saturday night, a blurry cloud of voices and notions hovered about the 
Oddfellows Lodge, leaving at least one listener both bewildered and enchanted.

NIGHT LIFE: STRAWBERRY-LINED PATH TO TEMPTATIONS; THE MOTOWN HITMAKERS' SHOW 
SHOULD BE THE CREAM IN SATURDAY'S FESTIVAL SALUTE TO THE LOCAL CROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Given civilization's relentless drive to pave things over, counting on 
agriculture to continue in Ventura County is as iffy as investing in Darryl 
Strawberry rookie cards. But for this, the 11th annual California Strawberry 
Festival, you can rest assured. There will be plenty of strawberries, also damn 
fine entertainment as personified by the greatest soul group of all time, the 
Temptations. They sing. They dance. They dress to impress. They blow your mind. 
What else is there? 
</P>
<P>
 Since the band's inception in 1961, the Temptations have had 14 No.1 songs, 
and have won three Grammys. By 1973, Motown had already released a three-record 
set of their greatest hits. In 1989, the group was inducted into the Rock 'n' 
Roll Hall of Fame. Thus far, the group has a cool 50 albums, with a boxed set 
due in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, Eddie Kendricks' unearthly falsetto and David Ruffin's 
raspy tones dominated the group as they scored with such hits as "The Way You 
Do The Things You Do," "My Girl," "Just My Imagination," "I Wish It Would Rain" 
and countless others. Ruffin left the group in 1968 (replaced by Dennis 
Edwards) and Kendricks departed in 1971. Both returned for a reunion in 1982, 
but both have since died, Ruffin in 1991 of a drug overdose and Kendricks a 
year later of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years there have been many Temptations, but the group lives on with 
founding members Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin and also Theo Peoples, Ron 
Tyson and Ali-Ollie Woodson. While most groups have no good singers, the 
Temptations have five great ones and, according to Williams, business is 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out there about 40 weeks a year," Williams said. "People may think we 
party all the time, but we don't. We treat this as a business. It's our 
livelihood. You can't abuse yourself. The main thing is to get plenty of rest, 
eat properly. We exercise. I think that's our secret after 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got back from Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia -- there's Temptations fans 
over there. Everybody goes to our shows -- we get little kids and 70- or 
80-year-old people. We have a very broad base of fans. We've been just about 
everywhere except for Rio de Janiero, Greece and parts of Africa; and last 
year, we signed a lifetime contract with Motown." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '60s, besides those Temptations, Berry Gordy's Motown roster 
included acts such as the Miracles, the Marvellettes, Martha & the Vandellas, 
the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells, the Four Tops, Junior Walker & the 
All-Stars, Gladys Knight & the Pips and later, the Jackson Five. Not 
surprisingly, Motown dominated Top 40 radio in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Gordy surrounded himself with a number of capable writers 
and producers. Smokey Robinson and Norman Whitfield wrote hit after hit for the 
Temptations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early '60s was like being in Camelot," Williams said. "We were young and 
confident; we got the red-carpet treatment and doors were opening for us. 
Motown was cranking out hit after hit. It was a wonderful time." 
</P>
<P>
 Always very image-conscious, Gordy devised something called International 
Talent Management Inc., which was sort of a finishing school for his flock of 
hitmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an in-house management program, sort of a grooming school," said 
Williams. "We were just young kids and they taught us how to dress properly, 
how to walk, how to do interviews. It's stuff we still use 34 years later. 
Motown tried to maintain a very positive image of crossing all barriers during 
a very tumultuous times in the '60s. Dr. King was doing his thing. The Vietnam 
War was in full swing. The women's movement was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 After Ruffin left in 1968, Whitfield wrote tunes -- "Cloud Nine," "Ball of 
Confusion" and "Psychedelic Shack" -- that brought the group into the 
psychedelic era. Brimming with sharp social commentary, "Cloud Nine" was 
different than everything that came before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It changed things for us because we wanted to step away from the ballads we 
were known for," Williams said. "We wanted people to know we could do more than 
'My Girl.' For the first few weeks, people were saying 'No, that's not the 
Temptations.' We won our first Grammy with that song." 
</P>
<P>
 And you can bet your bottom shortcake that Oxnard will be out of strawberries 
before you catch the Temptations miss a step -- their choreography is 
impeccable. And so is their attire -- you'll see Jackie Onassis wearing a 
Grateful Dead T-shirt before you'll see one of the Temptations in a wrong suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been known for our singing and choreography and our clothes. We 
probably have 50 to 75 different (suits) right now. No one has ever shown up 
wearing the wrong suit; we have people to take care of that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the two-day Strawberry Festival will offer a varied music schedule 
including Three Dog Night, Big Mountain, Doug Kershaw, the Ordinaires, Spencer 
the Gardener, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the Zydeco Party Band and others. Call

SIMI VALLEY CONTRIBUTES MOST RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The greater Los Angeles area has the only "seamless transit" program in the 
country, according to Metrolink spokesman Peter Hildago. To qualify for a 
Metrolink station, a city must provide comprehensive transit service that is 
included in the ticket price. Each city handles transportation in a different 
way -- some with buses, others with shuttle systems, others with taxis. The 
fare is all-inclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Simi Valley contributes the greatest number of passengers 
to Metrolink. A survey conducted by Metrolink in February showed Simi at 1,000 
trips a day, Moorpark at 562 trips per day and Camarillo at 214 per day. No 
surveys have been done since the Oxnard station opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink commuting costs vary depending on distance, and tickets are 
available one-way, which must be used within three hours of purchase; 
round-trip, which must be started within three hours of purchase, with the 
return any time on the same day; 10-trip, valid for 90 days from date of 
purchase, and monthly passes, valid for unlimited travel in a given calendar 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want the most quiet commute, go for a Monday or Friday trip. Officials 
report that ridership is lowest at the ends of the workweek, and attribute it 
to the growing popularity of flexible scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink offers fares discounted at 50% for the elderly and the disabled. 
Discounts are also available for midday and evening riders. One-way and 
round-trip tickets purchased between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and after 6:55 
p.m. are 25% off the regular fare for adults and 50% off for young people 6 to 
18 years old. At all times, children under 6 ride free with a fare-paying 
adult. Metrolink also offers group rates for school groups. 
</P>
<P>
 All Metrolink trains, stations and ticket-vending machines are accessible to 
the disabled. Boarding is via a raised mini-platform; there are two wheelchair 
spaces in each passenger car, and a wheelchair-accessible restroom. BARBARA

THEATER REVIEW; LIFE IN A DEAD-END RETREAT; THOSE LOOKING FOR A CONVENTIONALLY

 Once a luxurious temporary address for those on the move, the Baltimore is now 
a residential hotel occupied by pensioners, prostitutes and the detritus of 
big-city life. About to close the property permanently, the parent corporation 
sees no reason to repair the electric sign that once beckoned travelers; today 
the flotsam and jetsam of society drift into the "Hot l Baltimore."

 Playwright Lanford Wilson's 1973 recounting of a couple days in the life of 
the dead-end trackside Maryland retreat played for a then-record 1,166 
performances off-Broadway and won an Obie award. It's playing for the next few 
weekends at the Plaza Players Theater in Ventura, with a strong cast under the 
direction of Gerald Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Those looking for a conventionally structured drama with a beginning, middle 
and end will be disappointed, or at least surprised: This play is a slice taken 
out of a continuum. Characters drift in and out, questions remain unresolved, 
and not even a suggestion of plot appears until the second of Wilson's three 
acts. Some might find this maddening; others, refreshingly life-like. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Price plays Bill, the hotel's night manager, reporting to manager Mr. 
Katz (Hugh McManigal). Millie (Dorothy Scott) and Mr. Morse (John Masterson) 
are retired on what seems to be a minimal income; he's feisty and 
hard-of-hearing, while she keeps mainly to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger, female residents are all hookers: Suzy (Judy Walters), bawdy 
April (Linda Lacey) and the flighty -- in the '70s she'd be termed kookie -- 
girl who keeps changing her name (Diamera Bach). Tomboyish Jackie (Zoe 
Pietrycha) and her younger brother Jamie (David Steel) appear to be transients, 
and what of that man (James Leslie) asleep on a chair in the lobby and the 
woman (Cindy Swager) who's looking for her son? 
</P>
<P>
 What, indeed. Each has moments in the spotlight, with many on the verge of 
crisis. For this to work, the audience has to be interested in the characters 
-- maybe even imagine living among them -- but not so involved as to be 
disappointed when (for instance) that woman never finds her son, and wanders 
off into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, and despite its virtues, "Hot l Baltimore" may be more interesting 
as an exercise for actors than an example of good theater. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Hot l Baltimore 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m., through June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Plaza Players Theater, 34 N. Palm St. (in the Livery Arts Center), 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $10 all performances; Two for $10 on Wednesdays, though individual 
Wednesday night tickets are evidently still $10; maybe you can pair up in the 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Note new price schedule. For reservations or further information, call 
643-9460.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: SONGWRITER TOWNES VAN ZANDT'S LYRICAL STYLE TO BE SPOTLIGHTED; 
DUBBED THE 'VAN GOGH OF LYRICS,' THE RECORDING ARTIST WILL PERFORM HIS MOODY 
BUT WHIMSICAL MELODIES AT NICHOLBY'S IN VENTURA.

 It looks like Nicholby's in Ventura is really on to something great with its 
intimate showcase series, launched last month. Since inaugurating Nicholby's 
Presents, the club has scored two hits with blues legend John Hammond and 
fiddle virtuoso, Mark O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the third installment, will spotlight country-folk recording artist 
Townes Van Zandt, considered by many in the business to be one of the best 
songwriters in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But since his music is not the stuff of Top 20 airplay, chances are that most 
readers are asking themselves, Townes Van Who?. Yet praise from country music 
heavyweights, including Lyle Lovett, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard and Willie 
Nelson, seems to justify a compliment from Austin country rocker Steve Earle: 
"Van Zandt is the Van Gogh of lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and Haggard recognized gold when they recorded "Pancho and Lefty." And 
Harris and Don Williams scored a hit with "If I Needed You." Now Ventura County 
residents get a rare chance to hear the lyrical imagery of a literate man who, 
with an acoustic guitar, has been weaving songs about relationships since the 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect any Van Zandt lyrics to be simple. He's so introspective that 
a 1989 review in New York Newsday dubbed Van Zandt "the dean of depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 "See, when you're happy . . . you don't think about it," he said in the 
current issue of CountryBeat magazine. "But there's 15% of the time you get the 
blues, and those times you're sitting there and thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Texas songwriter, now transplanted to Nashville, also knows when to be 
whimsical. He often tells audiences: " 'Buckskin Stallion' is about a girl and 
a horse, and I still miss the horse." And don't be surprised if midway through 
his show, Van Zandt breaks into "The Shrimp Song" from the Elvis Presley film 
"Girls! Girls! Girls!" Referring to his more serious fare, Van Zandt once said, 
"You have to pass out the razor blades before the end of the set. By doing that 
Elvis song, it just lightens up a little." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Management has finally pulled the plug on country music and dance lessons at 
Santa Barbara's Red Dog Saloon, where we used to flock to hear popular groups, 
including Darlene O'Connell and the Dixie Flyers and Sky King. To help folks 
deal with the loss, the Dog's former dance instructor, Miss Ila, rounded up the 
club's refugees. And Saturday night, they held a "Dead Dog" dance party at her 
new home base, the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Santa Barbara country fans will have to count on the City Line Club and 
Galleon Room for their music and dance fix. But the clubs are using good bands 
and offering lessons. The Galleon Room caters more to a couples / two-step 
format. And City Line has some fun and original line dances, including Mustang 
Sally. Check out City Line on Thursdays when Connie is teaching. She's what a 
good dance instructor should be: competent, mellow and she stays all night to 
help her students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in Thousand Oaks, look for Miss Ila to cook up some local 
fun-tastic dance events in the near future. And congrats to Borderline dance 
instructor Jennie, who put together the Borderline dancers in record time to 
perform at Conejo Valley Days. Everyone present agreed that the routines were 
amazing: slick, professional and glitzy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's your chance to support a new country venue. The Starting Gate, a 
refurbished club featuring live country music and dance instruction on the 
weekends, will kick off its grand opening Friday. The Rhythm Rangers will play 
9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday. And Saturday, starting at 4 p.m., 
everyone is invited for a free barbecue "until the hog runs out," co-owner Gail 
Sap said. The Starting Gate is at 396 N. Ventura Ave., Ventura, 653-9112.

REWIND; KEEN SUBTLETY, SUSPENSE MAKE FOR AN INVITING 'UNINVITED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you want flashy pyrotechnics and gore, proceed straight to "The Amityville 
Horror" movies. But if you yearn for a classy ghost film with some 
old-fashioned storytelling magic, turn to "The Uninvited." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike so many modern-day haunted-house films, this 1944 entry endures 
primarily because of its keen sense of subtlety, mystery and suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't even matter that the ghosts in "The Uninvited" are rarely seen. The 
film is so deftly crafted that their implied presence is enough to draw the 
viewer into this work's spooky milieu. Doors slamming shut by themselves, 
candles flickering ominously on a shadowy staircase and the late-night moans of 
a tortured spirit are some of the elements that help paint a mysterious, 
spine-tingling atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Windward is the name of the haunted house in a chilly coastal section of 
western England. When music critic Roderick Fitzgerald (Ray Milland) and his 
sister Pamela (Ruth Hussey) stumble upon the vacant mansion, they see only a 
lovely old house in an appealingly out-of-the-way location. At the behest of 
Pamela, Roderick buys the estate for the two of them at a bargain price. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion's previous owner, an old military commander, does give the new 
buyers a hint of Windward's troubled history: The commander's daughter once 
lived there with her husband and infant daughter before falling fatally off a 
nearby cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 After Roderick and Pamela encounter eerie and unexplained happenings, they 
embark on a desperate search to uncover the true identities and motives of the 
ghosts haunting Windward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Uninvited" is really as much a seductive mystery as it is a bone-chilling 
story of the supernatural. Director Lewis Allen tantalizingly unravels the 
surprising events that lead to the spiritual unrest at Windward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Uninvited" (1944), directed by Lewis Allen. 98 minutes. Not rated. JON

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; CHEERLEADERS GET A STARRING ROLE IN MURDER 
STORY; THE WESTLAKE HIGH VARSITY SQUAD WILL PERFORM IN AN NBC MOVIE OF THE WEEK 
ABOUT THE TRUE-LIFE SLAYING OF A POPULAR TEEN-AGER BY A JEALOUS CLASSMATE.

 Gimme a K. Gimme an I. Gimme an L. Gimme an L. What's it spell? A TV 
appearance for the Westlake High School varsity cheerleading squad. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a production crew for the television movie about cheerleader 
violence was filming at Westlake High. "Death of a Cheerleader" is the working 
title for an NBC movie of the week scheduled to air next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is based on a true story about a girl from Orinda, in the East Bay 
area of San Francisco, convicted of the 1984 stabbing death of a popular 
cheerleader. Based on the girl's statements, police said the cheerleader 
symbolized unobtainable social and academic success, so the girl killed her in 
a jealous rage. 
</P>
<P>
 When producers contacted Westlake cheerleader coach Sharon Stewart to act as 
an adviser to the film, Stewart offered the use of her squad rather than hire 
women to play cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 This movie of the week follows an April, 1993, airing on ABC of "Willing to 
Kill: The Texas Cheerleader Story" about a mother who hoped to gain a spot on 
the high school cheerleading squad for her 13-year-old daughter by having the 
mother of a rival killed. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO responded with the semi farcical "Positively True Adventures of the 
Alleged Texas Cheerleading-Murdering Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 If cheerleader murder plots seem like the latest devolution in television's 
obsession with violence, take heart. Some good will come of this. Stewart said 
her consultant fee and the $40 a day for each of the dozen cheerleaders will go 
to the squad's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to equal two or three carwashes," she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Twenty years old may be too young in a professional acting career to be 
type-cast, but see if this doesn't strain expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two characters from the television series "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" will 
be featured in a production of "Hamlet" at Newbury Park High School this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Narvy, 20, will direct the production in addition to playing Laertes. A 
Newbury Park grad, Narvy is better known as "Skull," the slimmer of two bullies 
featured in the hugely popular children's series. 
</P>
<P>
 The other bully is "Bulk," played by Paul Schrier, who at about 275 pounds 
fills his television role effectively. Schrier will play Claudius. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working for Ford, driving parts between dealerships, when I got the 
call to come down and audition for the show as a last-minute replacement," 
Narvy said. "Paul and I hit it off right away because both of us had done a lot 
of Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger-mania, for those of you who don't have kids between 4 and 10 years old, 
stems from a half-hour live-action show that airs on Fox Television. The show 
centers on the exploits of six teen-agers who, through their combined efforts, 
change or "morph" into super-heroes whenever truth, justice or the God-given 
right to wear Spandex is challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 The play starts May 27. A portion of the proceeds will go toward the drama 
department's fund for building a new theater.

ON THE ROAD: LAND BRINGS TASTE OF BEBOP PAST TO LOCAL SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The jazz man, recently returned from gigs in Paris and Rome, walked in dressed 
as a gentleman of the piazza: black ventless suit with suppressed lapels, black 
pinpoint dress shirt, floral print Italian silk tie. He moved slowly and 
elegantly to the stage to greet his young blue-jeaned California sidemen, 
extending his 66-year-old hand and cocking his head slightly to reveal the 
ever-ironic smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Land Sr. is like that. Probably given that handshake, that smile, five 
thousand times before. 
</P>
<P>
 Land has been in the music that long, carving seamless sonic sculptures with a 
tenor saxophone that at times barely contained the girth of his sound. It was 
the strength of his musical conception that got him discovered and hired in 
1954 by legendary Clifford Brown and Max Roach, launching a career that also 
would include collaborations with Cedar Walton, Billy Higgins, Red Mitchell, 
Bobby Hutcherson, Gerald Wilson, Blue Mitchell, Buster Williams, Curtis Fuller 
and others of jazz's first rank. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular artists with a jazz bent would seek him out as well, and that accounts 
for his years-long association with Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time he was discovered by Brown and Roach, however, Land was playing L. 
A.'s segregated clubs -- a tough existence in a demanding, protean musical form 
that offered little financial reward. As if to gird himself for those club 
nights, he'd look the beast in the eye by day and participate in exhausting 
practice sessions with John Coltrane's equally obsessive partner, Eric Dolphy, 
at Dolphy's L. A. apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this, of course, would suit Land for a life of musical integrity and 
worldwide touring under all conditions, from the humblest basement club to posh 
cruise ships to the Montreaux Jazz Festival to Carnegie Hall -- to, only weeks 
ago, Europe's finest nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on a recent Saturday night, it's California 66, the grill-your-own steak 
restaurant, in this humble city by the sea. The place is on California Street, 
a block up from the throbbing Bombay Club, where hundreds of the young and 
restless clutch drinks and clot before the derivative funkster Curtis Traylor, 
and directly across the street from The Sportsman restaurant, closed but for a 
glowing blue neon LITE sign. 
</P>
<P>
 When the money's right, Land brings his own band, the L.A.-based Harold Land 
Quartet. When he's simply working for his fee, as he was on this recent 
Saturday night, the jazz man appears as a special guest and experiences a sort 
of musical potluck on the bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 His bandmates were California 66's house band, led by pianist/singer Johnny 
Veith. Veith, depending upon the night and the crowd, is known to glide from 
firm bebop into schmaltzy lounge tunes: This 40-year-old Eastman School of 
Music graduate is a master musical chameleon. On bass was Henry Franklin of 
Riverside, a sturdy jazz player; on drums, Ventura's Jim Christie, noted for 
his playing with country star Dwight Yoakum. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it would be a tall order when the jazz man arrived. Jazz, for all its 
improvisational "freedom," is a technically demanding form that makes group 
precision especially difficult. Often, a throw-together band will run through a 
few tunes ahead of time, particularly the original compositions of the featured 
guest. But not on this night. Land, a practitioner of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, 
spent the half-hour before the opening set chanting in his room at The Country 
Inn on Thompson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time he walked in, shook hands, and said hello, it was only minutes 
before he took the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 With no warm-up on his own instrument, Land launched into a blistering, 
arching, soulful rendition of "The Night Has A Thousand Eyes." He played it 
aggressively and with complete facility over a varied harmonic terrain, 
revealing imagination and deeply felt emotion. His tone, a masculine timbre at 
times reminiscent of Pharoah Sanders, grew warmer and rounder as the intensity 
of the tune escalated, burnishing and polishing an expanding mosaic of notes. 
For all this, Land remained unrelenting in his pace and, with circular hand 
signals for more propulsion from the drums, in his insistence to the band that 
they keep up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when asked about starting off with such an ambitious piece, Land would 
issue that ironic smile and say: "Yes. I like to start with that because 
sometimes the intensity will be sustained for the entire set." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't, plainly, though that had to do with the time it took for the band 
to find sure footing. It found it, however, in the second set, at 11:30 p.m.: 
Land's impassioned, bebop-chiseled rendition of "Lover" somehow galvanized his 
sidemen into playing with the urgency, boldness, and risk that Land has been 
surrounded by all his playing life. 
</P>
<P>
 For those few minutes, nothing else mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Real art -- the kind drawn in a musical vocabulary forged 50 years ago in 
segregated joints -- got created. It got created on California Street in a 
restaurant with a turquoise surfboard mounted over the bandstand and in which a 
pink wooden hand, pointing westward, is mounted to a sign saying "BEACH." 
</P>
<P>
 It got created in a place where the $10 cover charge kept some Venturans 
huddled on the sidewalk looking in, but where that same $10 seemed a bargain 
passage to the relatively few -- about 50 -- inside. 
</P>
<P>
 To Land, dignified ambassador from jazz's fecund age, it was merely another 
night at the beach, if you will. "Chanting helps me keep my energy, I feel, in 
most situations," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the jazz man, his suit coat still properly buttoned, packed up and 
headed back to the motel down the street. His wife would be waiting for him. 
Land had driven her back earlier, on break between the first and second sets, 
so she could chant and rest.

JAUNTS; NICE GUYS DON'T FINISH LAST IN VOLKSSPORTING; WALKERS SET THEIR OWN 
PACE IN THIS NON-COMPETITIVE SPORT, WHICH IS MAKING STRIDES STATEWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Volkssporting? If you had to guess, it sounds like a road race for Volkswagen 
bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not a race at all, and the only things buggy about it are the insects 
unlucky enough to be underfoot when volkssporters hit the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkssporters are nuts about walking. They walk all over the state, even the 
country, and in other countries where the sport is popular. They'll be striding 
through the Ventura-Ojai area this weekend during several walks and a bike 
ride. Anyone can join them, for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkssporting is hot in California, with 30 chapters of the American 
Volkssporting Assn. sprinkled mostly in the northern and southern ends of the 
state. The Big Valley Vagabonds chapter, out of Fresno, will host the weekend 
outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are hopeful that the walks and bike ride will spark enough interest in 
volkssporting to get a new chapter going in the Ventura-Santa Barbara County 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing between Monterey and Hollywood," said Mary Mott, president of 
the Big Valley Vagabonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkssporting began in Germany in the mid-1960s in response to a push for 
outdoor exercise that was non-competitive and for people of all ages. 
Translated, the name means "sport of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 As a movement, it grew quickly. It started in this country in 1976 during the 
bicentennial celebration when walkers in Fredericksburg, Tex., took to the 
streets in a march. Now there are more than 550 clubs throughout the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs sponsor walks, bike rides, swims, cross-country skiing, roller skating 
and ice skating. But the walks are by far the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 The walks are generally 10 kilometers, or a little more than six miles, and 
some are longer. Walkers go at their own pace. They don't have to start 
together, at a predetermined hour. They are given a window of several hours to 
begin the walk, which has a rating for difficulty. The route might be on a 
trail, through a park, in a neighborhood or downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people jog it," Mott said. "Others might take four hours. The average is 
about two hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to join the walkers and bikers need only register at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, two walks are scheduled tomorrow, beginning at Marina Park anytime 
between 1 and 5 p.m. One route takes in the Ventura Mission and other downtown 
sights, and the other goes along the coast. The same walks will be repeated on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Saturday, walkers can take a hike in Ojai beginning at the park and 
ride downtown anytime between 7 and 10 a.m. Bicyclists can do a trek along the 
Ojai Valley Trail beginning from the same location at the same time. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Walks and bike ride, sponsored by the Big Valley Vagabonds, a chapter 
of the American Volkssporting Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Tomorrow and Saturday 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura and Ojai 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Call Mary Mott, (209) 297-7685, or after today at 648-5371. On Friday, 
two walks in Ventura begin from Marina Park and either follow a coastal route 
or downtown route. Both are six to seven miles long. Walks begin between 1 and 
5 p.m. Same walks are scheduled Saturday. Also on Saturday, a 6.2-mile walk and 
an 18-mile bike ride begin at the park and ride at Ojai Avenue and Fox Street, 
between 7 and 10 a.m.

 With his teeth bared and his tongue hanging out, the wolf (as in Big Bad) will 
be beating down the door Saturday at the Camarillo Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll be on the arm of Kathryn Dippong as she puts on a puppet show based on 
the ancient fairy tale, the Three Little Pigs. The show, beginning at 11:30 
a.m., is mainly for children 4 to 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 15-minute performance ends, the kids can stay for a workshop to learn 
just how Dippong can turn a paper plate and some construction paper into the 
face of a little porker. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when they've mastered puppet-making, they can step behind the puppet 
stage and find out what it feels like to be the puppeteer and voice of one of 
the pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dippong knows her way around puppets and theater. She has a master's degree in 
children's theater and spent 1 1/2 years performing with the Heart of the Beast 
Puppet and Mask Theater in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 She tries to keep the puppet-making real simple. "I'm one who believes the 
parents shouldn't make it -- the kids should be able to do it, or what's the 
point?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the paper-plate puppet has a three-dimensional look. The snout sticks 
out, thanks to pipe cleaners. The puppet can also be used as a mask. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop should last about 1 1/2 hours. The cost is $3, and all materials 
will be supplied. 
</P>

 Children's entertainer Linda Arnold is back in town. She's doing a show at the 
Ventura College Theater at 7 p.m. Friday. Called "The Rainbow Palace," the show 
is kind of a kid-style tribute to Broadway and movie musicals such as "Peter 
Pan," "The Sound of Music," "Oliver" and "Oklahoma!" 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold also incorporates puppets and other whimsical characters into her 
performance: Tyrone the dinosaur, Gallagher the magical elf and Ted the cool 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a smooth soprano voice, and some of the tunes are her originals. Her 
promoters call her the Mary Poppins of children's music. She has been featured 
in the Disney "Kaleidoscope" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve tickets for the show, sponsored by the Ventura Children's Festival and 
Ventura College Community Services, are $6 for kids and $8 for adults ($1 more 
at the door). Tickets are available at Kideos in Ventura and Serendipity Toys 
in Ojai. To charge by phone, call 650-5900.

 If your kid is a little ho-hum about hiking, here's a jaunt that will spark 
some interest. Every month, the Conejo Recreation and Park District holds its 
Saturday Night S'Mores hike. It's an easy two-mile walk through Thousand Oaks' 
Wildwood Park after dark. Midway, the hike leaders light a campfire, tell 
stories, lead songs and break open the marshmallows, chocolate and graham 
crackers for s'mores. 
</P>
<P>
 The next hike is May 28 from 6:30 to 9 p.m. The cost is $4. Hikers should meet 
in the parking lot at the west end of Avenida de los Arboles and Big Sky Drive. 
Bring a flashlight. Preregistration is required -- this monthly event fills up. 
For information, call 494-8301. Details

SHOP TALK; SCREENING OUT YOUR CHOICES FOR THE BEST SUN PROTECTION; FIRST DECIDE 
ON THE CORRECT SPF RATING, THEN CONSIDER WHETHER YOU NEED THE SWEAT- OR 
WATERPROOF VARIETY. 
</P>

 There is nothing like going to the beach on a nice sunny day. There is also 
nothing like coming home looking like a pomegranate. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing the weather cooperates, many of you will be hitting the sand over 
the next several months. You'll be Boogie-boarding, surfing, swimming and 
tanning. 
</P>
<P>
 What you don't want to be doing is burning. So you might want to put "get 
sunscreen" somewhere at the top of your "To Do" list. Sounds easy enough, but 
buying the stuff can be tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, there's the SPF (Sun Protection Factor) to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 SPF measures the amount of protection a sunscreen will provide. With an SPF of 
15, you are supposed to be protected 15 times more than if you used no 
sunscreen. A 45 is supposed to protect you 45 times more. There is some 
disagreement, however, as to whether an SPF of 15 is actually the maximum, and 
those SPF 30s and 45s are pointless. Regardless, the higher SPFs sometimes cost 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 When you factor in the number of brands on the market, the number of stores 
selling them and the varying prices, you can see what a task it can be to 
choose a sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 We went shopping at Ralphs and Walmart in Oxnard, and at Sav-On Drugs in 
Camarillo's Carmen Plaza. Here's what we found last week for a sampling of the 
many sunscreens available. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll start with Vaseline Brand Intensive Care. 
</P>
<P>
 Four ounces of both the SPF 8 and 15 were $6.79 at Ralphs. Six-ounce 
containers of the same sunscreens were $6.89 at Sav-On. At Walmart, we found 
four ounces of SPF 15 at $3.97 and six ounces at $5.87. Have we lost you yet? 
</P>
<P>
 How about the old favorite Coppertone? A four-ounce bottle of SPF 15 was going 
for $6.99 at Sav-On and $5.97 at Walmart. An SPF 6 was $6.79 for four ounces at 
Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just to confuse the matter a little further, Coppertone also puts out a 
"Sport" brand of sunscreen. It's called "Sport" because it's for those athletic 
types who tend to sweat -- and Coppertone claims that the product is 
sweat-proof. A four-ounce bottle of SPF 8, good for six hours of protection, 
was $9.69 at Sav-On, $6.79 at Ralphs and $5.97 at Walmart. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, here's a good time to emphasize the importance of "waterproof" 
sunscreens. If you're going to be in the water, you're going to want to find a 
sunscreen that won't wash off immediately. Most of the brands out there are 
waterproof. But some aren't. Make sure you keep that in mind when you read the 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to get even more mind-boggled? 
</P>
<P>
 Check out the Shade brand of "UVA Guard" sun block, made with Parsol 1789. 
Parsol 1789 protects skin from ultraviolet A sun rays, which can lead to 
long-term skin problems (as opposed to UVB rays, which are responsible for the 
burning). Four ounces of Shade UVA Guard, SPF 15, was $8.99 at Ralphs, $7.99 at 
Sav-On and $6.97 at Walmart. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, there's always the generics. At Ralphs, we found Perfect Choice 
brand sunscreen, both SPF 15 and 30+, going for $4.99 for four ounces. Sav-On's 
Osco brand, SPF 15 and 30, with aloe and Vitamin E moisturizers, was priced at 
$3.99 for four ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 Now go protect yourself. Just don't get burned.

EARTHWATCH: ENERGY, BRAINS MAKE FOR HOPEFUL SITUATION; PETROLEUM INDUSTRY SHOWS 
WISDOM OF ENCOURAGING SCHOLARS WHO MAY NOT PURSUE TRADITIONAL OIL-RELATED 
CAREERS.

 The prospectors of oil were doing some prospecting for talent last week at the 
Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Energy Information Night, on which the local chapter of the American 
Petroleum Institute held an energy careers fair and honored several of its 
professional members for their accurate -- and spill-free -- deep water 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The chapter also handed out $1,000 scholarship checks, as it does annually, to 
16 local students. The winners, chosen by a committee led by Dick Miller of 
Clawson Petroleum Consultants Inc., could potentially do as much for our 
community as a new mineral discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a simple exercise in beating the bushes for future petroleum 
engineers. Among the planned college studies listed by this group of 
4.0-average earners were elementary teaching, history, electrical engineering, 
bioengineering and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, a few indicated they wanted to go into the oil business, and it made 
sense that students so inclined would apply; earlier in the nine-year history 
of these well-publicized awards, petroleum engineering was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Michele Tebeau, organizer of the awards ceremony, the 
chapter is now accepting applications from bright and needy students -- period. 
</P>
<P>
 I interviewed several of the winners. One, Daniel Geis, a Santa Paula High 
School senior with a 4.15 grade-point average, proved a bit of a wag. Having 
determined that he wasn't going into oil drilling, I asked him what he planned 
to do with an engineering degree. Wordlessly he pointed upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Space was also on the academic dance card of Michael Churney, a Westlake High 
School senior. Space and energy, specifically the way-out technology of 
hydrogen propulsion being considered by NASA for the planned National Aerospace 
Plane. 
</P>
<P>
 I was thinking how clever I was that I already knew BMW and Mazda were using 
the new technology -- which is non-polluting -- in sports cars. But I didn't 
know about the rocket version until Churney mentioned it. Clean space travel. 
He found out about it at his part-time job at Rockwell. When he was a 
sophomore. Fifteen years old. Are you getting the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 You may be asking if the American Petroleum Institute chapter isn't sort of 
shooting itself in the foot by aiding the careers of such kids. Well, there's 
plenty of work for the folks in the traditional oil business to do even if we 
switch to machines powered by hydrogen, which is of course free. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that half of the oil America processes is used to manufacture 
consumer goods -- everything from footballs to fertilizers to fake fur. A lot 
of the consumer goods made with oil, by the way, are recyclable. The other half 
gets poured into the gas tank. And the petroleum industry also purveys natural 
gas, which is used for power generating, heating and cooling. The dry stuff, as 
they call it, now accounts for more dollar sales at the Exxon and Chevron 
corporations than gasoline, according to reports released this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can see why Energy Night was so interesting to me. I went for the 
latest info on the industry, including natural gas and plastics. But I found 
some things much more intriguing to an Earthwatch columnist. People. And hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid who will be using his scholarship to become a lawyer and an opera 
singer will have to go into somebody else's column. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information on the cash scholarships awarded by the American 
Petroleum Institute call Dick Miller at 653-4482. No limit on what students 
choose to study. For new career information about the energy industry call Tim 
Pompey at the Ventura County superintendent of schools office, 388-4435.

FASHION; HAIR STYLES ON THE CUTTING EDGE HAVE A BEAUTY THAT'S IN DISARRAY; SOME 
DEFINE THE 'DECONSTRUCTED LOOK' AS MESSY. LOCALLY, THE LOOK IS SELLING IN 
MODIFIED FORM AS A 'FREEDOM SHAG.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you haven't seen deconstructed hair, it's a bit hard to envision. Try 
thinking of an unmade bed. 
</P>
<P>
 But, you have to see the beauty in the disarray, the charm of non-order. We're 
talking here of liberty, of discovery, of defiance with a romantic twist; of, 
you know, art. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, art with an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The style includes hair combed in several different patterns on a single head, 
or an overall bird's nest look. Or, maybe hair divided into segments and 
fastened with bits of cloth or wire. 
</P>
<P>
 We got a deconstruction definition from Enrique Ramirez of Yamaguchi Salon in 
Ventura: 
</P>
<P>
 "The hair is disconnected, it flows together, it doesn't blend, it could be 
very short and very long pieces at the same time; a lot of movement. . . . It's 
not contrived, not perfect. It just means messy," he finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez and fellow stylists were creating the look for a portfolio that would 
be submitted for competition, working on women who seemed to enjoy hair 
pioneering. We watched hair being cut long in front, short in back, "textured" 
by a number of different lengths within these segments. One version had a 
helmet of hair close to the head with extra wisps reaching to the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The deconstructed look is a legacy from London. Hair styles, by and large, are 
not invented in California, like swimsuits. They are imported from England. 
Don't ask us why; there's a mystique about these things. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, a look starts in London; and by the time it travels to New York, leaps 
to Los Angeles, then drifts northward to Ventura County, the British will have 
other bridges to cross -- or hair to muss up. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Yamaguchi, co-owner and artistic director of Yamaguchi, means to change 
this pattern. He sends representatives to London and Europe to get the feel of 
the newest looks, then he and his team interpret them so that local women can 
have a cutting-edge experience. Without such intervention, he said, new styles 
would take two to three years to reach the area. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, deconstruction is selling mostly in a modified form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clients are open-minded, (but) in Italy, France, London people are 
willing to try things much more than they are here in America," Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shag that we are doing is softer and more elegant looking. It's not so 
trendy that a professional wouldn't wear it. We call it more of a freedom 
shag." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the cuts we saw looked like something to wear with a business suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But, to help you plan a coiffure, we checked in with other Ventura County hair 
stylists. Will deconstruction go mainstream? 
</P>
<P>
 They were cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not going to end up with a lot of people who will want to wear wires 
in their hair with a lot of ponytails sticking out," said one, who asked for 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 A different point of view came from Kimberly Bence, a stylist at Mane 
Attraction in Camarillo, who saw a drawback in adding wires to hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reaction was practical. "It would be hell in an electrical storm," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Celeb's in Santa Paula, owner John Aguilar was philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are in a time and a place in our lives when we have to start 
thinking positive," he said, "I like things that are pretty, things that give a 
healing type of feeling. When I think of disarray, I think of bad times." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the style advances, clients might begin to request the look. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility is there. Aguilar considered for a moment, then said quietly: 
"I would try to redirect them."

THEATER REVIEW; FANTASY RULES OVER FACT IN 'LETTICE AND LOVAGE'; PERFORMANCE OF 
PETER SHAFFER'S PLAY AT THE ALHECAMA THEATRE IN SANTA BARBARA IS BOTH HILARIOUS 
AND ENDEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Fantasy floods in where fact leaves a vacuum," proclaims Lettice Douffet, a 
historical tour guide with an eccentric approach to lecturing in Peter 
Shaffer's "Lettice and Lovage." 
</P>
<P>
 The tediously scripted narration she's forced to deliver about a longstanding 
but inconsequential English estate never fails to leave visitors unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 So, true to her credo, Lettice starts dressing up her tour with all sorts of 
colorful anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, they never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 In an endearing and hilarious performance, Ensemble Theatre Company's Gretchen 
Evans captures Lettice's quirky appeal and her implicit repudiation of the 
soulless mediocrity of modern life. Instead, Lettice treasures the values of a 
more indulgent, imaginative past -- like her idol, Shakespeare's Falstaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettice is precisely the kind of gifted kook who, in another Shaffer play, 
would meet a tragic fate -- most likely at the hands of some champion of the 
status quo driven to subjugate her into normality (the vengeful composer 
Salieri in "Amadeus," for example, or the hack psychiatrist Dysart in "Equus"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Lettice and Lovage," however, is a welcome upbeat relief from Shaffer's 
typical brooding, with the playwright's trademark flair for powerful, 
often-poetic dialogue employed this time for wit and wry social commentary 
instead of agonized soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to say that Lettice has an easy time of it. Her wildly popular 
"alternative" lectures soon attract the notice of her supervisor, Lotte Schoen 
(Sylvia Short), a prim and proper authoritarian who exacts rigid discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not my fault," counters Lettice when confronted with her 
transgressions, "except in the most limited sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 That most limited sense, of course, defines the conventional rules of 
propriety in Schoen's system of justice, but the undaunted Lettice faces her 
punishment with a hysterical parody of Mary Queen of Scots at her execution. 
</P>
<P>
 The twist comes when Schoen, drawn to Lettice's rebellious spirit like a moth 
to a flame, ends up switching sides. Letting down her guard in believable 
stages, Short's assured portrayal smoothly transitions from stern inflexibility 
to the twinkling revelation of her long-buried secret -- she once contemplated 
acts of terrorism against the ugly monolithic architecture in post-war Britain. 
"I care more for buildings than their inhabitants," she gleefully confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The blossoming alliance between this unlikely pair is the heart and soul of 
the play, and director Robert G. Weiss' handsomely staged production is 
appropriately tuned to all the nuances of character. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third act, however, the playwright lobs a plot twist from left field 
involving an investigation by a bumbling solicitor (Charles De L'Arbre) in much 
the same spirit of inquiry that structured "Amadeus" and "Equus." (This might 
well be a genetic compulsion -- Shaffer's brother Anthony wrote the all-time 
classic brain-teaser "Sleuth.") 
</P>
<P>
 But here, rather than being systemic to the work, the complications turn out 
to be grounded in a trivial misunderstanding easily cleared up. Unfortunately, 
challenging us with this pseudo-puzzle puts us at one level of remove from the 
emotional attachments so delicately nurtured in the first two acts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the equilibrium is restored, but it's a needlessly close call.

MUSIC; RELEASE OF CD SPARKS CELEBRATION OF TOADS; THE SANTA BARBARA BAND WILL 
PRESIDE OVER A PARTY IN HONOR OF FOURTH ALBUM, 'DULCINEA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wanna hang out with some rock stars? They don't get much bigger than those 
hometown Toad boys, who will be hosting a CD release party Sunday night at the 
Beach Shack in Santa Barbara. The object of discussion and adoration is none 
other than the fourth Toad the Wet Sprocket album, "Dulcinea." The album's 
first single, "Fall Down," is already all over local radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-buck cover charge will go to one of the band's favorite causes, the 
Rape Crisis Center. No macho menaces in this band; in 1992, Toad was the only 
all-male act to appear at a National Organization for Women rally for abortion 
rights in the nation's capital. The proceeds from a May 28 concert in a field 
across the street from Dos Pueblos High School, a show that will feature Toad 
and some of their musical pals such as Creature Feature, Dudley, Woodburning 
Project and Cory Sipper, will go to the same cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toadsters, four S.B. locals from San Marcos High School, include Dean 
Dinning on bass, Randy Guss on drums, Todd Nichols on guitar. Glen Phillips is 
the singer. Just a nine-year overnight successes, Toad used to open for local 
Ventura bands at Charlie's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinning discussed his favorite band named after a Monty Python skit during a 
recent phoner. 
</P>
<P>
 How's the Toad bizz? 
</P>
<P>
 Great. We've been home for a year and a half; we had to rest up from our 
grueling 18-month tour. We took a little time off to get used to having a home 
life again, and because we didn't want all of our new songs to be road songs. 
We didn't want to do a "Running On Empty II." Last time, after we'd been on the 
road for eight months, radio started to play "Fear." It was like it was all 
brand-new again, so we went back to the places we'd already played. You could 
drop me in any town in the country and I'll bet I could find a good sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are definitely looking better. It's kinda nice to see a little reward 
after going into debt for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deals with big labels usually end up in big debts? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, you have to pay it all back. The cost of recording your album, the cost 
of the videos, the cost of touring -- you have to pay for it all. Making 500 
bucks a night on tour doesn't cover the crew or the hotels. We ended up with a 
platinum record with "Fear," and we're finally starting to make a little bit. 
Bands get signed everyday and I'd say 95% of them go into debt and never get 
out of it. The other 5% have careers. We turned down a million dollars from 
MCA, and we only took enough money from CBS to get by. We wanted total control 
over our careers and a four-album deal. You know, our first album only sold 
15,000 copies. The way we did it, they didn't see such a huge negative right 
away. I think we made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 What's "Dulcinea" like compared to the other albums? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh boy, well, it's actually less like "Fear," and more like the first two. On 
"Fear," we overdubbed everything, then separated everything out, and tried to 
make it sound perfect. The new one is actually a good bit of regression for us. 
We wanted to recapture more of the live playing feeling; it's more song- and 
less production-oriented. Actually, we don't have a clue. I hope it stays that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Dulcinea," that's the third one-word-titled album in a row. Do I detect 
a trend? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, our name itself is a mouthful. Could you imagine Toad The Wet Sprocket 
does "The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys"? We're giving our fans a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any one thing that makes Toad a particularly Santa Barbara band? 
</P>
<P>
 I guess it's the fact that we've lived here all our lives. The good thing 
about Santa Barbara is that so many different bands can co-exist far enough 
away from the music business in L.A. This is a real good place to be creative. 
I think the scene here is happening way more than when we started. There are a 
lot more places to play. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember when you guys used to open for the Mudheads and the I-Rails at 
Charlie's in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 We had some awesome gigs down there -- that was the best place in town. I 
always thought Chris O'Connor of the I-Rails and Bill Coffey of the Mudheads 
wrote great songs. I thought we would all get signed and we'd still be playing 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Toad get their buzz going? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we made a tape and started selling them around town, and one of them got 
into the hands of this ASCAP guy in L.A., and before we knew it, we were 
getting phone calls. We never sent tapes to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 What's alternative music? 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, it used to mean music that wasn't getting played on the radio. 
But now alternative radio is one of the most popular formats, so alternative 
radio itself is an oxymoron. The alternative to the alternative is the real 
alternative now. All I know is that now I can listen to the radio and actually 
hear music I like instead of Poison or Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you become a bass player? 
</P>
<P>
 I became the bass player, but originally, I was the keyboard player. When I 
was 16, I wanted a guitar for my birthday, but my dad told me "There are 10 
guitar players for every bass player that can sing." I've never forgotten that. 
I enjoy the more rhythmic aspects of music, and you can screw up on the bass 
and nobody will notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The band recently appeared on a KISS tribute album, but would KISS do a Toad 
song? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that they would. Gene Simmons was a Toad fan, that's how we got 
involved in that project. I'd love to hear him do "Walk on the Ocean." Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CROSSROADS OFF TO A SAVORY START; THE NEW SANTA BARBARA 
EATERY STILL NEEDS SOME TINKERING, BUT THE SEAFOOD, SALAD AND LAMB HIT THE 
SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The chef, said the waiter, was "having some trouble getting the salmon out of 
the package." Since one of us was already munching away happily on an appetizer 
of fried rock shrimp, the other one -- me -- just had to sit back and wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Time went by; the waiter reappeared. "I fibbed a little," he said. The problem 
was not the smoked salmon, he explained, it was the waffle iron, the one they 
use to make the corn waffle. First, they couldn't find it and, then, when they 
did, they poured in the batter and forgot to plug in the iron. A while later, 
the first waffle -- is this a surprise to anyone? -- burned. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was worth the wait. The smoked salmon ($8.25) appetizer at Santa 
Barbara's new Crossroads restaurant, served on a very fresh corn waffle, in a 
relish of peppers, is a luscious dish: crunchy, savory and different. 
</P>
<P>
 The anecdote -- and the smoked salmon dish -- illustrate what is both right 
and wrong with Crossroads: It's a restaurant that serves some outstanding food 
and, with a bit more time and tinkering, will be as important as it seems to 
want to be. 
</P>
<P>
 It bills itself as "An American Grill" and its location, immediately across 
the narrow street from the city's Bird Refuge, is a distinctive one. In recent 
years, it has been the site of two other significant Santa Barbara restaurants, 
Penelope's and, until late last year, Michael's Waterside Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of remodeling work went on at the restaurant in the months before 
Crossroads opened, and the building was nearly gutted. Bar patrons now look out 
across the Bird Refuge lagoon toward the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior has white linens, dark wood trim, subtle though effective 
lighting and seating that is especially comfortable -- except for a few of the 
usual cramped deuces. It is indeed a pleasure, these days, to find yourself in 
a restaurant where you can hear the conversation of your companion without 
leaning across the table. You can also read the menu here without a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is the brainchild of Michael and Candice Hartmann. But the 
kitchen belongs to chef Patrick Waterbury, who is dishing up some very 
interesting food. Michael Hartmann and Waterbury had worked together briefly 
years ago at Denver's Rattlesnake Club. 
</P>
<P>
 That deep-fried rock shrimp ($7.50) appetizer, in a sauce of sherry mustard 
and sweet peppers, is nearly a meal in itself. Lightly breaded and fried, the 
shrimp is a simple contrast to the richness of the sauce. The herbed calamari 
($5.95) appetizer is in the same category, its breading laced with herbs and 
horseradish. 
</P>
<P>
 You might just as well forget what should be the most interesting appetizer 
dish. Fritters of wild mushrooms and potato ($6.25) in a smoked Cheddar sauce 
sounds great, but the result is boring. Which gives you a good reason to order 
the pan-fried Washington state oysters ($8.50) instead. Served in the shell, 
the oysters are warm and juicy, and the chopped cucumber-tomato relish is an 
effective contrast to their very light breading. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that a salad as simple as hearts of romaine with maytag blue 
cheese ($6) would be nothing to write home -- or in a newspaper -- about. 
Somehow, these crisp romaine hearts seem to jump off the plate and onto your 
palate. Their creamy garlic dressing avoids the cloying quality of some creamy 
dressings, and the roasted garlic, olive oil, vinegar, lemon, egg and pepper 
are the most sensuous of combinations. That's a contrast to the nearly 
startling flavors in the country ham and dry jack cheese salad ($7.50), served 
with mixed greens with a lemon vinaigrette. Here, the flavors seem to battle 
one another on your tongue -- and a wonderful battle it is. 
</P>
<P>
 A thick, oven-roasted breast of chicken ($14.95) comes perfectly cooked, not 
overdone, in a thin crust of bread crumbs and tarragon, almost a fried chicken. 
The side dish is a luscious pile of mashed potatoes mixed with caramelized 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterbury has missed the boat on what the menu describes as ground round ($9). 
It's really a $9 hamburger, and not a very good one. Waterbury's roast rack of 
lamb ($21) couldn't be better. It's four chops of Sonoma lamb, and the meat 
melts in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that the single best entree on the menu is the pan-roasted peppered 
tuna ($16.95). The dish is ahi tuna, a small piece, beautifully moist in the 
middle, served with oven-dried tomatoes and leeks, the leeks in the form of 
deep-fried slivers on top. The peppered sauce originates in a lobster stock 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the casserole of prawns ($18), which sounds so good, with 
its mushrooms, split peas and seasoned vegetables, doesn't make it past "it's 
OK." As a lover of casseroles of any sort, I must confess that this one leaves 
me cold. Its flavors don't come together. 
</P>
<P>
 Both pastas are excellent, although I haven't actually eaten both, just 
elements of both. One evening when the bow-tie pasta and smoked rabbit sausage 
($13) was not available, the waiter suggested asking the kitchen to do the 
grilled scallops and ribbon pasta ($16.50), but served with the sauce that 
normally goes on the other dish instead of the usual cream sauce. The result 
was delicious, with the sauce of favas, tomato, marjoram and mustard, the 
scallops grilled quickly and succulent, all their juices held inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads desserts are rich, and usually worth saving room for. Their ice 
cream sandwich ($4.95) -- chocolate wafers with two ice creams and fudge and 
caramel sauce -- can really put you away. If you want more, try the pecan 
chocolate truffle tart ($6). It's a very small slice, for good reason. It comes 
with cappuccino ice cream and is as heavy as it gets. Pass on the warm apple 
crisp ($5.25). The apples are overcooked, and the toffee chip crust and vanilla 
bean ice cream can't rescue it. Details

 Makis Mikelatos, owner of The Greek restaurant in Oxnard, has been eyeing a 
Ventura Harbor location for some time. But no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mother's Day, The Greek closed its doors at its 3-year-old North Oxnard 
Boulevard location and, come mid-June, is scheduled to reopen at the harbor, in 
the long-vacant spot once occupied by Bedford's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Greek restaurant belongs to the water," Mikelatos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we like to move to the harbor is better exposure," he said. "We 
think we are going to get a lot of tourists because they walk all over the 
harbor, and we think they will come there from the different hotels." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikelatos said the change in address will be accompanied by a slight change in 
the menu. "We're going to keep the traditional Greek menu," he said, "but we 
are also going to add more salads and Greek specialties." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's got his spot, Mikelatos needs just a few more things. "We have a 
good idea," he said, "that we are going to need a lot more chairs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberries are the pick of the week, what with Oxnard's California 
Strawberry Festival this weekend. As always, the festival is loaded with food 
booths offering strawberry-themed fare. New on the menu this year: Strawberry 
Hot Links, prepared by the Santa Clara High School Booster Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a hot link, putting it on a nice size bun, and with it will be a 
mixture of barbecue sauce and a good strawberry flavor across the top," said 
John McGill, booster club president. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget the strawberry wontons being cooked up by the Hueneme High 
School Music Boosters. What's a strawberry wonton? 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't what we thought it would be," booster Lorena Lewis said. "The idea 
was really good, but the concept flopped in the kitchen. . . . The strawberries 
kept dissolving." 
</P>
<P>
 What the wontons turned out to be are deep-fried wonton skins with strawberry 
(or apple) topping. "Strawberry wonton nachos," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Comings and goings: Chef Michael French left Santa Barbara's 21 Victoria last 
week to take a sous chef position at Wolfgang Puck's San Francisco restaurant, 
Postriro. As of now, there is no replacement for him at 21.

PERSPECTIVE ON LATIN AMERICA; NAIL-BITER FOR EMERGING ECONOMIES; THE INVESTMENT 
BOOM OF RECENT YEARS IS FADING AS NERVOUS CAPITAL FLOWS OUT, RESPONDING TO 
GLOBAL INTEREST-RATE SHIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist who teaches 
at Mexican and U.S. universities. His latest book is Utopia Unarmed: The Latin 
American Left After the Cold War (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A serious warning signal has begun to flash in several Latin American 
economies (starting in Mexico, as with the 1982 debt crisis, and like then, 
spreading rapidly to the rest of the hemisphere). Instead of continuing to flow 
in, money is beginning to leave; instead of moving up, stock and bond markets 
are drifting downward. The felicitous reversal of fortune seen in recent years 
is fading. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1982 through the early 1990s, largely because of the now nearly forgotten 
debt crisis, Latin America was a net capital exporter. Absurdly, for a 
developing region of the world, it sent far more money abroad than the funds it 
received through loans, foreign investment and repatriated flight capital. 
Latin America was financing the industrialized world with its deficient 
savings, instead of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just a few years back, interest rates began to fall, foreign debts were 
renegotiated and macro-economic reforms took hold. Trade openings, 
privatizations and ensuing lower inflation made the hemisphere's finances more 
alluring. Money began pouring in. Countries like Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela 
(spectacularly) and Colombia and Chile (more consistently) received huge sums 
of foreign investment and private lending. Their stock exchanges boomed, the 
state-owned companies they placed on the auction block fetched fantastic 
amounts of cash and privately owned firms were borrowing again at reasonable 
rates on the international markets. Latin America re-established itself as a 
capital-importing region and its economies began to grow, albeit slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Several explanations were proffered for fascination with the area's so-called 
emerging markets. The newly achieved reforms -- exchange-rate stability plus 
sound public finances -- initially were given credit. That explanation was soon 
found wanting. As much money was flowing into Brazil, where the currency was 
devalued daily and inflation was above 50% monthly, as into Argentina, which 
had virtually eliminated inflation and practically adopted the U.S. dollar as 
its currency. Brazil, the presumed economic basket case, has been growing at 
five times the rate of Mexico, the supposed head of the class, and its foreign 
reserves are almost exactly twice Mexico's. Successful privatizations were also 
brandished as a reason for the boom, but again, counter-examples complicated 
matters. Mexico, for instance, received inflows well after its privatization 
program had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists soon understood the importance of a third factor: the tremendous 
difference in interest rates and investment yields between the emerging markets 
and the United States or Europe. Low rates in the United States, coupled with 
virtually guaranteed high investment return, paid in dollars, in Latin America, 
constituted an explosive combination. It made sense for pension funds, 
insurance companies, mom-and-pop investors and high-rolling speculators to 
place part of their money in Argentine and Brazilian stocks or Mexican Treasury 
certificates: they paid out 20%, 30%, even 40% yields, in dollars, yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, when interest-rate differentials started shrinking and uncertainty 
over several nations' political futures revived, as happened in the first two 
months of this year, the money that flowed in began to flow out. First the U.S. 
Federal Reserve Bank raised short-term interest rates, reversing the trend of 
the last several years. Then came the Chiapas uprising in Mexico, along with 
the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the 
kidnaping of two Mexican billionaires. The Banco Latino bankruptcy in 
Venezuela, where a new government raised some uncertainty, added nervousness to 
increasingly interconnected markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Latin stock markets' peak at the beginning of the year and the 
beginning of May, the Mexican Bolsa lost 23%, the Argentine market 25%, the Sao 
Paulo exchange nearly 40% and the Venezuelan stock market more than 30%. J.P. 
Morgan's Emerging Markets Bond Index, which tracks the trend of Latin debt 
rather than stocks, went from a peak of slightly above 100 in January to a low 
of 77 and has stabilized since in the low 80s. Somewhere in the vicinity of $20 
billion has left Latin America since the beginning of the year: $10 billion to 
$12 billion from Mexico alone, $2 billion to $3 billion from Venezuela, the 
rest from Argentina and Brazil. This total is worrisome but manageable. There 
is no need to panic, but it is time to ponder the excessive optimism of recent 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 What Latin America does to attract and keep investment funds from abroad is 
important, but it is a marginal economic region, still terribly sensitive to 
what goes on elsewhere. Latin America is not, in any sense of the word, a 
master of its own financial destiny.

CENTERPIECE: DIVERSE CROWD HAS TAKEN TO RIDING THE RAILS; PASSENGERS OF ALL 
KINDS ARE ENJOYING THE COMFORT AND REDUCED STRESS BY COMMUTING ON METROLINK 
TRAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA WELDON TONE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every weekday morning, the Metrolink whistle can be heard as it approaches 
each of four Ventura County stops. In this land of the automobile, the sound of 
mass transit is a curiosity. Who rides these trains? Is it just people in dark 
suits, headed for downtown banks? Garment retailers bound for the Cooper 
Building? 
</P>
<P>
 There must be more than that. It's been running every day from Moorpark and 
Simi Valley for more than 18 months, Camarillo opened a station Feb. 14, and 
Oxnard opened April 4. Is it possible that the most auto-dependent part of the 
country is really making a change? 
</P>
<P>
 There's one way to find out. APRIL 20, 1994 / OXNARD, 6:21 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a chilly, quiet morning at the Greyhound / Amtrak station on 4th Street. 
A dozen or so people wait to board, not a pin-stripe among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is the only actual station on the Ventura County line. Here, tickets 
are purchased from a person rather than a machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Five periwinkle-and-white passenger cars, each with a 148-person capacity, 
arrive right on time. Best not be late if you're riding the Metrolink, it 
seems. The passengers board and the train is gone by 6:22 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second train of the day; the first left nearly an hour ago. Some 
people's perception of mass transit is of dimly lit, slightly smelly, 
graffiti-covered vehicles with Styrofoam cups and candy bar wrappers as floor 
covering. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a pleasant surprise. Not a cup or wrapper in sight, no unpleasant 
odor, a well-lit mauve interior with not so much as an initial carved in the 
wall. Each car has three levels of attractive, cushioned seating. No smoking, 
no alcohol, no spitting permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting alone, looking way too comfortable, is Norma Cooper, a legal secretary 
from Torrance who is moving to Ventura soon. She's out this morning testing 
Metrolink and marveling at the option to sit and relax on the way to work in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On a lower deck, in a quiet corner, is a member of the clergy. Father Richard 
Loomis, of St. Anthony's in Oxnard, is headed for a meeting at a downtown 
cathedral, a ride he takes several times a month. "Before the Simi Valley stop, 
it's quiet enough to do my morning prayers," he reported. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quiet. There's a few headsets (no radios allowed without them), some 
newspapers, a couple of industrious people who appear to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the seats equipped with a writing table is Tracey Lipsett, a student 
at Cal State Los Angeles. The mother of a 21-month-old, she is intent over her 
books, taking advantage of the time to study without distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next car, dressed in matching red sweat shirts, are two sisters, 
Elisabeth and Gretchen Kealy, communicating in sign language. Elisabeth, 11, 
and Gretchen, 7, are headed for Burbank, to a school for deaf and 
hearing-impaired students. 
</P>
<P>
 The train travels through farmland, headed for Camarillo. Trees, flowers, blue 
sky and mile after mile of strawberry fields. Not a bad way to start the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing out the window is Bill Fisch, owner of a manufacturing company in 
Burbank. "This is the biggest no-brainer in the world," he said. "I am one 
happy commuter. Even my wife has noticed a big difference in how I feel when I 
get home. The only way I'd be happier is if they'd stop so we could pick 
strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
 He returns his gaze to the fields. CAMARILLO, 6:33 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many boarding at Camarillo, although more than at Oxnard. Camarillo and 
the next three stops are "platform stops," in the vernacular. No real train 
station, but ticket machines and plenty of parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like bikes are allowed. In white shorts and white shirt, bike in tow, is 
Richard Lewis, a retiree of four years. Lewis takes his bike to L. A.'s Union 
Station about once a month. "It's great fun," he said. "I'm seeing L. A. on my 
bike." Today, he plans to ride from Union Station to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bikes are permitted on the lower level of each passenger car, although a 
bike permit is required. There is no charge for the permit, and it's good for 
two months, Lewis reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass transit as recreation transportation, now there's a concept for Southern 
California. Imagine weekends, bound for the beach, cooler in tow. The brochure 
says no surfboards are permitted on Metrolink, but who knows what the future 
holds? Shirts and shoes are also required. 
</P>
<P>
 Out the window, the strawberry fields continue, interspersed with lettuce 
fields, orange groves and assorted other fruits and vegetables awaiting 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, chatting in one of the face-to-face seating arrangements are Kelly 
Park and Laura Gilkinson, co-workers who ride daily to a company in Glendale. 
Gilkinson hopes that recent changes at the company will help offset commuting 
costs. The company has recently crossed the 100-employee mark, where employment 
of a transportation coordinator is mandated. "I like everything about this 
except the price," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink fares range from $5.50 to $7.50 for one-way tickets to as much as 
$208 for an unlimited monthly pass for commuting between Oxnard and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The train continues its quiet journey over the hills toward Moorpark as 
buildings begin to appear. The whistle blows as High Street comes into view. 
There's the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Co. Always wondered 
where that was. MOORPARK, 6:44 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Business really picks up here. Must be close to 100 people getting on, 
including Angela Winter and Monica Lichtenstein, who join colleagues Park and 
Gilkinson, headed for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The four co-workers travel together daily, each choosing her own form of 
entertainment. Gilkinson reads the newspaper, Winters does office work and 
Lichtenstein plays Tetris on a Game Boy. According to her friends, Park 
considers it her duty to spend the commute distracting the other three. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cars away, the Kealy sisters have been joined by half a dozen others. 
Eight children under the age of 14 are animatedly signing to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenery, sadly, is changing to car dealerships and rows of fast-food 
restaurants. Farm fields are out of sight, although an occasional park can be 
seen as Simi Valley is traversed, west to east. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen headsets are spotted now, a few Wall Street Journals, many 
copies of the Los Angeles Times, a variety of books, an occasional Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 In a now half-full car is Paula Mills, a Moorpark resident and bankruptcy 
adviser who works downtown. She looks to be about a third of the way through 
"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." She began Metrolinking in August, she 
says, and has since read 25 books, admittedly not all as meaty as her present 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing is, I don't have to drive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her disdain for driving is shared by Debbie Barry, who recently returned from 
a three-year stay in Japan. "I couldn't wait to get back and have my own car," 
she said. "After six months of awful traffic and spending so much money, I quit 
driving and went back to public transit." 
</P>
<P>
 Another whistle and the last stop in Ventura County. SIMI VALLEY, 6:57 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Good grief, this must be double the number that boarded in Moorpark, and look 
at the size of that parking lot. The conductor confirms that Simi Valley is the 
busiest stop in the county -- about 1,000 trips per day and parking for 600 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few empty rows now. The group bound for the hearing-impaired school 
in Burbank has grown to 14, one of them on crutches. Keeping up with the 
"conversation" is now impossible for the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing furiously in a window seat at the end of one car is paralegal Steve 
Tapp, who uses his commute to work on his second screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, the first one didn't sell," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 He has met numerous people since he began riding in November, 1992, and has 
made at least one good friend. "This is kind of like church," he noted. "People 
sit on the same car, in the same seat almost every day. You tend to get to know 
the people around you." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the last of the great scenery behind, the train enters the tunnel that 
joins Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley. It's a very long tunnel. For the 
transplanted New York subway riders, it must feel like home. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the car, there aren't many passengers looking out the 
window. The train runs mostly through industrial areas and, unless you're into 
counting colors of concrete, there's not much to hold your attention. Travelers 
now pursue their commuter activities in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes out of Simi Valley, the first groups begin to collect their 
belongings. First stop is Chatsworth, followed by Northridge, Van Nuys, Burbank 
and Glendale. Few leave the train at the first three stops, but there's a 
significant departure at the Burbank and Glendale stations. The bulk of the 
passengers, however, seem bound for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:50, a general rustling is heard. Passengers bending to collect items 
under the seat, straightening papers to return to file folders, checking 
lipstick, popping breath mints, opening and closing briefcases. LOS ANGELES, 
7:55 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The five cars empty quickly and the commuters head off to the Red Line, the 
Blue Line, the DASH bus, MTA or Foothill bus or Metrolink Shuttle. Some will 
complete their commute on foot. No one looks hurried or harried, quite unlike 
those waiting at a nearby traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still not a cup or wrapper in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been an enlightening experience. As a 27-year resident of Southern 
California, I really didn't think that mass transit would ever find acceptance 
here. Clearly, I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The great thing is that nobody I talked to seemed to feel that they were 
making a big sacrifice for the good of the environment. They ride because it's 
less stressful, it's clean, it's quiet and it's productive time. For some, 
productive means finishing "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"; for others, 
it's getting caught up on office work, saying morning prayers, or simply gazing 
and reflecting. But it's all time that won't be spent behind the wheel of a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Metrolink survey showed that 78% of Ventura County commuters drove in 
a car alone prior to Metrolinking. Which suggests that they all share a common 
reason for using mass transit -- it beats driving. That, of course, is the only 
way Metrolink will ever work. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, I've already scheduled a day to take my 8-year-old downtown to hear 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic rehearse. Getting There

FACING THE CHALLENGE; THESE ARTISTS HAVE OVERCOME AUTISM, CEREBRAL PALSY AND 
MORE TO TELL THEIR STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leon Fuller suffers from autism, a condition that makes simple conversation 
difficult. Expressing himself, something most of us take for granted, is 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fuller has found a way to let his ideas and feelings come out. He's an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 His drawings, which are featured in "Outside/In: A View From the Studio" at 
the Fullerton Museum Center through June 5, combine imagery and written 
narratives to tell intricate, personal stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is remarkable because Leon is an artist who is not able to carry on a 
conversation," said curator Lynn LaBate. "But you can see his work and 
understand his mind processes. He is recounting tales based on his life. It's 
pure inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller is one of 30 men and women who have contributed nearly 150 drawings, 
prints, pastels and ceramics to the show. All of the artists are challenged by 
autism, mental retardation, cerebral palsy or epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work came out of the First Street Gallery in Claremont, a social 
services program that LaBate said uses art as therapy and a way for the 
developmentally disabled to mainstream into society. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the exhibit, she added, is to bring attention to First Street 
as a model for others interested in starting similar programs and to underscore 
the universality of creative expression. A sign above a series of photographs 
of the artists makes that clear: "To be 'disabled' is a false notion," it 
declares. "In truth, everyone is differently abled." 
</P>
<P>
 LaBate believes that this point becomes obvious as you wander through the 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pioneering effort, and you can see that. The art itself is very 
personal and rather exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 "People go in with the idea that (what they see) will be primitive or 
childlike, but the nicest surprise is that it's more than that. Some of it is 
childlike and primitive, but you're also impressed by the astounding range of 
emotions and technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Fuller's series of pencil, pen, ink and watercolor drawings -- 
crudely rendered depictions of people in curious situations. LaBate noted that 
Fuller is an avid TV watcher and that his drawings sometimes portray moments 
from one of his favorite shows, "Beverly Hills, 90210." They're quirky and 
cuttingly amusing recollections, but LaBate stressed that the satiric tone is 
probably unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Fuller portrait, we meet Jeanne Alcorn, a somewhat harried-looking 
figure who, the artist informs us in a scrawled note, is ready to "go out on 
her crusade as an insurance saleswoman." 
</P>
<P>
 And nearby are more works by Fuller. A drawing of three people in a domestic 
scene includes this enigmatic message: "Carol rushed to the kitchen with the 
milk and cookies, then Gail and Peter fainted." An even more curious work finds 
Gail and Peter tied to a post, as if they've been tortured. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fuller uses text for expression, many of the other artists turn to 
dramatic colors and bold geometric designs. Jim Collins' oil pastels capture 
landscapes, but in a repetitive manner: All are blockish, with sweeping hues 
layered on one another, broken up with small, abstract trees or other natural 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Rae also employs bright colors, something that impressed LaBate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Matisse would have seen her drawings, he would have remarked, 'Ah, that is 
what I'm aiming for,' " LaBate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show turns whimsical with the ceramics. A long, toylike train features 22 
cars made by several members of the First Street program. Nearby are Michael 
LeVell's miniature dining table (complete with plates of food) and a chest 
filled with books. John White's comically misshapen sandwich, a BLT, includes 
side orders of green pickles and red french fries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose del Rio's crayon and marker drawings also catch the eye, in much the same 
way as Fuller's. With folk art verve, they combine images of brilliantly plumed 
birds surrounded by concepts and attitudes apparently important to the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Floating through his aviary are the words Respect and Honor and Peace and 
Intelligence , all penciled with great care.

FUNNY AND FERVENT; THIS ROCKER CAN BE QUITE THE CUTUP, BUT HE TAKES HIS WORK 
SERIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Get Peter Himmelman in front of an audience and he can be the consummate 
cutup, a wit who excels at off-the-cuff humor, composes comic songs on the spot 
and typically goes the extra mile to get close to his listeners. Well, maybe 
just the extra half-mile. That, Himmelman said, is how far he had to walk on a 
recent night in Kansas City before he found a spot where he felt comfortable 
performing. Some 250 fans followed him out of a club and down several city 
blocks after some obnoxious regulars and a bad PA system convinced him that 
only an impromptu exodus could save his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful when you do that," Himmelman, who plays with his band Saturday 
at the Coach House, said recently over a backstage telephone from Ames, Iowa. 
"(It creates) a certain sense of unity. I only do it when I get angry. I want 
to sing these songs they want to hear, and when people are talking (and 
interfering with fans' ability to listen), I don't just want to throw it away. 
I take what I do seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 That much is clear from the six albums Himmelman, 34, has issued since 1986. 
As funny as he can be in his comical moments on stage, the songs this 
Minnesota-raised, Santa Monica-based rocker commits to tape are marked by an 
unrelenting fervency and a serious, spiritually informed cast that parallels 
early U2. 
</P>
<P>
 His new album, "Skin," is different only in that it is his first "concept" 
album. In it, he traces the progress of a reincarnated soul that failed 
miserably in its previous existence but struggles to live a moral, loving and 
meaningful life in the next go-round. The reincarnation motif, usually 
associated with Buddhist and Hindu belief, might seem odd for a singer who 
grounds his daily life -- and a substantial number of his songs -- in 
traditional Judaism. But Himmelman (who refuses to perform on Friday nights, 
the start of the Jewish Sabbath) says he has found precedent for the "Skin" 
plot line in his study of Jewish texts. 
</P>
<P>
 His songs explore dualities: good versus evil, the joy of comprehending the 
divine and its earthly manifestations versus the anguish of feeling fallen, 
isolated and without purpose. He can't explain that other duality which informs 
his career: the songwriter consumed with trying to fathom ultimate questions, 
versus the on-stage jester who loves to give his fans a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Painfully earnest' is what I am," Himmelman said lightly, quoting a recent 
review in the New York Times. He has some humorous songs, with titles like 
"Dixie the Tiny Dog" and "Disgruntled Postal Worker," but they are novelties he 
cooked up for his live shows, not songs intended for albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the artists I like didn't do a lot of funny stuff, novelty 
songs," he said with an audible shrug. He sees the humor in his performances as 
a necessary way to set the audience at ease, so it will be more receptive to 
his fervent stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're going to do anything sort of confessional, you want to make sure 
you're friends first," he said. "You don't want to say something and be 
rebuffed." 
</P>
<P>
 On this tour, fans will have to wait a while for Himmelman's wit to kick in. 
He has been playing "Skin" straight through at the start, as an introduction to 
shows that can amble on unpredictably from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just been banging it out, but that's not the answer," he said, noting 
that he hopes eventually to find ways to build upon the album's concept, to 
possibly flesh it out for a film or a theatrical staging. But he doesn't attach 
any special significance to joining the ever-expanding club of rock 
conceptualists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just something that's been interesting to me," he said. "There's no 
reason why I've done it. You sit down and create something. You go to the well, 
and this is what I fished up." 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman, who has a cult following, puts limits on what he will do to fish 
for a wider fan base. 
</P>
<P>
 "People magazine wanted to do a big spread on the last album (the excellent 
1992 release "Flown This Acid World")," he recalled. But he said the magazine 
quickly lost interest when he refused to pose for one of People's trademark 
celebrities-at-home photo spreads with wife and kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a necessary safeguard against obscuring the line between your 
real self and a cartoon persona," he said of his insistence on keeping his 
family life private. "You need to have these walls of separation. Everyone's 
trying to tear down walls, but walls are also good. They help to preserve what 
you think is sacred." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't entirely walled-off about his family. Over the years he has released 
moving songs declaring love for his dying father ("This Father's Day") and his 
nurturing mother ("Child Into a Man"), as well as tender, hopeful ballads 
celebrating the births of his 4-year-old son, Isaac, ("Laugh My Beloved") and 
his 2-year-old daughter, Raina, ("Raina"). Himmelman said that he now is under 
some familial pressure to deliver the musical goods for 9-month-old Chaya. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing up People spreads and appearances on "The Tonight Show with Johnny 
Carson' -- as he did a few years ago when an invitation conflicted with the 
Jewish holiday of Sukkot -- is obviously not the way to maximize one's 
audience. But Himmelman said he is more concerned about its intensity than its 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never found out what it took to be a big star, and it's not my big goal 
in life to find out, either," he said. "I work the same way I did as a kid, 
working with color crayons. I just say, 'Wouldn't this be fun to do?' Then I 
talk to the guys I've worked with and been friends with for years (most of 
Himmelman's band grew up with him in Minneapolis and have been playing with him 
since they all were in their teens) and see their reaction to it." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that "there's a certain (sales) number in my mind we need to 
do" to maintain a record contract and sustain a career. He said his label, 550 
Music/Epic, has been pushing a single, "With You," on the Adult Album 
Alternative format and that the company regards "Skin" as "the most easily 
marketable" record he has done.  
</P>
<P>
 "The irony is, you could say it's a weighty subject matter, an odd thing, a 
conceptual album. You'd think it was just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very mercantile about it," he summed up. "But I feel successful in my 
own way. In every city we draw people, they have all my records, they call out 
songs from 'Synesthesia' (an album from 1989 that, following on the heels of 
'Gematria' that same year, gave Himmelman the all-'80s title for obscure album 
titling). 
</P>
<P>
 And, as that recent Kansas City gig shows, his fans prize him enough to follow 
him that extra half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman said that earlier in his career, he himself might not have gone the 
extra distance to rescue a marginal evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to leave the stage with a bad night all the time, or a perfunctory 
night. Maybe it was having kids and being on the road, but now you know your 
time is limited and you don't want to waste it. I guess it's the common cry of 
adulthood: 'Where is the time?' There was such a quantity of it, you could 
squander it to no end and you'd wish it would pass. Now, I'm trying to conserve 
the minutes."

 Anthony Crawford 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthony Crawford" 
</P>
<P>
 Little Dog  
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Crawford's unassumingly charming debut album brings several pop 
troubadours past and present to mind: He looks like Jackson Browne, sounds like 
a raspier version of Crowded House's Neil Finn, and frequently writes of 
youthful Angst recalling everyone from Cat Stevens to the late Kurt Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with that confluence of sources informing his songs, Crawford comes 
off pretty much as his own man here.Like Crowded House, Crawford grabs your 
attention with careening melodies and holds it with lyrics that work like 
pieces of a puzzle, rather than a whole picture. That helps give his songs a 
longer shelf life than those who reveal everything upfront. He expresses 
disillusionment with a friend in "I'm Not Sure I Believe You Anymore." But 
where so many of his contemporaries in the world of grunge rock stop after 
venting their frustration and anger, Crawford uses a well-developed sense of 
humor, albeit black humor, to transcend his feelings of betrayal: "If you're 
looking for Fred/Fred's not home/He's out for a while/But if you hold your 
breath/I'll count along/To your pretty blue smile." 
</P>
<P>
 A popular studio musician who plays a gaggle of stringed instruments here, 
Crawford was discovered by Pete Anderson, Dwight Yoakam's longtime producer and 
collaborator. Anderson was so impressed with the original songs he heard 
Crawford noodling with between sessions in a recording studio one day that he 
formed Little Dog Records expressly to help get a wider audience for Crawford's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for Crawford -- and for us -- that he spent that break strumming instead 
of dashing out for a Big Mac. RANDY LEWIS

JAZZ; PROS WILL GIVE UPBEAT LESSONS

 Last year's debut Orange County Art & Jazz Festival put an interesting twist 
to the usual outdoor music festival proceedings. Held on the grounds of the 
American Way Cultural Center in Orange, the festival looked to the future of 
the music by mingling bands from area colleges and high schools with such 
professional musicians as saxophonist Eric Marienthal and trumpeter Tony 
Guerrero, who played with the band from his alma mater, Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's festival is scheduled to run three full days, beginning Friday, on 
the grounds of the Fullerton Arboretum. The premise is the same: A dozen high 
school and college bands will work with Guerrero and other professionals, 
including saxophonist Bob Sheppard (seen touring in the last year with Steely 
Dan and keyboardist Lyle Mays), trombonist Alex Isles and trumpeter Jeff 
Bunnell. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of professional bands are also on tap, including the percussive-wise 
combo Latinum, the quintet of saxophonist Dan St. Marseille and the salsa 
ensemble of violinist Susie Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to stimulate and educate the young musicians of Southern 
California while providing some great entertainment that's affordable for 
families," said festival director Larry Anders. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Linahon, director of jazz studies at Fullerton College, said cuts in music 
education funding makes events like this all the more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great experience for young people to play with pros under professional 
conditions. These students will see a higher standard than the garage-band 
mentality that we now have in popular music." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival also will feature displays from area fine artists ("It's not a 
craft show," Anders emphasized) as well as food vendors. 
</P>

COLLECTIBLES; MANY, MANY CORKSCREWS, NOT A DROP TO DRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sotheby's in New York has re-released its coffee-table book, "Collectible 
Corkscrews." The edition, however, mentions no Orange County collectors, and 
inquiries among some of the county's most knowledgeable wine aficionados also 
failed to turn up a single local collector. 
</P>
<P>
 While some may nevertheless exist, we had to take a hop over the county line 
to find an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some collectors get involved because of wine," said Pasadena's Michael Sharp, 
who is fascinated by the devices. "I'm not a big wine drinker. I like 
mechanical things. Corkscrews with cranks interest me. I also favor ones with a 
documented history, where you know the manufacturer or patent, the dream and 
the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man's ingenuity when it comes to making a better mousetrap can't be better 
illustrated than with corkscrews. We have the small task in front of us of 
extracting a cork from a bottle, yet there are . . . thousands of variations of 
going about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp is intimately familiar with several thousand variations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally own 3,500," he said, "and I don't have the definitive 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
 Invented in the late 17th Century, corkscrews use levers, screws and gears to 
accomplish their task. They often come in combination with implements such as a 
knife or screwdriver. Collectors often make decisions on the basis of 
distinctive shape, material or decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Timothy Diener's collection of corkscrews, long associated with the 
Christian Brothers winery in the Napa Valley, remains the most famous. In an 
article he wrote on the field, he tells of finding a one-of-a-kind corkscrew 
with a handle of wart hog tusk, its end tipped with a silver cigar cutter, in a 
California shop -- for $10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do get lucky now and then," said Donald Bull of the International 
Correspondence of Corkscrew Addicts. "I bought a corkscrew for $4 at a 
consignment shop that recently sold for $2,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Resale can go even higher, according to Sharp: "It wouldn't surprise me to see 
a corkscrew selling for $3,000 to $5,000. I've not paid that, but I've seen it 
offered." 
</P>
<P>
 Bull is the current "Right" of the ICCA; there is no president, the group's 
slogan being, "We'd rather be right than president." Diener was the ICCA's 
first Right; when he left office, he became Just Right. 
</P>
<P>
 ICCA membership is limited to 50, and the organization requires photographs of 
applicants' best six corkscrews, information about the collection and 
biographical data for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its name, the Canadian Corkscrew Collectors Club boasts a worldwide 
membership, mostly from the United States, and interest in the field is 
sufficient to qualify applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very first thing a corkscrew aficionado should do is join the CCCC," Bull 
recommended, "then hope to get in the ICCA when one of us dies or resigns." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp's oldest corkscrew dates from 1780, and is part of a set manufactured in 
England that comes with a little funnel and spoon. He nevertheless considers 
his own "best six" to be of more recent vintage and greater proximity, 
manufactured in California in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will & Fink were famous for manufacturing card-cheating devices and knives 
after the Gold Rush," he said. "The corkscrews look fairly plain, but they 
survived. I turned up the sixth one recently at a flea market. It was dirty and 
rusty. I paid little or nothing for it. I cleaned it up and it said 'Will & 
Fink.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Though flea markets, swap meets and antique shows are excellent sources, 
corkscrews don't have to be old to be a valuable collectible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I buy new ones, too," Sharp said. "If I don't have it, I want it. Even the 
new ones I have, most are no longer being produced. So the one that I buy 
today, that won't be on the market a year from now, is for sure going to be 
interesting to someone 50 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for membership in the CCCC, write Membership Chairman Milt Becker, 
P.O. Box 9863, Englewood, N.J., 07631; annual dues of $30 entitles members to 
receive "The Quarterly Worm." For membership in the ICCA, write to The Right, 
ICCA, 20 Fairway Drive, Stamford, Conn., 06903.

KID STUFF: THE SUMMERTIME DO'S; DAY CAMPS AND WORKSHOPS PROMISE ALL KINDS OF

 Spring may have its bluebirds and pollen, but for my money, there is no surer 
sign of encroaching summer than a child's backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh and functional in September, it is a sorry specimen by May: The zipper 
is missing teeth, and the bottom has worn thin from being dragged (or kicked, 
depending on the bearer's mood) across the school parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Your child's interest in school may be wearing thin by now too, but as any 
savvy parent knows, there's nothing like a good bribe to lure your reluctant 
scholar through the final weeks of the term. And, be it a night under the stars 
or a chance to strut and fret upon the stage, a summer camp or workshop can be 
a fine lure. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several criteria to keep in mind when choosing a program for your 
child, says Shirley Walch, executive director of the American Camping Assn., 
Southern California section. These include the adult-to-child ratio, the age 
and experience of the counselors or program leaders and the program's 
suitability to your child's personality or needs. ACA's office in Calabasas can 
provide a complete check list, as well as a guide to ACA accredited day camps 
and resident (sleep-over) camps in Southern California and Hawaii. You can 
reach them at (818) 223-9232. 
</P>
<P>
 Day camps and workshop series abound for kids in our area; the following list 
is a small sampling. Bear in mind that almost every program requires advance 
registration, and most fill up quickly. STAGE EXPERIENCE

 With an underwater viewing theater and an on-board laboratory, the Orange 
County Marine Institute's new R/V Sea Explorer will significantly expand the 
facility's public programs, says a spokesman. Summer activities will include a 
family harbor "eco-tour," an evening bioluminescence cruise and an interactive 
audio-video cruise in which visitors communicate with divers as they explore 
kelp forests and reefs. (All are offered on multiple dates throughout the

 At just 2 1/2 acres, the Environmental Nature Center is a micro-microcosm of 
California's plant life. The site, which is used year-round as an outdoor 
science classroom for local schools, becomes a Nature Camp Science Summer 
School for the general public June 27 through Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 An ENC spokeswoman says that the series is unlike other summer programs 
because it emphasizes science curriculum over recreation. Credentialed teachers 
lead groups in hands-on science projects that focus on themes such as 
conservation or rocks and fossils and conduct field trips to Griffith Park 
Observatory, La Brea Tar Pits and the Orange County Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions run Monday through Thursday. Fee: $175 to $225 for a two-week 
session.

WET & WILD; SHARK ATTACK STIRS MEMORY OF A CLOSE CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Ingram watched the shark bearing down on him. This, he thought, is the 
"great white death." 
</P>
<P>
 But, miraculously, he survived. It was an attack that, although leaving him 
without serious injury, has been talked about in diving circles since and even 
described in a 1985 book called "Last of the Blue Water Hunters." 
</P>
<P>
 "For two years afterward, every time I closed my eyes, my heartbeat would 
skyrocket," said Ingram, 46, who owns a boat repair business in El Toro.  
</P>
<P>
 Ingram's heart-stopping experience occurred 10 years ago off Baja California. 
But its memory was vividly brought back by the recent grisly discovery in San 
Diego of a young woman apparently chomped to death by a great white off Point 
Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram was luckier: Rather than bringing him death, the attack turned out to 
be a seminal experience that changed his view of life.  
</P>
<P>
 It began late one murky afternoon when Ingram, an experienced spear fisherman, 
was diving with several friends from a boat near Guadalupe Island. Like many 
serious spear fishermen, they were not using scuba tanks, preferring instead to 
hold their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Floating face down, the father of two suddenly saw what appeared to be "a 
large white reef kind of shimmering in the water" beneath him. "Only I looked 
at it and it was moving. It was a very large white shark, and it was coming up 
toward me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram later estimated the length of the animal at 15 to 17 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising his head out of the water long enough to yell, "Shark!" he swung his 
gun around and aimed it while the shark closed in. "Unfortunately, when you're 
in the water with an animal that size, it usually makes most of the decisions, 
and this one decided to attack," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a split second, the shark closed in on the diver from 25 feet away. At the 
moment of impact, Ingram fired his spear into the fish's head. Then he 
stiffened as it burrowed under his left arm and lifted him out of the water up 
to his waist. Falling over the shark's back, the diver did a 360-degree midair 
turn before sinking with his assailant back into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The shark retreated, towing Ingram's spear and gun out to sea. And the crew of 
divers -- convinced that their buddy had been bitten in half -- launched a 
chase boat to retrieve the remains.  
</P>
<P>
 "They told me later that they thought they were just coming out to pick up the 
pieces and kept thinking of what they would tell my wife," Ingram said. "I 
thought the same thing. I kept looking at my arms and legs; I just couldn't 
believe I was still all there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram swam away with only a bruised left arm "and the mental scars." 
</P>
<P>
 If he hadn't gotten back into the water almost immediately, he now believes, 
he probably never would have gone in again.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about sharks, they're going to swim into your mind, and you 
can't dive," he said. "I swim a lot now looking behind me. I've had days since 
then when I've had to get back on the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 But the experience also helped him clarify his values.  
</P>
<P>
 "The one thought that would not leave my mind as I got back onto the boat was 
how I didn't want to leave my wife and children," Ingram said. "I guess what's 
really important is what really sticks there." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has some advice for others who may encounter sharks: If you have a 
spear gun and the animal is within range, don't hesitate to shoot it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a spear gun, do the next best thing: Yell your head off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound carries long distances underwater, Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not used to hearing that, and it will scare them off."

DO IT!: LAGUNA COAST PARK SPRINGS OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 The firestorm that destroyed 366 houses in Laguna Beach last fall also 
blackened much of Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, which had opened just months 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas rebuilding the homes has been a sometimes-painful process that 
continues to be stalled for some, the park has quietly been healing itself. The 
public will get a chance to see for itself Saturday, when the Laguna Canyon 
Foundation sponsors a springtime open house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity to come out and see that Mother Nature has performed her 
miracles," said Sharen Heath, a foundation staff member and park docent. 
"There's some astonishing rebirth and regeneration going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Coast Wilderness Park comprises about 15,000 acres, spread out along 
each side of Laguna Canyon Road. Included are year-round streams, oak- and 
sycamore-shaded canyons and the only natural freshwater lakes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its debut in April of last year, the park has been open only on weekend, 
docent-led tours. Saturday's event will include guided walks for those who 
prefer, but will also provide visitors their first chance for some solo 
exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who wants to throw a backpack over his shoulder with a sandwich and 
some water and a pair of binoculars can get out there and hike," Heath said. 
</P>
<P>
 The open house will serve several purposes. It will provide an introduction to 
the park for those who haven't visited it yet, and it will show those who 
haven't been to the park since the fires that the park is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Grasses are coming back to the burn areas, and wildflowers are abundant, 
including several species called "fire-followers" that grow especially well in 
recently burned areas. 
</P>
<P>
 When Heath leads walks, she finds that people expect the worst after seeing 
images of burning brushland in newspapers and on TV. "They enter the park 
thinking they're going to be terribly disappointed," Heath said. "They leave 
with renewed confidence and faith in nature. . . . It really tickles me." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no public parking at any of the three unconnected park sites, but 
visitors are encouraged to park at Act V, on the western side of Laguna Canyon 
Road, across from the Canyon Club (signs will be posted for the event). Free 
shuttle buses will ferry visitors to the entrance of the park areas: Laurel 
Canyon, Big Laguna Lake and Little Sycamore Canyon-Little Laguna Lake. Shuttles 
begin at 8:30 a.m. and go until 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Pets, bicycles and horses will not be permitted for this event (for 
information on bicycle and equestrian tours, call (714) 832-7478). Visitors are 
encouraged to bring sturdy hiking shoes, drinking water, snacks, a hat and 
sunscreen; optional items include binoculars, field guide and camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is free, but organizers ask that anyone planning to attend call, so 
that an estimate of the number of participants can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Laguna Coast Wilderness Park open house. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, May 21, 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Laguna Canyon Wilderness Park, Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at Laguna Canyon Road 
(California 133) and drive south to Laguna Beach. Follow temporary signs to Act 
V, on the western side of the road across from the Canyon Club. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 855-7275.

PARKER'S CRACKS GO TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having spent most of my life in Costa Rica, T. Jefferson Parker's May 5 
column, "Hell and High Water," didn't tell me anything new about the country. 
Rather, it told me more about Mr. Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 His characterization of my country as a place where driving is a "thrilling, 
hands-on, full-contact sport," "recommended only for those with an unquenchable 
death wish," and where "life is cheap, but cars are expensive," leaves me 
thinking that he spends most of his free time watching Sylvester Stallone 
movies and probably bashing illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what he might have us think, Costa Rica is not a place where only 
macho men like himself dominate the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Carjackings, drive-by shootings, strangers shooting at each other on the 
freeway, a "slow lane" moving at 65 m.p.h. -- these are things that 
characterize Southern California roads, though maybe Mr. Parker doesn't 
experience them in his Orange County cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving conditions he describes can be found in many places in the United 
States. Many rural roads in Colorado, Montana, even California, are probably 
worse than what he describes in Costa Rica.  
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Parker doesn't tell us anything worthwhile about the 10 days he spent in 
my country. The only thing he reveals is his arrogant and mean-spirited 
Stallone view of the "Third World," of anything that's not as controlled, 
segregated and antiseptic as his Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope you never go back to Costa Rica, Mr. Parker. I can tell you that you 
are definitely not welcome.  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if The Times would have published this kind of stereotypical garbage 
in its L.A. edition.

REVIEW; UPLIFTING 'SESAME STREET LIVE!' MUSICAL DAZZLES THE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's loud -- the amplification of sibilants on the prerecorded soundtrack 
nears wince level. It's modest but glitzy -- the lights onstage could probably 
illuminate a small town.And, out in the lobby, Elmo flashlights, Big Bird 
pennants, T-shirts, posters, buttons and more are raking in the bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the elegant Pasadena Civic Auditorium, one of four local stops for the 
latest "Sesame Street Live!" musical for children, the gentle, more altruistic 
spirit of the TV show shines through as Big Bird, Elmo, Grover, Cookie Monster 
et al. put on a "When I Grow Up" pageant about Muppet career aspirations. The 
show opens tonight at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Charming song-and-dance numbers range from "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" to 
"Teddy Bear's Picnic."  
</P>
<P>
 The show has an affirming message, naturally. Elmo wants to be everything, and 
that's OK. Big Bird, the show's Everykid, can't come up with anything to be, 
and that's OK too. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you think about watching adults in Muppet guise cavort on stage, 
there's no denying the thrill for children who greet the entrance of each 
character with roars of delighted recognition.

VIDEO REWIND; 'AIR COMMAND' TAKES OFF AFTER STEWART GETS IN GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Strategic Air Command," a bit of Cold War propaganda about as circumspect as 
an above-ground nuclear test, is still worth seeing if you get a kick out of 
aviation or quaint period pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 James Stewart pulls on his trademark aw-shucks persona as he plays a pro 
baseball player and World War II pilot called back into the service to fly the 
huge cigar-like B-36 bomber for SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many flying pictures, the action doesn't truly get off the ground until 
the star does. But once Stewart hoists himself into the metallic belly of the 
beast and the engines begin to thunder, the film begins to soar. The aerial 
sequences are spectacular -- not the wasp-like darting around of combat films, 
but the serenity of high-altitude flying in immense but graceful aircraft. The 
B-36, in use only briefly in SAC and unusual for its six pusher 
propeller-driven engines, will surely appear a strange curiosity to modern eyes 
more used to the sleek lines of current military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Stewart (who was himself a World War II heavy bomber pilot) graduates 
to the jet-powered B-47, another short-lived plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the ground, matters get a bit treacly as June Allyson, as Stewart's 
wife, continues to try to talk him out of airplanes and back into baseball, 
even as brass hats try to keep him flying.  
</P>
<P>
 Victor Young's musical score is a plus, particularly the sweeping phrases 
played over the flying sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strategic Air Command" probably recruited a few fliers, even if the B-36 was 
obsolete by the time they made it into the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strategic Air Command" (1955), directed by Anthony Mann. 114 minutes. Not 
rated.

SPECIAL SCREENING: HAUNTING HUNTING IN 'NIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who saw Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" probably remembers the dude 
with the boom box and the rings, one spelling "hate" across his fingers, the 
other "love." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and his big-and-bad character made a good point about how our moral 
intentions don't always jibe with our nastier impulses, but he lifted the image 
from someone else. Robert Mitchum appears in the strange and mesmerizing "The 
Night of the Hunter" with the same words tattooed above the knuckles of each 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 As Harry Powell, the psychotic preacher who has the hardest time obeying the 
First Commandment, Mitchum is the grinning monster at the center of the 1955 
movie, directed by Charles Laughton. Lee used the symbols mainly to describe 
ghetto tension, but Laughton, Mitchum and screenwriter James Agee turn them 
into a reminder that man, after all, may be unrepentingly evil at the core. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Night of the Hunter" (which closes out the Newport Harbor Art Museum's 
short tribute to Laughton on Friday night) is a sensational movie, 
distinguished by the eeriest of inspirations that render it both artful 
(sometimes floridly so) and frightening. Laughton, in this, the only film he 
ever directed, created something highly original. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening passage tells us right off that this won't be a typical 
experience. Lillian Gish as Rachel, the movie's heroine, floats among the 
stars, quoting the Bible. The brood of orphans she watches over, seen only as 
smiling, disembodied heads, listen raptly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's weird, melodramatic and reminiscent of D. W. Griffith, especially his use 
of sentimental visions and his layering of image upon image for effect. There's 
a dreamy sway (not unlike a silent movie) to this beginning that infuses the 
entire picture and lets the creepiness that unfolds seem more foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchum's Harry shows up soon after, looking skyward while driving through the 
countryside. He's having a conversation with his God, a vengeful partner. 
"There are things you hate, Lord," he says, "perfumey things, lacy things, 
things with curly hair . . ." We see his switchblade moments later, as he 
angrily watches a girlie show in town, and it's clear he's insane. Mitchum's 
laconic face turns twitchy fast, his calming baritone rising with danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Agee's scenario pits Harry against John and Pearl (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane 
Bruce), two children who know where $10,000 in stolen money is hidden. After 
marrying, then murdering, their mother (Shelley Winters, in one of her better 
innocent victim roles), Harry chases them downstream in an odyssey equal parts 
terror and pastoral beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 When the youngsters' skiff washes ashore (it's a reference to Moses escaping 
tragedy as an infant, one of the movie's many biblical connections), the 
shotgun-wielding Gish's Rachel becomes their unlikely protector. She has the 
hard countenance of a nun who won't brook any foolishness. Rachel lifts her 
weapon and reminds us that "it's a hard world for little things," even as Harry 
stalks from the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Night of the Hunter" wasn't widely accepted when it came out, and it's 
not hard to figure out why. The contrast of sentimentality ripe with religious 
overtones against the blunt violence can be jarring; audiences of the day, 
probably not used to such directness, were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Laughton and respected cinematographer Stanley Cortez willfully 
take chances throughout, providing an ambiance that is both naturalistic and 
surreal. "The Night of the Hunter," ultimately more of a sermon on good and 
evil than a spook show, is a movie flush with style.

 Gustaf Anders, declaring a resurgence of the custom of after-dinner drinks, 
will host an evening of cognac tasting (and dinner) on Tuesday, beginning at 
6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The cognacs are from the Hine vineyards: an "antique" variety, which is 20 to 
25 years old, and a "triomphe" cognac, which has aged 40 to 45 years. Madeline 
De Jean of Hine Cognac will attend to answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner includes appetizers and a Tom Thomas cocktail, made with ginger ale, 
cognac and a sprig of mint. Hine Cognac Rare, a 10-year-old blend, will also be 
served. Crepe Willander, a rolled souffle filled with onions, parsley, herring 
and cheese, will be served next, atop a parsley salad. Braised veal shanks and 
lemon tart follow. Each dish is accompanied by a different wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $75, plus tax and tip.

 The National Sports Grill will open a fourth location in late June, this one 
in Orange, at the former site of a Red Onion restaurant. True to the offerings 
of its other restaurants in Buena Park and Fullerton, and later this month, in 
Torrance, this one will serve burgers, sandwiches, pizza and other "classic 
American" food, along with 35 brands of beer, including 15 on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 television monitors will make sure sports fans never miss a 
moment; 12 tournament-size pool tables are also planned.

PLANE DECOR, DOWN-TO-EARTH MENU; NIEUPORT 17 PLAYS IT SAFE ON THE GROUND 
</P>

<P>
 "I earned these wings," says our waitress, referring to a small gold flier's 
insignia on her navy blue lapel, which signifies her status as a full-fledged 
waitress. Aeronautics is the theme at Nieuport 17; courtly, dapper Bill Bettis, 
who has operated this Tustin bastion of Continental cuisine for more than 25 
years, is a former Navy pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 As if you couldn't guess. Nieuport 17's walls are thick with beautifully 
framed drawings and photographs of famous fighter planes. Indeed, the 
restaurant's name (which is something of a pun, since it's on Newport Avenue) 
refers to a biplane used by the kaiser's imperial forces in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis has constructed his restaurant carefully, giving it the swank, stately 
charm of an exclusive officers' club. The exterior recalls a Franche-Comte 
manor house, all white turrets and ivy trim. The main dining room -- one of 
four -- is a collage of rich wood paneling, empty wine bottles propped up on 
sideboards, deer antler chandeliers and fresh flowers. There are plush 
semi-circular booths to sink into, or high-backed tapestry chairs for those who 
prefer to dine upright. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuport 17 moved to this location at the corner of Irvine Boulevard about 
four years ago after 20-odd years nearby in Santa Ana. The faithful (these 
dining rooms are brimming with regulars) seem to have followed, which is 
impressive. It is no small feat pleasing the gentry of Tustin Hills, Newport 
Beach and surrounding communities, which make up the heart of Bettis' 
clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 Service is impeccable; this crowd would hardly settle for less. One is greeted 
by name in civilized fashion at a proper podium, then whisked at speed to one's 
table. Once seated, no one is left to linger long. The elapsed time from podium 
to cocktails in this restaurant might just be Orange County's shortest. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it is time to open up the thick, leather-bound menus, things begin to 
take on a rather familiar glint. This is a menu that plays it safe in the 
extreme: mostly steaks, seafoods and the usual complement of salads and 
accompaniments. The good side of this is that dishes are prepared competently, 
if not altogether with passion. Judging from the response, that's the way 
Bettis' customers want it. 
</P>
<P>
 Main dishes come with a choice of one of the fine daily soups ( albondigas , 
perhaps, or a smooth green pea potage with homemade croutons) or salad, either 
a wilted spinach with bacon, chopped egg and a light, non-cloying vinaigrette 
or a more conventional (and less compelling) tossed green. Since soup or salad 
is included, appetizers are sort of an indulgence, which perhaps explains why 
the list is somewhat truncated. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the lot has to be beef steak tartare. It's a proper tartar of 
top-grade minced sirloin mingled with capers, eggs, chopped onions and a dash 
of Worcestershire. Grilled buttered toasts, served alongside, punctuate the 
luxuriousness of this old-fashioned dish. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a shrimp cocktail of four extra-large shrimp in a standard red 
cocktail sauce; shrimp escadrille is the same in a more interesting remoulade 
sauce that you could think of as Thousand Island with horseradish. You could 
order a gutsy, anchovy-heavy Caesar salad a la carte for $6.50, but since you 
get salad with an entree, it would only make sense if you're dining light, with 
no main dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees can be Australian lobster tails, king crab legs, fresh fish, a variety 
of steaks prepared different ways and even a couple of veal dishes. People who 
have had the Southern fried chicken that Lousiana-born chef James Lane prepares 
on Sunday evenings report it's terrific. I can't say that about any of the main 
entrees I've tasted, but none was objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a pan-fried filet of sole came up buttery but slightly dry, 
although it must be said that our waitress did attempt to guide me toward 
charbroiled swordfish. Roast chicken morel is a boneless breast of chicken that 
tastes as if it has been poached, positively smothered with delicious morels 
and then blanketed with a bland, vinegar-punctuated brown stock.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu is dominated by beef dishes, the best of which has to be the prime 
rib -- superbly marbled roast beef served with a delicious, puffy Yorkshire 
pudding. The rest are steaks. The blackened rib eye, probably the most tender 
on the menu, truly hits the spot. The spices have been crusted onto the surface 
of the tender meat.  
</P>
<P>
 But the pepper steak is served with a very bland green peppercorn sauce. And 
then there's the roast braten Vienna, a New York steak prepared "Austrian-style 
with thin slivers of onion and pickles atop a delicious paprika sauce," 
according to the menu. What I tasted was a steak topped with onions but no 
pickles, in a creamy, rose-colored sauce no more than kissed with paprika.  
</P>
<P>
 You get to choose two vegetables from a list of old friends; broccoli 
Hollandaise, au gratin potatoes, green peas, glazed carrots and the like. The 
desserts are old friends, too, whether we refer to fresh raspberries and 
vanilla ice cream laced with Chambord liqueur, peach Melba or a trio of 
homemade confections: fudge pie, lemon sour cream pie and lime torte. The fudge 
pie is warm, soft and not particularly distinctive, but the lemon and lime 
desserts are almost perfect. The first has a rich cream topping over a frothy 
lemon filling, the second is almost like a lime-flavored creme brulee on a 
flaky short crust.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither one is light enough to make you want to fly away, but fair enough. 
Earning your wings is indeed a tricky business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuport 17 is expensive. Appetizers are $5 to $10. Main dishes are $14 to 
$36. Desserts are $3.50 to $7.

PARKER'S PLACE: GETTING SPRUNG: IT'S THE SEASON FOR ESCAPE; INSTINCTS KEEP THE 
LIFE FORCE GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring seems to induce in us human beings a strong desire to escape. Over the 
past month, friends and acquaintances have lit out for Mexico, the Caymans, 
Belize, Baltimore, Berlin, Hawaii and London, to name a few. Here in Orange 
County I've run across plenty of Mexicans, Caymanians, Belizeans, etc., doing 
the same. It seems like everybody's either packing for a trip, asking 
directions to the beach or trying to cajole you into giving them a lift to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 For the non-human inhabitants of Earth, things are just the opposite. 
Reproduction is the call of the current season, and just about everything that 
can -- and some things that can't -- is intent upon the act of mating.  
</P>
<P>
 Male sparrows livid with red feathers whiz through the sky after their desired 
counterparts. The lizards are literally crawling over each other, enraptured by 
hormones. Stinkbugs lose their balance and roll around, connected, legs waving 
in an orgy of amour and odor. Even my two retrievers, long neutered and 
reproductively challenged, have taken to acting out comic love scenes at all 
hours of day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the desire to escape and the desire to mate are actually 
complementary. The animals can't know that they're heading for parenthood, so 
you might assume that they are in it either for the pleasure -- hard to believe 
in the stinkbug's case -- or at the behest of deep instincts against which they 
are helpless. At any rate, they are much closer now than they will ever be 
again during the year. Maybe they're programmed by nature to enjoy each others' 
company for a finite amount of time, in their case all spring, before they 
escape into the liberties of summer without so much as a parting glance over 
their scaled, feathered or plated shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 But human beings pick and choose their hours together -- in some cases, at 
least -- over the length of a lifetime. Maybe the primary reason people want to 
escape their daily lives each spring is precisely so they can mate unencumbered 
by routine and all the handy reminders -- so visible around home and hearth -- 
that mating makes offspring and offspring make future escape difficult. This 
might account for the large number of June weddings, and it also might not. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the best example of human escape I've seen this spring was that of a 
young man at a local fair who was fitted snugly into a canvas straitjacket, 
then wrapped tightly -- very tightly -- in maybe 30 feet of chain. The chain 
was snugged several times around his neck, arms and waist, then yanked up hard 
into his groin, around the small of his back, then over his shoulders. I 
watched as his tormentors cinched this chain hard, then padlocked it at various 
junctures to keep it chokingly taut. If they were covertly making it easy on 
him, I sure couldn't tell. By the time they were finished securing him, a crowd 
had gathered to watch him try to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a young man, maybe 20, and slightly built. His hair was pulled back in 
a bun. He briefly addressed the gathering audience about this not being a 
trick, and it was easy to see the genuine duress he was under. Sweat beaded his 
face. His jugular vein stood out, as did the large blood vessel running up his 
forehead. His overall color quickly went from normal to an inflamed red as the 
sweat began running off his nose in a rivulet. He was breathing hard. His voice 
was hoarse. He coughed. And he hadn't even started his escape yet. 
</P>
<P>
 With maybe 80 people gathered close, he got down to business. First, he stood 
and bent at the waist, working the muscles in his arms and torso. It was hard 
to tell exactly what he was doing under there, but the material of the 
straitjacket rose and fell like a gentle ocean swell. He dipped one shoulder, 
then the other. He stood straight again, face growing purple, breathed steadily 
for a moment, then repeated the whole process. The chain didn't give an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point a woman behind me noted that he hadn't dislocated his shoulders 
properly. I thought to myself that the kid was definitely heading for trouble. 
The canvas of his jacket was soaked in sweat, forming a large V from his 
clavicles to the bottom of his sternum. His hair had popped loose and was now 
tangled painfully with the chain. The people directly in front of the escape 
artist -- no more than six feet away from him -- began to get worried looks on 
their formerly festive, curious faces. Things got quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape artist fell to the ground and went into a series of contortions. He 
convulsed as if his tongue was caught in an electrical outlet. You could hear 
the deep hiss of his breathing; and you could hear the gasps of wonder from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in the front row had to look away as he writhed before them, sweat 
and dried grass and agony turning his face into a mask of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 He jerked himself to his knees, then labored upright again. By standing on his 
left foot and raising his right knee as high as he could against the 
unforgiving chains, he managed to work one small loop of chain loose from his 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 10 minutes he tried to get his right foot through that loop and 
into freedom. He shook. He fell to his back. He raised his ankle to his ear. 
Finally, the foot slipped through and the crowd exploded into the applause of 
blessed relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this only freed him from the right knee down, so he had to do all 
of that again in order to get his right knee though the loop. He did. Then, the 
whole process began again as he worked free his left ankle, then knee. He stood 
upright again, breathing very hard, the color in his face even worse from the 
exertion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just to show you," he wheezed, "that you can escape anything in life 
if you can stay calm and keep breathing. Just so you know, if a person stays 
tied up like this for very long -- he dies. There, that's my positive-thinking 
message for the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone near the back of the crowd turned to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not leave now," the escape artist ordered. "You cannot leave." The 
reluctant witness stopped and obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 With his crotch unleashed and his legs fully liberated, the escape artist 
could arch his back and jackknife himself forward at the waist. Through several 
repetitions of this movement -- all done against the strictures of the 
straitjacket -- he managed finally to twist himself into such an angle that, 
when he let out what seemed to be all of his precious breath and leaned over, 
the layers of chains simply slid up his back, over his shoulders and to the 
ground, untouched padlocks and all. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd went crazy. There stood the hero, breathing heavily, eyes bulging, 
hair matted to his face, announcing that the straitjacket, in the opinion of 
experts, is much harder to escape than proletarian chains. It took him 10 
minutes, a contortive eternity, to prove this.  
</P>
<P>
 When he finally flung his canvas prison -- still fastened -- to the ground, 
the audience surged around him, clapping, smiling, breathing its own collective 
sigh of wonder. When you see someone bound, it's impossible not to feel that 
way yourself. Someone put a $100 bill in the escape artist's hat, shook his 
head without saying a word and walked off. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape artist bowed once more to the departing crowd, then collected his 
chains and straitjacket, the tools of his odd trade. He shook back his hair, 
posed for some pictures with fans, signed a few autographs. Then he slung the 
gear over his shoulder and disappeared into the throng, completing his escape. 
</P>
<P>
 He was spring itself.

3-HOUR-TOUR: WALKING YOUR DOGS OFF; PETERS CANYON PARK: A PLACE FOR PEOPLE OR 
PETS TO RUFF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Spanish called it Frog Canyon, or actually Canon de las Ranas, and you can 
still hear why. Then it was Golf Canyon, because it's where the sport was first 
played in Orange County, back in 1899. That's also about the time James Peters 
lived there, and in the barley farmer's honor, today the area is known as 
Peters Canyon Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 We knew we were heading for horse country, only we didn't have a horse. And so 
it was that my wife and I set out for a walk and picnic with our dogs, 
Hephzibah and Boney. 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 to noon: First stop was Mattern Meat & Sausage, where we planned to pick 
up sandwiches. The line was literally out the door when we showed up. We took a 
number and discovered a cornucopia of European delights. 
</P>
<P>
 We picked up a bottle of Hungarian wine rated five puttonyos -- not because it 
would necessarily go with our sandwiches but because you just don't run into 
five- puttonyo wine every day. Nearby were matra gogosari-lecho -- red peppers 
in tomato sauce -- and from Germany, fried herrings in mushroom sauce and 
kipper fillets in brine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the self-service freezer, specials included jaternice and hurka . 
</P>
<P>
 The former is Polish liver sausage with onions; the latter is Hungarian liver 
sausage with rice. In the bakery section were Baltic loaves (black rye, $2.25) 
and kommis (light rye, $2.35), while the deli offered cervelat (like summer 
sausage, $5.19 per pound), Toscana (Italian salami, $6.05) and lachschenken 
(raw cured pork loin, $7.99). 
</P>
<P>
 Order two half sandwiches and they'll charge you for one whole ($2.65). I had 
half with Hungarian head cheese (it was orange with paprika) and half with 
blood tongue. My wife had roast beef on rye with Swiss cheese, but it was 
anything but mundane: Mattern's shredded lettuce and mustard-and-mayonnaise 
"secret sauce" spruce up any sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 12:30: We spotted the trademark white horse on the roof and thought 
we'd quickly stop in for a couple of dog bones at the Feed Barn. Once inside, 
we found it hard to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny cowboy boots for infants start at $25; on hand were Size 2, but, said 
owner Norma Gustafson, they "start at aught." Children's videos included 
"National Velvet"; among kids' books were "Cowboy Dreams" and "The Girl Who 
Loved Wild Horses." Adults will appreciate "Cowboy Gear: A Photographic 
Portrayal of the Early Cowboys and Their Equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop carries Western clothes and all manner of bits and bridles, stirrups 
and snazzy leather and suede saddles. There are water-snake boots for as little 
as $50, but also ostrich boots for $750. "They're a special kind of ostrich," 
noted Norma's husband, Curly. "Pointed toe, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Large dog bones are available by the barrel ($1.50 a pound). We purchased two 
bones. (We found no treats to bring home for our kitty, Nightmare.) At the 
register were cassette tapes by Sons of the San Joaquin and "Waddie Mitchell, 
Buckaroo Poet." "Those are real true Western," Norma said.  
</P>
<P>
 12:30 to 2: Just inside the entrance to Peters Canyon Regional Park were an 
"Equestrian Parking Only" sign and watering trough. Boney and Hephzibah were 
not offended. 
</P>
<P>
 A bulletin board compared Africanized honey bees to their European 
counterparts. "Notice the family resemblance?" it asked. "The bees are so 
similar that only experts can tell them apart." The board also offered advice 
on rattlesnakes: Be cautious around shaded areas; if encountered, give a 
rattlesnake distance and "respect." 
</P>
<P>
 We started along the Lake View Trail. We paused at an observation bench that 
looked out across a field of purple flowers to the reservoir, along the shores 
of which herons and egrets can be spotted. Before reaching the eucalyptus 
groves at the park's southern end, we turned up the East Ridge View Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the ridge, with the reservoir behind us, we were rewarded with 
views of carefully landscaped Jamboree Road and the marching condos of suburbia 
on one side, the rolling lawns of equestrian estates on the other, the Tustin 
Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station hangars before us, and beyond, the 
buildings of Newport Center and Catalina Island, huge as day. 
</P>
<P>
 We came back down the hill and enjoyed our picnic on a bench beneath a shady 
pine. It having rained recently, the dogs got duly muddy and were all the more 
blissful for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does this outing include an auto wash?" my wife asked. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:30: It didn't. But what it did include was a stop at Joy Self Dog Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding both the backaches and clogged drains that often result at home, 
patrons at the "shampooch" are provided with apron, shampoo, towel, brush and 
comb, and raised tubs to put the dogs in. 
</P>
<P>
 A medium dog costs $8.99, with $2 off for the second dog; large dogs are 
$10.99, cats and small dogs $6.99. Grooming is limited to 30 minutes, blow 
dryer use to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hephzibah and Boney were each clipped into a leash called a "noose." (No doubt 
because that's how the dogs view it!) By simul-bathing the dogs, we were 
finished in under half an hour. Boney, who basically has a permanent flattop, 
looked fastidious as ever. Hephzibah, who has longer hair and went in looking 
like Pig Pen, came out decidedly bouffant. 3-Hour Tour

U.N. INSPECTORS ARRIVE TO CHECK KOREAN A-PLANT

 U.N. nuclear inspectors arrived at North Korea's nuclear complex north of the 
capital, Pyongyang, and started work at one of the plants, the U.N.'s nuclear 
safeguards agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seoul, South Korea's foreign minister, Han Sung Joo, urged North Korea to 
ease international tensions by cooperating with the U.N. nuclear inspectors, 
who want to check a reactor refueling operation for evidence of atomic weapons 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said he was 
unable to confirm whether the three-member team had visited a nuclear reactor 
at the complex in Yongbyon, which some reports have said Pyongyang has begun 
refueling in defiance of the atomic agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western governments and intelligence agencies believe that North Korea 
already possesses a crude nuclear device. Pyongyang has denied this.

MONTANA GOVERNOR DELIVERS GRADUATION ADDRESS -- FOR ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't easy, but Gov. Marc Racicot delivered his commencement address as 
promised. And the graduating class of one appreciated what the governor went 
through to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted someone special to come to my graduation," said 14-year-old 
Cory Rieber, an eighth-grader at Reichle School. "He was pretty much my only 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad weather forced Racicot to make the 100-mile trip from Helena by car 
instead of plane. The last stretch took him over a muddy country road, past men 
in fields setting irrigation pipes, a feedlot full of yearling cattle and a 
yard filled with last year's hay crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen is a ranching community in southwestern Montana. About 60 people -- and 
all 17 students at the two-room school -- turned out to hear the governor on 
Tuesday. The school has children in kindergarten through eighth grade.

MAN LOSES BOTH LEGS IN SEPARATE TRAIN ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A train severed the left leg of a man who was lying on the tracks, just a 
short distance from where the man lost his right leg in a similar accident 
eight years ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry R. Mills had his left leg draped over the rail as he lay on the 
crossties outside the rails on Monday.The engineer saw him and tried to stop, 
said Rick Harris, a Norfolk Southern railroad spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday's accident was very near the same location in which the other leg was 
cut off," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, 32, reportedly had been drinking heavily both times he was hit, 
Assistant Police Chief David Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills was in stable condition Wednesday at a medical center in Russellville.

LAW PROTECTS BREAST-FEEDING OPENLY IN N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a crime to try to prevent a mother from breast-feeding in public under a 
civil rights measure signed Wednesday that gives New York the toughest such law 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows nursing in malls, restaurants and other public places, even if 
the breast and nipple are exposed. It imposes fines up to $5,000 or prison 
sentences up to five years for anyone who illegally prevents breast-feeding in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 It gives mothers the strongest protection in the country, said Elizabeth 
Baldwin, a lawyer with La Leche League, a group that promotes breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if anyone bothers us, we can say, 'Listen, we are protected by law here; 
you have no right to infringe on what's happening between me and my child,' " 
said Liza Habiby, who says she was ordered out of a mall in suburban Albany 
last year for breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York law says: "The breast-feeding of a baby is an important and basic 
act of nature which must be encouraged in the interests of maternal and child 
health and family values." 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon general recommends breast-feeding during a baby's first year. 
Studies show that it reduces chances of sudden death syndrome, childhood 
cancer, infectious disease and other potentially deadly problems. It also 
reduces a mother's chance of developing breast and other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Museums in Houston and Ohio this year asked women to leave because they were 
nursing children. The Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio later apologized to the 
woman and now allows nursing in exhibit rooms if done discreetly. The Houston 
Museum of Natural Science offered no such apology. 
</P>
<P>
 New York in 1984 became the first state to protect nursing in public by 
amending its indecent exposure law to exempt breast-feeding, said Baldwin, a 
Miami lawyer. The new law gives women even more protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida last year passed a law that allows mothers to breast-feed in public 
without threat of being arrested for lewdness, but it does not impose 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Story, the manager at Latham Circle Mall, said Habiby was asked to cover 
up but was not forced to leave. She said women always have been welcome to 
breast-feed at the mall, but were asked to cover up if other customers 
complained. Story said the mall would comply with the law, which takes effect 
June 17.

ALFRED NIER; HELPED BUILD ATOM BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alfred O.C. Nier, a physicist who helped to develop the atomic bomb, died 
Monday after an automobile accident. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Nier, who maintained throughout his life that using the bomb was appropriate 
to stop World War II and save American lives, was asked by physicist Enrico 
Fermi in 1940 to identify the best type of uranium to sustain slow-neutron 
fission. He isolated U-235 in his basement workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Nier officially began working on the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tenn., in 
1943. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the war years, he spent most of his life in Minneapolis-St. Paul, 
Minn., where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned three college degrees from the University of Minnesota and taught 
and did research there until his death.

LEN BEDSOW; FORCE BEHIND ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Len Bedsow, the controversial first executive director of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center and former general manager of the Los Angeles Civic 
Light Opera Assn., has died. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow died Saturday in Port St. Lucie, Fla., of complications from a stroke, 
his friend and former light opera association publicist Tim Choy said in Los 
Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bedsow retired more than a year before the Orange County center 
opened in the fall of 1986, he was credited with building the facility. He 
hired acousticians and supervised architects and contractors, raised millions 
of dollars and courted performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in with a list of what I wanted to do, a bible of my intentions," the 
former theatrical producer told The Times in 1986. "I wanted to use everything 
I had learned in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 In getting the job done, Bedsow stepped on toes. One of the continuing 
brouhahas involved who was to occupy the glittery new stage. He was determined 
to prevent the facility from becoming an expensive community theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perlman. Stern. Ashkenazy. Galway. I wanted biggies. Biggies!" Bedsow said 
after he retired. "This place was not built for the Pacific Symphony. It was 
not being built to be a facility for less-than-world-class organizations, and 
that's what the local groups are." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow was 67 when he left, and said he had always planned to retire before 
the center opened, citing his age, health and the job stress. Criticism from 
community groups and a sexual harassment suit filed by a secretary in 1984 did 
not make him want to stay on. He branded the suit "an outright lie," and it was 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought up a New Yorker, Bedsow wanted to act. But World War II intervened, 
and he joined the Army and became a liaison to variety shows touring the front. 
After Paris was liberated, he helped produce musicals for the Army there. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning home, Bedsow became a stage manager and then a producer on Broadway, 
working on such shows as "Sophie," "A Hatful of Rain" and "Dear Barbarians." He 
also ran Samlen Productions, producing the Milliken Breakfast Shows from 1956 
to 1961 and industrial shows for major companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1965 as director of operations 
and from 1974 until he took early retirement in 1980 served as the 
organization's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles County Music 
Center, Bedsow supervised the presentation of the American premiere of "Evita" 
and other major shows such as "Gigi," "Mack and Mabel," "Hello, Dolly!" "Mame," 
"Cabaret" and "Company." He staged many of them in San Francisco as well as Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow also helped to found the Civic Light Opera Musical Theatre Workshop in 
1967 and supervised its administration for 10 years, training hundreds of 
musical theater performers. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Jane, and daughter, Susan Bedsow-Horgan, executive 
producer of the television soap opera "One Life to Live."

NUGGETS DON'T REALIZE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the house guest who won't leave, the Denver Nuggets keep hanging around 
the NBA playoffs, making life miserable for the established teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we know we're not supposed to be doing this," Nuggets captain 
Reggie Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's youngest team, which shocked Seattle in the first round, beat the 
Utah Jazz 109-101 in double overtime Tuesday night, reducing Utah's lead in the 
best-of-7 Western Conference semifinals to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 6 is tonight in Denver. A seventh game, if necessary, would be in Salt 
Lake City on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets were never supposed to get this far, but they keep swimming 
upstream against raging current. Facing a must-win situation five times in the 
playoffs, the Nuggets have won each time. 
</P>
<P>
 They trailed Seattle, the NBA's winningest team, 2-0 before rallying to win 
the final three games in the best-of-5 series, becoming the first No. 8 seed to 
beat a No. 1 seed since the NBA went to its current playoff format in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they fell behind Utah 3-0, only to stave off elimination by winning the 
last two. Having already shown a callous disregard for history, the Nuggets are 
aiming to become the first team in NBA history to win a series after trailing 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, the Nuggets posted their third overtime victory in 10 playoff 
games. Bryant Stith and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 22 points each, and Robert 
Pack and Brian Williams added 19 apiece. Dikembe Mutombo's seven blocks gave 
him 31 for the series, breaking Hakeem Olajuwon's record of 30 set last year 
against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent surge, Nuggets coach Dan Issel isn't ready to say the 
momentum has shifted away from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still ahead 3-2 and they still have an awfully good basketball team," 
Issel said. "I think there's a little more pressure on them at this point. But 
I'm not ready to say that we're the favorites to win the series." 
</P>
<P>
 Issel is ready to say that his team is the looser of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says that's because the Nuggets "don't have anything to lose. Nobody 
thinks we're going to win the championship, so there's no pressure on us. Teams 
like Utah and Seattle, they've been to the playoffs year after year. They talk 
about championships, and they feel the pressure that goes with those 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver believes it has other factors in its favor. Strategically, the presence 
of Mutombo has robbed the Jazz of their inside game, forcing Karl Malone to the 
perimeter. The Nuggets also appear the fresher team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think the longer the series goes, and the longer the games go, if we 
can keep the games close so that they have to keep their first-line players in, 
those are all advantages for us," Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah coach Jerry Sloan agrees with some of Issel's observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not any pressure on them," Sloan said. "Everybody in America wants 
them to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan said his team lost its composure, especially after Malone fouled out 
midway through the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played right into their hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone finished with 22 points after scoring only three in the first half. 
Frustrated by Mutombo's defense, Malone has hit just 14-of-38 shots (37 
percent) the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in our offense is based on Karl," Jazz forward David Benoit said. 
"When he went out, we just hoped someone would step up. No one did."

RODGERS: BROWN 'CANCER' TO ANGELS; BASEBALL: FORMER MANAGER SAYS MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED FIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers, his eyes watering, his voice choked with emotion, still had 
trouble believing Wednesday that he was standing behind a lecturn without a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been 24 hours since his firing as manager of the Angels, and still, he 
could not explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 So he came to one conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
 He was fired by Angel President Richard Brown, whom he accused of being a 
"cancer" in the organization. He's convinced Bill Bavasi, Angel general 
manager, was only following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think that Bill Bavasi had too much to do with my firing," 
Rodgers said. "I appreciate him being the front-man, that's commendable, but in 
my mind I don't think he had anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he says his confrontation with Brown during the Angels' last home 
stand might have triggered his dismissal. Rodgers was summoned for a private 
meeting to discuss comments that Brown heard Rodgers had made about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that I said that he didn't know anything about baseball," Rodgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I believed that," Rodgers said smiling, "I wouldn't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Bavasi vehemently denied the meeting had anything to do with 
Rodgers' firing, and sources close to Bavasi confirmed the firing was Bavasi's 
idea. Brown and chairman Jackie Autry approved the firing, and Gene Autry told 
Rodgers in a phone call Wednesday that he wasn't aware of the firing until 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a guy who's been through a tough, traumatic experience," Bavasi 
said, "and (Rodger's) entitled to make any comments that he deems appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what I told you (Tuesday) is the absolute truth. I know what happened. 
Rich knows what happened. The Autrys know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand by what I said, and it was totally my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just difficult for Rodgers to believe Bavasi, who was hired Jan. 12, 
would fire him this quickly. Yet, sources insist Bavasi was troubled by 
Rodgers' stubbornness, and was convinced they could not co-exist. Bavasi wanted 
to hire his own manager, and his only choice was Marcel Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lachemann had rejected the job, Bavasi said Wednesday, Rodgers would still 
be manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it might take days, if not weeks or months, to convince Rodgers that 
Brown was not behind the firing. Take a look at the track record since Brown 
has been president, Rodgers said, and you'll find his fingerprints on the 
departures of general managers Mike Port, Dan O'Brien and Whitey Herzog, and 
manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has been team president since Nov. 1 1990. Before that he had been the 
Angel legal counsel since 1981 and he has no baseball background. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still some kind of cancer here with the California Angels," Rodgers 
said, directing his comments directly toward Brown. "I think that's very 
obvious for someone who's been here for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization is not all bad. This organization is very salvageable. But 
there's a paranoia here. There's a fear of failure that has to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, 55, an original member of the Angels' expansion team, says Brown is 
threatened by those who played the game, and it has become quite apparent in 
the last nine months with O'Brien, Herzog and Rodgers all leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a paranoid person," Rodgers said, "you're threatened by everything 
and anything about you. There's something against people who played the game. 
'You're not as smart as the next person or you can't do the job as well.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't after anybody's job. I have trouble enough with my own job, which I 
don't have anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Although this was a news conference called by Rodgers at the Jolly Roger Inn 
in Anaheim, the Angels sent a club official to monitor Rodgers' remarks. When 
informed of Rodgers' comments, Brown refused to address them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who will be paid $600,000 this year and $600,000 in 1995 -- and is 
expected to earn $3 million to $5 million in his settlement involving the 
Angels' 1992 bus accident -- said he likely will sit out this season before 
considering another managerial job.

Professional Soccer League games for the team last season, to West Ham United 
of England's Premier Division for an undisclosed amount.Feuer, who had four 
shutouts and a 1.476 goals-against average, will be the first U.S. goalkeeper 
to join England's top level of soccer, the team said. The Salsa released 
midfielder Dale Ervine, a former indoor star who scored two goals in 18 starts

NHL PLAYOFFS; DEVILS STILL FEEL CONFIDENT, DESPITE BIG LOSS IN GAME 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't tell the New Jersey Devils they're not in the same class with the New 
York Rangers. Not after the first two games of their Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Rangers dominated the Devils Tuesday night, limiting them to 16 
shots in a 4-0 victory in Game 2 to even the best-of-7 series. But the Devils, 
who recorded a 4-3 double-overtime victory in Game 1, say the game wasn't as 
one-sided as people think. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will look at 4-0 and look at the shots and say we were not there at 
all," Devils coach Jacques Lemaire said Wednesday after the team's optional 
workout. "But one thing I know is if we would have scored, if (Bill) Guerin 
would have scored or we would have scored on 5-on-3, I know it would have been 
a different game." 
</P>
<P>
 The series moves to the Meadowlands Arena for Games 3 and 4 on Thursday and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sequences that still stick in Lemaire's mind from Game 2 both happened 
in the second period with the Rangers clinging to a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerin swept down the left boards and broke in alone only to be stopped on a 
great glove save by Rangers goalie Mike Richter. A few minutes later, New York 
withstood a 5-on-3 New Jersey power play, limiting the Devils to one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the failures and a great forechecking job by the Rangers, New Jersey 
was still in the game heading into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 However, New York put the game away with three goals in the opening 8:38 to 
post their seventh win in eight games with New Jersey this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Game 1 was a fluke for us, nor do I think it was a fluke for 
them to win Game 2," Devils forward Tom Chorske said. "We took it to them in 
Game 1 and they took it to us in Game 2. It's an evenly matched situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people forget the Devils only finished six points behind New York in the 
race for the best record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "To beat New York, we need the guys at their best," Lemaire said.

STOCKS RALLY FOR SECOND DAY, BUT DOLLAR STILL IN DOLDRUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar tumbled against major currencies Wednesday after the Federal 
Reserve Board's increase in interest rates failed to restore confidence in the 
U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But stocks, still basking in the afterglow of the Fed's tough anti-inflation 
moves, staged a second-day rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on short-term Treasury securities fell further, but the tumbling dollar 
pushed up long-term Treasury bond yields -- disappointing investors hoping for 
an opposite reaction to the central bank's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traders expected the dollar to gain after the Fed raised its discount 
rate on overnight loans to member banks to 3.5% from 3% and lifted the federal 
funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 4.25% from 3.75%. Higher rates 
usually bolster the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell instead, as traders concluded that the Fed probably won't 
raise rates again soon and that Tuesday's increase wasn't enough to warrant 
buying the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 1.658 German marks and 103.5 Japanese yen, 
down from 1.672 marks and 104.45 yen the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, blue chip stocks trailed a sharp broad-market surge that 
featured rebounds in recently battered technology, transport and utility 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended 12.28 points higher at 3,732.89, adding 
to Tuesday's 49-point gain. Market measures taken from a wider array of stocks 
also gained. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.60 to 250.73; 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.32 to 453.69. The Nasdaq composite 
index of mostly smaller companies surged 10.38 points to 721.90.  
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's gains were more dramatic on the broader market, where advancing 
Big Board stocks outnumbered declining ones by more than 2 to 1 and the trading 
pace was brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume on the NYSE floor came to 337.67 million shares, up from 311.68 million 
on Tuesday. The total helped the NYSE surpass the $1-trillion level in the 
value of trades so far in 1994. The exchange said it didn't reach that 
milestone last year until June 10, and that was the earliest ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the 30-year bond yield edged upward to close at 7.27% from 
Tuesday's 7.26%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1/16 
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities, meanwhile, ranged from 3/16 point to 
7/32 point higher, and intermediate maturities were 1/16 point to 1/4 point 
higher, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Banking stocks gained more ground as investors bet that rising short-term 
rates will enhance their balance sheets. The Big Board's list of active issues 
included Citicorp, up 3/4 to 39 5/8, and BankAmerica, up 1 to 48 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prominent among the technology winners was Lotus Development, which jumped 4 
3/16 to 55 15/16 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leading transport stocks were Conrail, up 2 1/2 to 53 1/4, and American 
Airlines parent AMR, up 1 5/8 to 55 3/8. Utility Public Service Enterprise 
gained 3/4 to 27 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors Chief Executive John Smith said he was concerned that the 
rise in interest rates will slow U.S. sales of cars and trucks. GM fell 1/4 to 
54 1/8; Chrysler dropped 1/4 to 46 1/2; Ford slipped 1/2 to 58 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Woolworth fell 2 to 15. It said its first-quarter U.S. revenue fell 4.8% and 
that foreign revenue, expressed in dollars, was off 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calgene gained Food and Drug Administration approval of its genetically 
engineered tomato, but analysts said the next big step will be winning consumer 
approval. Its stock rose 1/16 to 11 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chevron tumbled 1 3/4 to 86 3/8 after Dean Witter Reynolds reduced estimated 
earnings for the energy concern. 
</P>
<P>
 So-so sessions for the major foreign markets didn't deter U.S.-based buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index finished 86.59 points, or 3.78%, higher at 2,375.18. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index surged 431.94 points to end at 9,476.64. 
Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei closed up 19.20 points at 20,152.73. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, London's the Financial Times 100-share average ended at 3,116.5, 
down 7.7 points, while Germany's DAX-30 index rose 7.70 to 2,267.41. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities markets, gold, silver and oil prices closed higher.

INSIDE OUT: WHERE MEN CAN BE MEN AMONG KHAKIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some husbands hide out in the bathroom. But when Mr. Inside Out craves "me" 
time, he heads for his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's homey -- as closets go, we suppose. Still, that doesn't entirely explain 
the rapturous expression that comes over his face as he stands there, 
surrounded by khakis, white shirts and piles of dirty laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last night he was humming. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a closet, we began to wonder, or the pleasure dome of some twisted 
psychopath? Yes and no. "I can make a mess," he explained, "and no one will 
tell me to clean it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, so that's it. The closet-as-clubhouse. A tiny bunker -- off-limits to 
dames -- where snowy white crew socks and flannel shirts are safe from the 
clutches of cross-dressing wives and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 His stupid stuff never looked so tempting.

 Oh, Just Cave and Buy a Hideous Granny Dress Like the Rest of Us: Allure 
magazine Editor Linda Wells was in Los Angeles this week to size up local 
exercise and skin-care trends firsthand. Just going from room to room in her 
suite at the Hotel Bel-Air, she complained, was making her freshly exercised 
muscles ache. But she had praise for what she's seen so far: "People are 
getting away from exercise gimmicks. I noticed that workouts are safer, more 
down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
 All the energy that once went into gimmicks, she observed, seems to be going 
into skin care. "I just had a great treatment called 'Hunter's Retreat' at 
Burke Williams spa (in Santa Monica). First they rub you down with papaya and 
pineapple. Then they shoot you with jets of water. Then they scrub you with 
something that looks like a doormat -- only softer. It's really pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells may have mastered the rhythm of spa life here, but she confessed she's 
out of sync with L.A.'s dress code: "I feel like I bring all the wrong things. 
You have to look easygoing here and that's not a posture I, as a New Yorker, am 
good at."

 Gee, Your Hair Smells Good: Students at Orange High School have discovered 
that a little cherry-flavored Kool-Aid, diluted slightly, turns blond hair a 
nice shade of pinkish red.  
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Jennifer Saunders said she got the green light to go pink 
only after a hairdresser assured Mom that the color would wash out, like food 
coloring. Unlike a classmate who applied orange-flavored Kool-Aid to brunette 
hair (yech), Jennifer's experiment was a success: "It lasted for three days and 
it made my hair smell like cherries." Even better, the whole thing cost 24 
cents.

 Shop Like a Parisian: We love Paris in the springtime. (Even though we've only 
really been there in the winter.) So we lingered over a slender but 
information-packed map book titled "Shopwalks Paris," by Jane Magidson and 
Susan Harney, and daydreamed.  
</P>
<P>
 Magidson, a former fashion editor, wrote a similar guide nearly 10 years ago 
and said the city has changed quite a bit in the meantime: "A section called 
Marais has emerged as the hottest, most interesting area. It's filled with very 
cutting-edge but accessible shops." It's also the old Jewish section, so if you 
want a bagel instead of a baguette, she recommends Jo Goldenberg on the Rue des 
Rosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 And where do those fabulously chic Frenchwomen shop? "Oh," Magidson squealed, 
"I have to look at my guide!" Try Boutique Corinne Sarrut on Rue du 
Pre-aux-Clercs, "a little winding back street lined with shops carrying some of 
the freshest fashion in Paris"; Boutique Lindblad for accessories, and Mouton a 
5 Pattes for discounts, "Paris' answer to Loehmann's, though on a much smaller 
scale." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shopwalks" is available at California Map & Travel Center in Santa Monica, 
Traveler's Bookcase in L.A., Geographia in Burbank or by sending $6.95 
(includes postage and handling) to Shopwalks, P.O. Box 20023-DHCC, New York, 
N.Y. 10017.

sneakers untied, these days youthful hipsters are wearing their sneakers laced 
upside down. We spotted this irreverent-but-still-neat look on a recent trip to 
the Magic Kingdom, where trend-watching helps pass the time in Line Land -- er, 
Toon Town. 
</P>
<P>
 When done correctly, the bow ends up close to the toes. This is a tedious 
procedure best left to girls whose time is not yet taken up by boys, household 
chores or saving the planet. Counts us out.

 Objects of Their Affection: The two most important clients in the history of 
Cartier were the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In the recently published "Made 
by Cartier," authors Franco Cologni and Ettore Mocchette write rather 
diplomatically that the pair, "more than the sovereigns even, had license to 
live in luxury, in the almost exclusive cult of beauty, in a sort of elegant 
idleness suspended like a dream above the harshest reality of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 After the duchess's death, Cartier bought back several of these pieces at 
auction -- part of the company's effort to create a collection of Cartier 
decorative art pieces. The duchess's lorgnette with a tiger-shaped handle, Cole 
Porter's cuff links and Barbara Hutton's canary diamond tiger brooch are part 
of the mouth-watering L'Art de Cartier exhibit at the Rodeo Drive store now 
through May 28. Why can't we be suspended like a dream above the harsh reality 
of our time? Uh?

 Stylishly Somber: Speaking of people who transcend social convention, we were 
fascinated by a recent report on the shopping habits of Kurt Cobain's widow, 
singer Courtney Love. The New York Times reports that Love was "stocking up" on 
frocks at designer Anna Sui's New York store this past weekend. Appearing at a 
dinner with Sui and fellow grunge aficionado Marc Jacobs that evening, Love 
wore a black satin slip dress and a hat Jacobs described to the paper as a 
"crocheted Dickens bonnet."

 Oxnard claims to harvest 23% of California's strawberries, so it's fitting 
that the town folk will celebrate their harvest with the annual California 
Strawberry Festival this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry delights range from crepes and blintzes to chocolate-dipped berries 
and strawberry cheesecake on a stick.For strawberry lovers who can't shove 
enough of 'em down their throats, there are competitions such as the Strawberry 
Shortcake Eating Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 If you start to see too much red, there are also three stages full of 
performers, including Big Mountain, Three Dog Night, Doug Kershaw and the 
Temptations, along with children's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who overload on calories, there's a 10K race and non-competitive 
two-mile Family Dash at 8 a.m. Sunday. The festival is 10 a.m.-6:30 p.m. 
Saturday-Sunday at Strawberry Meadows of College Park, 3250 S. Rose Ave. $5; 
children 2-12 and seniors, $3. Information: (805) 444-5544. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

CLUB REVIEW; THE MUSIC IS WHERE IT'S AT AT SPACIOUS JACKS SUGAR SHACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jacks Sugar Shack is anything but a shack. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacious West L.A. nightclub resembles the recreation deck of the Love 
Boat, with ample aloha kitsch adorning the 300-capacity venue.Although one 
bartender says Jacks' proprietors "try to keep the place as tacky as possible" 
-- which explains the plastic waterfall adjacent to the bar area -- in reality, 
the club is an airy and comfortable venue for live music. Jacks may have a 
separate billiard room, an outdoor patio, a large bar, dining and arcade area, 
but more often than not, the action takes place in the modest performance room. 
Last Saturday's Thelonius Monster show included stage diving by Flea, as well 
as impromptu jamming by various members of the Circle Jerks, Firehose and Porno 
for Pyros.  
</P>
<P>
 An "anything goes" feeling at Jacks is predicated by the variety of live music 
currently offered at the club. From local alternative acts on Wednesdays to 
upcoming shows by the grungy Supersuckers and honky-tonker Junior Brown (who 
performs there Friday and Saturday), Jacks appears to be making an effort to 
keep the music selection eclectic. And if you should miss a show, the jukebox 
-- which is sandwiched between "The Creature From the Black Lagoon" and 
"Indiana Jones" video games -- is well-stocked regularly with CD compilations 
from the bands passing through.

 'TIL THEY MEET AGAIN: The Brea City Council skipped its twice-monthly meeting 
Tuesday night. Reason: Lack of an agenda. "Why meet just to meet?" Assistant 
City Manager Tim O'Donnell says. Actually, officials in this city, battered by 
recent political charges and countercharges, have discussed switching to 
monthly meetings to save money. . . . But not everyone is happy about that. 
Resident Bill Vega complains it would shortchange the public and be a "cover-up 
of the city's corruption."

 BEE KILLERS: The local Vector Control people have decided on their defense 
when the Africanized honeybees -- the killer bees -- reach Orange County at the 
end of the year. They're setting up five, 50-gallon pressurized spray units on 
pickup trucks, filled with a soaplike material that kills the bees. . . . "The 
idea is to destroy the swarm before it becomes a colony," says Vector Control's 
Fred Beams. "That's when they're dangerous." The Vector Control board will 
choose a contractor today.

 TEACHER FIRST: Newport Beach forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz says he loved 
the recent New Yorker magazine profile of him. But while the magazine notes 
he's best known for high-profile murder cases -- he did convince a jury that 
Jeffrey Dahmer was sane -- Dietz says most of his work now is teaching 
companies how to avert workplace violence. Included: an HBO documentary on the 
subject. . . . Adds Dietz: "It's so much more rewarding to prevent these 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 WORLD SERIES VET: Maybe the pennant-hungry Autrys hired pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann as the new manager of the California Angels (C1) because he knows 
what winning a World Series feels like. Lachemann, 52, was a pitcher for the 
USC Trojan team that won the 1961 College World Series. . . . Before he became 
a coach -- nine years with the Angels -- Lachemann did pitch a little in the 
majors: He was 7-4 in an abbreviated stint with the Oakland A's.

LEN BEDSOW; FORCE BEHIND ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Len Bedsow, the controversial first executive director of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center and former general manager of the Los Angeles Civic 
Light Opera Assn., has died. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow died Saturday in Port St. Lucie, Fla., of complications from a stroke, 
his friend and former light opera association publicist Tim Choy said in Los 
Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bedsow retired more than a year before the Orange County center 
opened in the fall of 1986, he was credited with building the facility. He 
hired acousticians and supervised architects and contractors, raised millions 
of dollars and courted performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in with a list of what I wanted to do, a bible of my intentions," the 
former theatrical producer told The Times in 1986. "I wanted to use everything 
I had learned in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 In getting the job done, Bedsow stepped on toes. One of the continuing 
brouhahas involved who was to occupy the glittery new stage. He was determined 
to prevent the facility from becoming an expensive community theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perlman. Stern. Ashkenazy. Galway. I wanted biggies. Biggies!" Bedsow said 
after he retired. "This place was not built for the Pacific Symphony. It was 
not being built to be a facility for less-than-world-class organizations, and 
that's what the local groups are." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Lawrence, chief architect of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
said in 1986 that Bedsow "had a wonderful sense of showmanship. In a certain 
sense, that kept the momentum up with the fund raising." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow "gave us the strategic direction to do what we did and how we did it," 
Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow was 67 when he left, and said he had always planned to retire before 
the center opened, citing his age, health and the job stress. Criticism from 
community groups and a sexual harassment suit filed by a secretary in 1984 did 
not make him want to stay on. He branded the suit "an outright lie," and it was 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought up a New Yorker, Bedsow wanted to act. But World War II intervened, 
and he joined the Army and became a liaison to variety shows touring the front. 
After Paris was liberated, he helped produce musicals for the Army there. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning home, Bedsow became a stage manager and then a producer on Broadway, 
working on such shows as "Sophie," "A Hatful of Rain" and "Dear Barbarians." He 
also ran Samlen Productions, producing the Milliken Breakfast Shows from 1956 
to 1961 and industrial shows for major companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1965 as director of operations 
and from 1974 until he took early retirement in 1980 served as the 
organization's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles County Music 
Center, Bedsow supervised the presentation of the American premiere of "Evita" 
and other major shows such as "Gigi," "Mack and Mabel," "Hello, Dolly!" "Mame," 
"Cabaret" and "Company." He staged many of them in San Francisco as well as Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsow also helped to found the Civic Light Opera Musical Theatre Workshop in 
1967.  
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Jane, and daughter, Susan Bedsow-Horgan, executive 
producer of the television soap opera "One Life to Live."

UFW LEADING IN OXNARD ELECTION; LABOR: AT STAKE IS RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF 
OF 600 PRODUCE WORKERS. BALLOTING IS THE UNION'S FIRST IN THE COUNTY IN YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Farm Workers union led Wednesday in an election to represent more 
than 600 workers at an Oxnard produce company, but 87 challenged ballots could 
ultimately decide the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at Ocean View Produce Co., a subsidiary of the Westlake Village-based 
Dole Food Co., voted 275 to 231 in favor of union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 87 contested ballots, 28 were cast by workers who did not appear on a 
list of employees eligible to vote and 59 were cast by farm labor contractor 
employees who union officials contend have no right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically it could take a month to resolve these issues," said Mauricio 
Nuno, an agent for the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, which 
conducted the election. "It's too close to call a winner. With those 87 votes, 
it could go either way." 
</P>
<P>
 If the UFW wins at the polls, the union would be certified to negotiate a 
contract on behalf of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The election, the first for the UFW in Ventura County since the early 1990s, 
was also the first test statewide of the union's renewed commitment to the 
blood-and-guts work of organizing in the fields, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty, union officials said Wednesday night they are 
confident their lead will hold up, resulting in a victory that would 
demonstrate the union's re-emerging strength in Ventura County and across the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've won," said UFW Secretary-Treasurer David Martinez, surrounded by a sea 
of red-clad union supporters waving red-and-black banners emblazoned with the 
UFW's trademark Aztec eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a watershed election," Martinez said. "Everybody has been looking at 
this as the real test of whether farm workers can again galvanize behind this 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials said it's too early to tell how the election will turn 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can say one way or another at this point," Dole spokesman 
Tom Pernice said. "The number of unresolved challenged ballots is sufficient to 
offset the outcome of the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Balloting began at 7 a.m. in the middle of a strawberry field blanketed with 
mist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laborers, wrapped in thick clothing and shielded by bandannas, formed a 
single-file line as they waited to enter four makeshift voting booths hauled by 
state election officials from one field to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Elections were held across the Oxnard Plain at six fields managed by Ocean 
View Produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Barred by state law from from congregating at the polls, UFW organizers and 
company officials monitored the election from the roadside. They followed each 
other from one field to another, with the cars of UFW supporters sporting 
pro-union bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the rutted roads leading into one field, an anti-union sign was posted 
on a fence. Company officials wore buttons bearing the same insignia. But 
despite efforts to thwart the union drive, farm workers and organizers 
expressed confidence early that the effort would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to win," farm worker Ricardo Garcia predicted in the morning. 
"The workers are strong and together behind this movement." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the UFW launched a statewide campaign to resume organizing efforts 
in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, thousands of union members and supporters completed a 24-day, 
340-mile pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento. The march followed an 
announcement that the union planned to shift its strategy, putting organizers 
back in the fields to enlist new members and push for new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, more than 3,000 farm workers and their advocates marched from Ventura 
to Oxnard recently to support the new campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in the 1980s, the UFW had more than 4,000 members in Ventura 
County and had negotiated contracts with more than two dozen growers. Since 
then, however, UFW membership locally has dropped to only a few hundred workers 
and the union now has only two contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've kept going but it's been so hard in the last 10 years," said Martinez, 
eating sweet bread and sipping hot chocolate while monitoring the election. 
"But now we're moving forward. The workers are fed up with the conditions they 
are forced to endure." 
</P>
<P>
 UFW representatives say the organizing drive was sparked by the dismissal of 
two Oxnard celery harvesters, who contend they were fired for engaging in union 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers say they began campaigning for the union after the company lowered 
the price it paid per box of celery. They gathered enough signatures -- more 
than half of the 600 farm workers at Ocean View -- to force the union election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dole officials said the two workers were let go because they violated company 
rules, but refused to elaborate. Also, Dole officials said they support the 
workers' right to hold a union election.  
</P>
<P>
 "The company is complying with state and federal laws and supportive of the 
workers' right to a free and fair election," Pernice said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last election site, in the shadow of the towering Edison power plant 
late Wednesday afternoon, more than 60 workers lined up to vote. In the middle 
of a freshly furrowed field, the ballots were hand-counted as anxious 
supporters of the company and the UFW looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 When the results were known and the UFW had maintained its early lead, union 
supporters began waving their banners and flags and shouting pro-union slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we want?" a worker asked in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "A contract," the others responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "When do we want it?" he asked again.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now!" they shouted back.

blasted the sale of Pruner Ambulance Co. on Wednesday, saying the owners misled 
the county into extending their contract without revealing plans to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the county was blindsided," said Ken Maffei, president of the 
county firefighters' union. "Pruner made some commitments and got the county to 
extend the contract and now they are backing out." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner's announcement of the sale came just a week after the county Board of 
Supervisors agreed to renew the company's contract for two years, despite past 
protests from county and Ventura city firefighters who had asked for a chance 
to bid on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner serves all of the county except Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county is responsible for renewing ambulance contracts, 
individual cities may choose to get out of them at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council is studying the possibility of switching from Pruner 
to ambulance service provided by firefighters. Ventura Fire Capt. Rod Smith 
said the firefighters' request might have been accepted by the city if Pruner 
had told city and county leaders of its intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been interesting if the council and the board members had known 
about" the sale, Smith said. "Who knows what could have been worked out?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Councilman Jim Monahan, a longtime supporter of firefighter 
ambulance service, said the sale of Pruner heightens the appeal of switching to 
firefighter service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like being held hostage by something beyond our control," Monahan 
said of the Pruner sale. "Especially since we have the expertise we need right 
here within our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said she is concerned that Pruner did not tell the 
county of its plans to sell the company to CareLine, the second-largest 
ambulance company in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little bit funny about it," VanderKolk said. "I think it's all 
perfectly legal, but I don't know if they were dealing on the up and up." 
</P>
<P>
 But VanderKolk added that she would not oppose the sale, as long as CareLine 
upholds a contract provision for Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal with the county, Pruner agreed to provide an ambulance in 
Oak Park, a community that has long complained about slow response times. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Langdale, a spokesman for the Irvine-based CareLine, said the Oak Park 
ambulance and all other promises made by Pruner will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our basic goals is to improve the quality of service," said Langdale, 
CareLine's director of financial planning. "We want to be a good, strong 
presence in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Langdale said the negotiations were kept confidential until they were 
completed because of their sensitivity.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks residents Don and Jackie Pruner founded Pruner Ambulance Co. in 
1963 with a single ambulance they parked in their driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pruner contingent in Ventura County now includes 55 paramedics and 19 
emergency medical technicians. Thirteen ambulances operate throughout the 
county during the day and 12 at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen E. Frank, president of Ojai Ambulance, said it is too soon to tell 
what effect the sale of Pruner will have on his tiny company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, companies the size of Ojai Ambulance are becoming harder and harder 
to maintain," said Frank, whose business owns two ambulances. "Right now it's 
still unclear what the sale of Pruner means for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner spokesman Steve Murphy said the sale of the company will give it a leg 
up in gaining access to cutting-edge technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great opportunity," Murphy said. "We're just going to try to be as 
progressive as we can into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, CareLine plans to install a state-of-the-art, computer-aided 
dispatch system similar to those used by police departments throughout the 
county, Langdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This system will give us the ability to be faster and more efficient in 
responding to calls," Langdale said. "It should have a positive impact 
throughout our service area." 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said while the new dispatch system might improve Pruner's response 
times, the firefighters still are better equipped to handle emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how may radios they buy, or how many bells and whistles they put on 
their ambulances, the fact is that we have 30 stations throughout the county," 
Maffei said. "They are never going to be able to put an ambulance everywhere we 
have a fire station." 
</P>
<P>
 Langdale said CareLine plans to aggressively fight efforts by firefighters to 
gain control of paramedic and ambulance services now provided by Pruner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fire Department is making an argument that is emotional and political," 
Langdale said. "From a practical, economic standpoint they can't win, because 
while we are a publicly held company responsible to our shareholders to be as 
profitable and efficient as possible, the firefighters are not responsible to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maffei said CareLine's emphasis on efficiency will harm residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "CareLine is here to make a profit and they are responsible to their 
shareholders," Maffei said. "We are here to provide a service. and we are 
responsible to the residents of this community." 
</P>
<P>
 CareLine owns subsidiaries in California, Alabama, Colorado, Georgia and 
Massachusetts. The company's California service area includes Los Angeles, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Health Care Agency Director Phillipp Wessels, who is reviewing 
CareLine's financial information, said he has received positive feedback from 
other counties served by CareLine.

FILLMORE FESTIVAL GETS EXTRA SUPPORT; CELEBRATION: EARLY CALIFORNIA DAYS, A 
TRADITION SINCE 1910, IS FIRST BIG EVENT SINCE TOWN WAS HIT HARD BY THE QUAKE. 
</P>

 The carnival rides that Wednesday were soaked in a driving rain, this 
afternoon will spin, twirl and light up the sky in downtown Fillmore as one of 
the oldest parties in Ventura County kicks off. 
</P>
<P>
 The cool, wet weather was expected to clear out by this weekend in time for 
the Early California Days Festival, a four-day celebration that this year 
promises to be more cherished than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first big activity the city has had since the earthquake," said 
Hank Carrillo, executive director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce, which is 
sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an awful lot of people -- in and outside the area -- who are 
supporting Fillmore to the fullest because of what happened," Carrillo said. 
"It's very heartwarming to know that people haven't forgotten and that they 
still care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the earthquake was four months ago, they still remember." 
</P>
<P>
 The Early California Days Festival, which has been celebrated in Fillmore 
since 1910, begins this afternoon with the opening of the carnival and midway 
at Santa Clara and Mountain View streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the one time during the year when most of the nonprofit organizations 
and service clubs have an opportunity to raise funds for their projects," 
Carrillo said. "There are no outside vendors, so all the money raised will 
benefit local causes." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the carnival and midway today is free. It will open at 3 p.m. and 
close at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, when gates open at 11 a.m. and close at 10 p.m., the admission 
will be $1. Admission also will cost $1 on Saturday, but it will be free on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen groups and clubs will staff various booths along a midway that will 
feature food, games and carnival rides. For many of the organizations, it is 
the largest single fund-raiser of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a bingo booth that's pretty successful every year," said Conrad 
Villegas, vice president of the Fillmore Lions Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give prizes donated by local merchants and all the money is collected and 
it goes toward a fund to help the blind," Villegas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the four-day festival is Saturday morning, when 15 hot-air 
balloons take to the skies and the parade steps off at the corner of 2nd and 
Central streets at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got close to 100 entries, from car clubs and high school bands to 
marching groups and the old-time fiddlers," Carrillo said. "The Shriners will 
be there with their little cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade route winds south on Central to Sespe Avenue and then heads west 
along Sespe to the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to go straight down Central to the park, but we had to change it 
because of the earthquake," Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours on the popular Hollywood Movie Train will be offered both Saturday and 
Sunday, with four rides each day at a cost of $12.50 for adults and $7.50 for 
children. The ride will be free for children under 4 years old who are 
accompanied by an adult. The train will head east to Piru before returning to 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the receipts from the train rides will benefit the Fillmore High 
School and Middle School marching bands, drill teams and flag teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo said the Early California Days Festival began before World War I as a 
celebration of the Old West. It coincides with the California Strawberry 
Festival, a relative newcomer at only 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event has been going on since 1910, and it's always been the third 
weekend in May," Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the strawberry festival started, somebody at the (Fillmore) chamber 
contacted them about the conflict, but they wouldn't change," he said. "So 
that's what happens." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Early California Days Festival, featuring carnival rides, game booths, 
hot-air balloon rides and food, opens at 3 p.m. today at the intersection of 
Santa Clara and Mountain View streets in Fillmore. Admission is free today, but 
the cost is $1 on Friday and Saturday. It will be free again Sunday, closing 
day.

RUSSO DENIES ABUSE IN TENSE DAY IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An affluent Westlake woman saw bites and scratches on her teen-age daughter's 
body but assumed the marks were caused by the family's dog, she testified 
Wednesday under intense cross-examination at her child-abuse trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe the dog might be doing it," 52-year-old Charlotte Russo said 
after being confronted on the witness stand with pictures of the girl's 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it true that you never asked where the marks came from because you put 
them on her?" Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Russo answered. "I didn't ask her where they came from, and I didn't 
make the marks on her arms." 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of many bitter exchanges Wednesday between the defendant and the 
prosecutor who wants to send her to prison for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding questions from the prosecution for the first time in two days of 
testimony, Russo admitted that she treated the girl differently from her six 
other children, often slapped the girl for talking back, would not let her 
attend eighth-grade graduation and considered the girl's school performance 
more important than her happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mother denied that she forced the girl to sleep in the back-yard 
racquetball court or routinely beat the girl for lying or doing poorly in her 
class work. 
</P>
<P>
 From the onset of the 2 1/2 hours of rancorous cross-examination, the 
prosecutor and the defendant often engaged in sharp exchanges.  
</P>
<P>
 It started with Corona's first question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever had acting lessons?" Corona asked Russo as defense attorney 
James M. Farley quickly objected. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. Campbell Jr. allowed the question to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Russo answered. 
</P>
<P>
 If she had not taken acting lessons, Corona followed up, then had she been 
coached by her husband, Richard, or anyone else on how to carry herself on the 
witness stand? 
</P>
<P>
 Corona noted that Russo had broken into tears during direct examination when 
recalling how she adopted the girl after watching a Jerry Lewis telethon 15 
years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Russo said she had not been coached to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley repeatedly interrupted with objections during Corona's 
cross-examination, saying at one point that the prosecutor was badgering his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo denied having anything to do with the decision in April of last year to 
lock the girl out of the family's main house and force her to sleep in a 
back-yard racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you want to avoid responsibility for your decisions?" Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley objected, and Campbell told Corona, "I believe you are getting 
argumentative. So why don't we just slow down and start over again?" 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Corona questioned Russo's contention that the girl 
required a special low-sodium diet because salt caused her face and feet to 
swell. What is it about the girl that causes those reactions, the prosecutor 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Russo responded. "I'm not a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona did not ask Russo, a registered nurse, any further medical questions or 
for many details about the two alleged incidents that resulted in felony and 
misdemeanor charges being filed against her: charges of locking the girl in the 
racquetball court and biting her on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor questioned the mother about whether she forced her daughter 
to do homework only two days after the girl had undergone open-heart surgery in 
the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've never cut her any slack with regard to her schoolwork because of her 
surgeries, have you?" Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I have," Russo insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike during direct examination, Russo did not shed tears during the 
interrogation by Corona. But she often appeared to be worn down by the 
prosecutor's rapid-fire questions. 
</P>
<P>
 After Russo said her husband was the one who banished the girl to sleep in the 
racquetball court, Corona asked: "Did you agree with it?"  
</P>
<P>
 "I accepted it," Russo answered. 
</P>
<P>
 " Did you agree with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
 "But did you agree with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I agreed with my husband," Russo finally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo admitted that she treated her daughter differently than the other 
children by making the girl bike 13 miles to and from summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona later asked Russo about the racquetball-court sleeping arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were any of the other kids required to sleep in the racquetball court?" 
Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then (the girl) was treated differently when she was required to sleep in the 
racquetball court?" Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess so," Russo replied.

LANDFILL OPERATORS SUE TO FORCE NUNS TO ACCEPT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operators of the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard have filed a lawsuit to force 
the Catholic nuns who live in a convent nearby to accept $96,500 as 
compensation for the dust, noise and smell from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Whitney, general manager for the Ventura Regional Sanitation District, 
which operates the landfill, said the suit was a legal maneuver to meet a 
deadline imposed by the Board of Supervisors to resolve an impasse between the 
nuns and the sanitation district. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors voted 4 to 1 in March to extend the landfill's permit for 
three years as long as the sanitation district made a settlement with the 
Sister Servants of Mary, which has run the convent for 30 years. Supervisor 
John Flynn voted against it, saying the landfill had exceeded its capacity and 
the permit should not be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney argues that the district's action frees it from the possibility of 
losing its permit to operate the landfill by showing that it is taking actions 
to resolve the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no longer the threat that we'll have to close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney said that negotiations will continue despite the district's lawsuit, 
filed in Ventura County Superior Court. A mediator was retained when talks 
broke down a month ago, but due to scheduling problems, negotiations will not 
begin again until mid-July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Cohen, the Oxnard-based attorney representing the nuns, said he 
considers the lawsuit a formality and is eager to re-enter formal negotiations 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't in all honesty fault the district" for the lawsuit, Cohen said. "Both 
sides have been working diligently to negotiate a settlement and resolve the 
problem, but they were up against a board deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the nuns probably would not try to shut down the landfill even if 
negotiations continue to falter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sisters realize that the problems (caused by forcing the landfill to 
close) would go far beyond their own," he said. "But if we can't mediate a 
resolution to this, we are going to go for broke, take this to court and 
collect on the damages." 
</P>
<P>
 The convent is situated about 500 feet from the landfill on a large parcel 
donated to the Catholic order 33 years ago. It is one of just six such convents 
in the United States that train nuns for service in the Sister Servants of Mary 
order. Nuns in the order minister to the homebound sick and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bailard landfill, which opened a few years after the nuns launched their 
convent, now covers more than 180 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn speculated that the district was delaying the negotiations until July 
because the State Integrated Waste Management Board is scheduled to meet in 
Ventura in June. He said the district wanted to avoid any controversy that 
could affect its environmental-health permit, which the state board is 
scheduled to review. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cohen and the district's Whitney disagreed with Flynn's contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still wants the landfill closed," Whitney said. "But John Flynn lost that 
fight 4 to 1 and my advice to him is to let it go. Everybody knows he's a lone 
voice in the wilderness. The fact is, both sides are highly motivated to 
negotiate a settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 But the two sides are still far from a resolution.  
</P>
<P>
 The nuns at the convent have said that the dust, noise and smell from the dump 
are unhealthy and at times unbearable. They are asking that the district buy 
their property and find them an alternative site to live. Cohen estimates that 
the move would cost more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the offer contained in the lawsuit was fair.

SUPERVISOR UNVEILS OAK PARK LIBRARY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park will move one step closer to having its own library if the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors approves a project proposed Wednesday by Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk for a 10,000-square-foot facility on Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to vote on the $1.6-million project at Tuesday's 
supervisors meeting. If approved, the community would begin a search for an 
architect and discussions of design and possible environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just asking for conceptual approval," VanderKolk said. "There are so many 
steps that will still need to be taken if we get approval. This is really the 
very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The affluent community of nearly 14,000, which has been trying since 1991 to 
get its own library, would pay for construction of the facility by using its 
untouched capital improvement fund, raised through fees charged to developers. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the fund contains only $1.09 million, VanderKolk's proposal 
depends on developers' fees from future residential projects, the sale of a 
nearby piece of county-owned land and other revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed library site is a piece of land owned by the school district, 
adjacent to Oak Park High School. School officials would lease the land to the 
county for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the higher operating costs when the public library is moved from its 
current site at the high school to the new facility, the county would have to 
agree to increase the money it allocates to the community for library services. 
Costs would nearly triple, from $49,072 to $132,700.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not asking for even the amount the community is already paying in 
property taxes for library services," VanderKolk said. "This community pays 
three times in taxes what they get back in library services." 
</P>
<P>
 In a measure on the June 7 ballot that will determine Oak Park's future, 
voters will decide whether to begin annexation proceedings to become part of 
Thousand Oaks, a separate incorporated city, or to remain an unincorporated 
part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk and community officials said Oak Park wants a library regardless of 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what the community votes on the ballot," said George 
Anterasian, a member of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council. "That is not 
going to change the fact that the community needs a library facility."  
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park residents now share a small library with the high school. High on the 
list of complaints about the facility are the lack of nearby bathrooms, the 
small number of books and research materials available and limited operating 
hours. The library is staffed by the school district during school hours, and 
by a county librarian for 16 additional hours Monday through Thursday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderkolk's proposal would only add four operating hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Though members of Oak Park's municipal council said they approved of the 
proposal, some said 20 hours of access beyond school operating hours is not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot more that we would like to have done, but you've got to start 
someplace," said Municipal Advisory Council member Ron Stark. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Kent Behringer said he hopes the community will work to 
increase open hours once the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about all we can manage under the circumstances," Behringer said. 
"You just can't encumber yourself to a bigger amount if you don't have the 
funds on hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Though construction would empty the capital improvement fund, council members 
said they think building a library is the best use of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, it's only enough money to do one project well," Anterasian 
said. "But I believe it is an adequate amount to build a good-sized library." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk's proposed budget for the library relies on collection of $957,000 
in anticipated developer's fees, including $100,000 the city hopes to gain from 
allowing one developer to exceed zoning restrictions. The construction budget 
also depends on the county allowing Oak Park to use $213,000 from an 
air-pollution mitigation fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is concerned about future operating expenses for libraries," 
VanderKolk said. "But this board is committed to library services and they 
realize that Oak Park has not received its fair share for many years in many 
areas, not just in libraries." 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is not approved, she said, "basically, we're back to square 
one."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDICIAL CANDIDATES DISCUSS THE ISSUES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Judicial candidates James Farley and Colleen Toy White squared off for the 
first time over issues ranging from courtroom experience to the death penalty 
at a forum in Simi Valley on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates, who are vying for a vacant seat on the Ventura County 
Superior Court, fielded questions from about 30 members of the East County Bar 
Assn. in Simi Valley at the midday luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience questioned the candidates on how they would reconcile their 
convictions and their professional associations with a job that requires 
impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley, who is a defense attorney and an outspoken opponent of the death 
penalty, said he would sentence a defendant to death if the situation required 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that handing down that sentence would be very difficult for me 
morally, but as a judge I would have the responsibility to pass that sentence 
in certain circumstances," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who has spent her career with the district attorney's office and who 
dubs herself a "strong supporter of the death penalty," said she would have no 
trouble handing out that sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if her career as a prosecutor would present a conflict for her as a 
judge, she told the audience to look to history for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a number of quality judges who have come out of the district 
attorney's office -- or for that matter, from the public defender's office," 
White said. "I don't think that it would pose a conflict."  
</P>
<P>
 A number of questions submitted to moderator Nancy Goldstein focused on the 
issue of courtroom experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said he has represented hundreds of clients in both civil and criminal 
cases in Superior Court, while White has had limited experience trying court 
cases and has worked primarily as an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 But White argued that her experience as a prosecutor has placed her in the 
position of making "quasi-judicial" decisions about the merits of the office's 
cases on a daily basis. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ARCHITECTURE ADVISER OFFERS RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime Ventura architectural adviser Nicholas Deitch offered his resignation 
Wednesday because he is competing for a city contract and wanted to avoid the 
appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation came two days after the City Council told Curtis Stiles to 
resign from the Planning Commission to be eligible for a city landscaping 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Deitch, the principal owner of Mainstreet Architects and Planners and chairman 
of the city's Architectural Review Committee, tendered his resignation in a 
three-page letter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of council members, however, Deitch agreed to postpone formally 
resigning until the council devises a conflict-of-interest policy in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deitch, who has volunteered on city committees for 10 years, is on a short 
list of candidates for a project that would make city buildings accessible to 
handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough enough around here with the drought and the recession in the 
last few years and I felt I had to make a choice," Deitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deitch's offer to resign followed the council's action Monday in notifying 
Stiles that he would have to quit his commission post or turn down a $25,000 
landscaping contract with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 An infuriated Stiles quit the commission and turned down the landscaping 
contract, telling council members they had "humiliated" him. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and city staff, however, called and wrote Stiles Tuesday and 
Wednesday, asking him to stay on the project to redesign California Street 
Plaza across from the Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Stiles changed his mind and decided to accept the city contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say, 'Don't get mad, get even,' " he said. "I say, 'Get mad and 
then get over it.' It's a much more healthy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Gregory L. Carson said he was pleased, though not surprised, 
that Stiles had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling he was eventually going to take the contract," he said. "I 
know his feeling of responsibility to the city goes stronger than that."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ERRATIC RAIN SOAKS POCKETS OF THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rain cloud literally sat on top of Thousand Oaks and doused the city 
Wednesday morning, while Camarillo saw barely enough precipitation to wet the 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 An erratic spring storm brought Ventura County some much-needed rain, although 
the region is still below average rainfall for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ground was dry and it's all soaking in," said John Weikel, senior 
engineer for the county's Flood Control Department. "This will save people from 
having to water their lawns." 
</P>
<P>
 But the showers, which began Tuesday, have dropped little rain on the 
agricultural plain in Oxnard. Instead, the downpours have been concentrated in 
the Matilija Canyon area beyond Ojai and in pockets of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes in spurts, but when it does it pours," said Sheriff's Deputy Art 
Bielz in Fillmore. Fillmore received twice as much rain as neighboring Piru, 
and Thousand Oaks received four times as much as Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai also experienced brief showers, while the mountains beyond received 
one-half to three-quarters of an inch of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predict cloudy skies and a 20% chance of rain today but a clear 
weekend, except for some morning fog. High temperatures should be in the 60s 
along the coast and rise to the 70s inland, according to the National Weather 
Service. County Rainfall

 Here are rainfall figures from the Ventura County Flood Control District for

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD, VENTURA; ELECTRIC BUS USED IN CLEAN AIR 
TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An electric bus with a rechargeable battery pack is hitting the streets of 
Oxnard and Ventura this week as part of an experiment in clean public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. lent the white bus with large, opening windows 
to the South Coast Area Transit as part of an effort to reduce air pollution in 
Ventura County and other parts of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric bus produces 97% less pollution than diesel-run buses, said Tony 
Wilson, an Edison spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a research bus that we are providing so they can take a look and see if 
they will be able to use it in their transportation system," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric bus route will be alternated between Oxnard's St. John's Hospital 
route and the Ventura Harbor route through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus takes the place of the regular buses on the route and costs no more to 
board than the regular $1 fee for most riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard and Ventura are the first two cities to use the bus. Until now, the 
trolley was used at Edison's nuclear power plant in San Onofre in San Diego 
County. After Ventura County, the bus heads south to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to show people that electric technology is here and available 
right now," Wilson said. "We hope to raise the visibility of this type of 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Duval, a manager with the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, 
said using electric buses would help reduce air pollution in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "An electric bus is very much cleaner than the current buses used," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAT has also applied for a federal grant to buy 26 compressed-natural gas 
buses, which the district hopes will be operating by August, 1995, said Laurie 
Anderson, a spokeswoman for SCAT. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SEWER REPLACEMENT DELAYED A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A weeklong sewer-replacement project that was scheduled to begin this week and 
close the downtown portion of Ojai Avenue has been delayed, officials with the 
project's contractor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at 7 a.m. Monday, Ojai Avenue will be closed between Montgomery and 
Ventura streets and traffic detoured around the Ojai Arcade and adjacent 
businesses by Matilija and Aliso streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, Dorfman Construction, postponed the sewer project for a week 
to notify businesses that deliver goods to downtown Ojai of the road closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking with the city and the fact that Ojai Avenue is a state highway, 
we felt an obligation to the delivery services," said Maurya Foy, project 
coordinator for Dorfman Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The road is expected to be closed a week.  
</P>
<P>
 The excavation is part of the Ojai Valley Sanitation District's 
sewer-replacement project that started in August, 1993, and is expected to be 
completed by June 30. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WELDON CANYON; PETITION SEEKS TO PUT LANDFILL ON 
BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives for a San Diego County firm seeking voter approval for a dump 
at Weldon Canyon have begun circulating a petition aimed at placing the 
landfill measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic Resources wants to build a dump and recycling center on 551 acres in 
Weldon Canyon, 2 1/2 miles north of Ventura and five miles south of Ojai, and 
is asking voters to amend the county's General Plan and certain zoning 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the measure on the ballot, Taconic must obtain 18,753 valid signatures 
by June 6, said Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of voters for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a countywide (initiative), this is pretty close," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic, which began collecting signatures on Tuesday, would have to collect 
about 938 valid signatures a day to make the June deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 That deadline was set to allow the registrar time to count and verify the 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic could elect to wait to place the measure on the June, 1996, ballot or 
try for a special election sometime in between. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 public officials, local businessmen and residents attended a news 
conference Tuesday morning at the Simi Valley Courthouse to begin the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Brown, a former Moorpark city councilwoman and proponent of the 
landfill measure, was the first person to sign the petition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel it's time (there was) some serious consideration of the landfill 
site in the west county," Brown said. TRACY WILSON

STUDENTS PUBLISH UNDERGROUND PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking aim at school administrators, "religious right-wing fanatics" and 
uniforms in public schools, a group of Simi Valley high school seniors on 
Wednesday distributed the second edition of an underground newspaper titled the 
Student Advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page, letter-size paper was passed out to about 1,500 students and 
staff at Royal High School before the first bell. Those involved -- none of 
whom would allow their names to be used -- said they planned to distribute 
another 1,000 copies at Simi Valley High School today and at junior high 
campuses on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One Royal High senior who worked on the paper said the purpose was "to educate 
students, to open their minds, to make them think a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make them realize what's happening in their district because a 
lot of students don't read newspapers, don't go to school board meetings," the 
senior added. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest issue of the Student Advocate features a commentary attacking the 
idea of uniforms in public schools, a measure suggested by some members of a 
committee studying campus safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Another article satirizes the controversy over the California Learning 
Assessment System exam. And a full-page report card assigns up or down arrows 
to school board members and others, including a conservative parents group 
called Citizens for Truth in Education, according to their positions on a 
variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier April 8 edition of the Advocate blasted the city's assignment of a 
Simi Valley police officer to patrol school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very distressing to report that the schools in our district are 
becoming less and less of an educational estate and . . . more and more of a 
police state," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Diane Collins said the students should be praised and not 
penalized for their activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those kids are really bright," she said. "We should be proud of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 A district administrator, Leslie Crunelle, said she had not seen a copy of the 
paper distributed Wednesday. But she said the earlier edition violated no 
school policies and was protected by free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing -- as I recall -- that was libelous, slanderous or 
obscene," she said. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MORMONS TO OPEN A NEW MEETING PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After seven years of planning and construction, the Mormon church in Thousand 
Oaks will open a 45,000-square-foot Spanish-style building to serve much of the 
church's expanding membership in the east part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The elaborate $7-million facility, which includes everything from worship 
halls to a basketball court, was built by the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints to act as a periodic meeting place for the local church 
division, called a stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's 2,650 local members, who had long been divided into two smaller 
chapels, met together in the new building last month for their first combined 
service. On Saturday, the church will open the building to the public for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a thrill to have this building open," said Gary D. Snyder, 
president of the stake that covers Moorpark and most of Thousand Oaks. "It 
marks a great accomplishment for us, and signifies the continuing growth of our 
membership in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the building, a chandelier-lit entryway leads to a main chapel that can 
open to accommodate 1,400 people. A second chapel can accommodate about 300 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Down long hallways around the building are entryways to a host of other 
facilities including classrooms, offices for church leaders, kitchens, 
libraries, and a family research center where people can trace their roots. 
There is also an entertainment area that includes basketball and volleyball 
courts and a performance stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most rooms are wired to a satellite dish, housed in a shed behind the site, 
which connects the facility to church headquarters in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Sunday, an average of 1,200 members from various units of the stake will 
meet at the new building. Regular Sunday services continue in the existing 
temples in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said study classes, Boy Scout meetings and other church-affiliated 
events will be held at the new building periodically throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's open house, which will include music from the church's new pipe 
organ, will be held from 1 to 5 p.m. at 1600 Erbes Road, Thousand Oaks. MATTHEW

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: DISTRICT TO SURVEY CAMPUS VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before school ends next month, Simi Valley school officials plan to distribute 
a survey questioning 14,000 students, teachers and other employees about the 
presence of drugs, weapons and violence on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7,000 survey, co-written by educators at the UC Santa Barbara and the 
county Office of Education, was approved Tuesday night by the Simi Valley 
Unified School District Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the questionnaires, which are anonymous, will be used to recommend 
short- and long-term measures for improving campus safety. The intense scrutiny 
on safety was sparked by the Feb. 1 fatal stabbing of a student at Valley View 
Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school board approved the survey by a vote of 4 to 1, several 
questions on parents' education and income levels sparked debate among board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Carla Kurachi, who opposed the survey, argued for the removal 
of a question that asked if the student filling out the survey receives free or 
low-cost school lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that asking someone if they're at poverty level has anything 
to do with safety," she said. "Why are we so interested in labeling?" 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials and other board members said the information on income 
level, along with other background questions, would help identify which groups 
of students feel unsafe at school. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DEADLINE SET FOR SEEKING QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to start mailing out checks, Thousand Oaks council members have set a 
mid-June deadline for residents to request earthquake relief funds, despite a 
warning from staff members that a one-month application period might be too 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners looking for help repairing quake-damaged property must apply by 
June 16 to receive a portion of the city's $501,000 federal earthquake-recovery 
grant.At least 50 residents have already requested city aid. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their applications, residents must prove they have tapped every 
other possible source of money, including the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Small Business Administration and private insurance. But that 
requirement, coupled with a deadline just four weeks away, could create 
problems for homeowners whose requests for FEMA funds are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA will continue accepting requests for money until July 17, so residents 
might receive federal grants well after they have applied for city loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how this is all going to work, timing-wise," said quake victim 
Michele Relkin, who will not hear from the Individual Family Grant program 
until at least mid-June. "It's like living on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the time crunch, council members said they would accept some 
incomplete applications. But they defended the June 16 deadline as necessary to 
help city staff members get a swift and accurate assessment of residents' 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because FEMA's taking too long doesn't mean we need to take too long," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once applications are in, the council will decide how much money to give 
homeowners and how much to spend on repairing masonry walls along arterial 
streets. They will also vote on whether to structure the housing rehabilitation

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SMOKERS CAN INDULGE ON RESTAURANT 
PATIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Seeking a compromise to keep both tobacco fans and no-smoking activists from 
fuming, Thousand Oaks City Council members have agreed to let diners light up 
on restaurant patios, as long as their seats are 20 feet from the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision effectively bans smoking from small, sidewalk cafes with just a 
few outdoor tables clustered around the entrance.But restaurant owners with 
larger patios can create special smoking sections far from the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-smoking activists had urged the council to consider a complete ban on 
smoking in outdoor restaurant areas. They argued that children might be tempted 
to try cigarettes after watching adults relax with cigarettes and coffee in 
open-air cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Alex Fiore, a former smoker who quit seven years ago, said a 
blanket prohibition would be "going just a step too far." The law barring 
smoking within 20 feet of any public doorway creates enough hardship, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my bridge club, if someone wants to smoke they have to go out the door and 
walk 20 feet down," Fiore said. "But then they're within 20 feet of the next 
establishment. So they walk another 20 feet, and they're within 20 feet of the 
next establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty cruel -- we kick them out of the building and then they have to 
go into the middle of the parking lot or the middle of the street to have a 
cigarette," Fiore said. "I wish they didn't (smoke), but they do, and they 
shouldn't be treated as third-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members hinted that they might reconsider a ban on all outdoor 
restaurant smoking at a future meeting. They also indicated a willingness to 
discuss regulating smoking in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, all five council members voted for the compromise position.

COUNCIL SETS ASIDE $400,000 IN BLOCK GRANTS FOR TRANSPORTATION CENTER; THOUSAND 
OAKS: FACILITY WOULD PROVIDE A LINK TO SHUTTLES, TAXIS AND CITY AND INTERSTATE 
BUSES. A PARCEL NEXT TO THE CIVIC ARTS PLAZA IS A POSSIBLE SITE. 
</P>

<P>
 Longstanding plans for a Thousand Oaks transportation center linking airport 
shuttles, city transit and interstate buses received a boost this week when the 
City Council set aside $400,000 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders envision the hub as a staging ground for a variety of modes of 
public transportation, from local taxis to Greyhound Bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents could hop aboard buses headed for Downtown Los Angeles or the 
Moorpark Metrolink station. They could stash luggage in lockers, hail idling 
taxis or buy monthly transit passes. And instead of waiting at deserted street 
corners, they could huddle in a heated, well-lit shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation hub would not replace bus stops now scattered throughout 
Thousand Oaks. Instead, it would provide a central transfer spot and would 
serve as the loading dock for shuttles such as the Great American Stage Line 
and Ventura County Interconnect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now if you come into town on the Great American Stage Line, you don't 
know where you're going to end up," said Judy Golubics, a member of the city's 
Traffic and Transportation Commission. A hub with restrooms, phones and a 
cafeteria would "make it all more convenient," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 By setting aside $400,000 in federal community development block-grant money 
for the project, Thousand Oaks City Council members did not commit to any 
particular site or design. The money, along with $200,000 allocated last year, 
will be reserved in a special fund to buy land once the council settles on a 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have already identified a parcel next to the Civic Arts Plaza 
as a possible site for the transportation center. With council permission, city 
officials are negotiating to buy the 2.3-acre plot at the southwest corner of 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Oakwood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The boulevard site has generated some controversy among council members and 
the public because of concerns that a transportation center would create 
traffic and parking problems along the city's central corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before purchasing any property for a transportation center, staff members 
would analyze all environmental and traffic impacts, City Manager Grant 
Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 While withholding judgment until those studies are complete, Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar said she believes a boulevard site would be ideal because "that's where a 
large number of our low-income residents live, and that's our business 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 As a model, some Thousand Oaks officials have considered the large 
transportation center in Oxnard, which has served Amtrak, Greyhound and local 
buses since 1986. Built with redevelopment money, the complex has proved a 
great success, said Maureen Hooper Lopez, the director of planning for the 
South Coast Area Transit bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 "People making connections aren't trying to cross busy streets or run against 
red lights," she said. "Drivers used to have to radio each other to say, 'Hey, 
I've got a transfer here, so don't pull out yet.' Now they can see the 
connection buses coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for a Thousand Oaks center has been so preliminary that officials do 
not have cost estimates. But council members are setting aside money now, 
hoping to get the project under way soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Full city coffers would be helpful in securing federal money to help build the 
hub, Councilman Frank Schillo said, because many grant programs require cities 
to put up matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mayor Elois Zeanah questioned the council majority's decision to set 
aside $400,000 in the block grant funds -- earmarked to help low-income 
residents -- for the transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah also expressed concern about another block-grant allocation: spending 
$150,000 to improve wheelchair accessibility along Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
Installing curb cuts and new sidewalks should be taken care of by redevelopment 
agency money, she said, and not by community development funds. 
</P>
<P>
 While Zeanah cast the lone vote against the capital projects, she approved 
allocating $112,500 in block-grant funding to 14 nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously agreed to give $10,000 apiece to senior nutrition and 
meals programs and to the Mannafood bank. Lutheran Social Services and Catholic 
Charities each received $10,500 grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other groups, including the Youth Employment Service and the Interface 
counseling programs, split an additional $50,000 in grant money from the city's 
Social Services Endowment Fund.

KNICKS FIGHT OFF DEMONS TO GRAB EDGE THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All of those supposed demons were coming at the New York Knicks like a 
four-on-one fast break Wednesday night. The memories of last season's Game 5 of 
the Eastern Conference semifinals against Chicago, when Charles Smith missed 
four shots within arms' length of the basket. The memories of this season's 
Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Chicago, when Toni Kukoc 
beat them with 1.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubert Davis had something bigger, something more imposing, to deal with as he 
made two late free throws that gave the Knicks an 87-86 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of his disappointed father, among the 19,763 in Madison Square 
Garden, was the motivation as he stepped to the line with the game on the line. 
He blocked out everything else, including the Bulls' effort to freeze him by 
calling a timeout, then made the two shots with 2.1 seconds left that gave the 
Knicks a controversial victory and a 3-2 series lead heading into Game 6 Friday 
night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, taking their optimistic notes where they can find them, can be 
thankful they didn't have to go out like this. History would not remember the 
exit fondly, not the memory of Scottie Pippen flying at Davis and fouling the 
second-year guard well after the shot. Nor the sight of the champions falling 
into their usual postgame retreat, Pippen bolting the locker room and Coach 
Phil Jackson issuing a terse comment before getting up from the interview table 
and leaving without taking questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of things in the NBA," Jackson said. "But I've never seen 
what happened at the end of a game like that." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question Davis was fouled on the right arm on the straightaway 
jumper, only whether the referees would give him the whistle because the 
contact clearly came after the release. Veteran Hue Hollins called it without 
hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Darrel Garretson, the league supervisor of officials and one of Wednesday's 
referees, said: "I think it's important to define what a shooter is. A shooter 
remains a shooter until he regains his balance on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Davis if the foul affected the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "His pressure affected the shot," Davis said. "It was a pretty much a late 
foul." 
</P>
<P>
 But did it cause him to miss? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Davis prepared for his first free throws of the night, he stayed far away 
from the line as long as possible, helping to ensure no one could say anything 
to him, trash talk or words of support. He took the ball and made the first for 
an 86-86 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls called time out. Davis went to the Knick huddle and told everyone to 
leave him alone. Then he returned and swished the second shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Timeout, Chicago. All that remained was for the Knicks to hold on for the 
final 2.1 ticks, no small matter considering Kukoc's shot a few days earlier. 
Immediately, something was different this time. Pippen stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls called another time out, their last, when Pete Myers could not get 
the ball in from the right sideline at halfcourt. The crowd, which had earlier 
chanted, "Quitter! Quitter!" at Pippen when he was at the line, broke into "Sit 
down, Scottie!" Jackson reloaded and showed a similar formation to the one that 
resulted in the Game 3 win. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the other difference. Myers went to Pippen cutting through the lane, 
but Anthony Mason knocked the pass away and John Starks picked it up to burn 
off the final moments. The Knicks, playing for the win and momentum heading 
back to Chicago, also got some redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be like this," Starks said. "Games should end like this, with great 
plays deciding who is the better team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks, at least for a night.

GOTT SAVES ONE FOR GROSS, 5-2; BASEBALL: WALLACH'S DOUBLE KEYS DODGERS' BIG 
SIXTH INNING AS 'THE MAYOR' REGAINS FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They call him the mayor, so talkative and likable is Jim Gott, who led the 
Dodgers with 25 saves last season in a role he was given because of injuries to 
Todd Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, though, has been a story of frustration. Gott has struggled, at 
times showing his prowess of last season -- but only glimpses of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why he was on the mound again Wednesday night at Mile High Stadium was hard to 
say -- he had pitched in three of the last four games. But he was out there in 
the eighth inning, trying to preserve a 5-2 lead over the Colorado Rockies 
before presumably turning the ball over to -- who else? -- Darren Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, Gott was throwing his breaking ball so well that he stayed 
for the ninth, throwing two perfect innings and earning his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth victory in nine games for the Dodgers, putting them back in 
sole possession of first place in the National League West.  
</P>
<P>
 "After last season, I came out this spring as if I had to prove things," said 
Gott, who is 5-1 with a 4.37 earned-run average. "I said things I don't 
normally say, like I wanted the closer role rather than them just handing the 
job to Todd, and then I felt like I had to go out and back it up. I was going 
out and getting behind batters 3-0 and helping guys make ballclubs in spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, I was fatigued going into the eighth inning, but I feel like the 
things I have done out there have put extra pressure on the bullpen. (Manager) 
Tommy (Lasorda) came up to me after the eighth inning and gave me a pep talk. 
He knows I have had trouble in the past with Howard Johnson, and he told me he 
was sending me out there in the ninth just to get this guy out. That pumped me 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kevin Gross (3-1) who had kept the Dodgers in the game until then, 
having put together his third consecutive solid performance. In six innings, he 
gave up four hits, walked three and struck out eight, giving him 56 strikeouts 
this season and keeping him among the league leaders. He stiffened up a little 
during the sixth inning, when the Dodgers scored five runs to move ahead, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a long time to get loose, but he battled and threw extremely well," 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through five innings, the only hit Gross allowed was a bloop single to 
Johnson, who eventually became Gross' nemesis. Twice, Johnson, who was two for 
three, got as far as third base before Gross pitched out of the jam. But in the 
sixth inning, with the Dodgers leading, 5-0, Johnson succeeded when he tripled 
home Andres Galarraga, who had singled, and then scored on a single by Charlie 
Hayes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' big inning came in the top of the sixth, when they scored five 
runs on five hits and three walks, knocking out Steve Reed, who had relieved 
starter Willie Blair (0-2). Blair was filling in for Marvin Freeman, who was 
scratched because of a respiratory condition. Delino DeShields, who also made a 
couple of solid defensive plays, and Mike Piazza started the inning with 
consecutive singles, then scored on Tim Wallach's double, his 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez walked, and Eric Karros, who was two for four, hit a 
run-scoring single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi, who was two for four and extended his hitting streak to 10 
games, followed with a run-scoring double off the left-field wall. During his 
streak, Mondesi is hitting .432 with three home runs and nine runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Mike Munoz walked DeShields for the fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first four innings, Piazza failed in three attempts to throw out 
base-stealers. Last season, Piazza caught more baserunners than any catcher in 
the majors. He caught 58 of 166, a 35% ratio and a Dodger franchise record. But 
this season, Piazza has caught only seven of 31 runners, a 23% ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have quite a few guys on our pitching staff who are slow to the plate, and 
Mike thinks he has to be super quick, so he's rushing the throws," bullpen 
coach Mark Cresse said. "He'll be OK. He's got the ability to throw a lot 
better than this. Our pitchers have to work on this, also."

<P>
 The American Speedway Final, perhaps the most important event in U.S. speedway 
motorcycle racing, will be held Saturday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying event to select five American riders to compete in the Overseas 
Final on June 12 in Coventry, England, resumes after a two-year absence. 
Qualifiers in England will ride in the World Speedway Final on Aug. 20 in 
Vojens, Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Ermolenko, the world and national champion from Cypress, is seeded into 
the Overseas Final and will not compete in Ventura. Ermolenko, one of the 
top-ranked riders in the British League, came home last September to add the 
U.S. championship to the world title he won in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the third American world champion, joining Jack Milne of Pasadena and 
Bruce Penhall of Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko is recuperating from a serious leg injury suffered five weeks ago in 
an accident at his home track in Wolverhampton, England. The injury aggravated 
an injury that had sidelined him much of the 1992 season, but he expects to 
resume racing in the British League before the Overseas Final. 
</P>
<P>
 Other British League riders from Southern California will be in the Ventura 
field, including Chris Manchester, 1992 national champion from Hesperia; Greg 
Hancock of Newport Beach, Billy Hamill of Monrovia and Ermolenko's younger 
brother, Dukie. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Larsen, another Newport Beach rider who competed for three years in the 
British League before returning to Southland tracks this season, is one of the 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California speedway specialists challenging the British riders on 
Ventura's renovated 350-meter high-banked oval include former national 
champions Mike Faria, Brad Oxley and Bobby Schwartz; plus Charlie Venegas, an 
ice-racing champion, and Northern Californians Jim Sisemore and Bart Bast. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian champion John Kehoe also will ride in the round-robin competition 
that matches 16 riders in a series of four-lap heats. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Final, which has been held in such venues as the Coliseum, 
Anaheim Stadium and Long Beach Veterans Stadium, has not been contested the 
last two years because of a contractual dispute between the American 
Motorcyclist Assn. and the Southland sanctioning body, International Speedway, 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Saugus Speedway will hold a NASCAR Winston Racing Series program 
Saturday night for sportsman, Grand Am modifieds and street stocks. . . . 
Street stocks and IMCA modifieds will run Friday night at Ventura Raceway. . . 
. American V8 modifieds and pro-mod stocks are scheduled for Sunday at Willow 
Springs' Kern County Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 MIDGETS -- The U.S. Auto Club western regional full midgets and three-quarter 
midgets will race Saturday night at Bakersfield Speedway in Oildale. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- The Toyota Challenge, an American Motorcyclist Assn. road race 
championship event, will be held Saturday and Sunday at Laguna Seca Raceway, on 
the Monterey peninsula. A 750cc supersport race of 35 miles will be the feature 
on the Saturday program, with Harley-Davidson twin sports, 600cc supersports 
and the Camel superbike main events on Sunday. Australian Tony Corser, who won 
the Pomona superbike race last month, will be favored over Steve Crevier of 
Canada, Takahiro Sohwa of Japan and American veterans Jamie James and Fred 
Merkel in the superbike feature. . . . Four-time champion Scott Parker moved 
ahead of Chris Carr in the AMA Grand National dirt track series with his 
victory last week at Pomona. It was Parker's fourth victory on the horse racing 
oval. The series moves to DuQuoin, Ill., May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 RALLY -- National champion Paul Choiniere of Shelburne, Vt., and co-driver 
Jeff Becker of Great Neck, N.Y., repeated last year's victory in the Rim of the 
World Rally last weekend in the Angeles National Forest west of Palmdale. 
Driving an Audi Quatro, it was their first victory this season in the Sports 
Car Club of America's Michelin Pro Rally series. Jeff Zwart, formerly of Costa 
Mesa, and co-driver Tony Sircombe of Corona del Mar, finished second in a 
Porsche Carrera. 
</P>
<P>
 NECROLOGY -- Tom Nuckles, 66, owner of the Lotus-Porsche that launched the 
career of George Follmer in the mid-'60s, died last Thursday in Pasadena of 
cancer. Follmer, who won the 1965 U.S. Road Racing Championship in Nuckles' 
car, went on to win the Can-Am and Trans-Am championships in the heyday of 
American sports car racing.

 Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets regards Danny Ainge of the Phoenix Suns 
as an annoying mosquito.

 "He plays little games," Olajuwon told Chris Jenkins of the San Diego

and then he pretends to be reasonable.

 "He tries to fool people. He pretends to be a nice guy. When you do that, you 
are a hypocrite. I would advise him to be God-fearing."

 P.R. coach: Buddy Ryan, Arizona Cardinal coach, told Jack Magruder of the 
Arizona Daily Star of the adjustment Barry Switzer must make as the new Dallas 
Cowboy coach: 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't coach much at Oklahoma. If he would have been hired on as a 
position coach, a linebacker coach, or something, (the Cowboys) would have been 
in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 "In his system the assistant coaches do a lot of the coaching, anyway. He'll 
do the people part of it just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Switzer: While coaching at Oklahoma in the mid-1970s, Switzer said he was 
once offered the head coaching job with the Kansas City Chiefs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I had more first-round draft choices on my team than they did," 
Switzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong juice: Before he snapped out of a hitting slump, the Pirates' Andy Van 
Slyke said: "Everybody's talking about the ball being juiced. The balls I've 
been hitting have prune juice in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Time machine: Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the 
Lakers' hiring of Del Harris as their coach:  
</P>
<P>
 "So the Lakers have gone from slicked-back Showtime to blue-haired Vaudeville. 
The '90s look . . . the 1890s. Instead of the Laker girls, they should bring in 
a barbershop quartet." 
</P>
<P>
 M&M's: Dikembe Mutombo of the Denver Nuggets changed his autograph to DM -- 55 
because he feared writer's cramp. 
</P>
<P>
 He never considered signing his full name: Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba 
Jean Jacque Wamutombo. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wondering: Mike Lupica of Newsday wrote: "How come Michael Jordan is a 
threat to baseball and the A.L. West isn't?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has been around: Oriole closer Lee Smith told the Baltimore Sun that he 
doesn't find extra motivation in facing the Red Sox and the Yankees, two of his 
former teams, in the same week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that was the case, I'd be pumped up every place I went," Smith said. "I've 
played near everywhere." 
</P>

 FYI: The shortest hole played in a major golf championship is the 107-yard,

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; MAPLE LEAFS GAMBLE, LOSE AS CANUCKS EVEN SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Toronto Maple Leafs had their eyes on Pavel Bure. They should have been 
watching Jyrki Lumme. 
</P>
<P>
 With Toronto's checkers concentrating on Canuck scoring star Bure, Lumme got 
off the shot that beat the Maple Leafs, 4-3, Wednesday night and evened the 
NHL's Western Conference final at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I try the back door and when nothing happens, I go back to the 
point," Lumme said in explaining his winning goal at 15:46 of the third period 
on a pass from Trevor Linden. "The whole slot area was wide open so I thought 
I'd try it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puck kind of bounced off my blade a bit. I was sideways and I went past 
the net a little so I turned and just got a shot off. I tried to go upstairs 
and hoped we could get the rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 There was none. Maple Leaf goalie Felix Potvin couldn't handle the knee-high 
wrist shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure, Jeff Brown and Murray Craven also scored for the Canucks, who flew home 
immediately after the game to begin preparing for Game 3 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitri Mironov scored twice and Dave Ellett once for the Maple Leafs, who got 
all their goals on power plays. Doug Gilmour assisted on all three to increase 
his league-leading playoff points total to 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisive power play was made possible when Toronto defenseman Jamie Macoun 
lost the puck in his own zone, then tackled Cliff Ronning in trying to prevent 
a 3-on-1 Canuck rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto twice fought from behind. Ellett tied it 3-3 with a blue-line slap 
shot at 4:37 of the third period. After Lumme scored, Canuck goalie Kirk McLean 
preserved the victory with a huge save with his catching mitt on a Mike Gartner 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mironov became the first Maple Leaf defenseman since Sid Smith in 1949 to 
score two power-play goals in one playoff period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellett's goal and two assists give him 14 assists and 17 points, breaking the 
club record shared by Tim Horton (1962) and Ian Turnbull (1978) for most points 
by a defenseman in one playoff year.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GLAVINE KEEPS STREAK ALIVE WITH 100TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atlanta's Tom Glavine got the 100th victory of his career in style Wednesday, 
holding the Reds to two hits over seven innings for a 3-1 win that left him 
unbeaten at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Glavine (5-3) struck out three, walked two and allowed only two hits to Brian 
Dorsett as he improved to 11-0 in 12 starts at Riverfront Stadium. The Reds 
have scored only 18 earned runs against him in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the (appropriate) thing about getting 100 here is that I've done 
pretty well here for whatever reason," said Glavine, 28, who has an 100-69 
record in six-plus seasons, including three consecutive 20-victory seasons. 
"I'm one-third of the way to where every starting pitcher would like to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff went four for four and drove in two runs to help the Braves 
overtake the Reds for the best record (24-13) in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, New York 3 -- Ron Tingley hit a two-run homer and Chuck Carr and 
Alex Arias had run-scoring singles in a two-run seventh inning for the Marlins 
at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Hough (4-2), who had a no-hitter through 5 2/3 innings, lasted six 
innings in a steady rain, allowing three runs and three hits, striking out five 
and walking four. Robb Nen pitched two innings of hitless relief to earn his 
first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Jones (4-4), lost for his third time in his last four decisions. He gave 
up four runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out four and walking 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, San Diego 4 -- Ryne Sandberg hit a bases-loaded triple, and the 
Cubs withstood a late rally at Chicago to extend the Padres' losing streak to 
10 games -- their longest in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs have now won three consecutive games for the first time since last 
September. San Diego's last 10-game losing streak came in 1974. San Diego's 
club record is 11 losses in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, San Francisco 2 -- Doug Drabek won his sixth consecutive decision 
and struck out a season-high 10 in eight innings to lead the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (6-1) hasn't lost since his first start of the season against Montreal. 
He gave up eight hits and walked four. John Hudek came on for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Portugal (4-3) took the loss in his first appearance in the Astrodome 
since leaving the Astros in the off-season to sign with the Giants as a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Ray Lankford hit his 10th home run of the season 
in the 10th inning and the Cardinals used a National League record-tying six 
pitchers for the second consecutive night in their victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Perez (1-0) got the victory despite allowing Brian Hunter's game-tying 
sacrifice fly in the ninth. The Pirates have scored only 22 runs while losing 
seven of their last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 6, Philadelphia 1 -- Montreal's Jeff Fassero pitched eight shutout 
innings, and Lenny Webster drove in four runs at Philadelphia, as the Expos 
handed Danny Jackson his first loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassero (4-2) allowed six hits, struck out eight and walked one. Jackson (5-1) 
gave up 10 hits in seven innings.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HOT TWINS COOL OFF YANKEES WITH SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Yankees went into the Metrodome as baseball's hottest team, with 
a 10-game winning streak and a 26-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
 They left it with two losses, being swept in a series for the first time all 
season. And now the Minnesota Twins are the toughest team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they're the hot team now," Don Mattingly said Wednesday after his 
Yankees were routed, 13-5, by the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Mahomes (4-1) held New York to two hits and one run in seven innings. Dave 
Winfield homered, singled twice and drove in four runs to lead the Twins to 
their ninth victory in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby Puckett also tripled, doubled, singled and scored three times as the 
Twins (20-19) won their fifth consecutive game and own a winning record for the 
first time since April 23, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Detroit 3 -- Joe Carter drove in three runs and Dave Stewart 
allowed three hits in 5 2/3 innings at Toronto, as the Blue Jays gained only 
their second victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who is on a pace to drive in 204 runs this season, raised his 
runs-batted-in total to 49 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ever remember being locked in for this long," Carter said. "Right now 
I'm seeing the ball so well I feel that if there's a runner on third with less 
than two outs, I'm going to bring him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart (3-3), who missed his previous turn in the rotation because of a groin 
pull, held the Tigers hitless until Mickey Tettleton singled leading off the 
fifth. Stewart, who struck out nine and walked four, gave up a run-scoring 
single to Cecil Fielder in the sixth, before re-injuring his groin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gullickson (2-3) allowed five runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings as 
Detroit lost for the fifth time in six games.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas 6, Oakland 2 -- Will Clark hit a three-run homer, and Kenny Rogers 
pitched his first complete game of the season as the Rangers completed a 
three-game sweep at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers (4-3) gave up two runs and 11 hits, struck out four and walked none as 
Texas got its first series sweep this season and only its second three-game 
sweep in the last two years. For the third consecutive game, the Rangers got to 
Oakland's starter early but this time held the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dean Palmer's third home run gave Texas its first run in the second, the 
Rangers scored five more in the third. Former Ranger Bobby Witt (3-4) faced 10 
batters and gave up eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 5, Baltimore 2 -- Aaron Sele pitched a seven-hitter and Otis Nixon had 
four singles as the Red Sox chased Ben McDonald early at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon stole two bases and drove in a run for the Red Sox, who sent nine men to 
the plate in a four-run second inning. Boston has won five of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Sele (5-1) has allowed three earned runs or fewer in 25 of 26 starts in his 
career. McDonald (7-2), bidding to become the first eight-game winner in the 
majors, gave up four runs, eight hits and three walks in three-plus innings. He 
has lost two consecutive games after opening the season with victories in his 
first seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Milwaukee 3 -- Mark Clark pitched his second consecutive complete 
game as the Indians won their fifth game in a row, at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark (4-1), who shut out Detroit in his last start, gave up seven hits, 
struck out two and walked two. Kenny Lofton extended his hitting streak to a 
career-high 16 games with a first-inning bunt and scored twice for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 7, Seattle 6 -- Dave Henderson drove in David Howard, who was 
pinch-running for Bob Hamelin, with a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning to give 
the Royals a victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals, who swept the three-game series, had to overcome two home runs by 
Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., who lifted his major league-leading total to 17.

ON FINAL TRY, WINGO TAKES DOWN MONROE; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: HIS THREE-HITTER 
GIVES BIRMINGHAM THE MID-VALLEY LEAGUE TITLE, ENDING THE VIKINGS' REIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the previous three seasons, Birmingham High senior Donny Wingo watched 
with envy as Monroe claimed the Mid-Valley League baseball title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Wingo made sure he didn't walk away from his high school baseball 
career a member of yet another runner-up team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingo pitched a three-hitter as Birmingham beat Monroe, 5-0, to clinch the 
league championship and put an end to the Vikings' three-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been building up to this moment for a long time," said Wingo, a 
three-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham (13-13, 9-7 in league play), which lost its first four league 
games, has won nine of its last 12 to clinch with one game remaining. Monroe 
fell to 8-13, 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted it more than we did and that's what it came down to," Monroe 
Coach Kevin Campbell said. "We didn't come to play." 
</P>
<P>
 A light rain fell continuously until the late innings and definitely affected 
Wingo's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knuckleball worked pretty good today with the wind and (rain)," said Wingo 
(4-5) after recording his third complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the rain cheated Wingo of what should have been his third home run. 
</P>
<P>
 With Steve Brown on base and one out, Wingo ripped a shot to center field in 
the third inning. Wingo began walking to first, expecting the ball to clear the 
fence 390 feet away. But the drizzle slowed the drive dramatically and the ball 
hit the fence. Wingo bolted into a sprint and managed to get a run-scoring 
double. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty embarrassed (about walking)," Wingo said. "But I got every part 
of that ball. I thought it was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rick Weber concurred: "Normally, if it isn't drizzling, that ball is out 
of here.' 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe ace Joel Zamudio (4-3) allowed two hits (both doubles) and three walks 
while striking out four in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham parlayed two walks and two errors into two runs in the first. The 
Braves added two in the third on Wingo's double and Pedro Rodriguez's 
run-scoring grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham, which had four hits -- three for extra bases -- made it 5-0 in the 
fourth when Dan Arnold scored on a sacrifice fly by John Ransom.

BALLARD GOES THE DISTANCE, WINS 2 RACES; CITY SECTION SWIMMING: BIRMINGHAM 
SOPHOMORE SWITCHES EMPHASIS TO LONGER EVENTS AND BREAKS 200 FREESTYLE RECORD 
HELD BY HER OLDER SISTER.

 Kristine Quance may have graduated, but there is still a dominant area swimmer 
in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham High sophomore Gretchen Ballard hasn't approached the national 
records Granada Hills' Quance made routine in 1993, but Ballard added to her 
growing collection of marks in the City Section finals Wednesday at Belmont 
Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Ballard broke City records in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle 
events. This year, Ballard switched her emphasis to the longer races but the 
results were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 freestyle, Ballard broke the City record held by her older sister, 
Heather, with a mark of 1:52.90, two-tenths of a second faster than Heather 
swam in 1992. Heather, who now swims at USC, attended the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretchen Ballard faltered in the final 50 meters, but still finished nearly 10 
seconds in front of Granada Hills' Erin Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather also owned the 500 freestyle record with a 4:56.46. Despite Gretchen's 
efforts, the mark stood, but her time of 6:11.59 was nearly 30 seconds faster 
than that of Samantha Sommatino of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed," Gretchen said. "I'm probably still a little tired 
from the 200."  
</P>
<P>
 Ballard was essentially a one-person team as the Braves finished in sixth in 
the team standings, 129 points behind defending champion Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills was the top area team among the girls, finishing second for the 
second successive year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' 200 freestyle, junior Aaron Robinson of El Camino Real won for 
the third year in a row in 1:50.41, only .09 ahead of Eric Cole of Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I got it on the last stroke," Robinson said. "I knew it would be 
close from the start. I looked over each time I took a breath and he stayed 
right with me." 
</P>

really nervous," Mababa said. "Now I'm just really, really happy." 
</P>

 Henry Showers, who breezed to victory in the 500 freestyle and 200 individual 
medley, led Venice to the boys' team title by a narrow margin over second-place

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: MAHER, FRESNO STATE HOMING IN ON SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After her Fresno State softball team lost a Western Athletic Conference 
championship bid by dropping a doubleheader at Cal State Northridge last week, 
shortstop Kim Maher was relieved that the Bulldogs were still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (45-14) is playing host to the NCAA Region 6 tournament, which 
will begin Friday. Being at home is a bonus for the sixth-ranked Bulldogs, who 
finished 21-5 in the WAC behind No. 3 Northridge (21-3) and No. 9 Utah (22-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple days ago, I was just happy to get the chance to get back to the 
World Series," Maher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Buena High standout has been to two College World Series with 
Fresno State, which finished third each time. She will compete in a third if 
the Bulldogs can advance past California, Oregon and Central Michigan this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 For Maher, a senior who is batting .435 and leads Fresno State in eight 
offensive categories, there is no place like home -- especially when you 
compare Bulldog Diamond (capacity 2,400) to Matador Diamond, which featured a 
few hecklers in Northridge's 1-0 and 2-0 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Our field) gets crowded and all you see is red, for Fresno State," Maher 
said. "It's like a big family reunion. The fans are a little more respectful to 
the players. They're there just to watch good softball. They're not there to 
bash on anyone's performance or what they look like or what team they're from." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldog Coach Margie Wright was visibly upset at her team between games, but 
she also defended her players and complained to CSUN officials about abusive 
fans down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wright was mad) because we weren't playing up to our potential and the fact 
that we had to play in a place where you don't get any respect for being a 
ballplayer," Maher said. "That does have an effect on your playing ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State stranded seven runners in the first game. Maher, who went 0 for 6 
in the doubleheader, struck out with none out and the bases loaded in the first 
inning against Jennifer Richardson in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 But now it's home sweet home for Maher and the Bulldogs, who have won each of 
the past six regional tournaments in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Maher likely will settle for nothing less than another regional title and CWS 
berth. With what she's accomplished, a national title is all that's left. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year starter holds four records at the Division I power: home runs 
(31), doubles (50), runs batted in (179) and runs (162). 
</P>
<P>
 She also expects to finish with the second-highest batting average (currently 
.346, behind Julie Smith's .359 average over two seasons) and total hits (279 
to Martha Noffsinger's 327). 
</P>
<P>
 This season, she leads the Bulldogs with 81 hits, five triples, 18 walks and a 
.737 slugging percentage. Her team-best 62 RBIs already have broken her 
single-season record (49), and her 50 runs and 16 doubles threaten records held 
by Smith (55) and Gina LoPiccolo (17). She has tailed off in home runs, 10 this 
year compared to 14 in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably been the best four years of my life," Maher said. "It's been 
incredible, and I don't think anything could really top it." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one thing left," she said. "That would be to come back here with 
a World Series title. That would top my career." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: New Mexico junior infielder Heather Medearis (Hart) led her 
team in nine offensive categories, including batting average (.397), runs (33), 
hits (58), triples (two), home runs (nine) and RBIs (34). Her first-inning solo 
home run Friday helped the Lobos knock Utah out of contention for the WAC 
championship, won the next day by Cal State Northridge. One of Medearis' home 
runs was a grand slam. She was named honorable-mention All-WAC, the Lobos' most 
valuable player, and their best offensive player for the third consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore pitcher Stacey Hart (Alemany), who was 13-5 as a freshman, is 9-7 
with a 1.89 earned-run average at Wichita State. . . . Utah senior catcher Deb 
DiMeglio (Palmdale) was selected first-team All-WAC for the third consecutive 
season. She has set career school records for home runs (26) and RBIs (119) and 
begins play in the NCAA regional this weekend with a .358 batting average and 
.981 fielding percentage. Utah freshman pitcher-infielder Cyndee Bennett 
(Glendale) set team single-season records for home runs (12) and RBIs (48) and 
was named honorable-mention All-WAC. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, senior outfielder Jason Shapiro (Taft) has led UC Davis (44-10) 
to the NCAA Division II West regional at UC Riverside. Shapiro has a .335 
batting average and leads the team in doubles (15), times hit by a pitch (16, 
tied) and stolen bases (39 of 52). 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman left-handed pitcher Justin Siegel (Taft) has 12 strikeouts in 12 2/3 
innings for North Carolina State (41-14-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Russell Ortiz (Montclair Prep) has 28 strikeouts in 32 2/3 innings for 
Oklahoma (39-15). He is second on the staff in appearances (20) and saves 
(two). . . . Freshman infielder Stacy Kleiner (Taft), overcoming a stress 
fracture in his left foot that sidelined him for 18 games, is batting .317 at 
Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Brent Overfelt (Glendale) pitched a complete game to lead Westmont to a 
6-4 victory over Cal Baptist and put the Warriors in the NAIA District 3 
tournament final last week. Overfelt is 7-3. . . . Freshman first baseman David 
Jacobs (Calabasas) is batting .298 at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore catcher Shane Slayton (Royal) is batting .348 and ranks second in 
home runs (eight) and third in RBIs (42) at Nevada. Freshman infielder Andy 
Dominique (Alemany) is batting. 322 with seven homers, and his 44 RBIs are 
second highest on the team. Freshman pitcher Chris Garza (Notre Dame) ranks 
second on the team with a 3.31 ERA in 16 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior first baseman Mike Mitchell (Rio Mesa) is batting .338 and leads UCLA 
in home runs (11) and RBIs (40). . . . Junior first baseman J.P. Roberge (St. 
Francis) is batting .316, has eight home runs, 40 RBIs and 17 stolen bases for 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman pitcher Trevor Leppard (Simi Valley) has left the University of San 
Diego for Moorpark College.

BEHIND THE SCENES; STATES OF THE 'UNION,' GLOBALLY

 A Bedouin bride is shrouded in black, covering a richly embroidered velvet 
gown underneath, in accordance with Muslin customs. In Bali, brides prepare for 
the Big Day by having their upper front teeth filed to prevent the deadly sins: 
pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth.And in China, brides 
toss watermelons from a window to symbolize getting rid of their bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Matrimonial rituals are not always as simple as compiling something old, 
something new, something borrowed and something blue, as revealed in a fashion 
show and exhibit at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana on Sunday. 
"The Passages to Union" show explored wedding traditions and bridal gowns from 
around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Much like a wedding, the event was no small undertaking. Museum coordinator 
Patricia Korzac spent six months collecting information on a subject that for 
the most part has gone undocumented. Although getting married might seem like a 
turning point, she said many cultures perceive it as less important than the 
rites of passage into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Not having books for reference didn't keep Korzac or her assistants from 
putting on an enlightening show complete with photographs, dowry gifts and 
ceremonial objects. There were exquisite gowns from Mexico, Japan, Thailand, 
Afghanistan and other lands, proving that no matter the culture or their 
economic status, a bride is lavished in the best available. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent, unfortunately, was information about what grooms wear. ROSE APODACA

STYLE FILE: STRINGING ALONG TRINKETS AND TREASURES WITH CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know they are there. You can hear them rattling around in your drawers. 
Old charms, beads and keepsakes that are too precious to toss but too small to 
really do anything with . . . or so you thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Cushner suggests you gather them together to create a necklace in which 
every little piece has meaning to you. 
</P>
<P>
 A workshop on how to make a "treasure necklace" was offered recently by 
Cushner at Timbuktu, Folk and Tribal Art in Costa Mesa. (The next workshop is 
scheduled for Saturday at the store. For more information, call (714) 650-7473. 
A $2 donation is requested.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cushner's students bring loose trinkets from home or buy items available at 
the store, such as African beads, milagros (religious votives from Mexico and 
Guatemala), Chinese bone beads and old coins.  
</P>
<P>
 Using Cushner's needles and pliers, they string or hang the trinkets on 
prestressed synthetic thread, usually completing a necklace in three to four 
hours.

 There's Dweeb, Barney, Shorty, oh, and Bam Bam. They exist for those who 
"don't want to feel like a dork," says footwear designer Eric Meyer. "They" are 
the sneakers, clogs and casual shoes (above) that are selling like mad under 
Meyer's line Simple (about $54). "The idea was to reduce down to the basics 
rather than add all the gizmos for a marketing appeal," says the former shoe 
man for Vision Sports. "I took a step backward by taking classic old styles and 
remaking them with the latest technology." It Runneth Over

 The battle of the bras continues as Maidenform lets it be known that it won't 
be flattened by British newcomer Wonderbra. After all, the New York-based 
company claims about 70% of the push-up bra market in the U.S., and its 
foundations cost almost half as much as the foreign brand. The Wonderbra 
hoopla, concedes Maidenform spokeswoman Clare McLean, "has been wonderful for 
the industry overall. We just want customers to be aware of the range of 
options." From this Monday through mid-June, the company will offer a special 
promotion in department stores nationwide asking gals to "take the plunge."

 Couture king Karl Lagerfeld may have wowed fashion fans with his faux fur 
clothes (and we're not talking coats) for fall. The clothes surprised local 
club-wear designer Mya Abbott -- but only because she's long been cutting 
corset-style vests from hairy synthetic skins ($38) for her label Paper Doll 
Productions. Her clients wrap up in leopard, burgundy, green, silver and black 
(below). "Fur is not as prevalent as velvet, but it still has a luxurious feel 
to it," says Abbott. Demand is so hot, she's added belts ($16) and shoulder 
bags ($18) to the line. Short Cuts

 The thigh's not just the limit as skirts rise dangerously high this year. The 
flirtiest of models is the A-line silhouette. In rayon or suede, the freshest 
are those that bell out slightly like something out of the Jetsons. The A-line 
takes some of the edge off straight versions which can, intentionally or not, 
look risque. ROSE APODACA JONES

SAMPLE ARITHMETIC; 'TASTE FOR LIFE' ADDS UP TO BENEFIT AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Gourmet food, fine wine and great music -- the key ingredients for a 
successful party -- were all present in abundance at the South Coast Cancer 
League's "A Taste for Life." 
</P>
<P>
 A sell-out crowd of 600 party-goers danced under a cluster of gold paper 
stars, sampled from among 140 wine selections and tasted gourmet offerings from 
21 Orange County restaurants Sunday at the Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center in 
Costa Mesa. The $125-per-person gala was expected to net more than $200,000 for 
the American Cancer Society-Orange County Unit. On Their Feet 
</P>
<P>
 For party-goers, "A Taste for Life" is not a typical black-tie gala. Instead 
of sitting for hours at a table waiting for the next course, guests are free to 
wander, going from station to station grazing food and sampling wine or just 
mingling with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get very tired of sit-down dinners with rubber chicken," said Donna Blue, a 
league founder. 
</P>
<P>
 Chefs outdid each other to impress the guests. Alan Greeley of the Golden 
Truffle, chefs coordinator, decorated his station with a starry night scene 
that matched the party invitations and served a Caribbean chicken spring roll 
and a crawfish salad with Tabasco vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Other offerings included rigatoni with lamb and spinach from Gandhi, Oriental 
salad and gnocchi from the Four Seasons Hotel, smoked salmon and homemade 
breads from Mr. Stox, seafood salad from Tutto Mare, smoked salmon lasagna from 
Claes Seafood at the Hotel Laguna, penne with vodka and spinach sauce from 
Antonello, clam chowder in a French loaf from 21 Oceanfront and a chocolate 
mousse pastry from John Dominis. International and California wineries poured 
their best vintages. Friends for Life 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Laine, a friend of ball chairwoman Mary Dell Barkouras, performed his 
classic hits, including "Jezebel," "Rawhide" and "Mule Train." 
</P>
<P>
 "He . . . wanted to do this because I lost my husband (George)) to cancer, and 
he lost his wife, and he knew how I felt," said Barkouras, who wore the purple 
Mary McFadden gown her late husband chose for their wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hart, co-host of "Entertainment Tonight" and a longtime friend of 
Barkouras, served as the evening's emcee and auctioneer.  
</P>
<P>
 Hart presented the Excalibur Award to George and Judie Argyros for their 
contributions to the cancer society, and she introduced Michael and Isabel 
Mondavi and Ted and Mary Jean Simpkins, who were also recognized for their 
support.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, guests danced to the big band sounds of Barry Cole and his Sounds of 
Music orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Taste for Life" was first held in 1989 at the Tallmantz Aviation Hangar at 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took the planes out, and we walked in. There was a 25-foot ceiling, 
concrete floor and nothing else," said Jeanne Price, former league president. 
Despite its humble origins, "Taste for Life" has raised $550,000 during the 
past few years. Proceeds, including this year's revenue, go to cancer research, 
prevention and support programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Karen Winnett, president of the South Coast Cancer 
League, and her husband, Steve; Gloria Ruston, special events manager of the 
American Cancer Society-Orange County Unit; Ed Griffin, auctioneer; Byron and 
Ronnie Allumbaugh, Donna Blue, John and Donna Crean, Donna Di Bari, Janet 
Harris, Tita Loza, Darlene McElroy, Gail Robson, Duane McKay, Mona Lee Nesseth, 
Pat and Alan Rypenski, and Ed and Linda Sherman. KATHRYN BOLD

THEATER REVIEW; 'B.L.T.': STACKED WITH YOUNG TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been done before -- casting an adult story with kids. It worked 
beautifully in the film "Bugsy Malone," featuring a pubescent Scott Baio. It 
works almost as well in Diane Christensen's adaptation of Gary White's 
"B.L.T.," with the La Habra Depot Theatre's Young Actors Company. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some sharp corners that never get smoothed out in a cast ranging in 
age from 7 to 17, but Christensen's direction is sharp throughout, her tempos 
jingle merrily, and a couple of times one is tempted to forget the cast's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a "swingin' revue of music from the roaring '20s," the musical's 
plot is as venerable. It's the kind of story Alice Faye, Don Ameche and Tyrone 
Power used to revel in. 
</P>
<P>
 When Little Sally (Danielle White) discovers some ancient artifacts -- a straw 
hat, a ukulele -- in her Grandpa Pookie's (Adam Milano) attic, she sets him 
foraging about his memories, beginning with his college days in the Jazz Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Pookie (Mike Posey) is in love with dashing Daisy Fitzgerald (Smita 
Nagak), but Daisy is head-over-heels for Teddy Rhapsody (Josh Cloud), who soon 
becomes a famous crooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy becomes a Ziegfeld star, but by the time movies become talkies, both she 
and Teddy are going downhill, reduced to dubbing voices for film stars with 
thick accents. Of course, Pookie follows Daisy throughout her ups and downs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's all tongue-in-cheek, and most of the memorable old songs, from "Ain't She 
Sweet" to "Bye Bye Blackbird" have the right flavor. Particularly in the group 
numbers, the company does well. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually the leads also do very well. Seven-year-old White is an imp of a 
granddaughter Sally, and 17-year-old Nagak's sweet soprano fits her material to 
a tee. Cloud's pompous crooner is very informed by touches of Rudy Vallee, and 
Joy Posey's speak-easy owner by a Texas Guinan flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The real standouts are 16-year-old Milano's gentle grandfather, who sparkles 
when recalling one of his vaudeville numbers, "Don't Bring Lulu," and 
especially the very talented 11-year-old Mike Posey, who really carries the 
show, has a strong pop voice and knows his way around a stage and an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * "B.L.T.," La Habra Depot Theatre, 311 S. Euclid St., La Habra. Friday and 
Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday, 2:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $8-$10. (310) 905-9708.

NATO OFFERS RUSSIA 'SPECIAL PARTNERSHIP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO agreed Wednesday to offer a "special partnership" to Russia as a way of 
overcoming its objections to joining the alliance's new military cooperation 
program for former Warsaw Pact foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were sketchy on what the special arrangement would entail, although it 
was clear it would enable Moscow to have close consultations with the allies on 
security matters and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The special relationship would be separate from the Partnership for Peace 
program, which was approved at a January summit of President Clinton and other 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders as a way mainly to draw former 
Warsaw Pact adversaries closer.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When asked if he wasn't getting enough credit for winning the Kentucky Derby, 
Go For Gin refused comment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 His rider, Chris McCarron, was not so shy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Go For Gin was shown a lack of respect when he was sent off at 9-1 
in the Derby," McCarron said. "He'd been favored in his last race, the Wood 
Memorial, and he didn't run badly." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of his two-length victory in the slop at Churchill Downs, 
more was said about the trouble several of his rivals encountered than about 
the perfect trip Go For Gin got. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He did everything right," McCarron said in the jockeys room at Hollywood 
Park. "He showed speed and then he relaxed. Then he turned it on again. 
Whatever button I pushed, he responded well." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron will be pushing the buttons again Saturday when Go For Gin attempts 
to win the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Preakness, at Pimlico in 
Baltimore. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think his chances are excellent," McCarron said. "There is the possibility 
that he got lucky in the Derby and that it was the best day of his life. But 
the record shows that he is a quality race horse, and I'm inclined to believe 
that he has got a lot more left." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, McCarron also appears to have a lot more left. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He is on a tear in stakes races and is only 19 victories away from becoming 
the 11th jockey to ride 6,000 winners. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame member says he is still learning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a terrific chat with Eddie Arcaro when I was down at Oaklawn," he said. 
"I was able to pick his brain for 2 1/2 hours." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that you'll know it immediately when you sit on somebody special. 
Well, that's how I felt when I worked Go For Gin for the first time the Sunday 
before the Derby. I got chills up and down my body." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the Preakness, McCarron will be meeting up with one of his former mounts, 
Numerous of the Charlie Whittingham barn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Numerous has a legitimate shot," McCarron said. "He'll need to show 
considerable improvement, but so many of Charlie's horses jump up and run their 
best races on the right days." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the choice between keeping Coach Barry Melrose or General Manager Nick 
Beverley, the new King owners did the right thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You would think USC, which has one of the richest athletic traditions in the 
nation, would have had a Hall of Fame long ago. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the first induction ceremony won't take place until Saturday night at a 
black-tie dinner that is expected to attract 600 people to the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Those most responsible for the establishment of the Hall of Fame are John 
Hamilton, an Orange County businessman and USC graduate, and Mike Garrett, the 
Trojans' first Heisman Trophy winner and current athletic director. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Inductees will be Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Jon Arnett, Frank Gifford, John 
McKay, Howard Jones and Marv Goux (football), Bill Sharman (basketball), Stan 
Smith (tennis), Al Geiberger (golf), Rod Dedeaux and Fred Lynn (baseball), 
Buster Crabbe (swimming), Parry O'Brien (track and field), Braven Dyer 
(sportswriting) and Norman Topping (administration). . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A personal favorite is McKay. . . .

 Angelo Dundee, who trained Muhammad Ali and has managed several world 
champions, is still as optimistic as ever about his fighters. On Monday at the 
Forum, he will send 1988 U.S. Olympian Arthur Johnson, whom he calls a 
"potential menace to members of his weight class," against second-ranked 
flyweight contender Alberto Jimenez. . . .

 Eric (Butterbean) Esch, all 330 pounds of him, will turn pro after 
participating in the Tough Man competition on pay-per-view from the MGM Grand 
on Friday. The Tough Man has produced such stalwarts as Tommy Morrison, Greg 
Haugen and Mr. T. . . .

<P>
 One reason Dodger Stadium fans are paying more attention to the action this 
month is that they're not bringing portable TV sets to watch King and Laker 
playoff games. . . .

 The Angels probably would have fired Honest Abe Lincoln.

LACHEMANN DAY LATE FOR A GEM BY FINLEY; BASEBALL: ANGEL WINS THIRD IN A ROW, 
COMBINES WITH GRAHE TO BEAT THE WHITE SOX, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spotless, starched uniform, No. 53, is hanging neatly in the empty closet 
in the Angel manager's office. The desktop is clean. The walls are bare, and 
the bathroom is clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Lachemann, the new occupant, moves in today for his first full-time 
managerial job. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad he didn't arrive a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing Lachemann enjoys more than a good old-fashioned pitchers' 
duel, and seeing his prodigy, Chuck Finley, pitch the Angels to a 3-2 victory 
over the Chicago White Sox in front of 21,230 fans at Anaheim Stadium on 
Wednesday night would have delighted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who failed to win during the first month of the season, struck out 12 
batters en route to his third consecutive victory. It was his highest strikeout 
total in five years and the most by an Angel pitcher since Mark Langston struck 
out 12 against Kansas City last May. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in swinging the bat real well and scoring a lot of runs," said 
Finley, who yielded five hits in eight innings, "so I tried to stay aggressive. 
I feel like I'm more of a power pitcher now. I'm able to get behind the ball 
and pretty much drive it where I want it to go." 
</P>
<P>
 It was vintage Finley. He was down, 2-0, in the fourth inning, having allowed 
seven baserunners, but then he retired 13 consecutive batters until the eighth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels tied the score, 2-2, in the sixth inning on Dwight Smith's two-run 
homer and went ahead on Tim Salmon's two-out, run-scoring single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley (3-3) stepped aside for Joe Grahe in the ninth. Grahe ended the game by 
striking out pinch-hitter Tim Raines with Darrin Jackson on second base, 
recording his fifth save and first since April 14. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the first time this season that the Angels (17-24) won a game in 
which they scored fewer than four runs. It enabled them to snap their four-game 
losing streak and remain three games behind the division-leading Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when it appeared that Finley's performance might go for 
naught. White Sox starter Jack McDowell finally looked like the guy who won the 
1993 Cy Young Award. He yielded only three hits and kept the Angels from 
reaching third base until Smith's homer. It was the first time this season that 
McDowell has pitched more than seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell, however, was left with just another loss when No. 9 hitter Gary 
DiSarcina ruined his night. DiSarcina, who had only three hits off McDowell 
before this season, went three for three and sparked the game-winning rally. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, who has a career-high 10-game hitting streak, hit a one-out single 
in the eighth off second baseman Joey Cora's glove. Harold Reynolds, on a 
hit-and-run, slapped a single to center, advancing DiSarcina to third base. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox Manager Gene Lamont summoned left-hander Paul Assenmacher to face 
Smith. Interim Manager Bobby Knoop, after talking in the dugout with hitting 
coach Rod Carew and third-base coach Ken Macha, decided to employ pinch-hitter 
Bo Jackson. He struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. Kirk McCaskill entered the game to face Salmon, who hit an 0-and-1 
pitch into center field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a nice welcoming present for Lachemann, but Salmon wanted everyone to 
know that Buck Rodgers, who was fired Tuesday, will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made the commitment to go with youth," Salmon said, "and I felt that 
Buck showed the temperament to go with young players. The manager takes the 
blame for everything, and it takes a lot of patience to deal with the 
inconsistencies that go along with playing young players. . . . I owe a lot to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel pitching staff is elated being reunited with Lachemann, their 
pitching coach for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about Marcel," Langston said. "I really enjoyed working with 
him. He was the kind of guy who felt bad if we didn't perform well because then 
he'd believe he didn't prepare us properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, you couldn't prepare us any better than he did. He 
gave us absolute maximum effort. I have the utmost respect for Buck, but I 
think we've very fortunate to get somebody like Marcel to step in."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; IS MCDOWELL BURIED IN THE BULLPEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda faced questions concerning his use of the bullpen 
for the second consecutive day. Lasorda relies mostly on closer Darren Dreifort 
and set-up reliever Jim Gott, often overlooking Roger McDowell.The other three 
relievers are left-handers, whom Lasorda uses in spot situations. McDowell has 
appeared in only 11 games, Dreifort has pitched in 19 and Gott in 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Dodgers' games have been close, which would seem to warrant using 
Gott or Dreifort. But in Monday night's 9-2 blowout, when Ramon Martinez had to 
leave suddenly in the seventh inning because of a stiff lower back, Gott got 
the call and Dreifort was sent in to pitch the ninth inning. At that point, 
McDowell, who is 0-2 with a 4.63 earned-run average, hadn't pitched for six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda defended his using Dreifort, saying he was warming up anyway and 
hadn't pitched since Friday. "Plus, you never know in (Mile High Stadium)," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi's single in the third inning extended his hitting streak to 10 
games, the team's longest of the season. . . . Colorado pitcher Marvin Freeman, 
who was scheduled to start Wednesday's game, was scratched because of an upper 
respiratory condition and Willie Blair took his place. . . . Ellis Burks was 
sidelined because of a sprained left wrist he suffered on a checked swing in 
his second at-bat during Tuesday's game. . . . Ramon Martinez's stiff lower 
back has improved and he appears on schedule to start Saturday. . . . Todd 
Worrell said he felt fine the day after throwing, but Lasorda said he wasn't 
sure yet if Worrell will be ready to come off the disabled list Friday. MARYANN

DIVISION V AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defending Champion: Santa Monica Crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Teams: Cerritos Valley Christian (19-3-1), Lancaster Paraclete (20-5), 
Crossroads (20-6), Thousand Oaks La Reina (14-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Whittier Christian (9-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Jennifer Abramson (Crossroads), Shane Anderson (La Reina), Anne 
Cunningham (Southern California Christian), Ashley Gayer (Paraclete), Deborah 
Goddu (Whittier Christian), Jamie Johnston (Paraclete), Jennifer Melone 
(Calvary Chapel), Tracey Milburn (Moorpark), Michelle Nuesca (La Reina), Kiana 
Peters (Murrieta Valley), Susie Schoales (Valley Christian), Jessica Schulman 
(Crossroads), Sarah Van Diest (Valley Christian), Kathy Zimmerman (Alverno). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Paraclete. Nobody is standing between the Spirits and a matchup 
with Crossroads in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Fillmore (14-7) might have to face Moorpark, Oak Park and 
Crossroads in the first three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Valley Christian started 0-3, while five of its players were busy 
winning a Southern Section Division IV-A basketball championship. Since then, 
the Crusaders have not lost and should at least match their semifinal 
appearance of last year. . . Murrieta Valley (17-4) was runner-up to Crossroads 
a year ago without a senior on its squad, and the veteran Nighthawks might 
surprise Valley Christian in the quarterfinals. . . Calvary Chapel (11-16) 
struggled against an upgraded schedule this year, but it paid off as the Eagles 
knocked off Brethren Christian in a playoff game Friday to earn a playoff 
berth.

 Defending Champion: Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Teams: Marina (21-2), Los Alamitos (21-4), Simi Valley (23-2), Pacifica 
(18-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Ocean View (17-6). Reached semifinals last year with same pitcher, 
Kathy Ponce. Most important game is the first one, in which the Seahawks battle 
Cerritos and Prom Night. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Amanda Adams (Cypress), Julie Adams (Cypress), Lynea Backlund 
(Fountain Valley), Carolina Bernal (Newbury Park), Kristi Bolle (El Modena), 
Michelle Churnock (Foothill), Lindsey Collins (Fountain Valley), Marcy Crouch 
(Marina), Laurie Fritz (Kennedy), Faith Fuata (Marina), Marie Gieron 
(Foothill), Patty Godwin (Mater Dei), Sara Griffin (Simi Valley), Wendi Griffin 
(Garden Grove), Dana Gulick (El Toro), Deborah Harrelson (Fountain Valley), 
Nikki Hart (El Dorado), Heather Hollis (San Clemente), Margaret Hollis (Mater 
Dei), Karen Hoshizaki (Cerritos), Heather Hamer (El Dorado), Chastity Johnson 
(Lompoc), Jennifer Johnson (Garden Grove), Megan Kenney (Agoura), Candace 
Kollen (Mater Dei), Misty Lauby (El Toro), Toni Mascarenas (Pacifica), Brandee 
McArthur (Villa Park), Jodi Morris (Capistrano Valley), Stefanie Noffsinger 
(Huntington Beach), Ronda Nuno (Arroyo Grande), Lisa Pitt (Kennedy), Becky Polk 
(Ocean View), Kathy Ponce (Ocean View), Chris Puccio (Orange), Linda Rodriguez 
(La Quinta), Christa Saindon (Cypress), Janee Sansone (Ocean View), Michelle 
Schneider (Los Alamitos), Robin Tessman (Foothill), Janne Thorpe (Newbury 
Park), Kelli Tom (El Dorado), Lisa Tully (Mater Dei), Lynette Velazquez 
(Marina), Carolyn Wilson (Los Alamitos), Deborah Wilson (Los Alamitos), Duffy 
White (Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Los Alamitos. Griffins feared first-round matchup with Huntington 
Beach -- the only OC team to beat Los Alamitos. They got La Quinta instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Foothill (21-6). Century League champion could face, in order, 
Huntington Beach (15-9), Kennedy (20-5-1) and Los Alamitos (21-4) to reach the 
semifinals. Huntington Beach might have the most dominant pitcher of the three 
they'll face. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Ocean View has a junior pitcher, Ponce, who could carry the Seahawks 
all the way, but the senior prom is Friday and they play Cerritos. They will be 
without catcher Racquel Willson and could be without backup Angela Burke (ill), 
and the top JV catcher is injured. They're breaking in a new catcher this week. 
Burke is also the starting shortstop.

 Defending Champion: Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Teams: San Bernardino Cajon (23-0), La Canada (20-2), Corona (21-4), Santa 
Maria St. Joseph (19-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Corona Centennial (18-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Carrie Breedlove (Burbank Bellarmine-Jefferson), Kim Bryant 
(Temecula Valley), Julie Ciccarelli (Bellarmine-Jefferson), Leticia Gamboa 
(Riverside La Sierra), Julie Gonzalez (San Pedro Mary Star of the Sea), Lindsey 
Kelly (Riverside Notre Dame), Christina Kilgore (Moreno Valley Valley View), 
Lana Moran (Cajon), Angela Navarrette (Cajon), Lindsay Parker (La Canada), 
Stefanie Ruiz (Aliso Niguel), Shakeya St. Julien (Valley View), Jackie 
Tenerelli (La Canada), Tara Thompson (Atascadero). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Mary Star opens with Aliso Niguel, then plays an overrated Corona 
team in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Defending champion Atascadero (15-8) travels to Mountain View in 
the opening round, and a victory earns it a second-round game with 
second-seeded La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Cajon and La Canada feature the division's two dominant pitchers. The 
top-seeded Cowgirls will ride the arm of sophomore Moran (21-0, 0.05 ERA, 272 
strikeouts); the Spartans rely on junior Parker (18-0, 0.00 ERA, 230 
strikeouts). . . Aliso Niguel, which has only one junior on an otherwise 
all-freshman roster, got in as an at-large team and will open at Mary Star, 
which has two-way threat Gonzalez (14-1; .493). . . Atascadero won the Division 
IV title last year and Thompson (10-4, 0.45) was the division's player of the 
year.

</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Linfield (16-4) won't face a league champion until the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Norwalk Pioneer Baptist (14-3-1) would face Cornerstone Christian 
in the second round and Linfield in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: This year's top three seeded teams (along with Linfield) advanced to 
the semifinals last season, with Templeton beating Linfield for the title. . . 
. Freeman, a junior catcher at Cate, is hitting .764 on the season and has tied 
a Southern Section single-season record with 56 runs batted in. . . . Templeton 
returns four All-CIF players, led by catcher Alary (.588) and shortstop 
Chandler (.565).

 Top Teams: Upland (22-0), Mission Hills Alemany (20-2), Irvine (17-9), 
Woodbridge (20-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Torrance (17-6). 
</P>

 Top Players: Tammy Alcantar (Alemany), Liza Brown (Rancho Cucamonga), Candi

Tabby Cleveland (Costa Mesa), Sophie Contreraz (Alemany), Ann-Marie Froysaa 
(Trabuco Hills), Amber Griego (West Covina South Hills), Diana Humphries

(Canyon Springs), Katie Scheuerman (Tustin), Kelly Smith (Upland), Alycia 
Stevens (Laguna Hills), Natalie Tomoguchi (Irvine). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Irvine. The Vaqueros won a coin toss to gain the top spot from the 
Sea View League and are the third-seeded team in the division, where they came 
out winners again with a draw that should help them advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Upland. The Highlanders should play Ivy League champion Ramona 
(22-3) in the second round and then might face San Dimas (18-1-1) in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Upland will look familiar to Orange County softball fans. The 
Highlanders beat Kennedy, Foothill and Mater Dei en route to the championship 
of the Woodbridge tournament. . . The county has only six teams in the 
division. But Irvine, Woodbridge and Laguna Hills could advance to the 
quarterfinals because each received a favorable draw. San Dimas and Isgar 
(18-1, 250 strikeouts) could surprise top-seeded Upland.

 Top Teams: Saugus (24-2-1), Hacienda Heights Wilson (26-2), La Puente Bishop 
Amat (18-3), Lakewood (21-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: La Mirada (20-5-1).Sound defense, adequate pitching, enough power 
to end a game with one swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Gina Arnold (Hawthorne), Angela Bessolo (Lakewood), Shannon 
Carlson (Magnolia), Linda Carrillo (La Mirada), Erica Christensen (Newhall 
Hart), Tracy Clark (Hart), Carrie Davis (Bellflower), Angie Fancuberta

(Lakewood), Amy Tanner (La Mirada), Chrissy Vega (Savanna), Cristy Waring (La 
Mirada), Sherell Watson (Bellflower). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Bishop Amat. La Mirada provides stiffest challenge on the road to 
the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Fullerton (14-13). Freeway League champion gets Lakewood in the 
second round and probably Bellflower (19-5-2) in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Sunny Hills lost to La Mirada, its first-round opponent, 8-0, this 
season. . .Saugus' only losses were back-to-back to Marina and Fountain Valley, 
4-1 and 7-1, in midseason. The Centurions already have beaten third-seeded 
Bishop Amat, 1-0. . . Lakewood has beaten Division I power Los Alamitos, 8-3. . 
. Dogged by injuries most of the season, Los Altos -- the third entry from the 
Miramonte League -- was healthy for its final game against Wilson and beat the 
Wildcats, 2-1. At the time, Wilson was ranked fifth in the state.

DIVISION III WILD-CARD GAME; TUSTIN DOESN'T GET CALL OR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The difference between victory and defeat for Tustin might have been the 
distance from Katie Scheuerman's wrists to her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Paul (Smokey) Edds overruled his umpiring partner, declaring Scheuerman 
did not have control of the ball on a force play at third, and it led to five 
unearned runs and Chino's 5-4 victory over Tustin Wednesday in a Division III 
wild-card softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino (12-14), third in the Baseline League, advanced to a first-round game 
against Rancho Cucamonga on Friday. 
</P>

 Tustin (12-8), third in the Sea View, went home.  
</P>
<P>
 "That play changed the whole complexion of the game," Chino Coach Leo Leon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With runners at first and second, third baseman Kristin Kirkwood fielded 
Carrie Black's bunt and whipped a throw to Scheuerman, the shortstop covering 
third base. The throw short-hopped Scheuerman, who trapped the ball against her 
chest with her wrists. Runner Arleen Felix was called out by the base umpire 
behind the play, but on appeal, Edds, the home plate umpire, overruled the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was pinned with her wrist against her body and that doesn't 
constitute possession of the ball," Edds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Coach Jerry Hoffman put up a mild protest over the changed call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they might score a run or two, but not five," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bases-loaded walk, an error, an RBI grounder, a squeeze bunt, another RBI 
grounder. Five runs, one hit, four errors. 
</P>
<P>
 That bizarre sequence followed a frustrating first inning. Tustin loaded the 
bases with none out, but failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most important thing for us," Leon said. "We've only come from 
behind one time all season long." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, its players making their first playoff appearance, had eight hits to 
Chino's three. The Tillers stranded four runners in scoring position, and 
closed the gap only because freshman Jenny Odum hit a two-run homer, her fourth 
of the season, in the seventh. Odum had struck out in three previous at-bats 
with five runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
 After singles by Kirkwood and Scheuerman, Erin Hayes had an RBI double in 
Tustin's two-run third inning.

 CITY SECTION TEAM GOLF FINAL 
</P>
<P>
 * Today's schedule: The section's top teams will tee off at noon at Knollwood 
Country Club in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year's champions: Team -- Granada Hills. Individual -- Darren Angel, 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The top two teams qualify for the CIF-Southern California Golf 
Assn. championship next month at Redlands Country Club. But the most 
interesting aspect of this tournament is Angel. Earlier this week, the junior 
player won a U.S. Open preliminary qualifying tournament in Bakersfield with a 
one-under par 71. Last month at Knollwood, he broke the course record with a 
nine-under 63 and he has not been over par all season there. ERIC SHEPARD

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: PLAY AT HOME MIRRORED YEAR OF FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Shanahan was face down, eating dirt at home plate. He had just been shot 
down for the final out as Fresno State held on for an 8-7 victory over the Cal 
State Northridge baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Matadors, it also marked the final out of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kept alive to the bitter end was the season's enduring theme: Everything That 
Could Go Wrong, Did. 
</P>
<P>
 The final inning capped a season of frustration. With Northridge trailing by a 
run, Shanahan and Keyaan Cook each lined two-out singles off reliever Scott 
Warembourg, setting the stage for Josh Smaler. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 26, Smaler belted a two-run homer off Warembourg in the bottom of the 
ninth at Northridge to hand the Matadors a 3-2 victory. The Fresno State radio 
crew noted Smaler's feat. The crowd held its breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler came through again -- almost. 
</P>
<P>
 He drilled a single into right field. Bryan Judice -- who had four hits and 
has the best arm among the Bulldog outfielders -- fielded the ball cleanly and 
came up firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan got the green light at third, but was tossed out by several feet at 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do?" Smaler said. "You've got to go for it. You can't be passive 
at this point. We had nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (25-30, 12-12 in Western Athletic Conference play) lost its fourth 
game in a row and its sixth in seven. The Matadors finished below .500 for the 
first time since 1988, when they were 22-33. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole season has been so frustrating," Smaler said. "Just hard to 
believe." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's Moment 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Moreno, take a bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, a walk-on infielder pressed into service because of injuries to 
several teammates, finished the season by hitting safely in nine of his last 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the highlight of the year for me," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, the designated hitter in the Fresno series, also caught the attention 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even (Fresno State Coach Bob) Bennett asked me, 'Who's this Moreno guy?' " 
Kernen said. "He's done everything we could have asked." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, a junior transfer from Long Beach City College, finished 11 for 49 
(.224) with three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hicks' winning, personal-best throw of 60 feet 6 3/4 inches in the 
Flagstaff Invitational last week moved him to third place on the all-time 
Matador shotput list. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, a senior, improved his previous best of 59-11 to become the fourth 
Northridge athlete to crack the 60-foot barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Joe Staub (63-1 in 1979), Brian Faul (62-5 1/2 in '83) and 
Steve Albright (60-6 1/2 in '76). JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Desperation Time 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Mission baseball team managed to stretch its Southern California 
regional series to three games against Rancho Santiago last weekend, Free 
Spirit Coach John Klitsner would have been hard-pressed to find a starting 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we would have done," Klitsner said after the Dons defeated 
Mission, 13-10, Sunday in the second game of the best-of-three set. The third 
game would have followed immediately. "Is Osvaldo sitting out there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner was referring to Cuban defector Osvaldo Fernandez, a left-hander who 
pitched in one game for the Free Spirit early in the season before quitting to 
pursue a professional opportunity. Fernandez still hasn't signed a contract and 
apparently will wait to be chosen in the June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission (26-17) used ace right-hander Ray Rivera (12-3) in an 8-4 loss to 
Rancho Santiago on Saturday, and Nos 2 and 3 starters Robert Ballester (6-2) 
and John Romero (5-5) on Sunday. Klitsner said he probably would have changed 
pitchers every two or three innings if the teams had played a third game. CAL 
LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 All the Right Moves 
</P>
<P>
 The right players were positioned in the wrong places. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Coach Marty Slimak had an uneasy feeling after the Kingsmen dropped 
their season opener, 9-8, in a game against Azusa Pacific early in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't look right out there," Slimak said. "(The lineup) didn't feel 
right, either." 
</P>
<P>
 And so started a game of musical players: 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sebbo was moved from catcher to third base; Mike Shwartzer vacated first 
base to take over behind the plate; John Becker was inserted into the lineup at 
first base; Joe Gordon switched from third base into a platoon at second base, 
and Ed Campaniello moved from second base to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we made those moves, everything just clicked," Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebbo is batting .374. He leads the team with 14 doubles and is second with 45 
runs batted in while committing only eight errors. Shwartzer, who attended San 
Diego State and Cal State Northridge before transferring to Cal Lutheran, is 
batting .358 and has made only four errors with seven passed balls. Becker has 
10 home runs, 33 RBIs and a .362 average. Campaniello is batting .333. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those changes turned our season around," said Slimak, whose team is 29- 6-1. 
"I'm glad we made them early." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever team wins the best-of-five series between Cal Lutheran and UC San 
Diego in the NCAA Division III West Regional starting Friday will be going 
against the odds at the national tournament in Battle Creek, Mich., May 26-31. 
</P>
<P>
 No team west of the Mississippi has claimed a Division III baseball 
championship since Cal State Stanislaus won back-to-back titles in 1976 and 
'77. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran came closest to breaking that string, losing in the last inning 
of the championship game against William Paterson College of New Jersey in 
1992. The Kingsmen also qualified for the tournament last season, but lost 
their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran and UC San Diego, which are among only 11 Division III baseball 
teams west of Colorado and play Friday in a West Regional game, usually meet 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time they faced each other was 1992, also in the West Regional, and 
the Kingsmen won in four games. The first three had dramatic finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran won the first game, 4-3, in 10 innings; lost the second, 3-2, in 
10 innings, and won the third, 8-7, in 10 innings, before winning a 12-2 
blowout in the final meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief pitcher Tim Barber, a senior, is the only holdover from that Cal 
Lutheran team.

</P>
<P>
 When the Valley College men's and women's cross-country programs were dropped 
this week, it marked the end of a proud sports tradition at the school, 
particularly on the men's side. The Monarchs won state titles in 1968, '69 and 
'70 and have produced more top-five individual finishes (16) at the state meet 
than any school except Grossmont (21), whose program was disbanded last year.

CITY HALL NEWS: ARCADIA; FEUDING MARKS CITY COUNCIL SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the genteel community of Arcadia, where any battles usually take place on 
Santa Anita racetrack, the City Council chamber has become the backdrop for a 
war of words between the newly elected members and old hands. 
</P>
<P>
 New and old council members have been locking horns since a bitterly contested 
election last month in which two incumbents were voted out of office and three 
newcomers gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks began to fly at the first meeting, when new members Mary B. Young, 
Barbara Kuhn and Sheng Chang chose Young to be mayor, going against tradition 
that dictates giving the position to the mayor pro tem, in this case Councilman 
Dennis A. Lojeski. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no communication going on between the council members. 
It's a very unhealthy situation," Lojeski said. "It deteriorated to where I 
made 10 phone calls to Dr. (Sheng) Chang and he didn't return one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman R. C. (Bob) Margett, whose nomination of Lojeski for mayor failed, 
responded by raising concerns about a new mayor unfamiliar with existing plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Lojeski chastised Chang for saying in his opening speech that 
the city is in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our city is not in serious trouble. Please do your homework," Lojeski chided 
Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council's second session May 3, Lojeski and Margett refused to go along 
with the formality of excusing Chang, who was not in attendance. "He didn't 
extend the courtesy of telling me where he was going," Lojeski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lojeski later successfully called for an investigation by the city clerk of 
charges of election fraud. The charges had been made by Carole Ciraulo, the 
wife of defeated Councilman Joseph Ciraulo, in a letter to the secretary of 
state and named Chang as being involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the election campaign, the three who eventually won had charged 
that the council had run down reserves while giving large pay raises to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will change," Chang said optimistically. "Their memories of the 
election are still fresh. I expect the hostility to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said that he did leave a note asking council members to excuse him May 3 
because he had to attend a wedding in Japan. As to the election fraud 
allegations, an investigation by City Clerk June D. Alford rejected all the 
allegations in Ciraulo's letter with the exception of the charge that 21 
non-citizens at a retirement home had voted. Alford said federal officials are 
still checking records. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arcadia group said Tuesday it will file a legal challenge to the election 
result later today, the deadline for such challenges. "It has been determined 
that at present there is enough evidence of election fraud to file an election 
contest with the county clerk," said Geri Fasching, spokeswoman for Citizens 
for Fair Voting and wife of defeated councilman George Fasching.

<P>
 ARCADIA: The city has received an application from Santa Anita Park requesting 
an amendment to Arcadia's zoning laws to allow entertainment other than horse 
racing at the track. The proposal would allow single or multi-day events, 
festivals and concerts. Track officials say they are considering a three-day 
festival over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 AZUSA: The City Council has taken the first steps toward expanding the 
20,000-square-foot city library. The council voted to have staff prepare a 
feasibility study on expanding the facility, built in 1957, and to seek 
proposals for an architect. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: In an effort to help overcome the city's financial problems, the City 
Council has established a committee to review the fiscal 1994-95 budget and to 
make recommendation on ways to increase revenues and decrease costs. The 
council also voted to require its members to hold town hall meetings and keep 
regular office hours at City Hall on a trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 IRWINDALE: The City Council has decided that the Duarte-based City of Hope 
National Medical Center must pay the city's utility tax because the meter for a 
new electrical substation for the cancer research center is in Irwindale. The 
council unanimously denied the hospital's request for an exemption from the 
7.5% tax, suggesting the City of Hope put the meter outside Irwindale.  
</P>
<P>
 LA PUENTE: The deputy city clerk has sworn in John Brennan and Richard McInnis 
as planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: The City Council has allotted extra money to two projects. The 
council, after voicing its unhappiness with the architectural firm, gave an 
extra $55,000 for the construction of the Barnes Park Bathhouse because of 
errors in design. It also gave $6,548 to complete a structural repair to the 
library. A contractor repairing the library discovered that some of the masonry 
was not reinforced with steel rods as required in the 1960 plans. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: The City Council has approved a long-awaited plan to revitalize the 
city's downtown area. The council approved the Pomona Downtown Specific Plan, 
designed to bring the downtown economy back to life with dining, shopping and 
entertainment. The plan covers the area between Holt Avenue and Mission 
Boulevard and between White and Towne avenues.

CULTURAL CENTER BECOMES A SYMBOL OF POLITICAL DEBATE; ASIA: SOME SEE $3-MILLION 
FACILITY IN EL MONTE AS A HAVEN FOR OVERSEAS CHINESE. BUT PRO-INDEPENDENCE 
TAIWANESE LOYALISTS SEE IT AS AN INSULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty when it comes to the Chinese Cultural Center in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say the $3-million facility built by the Taiwanese government is a haven 
where overseas Chinese can rekindle ties with their historic culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, who believe Taiwan should be independent of China, see the center 
as a slap in the face. They want it renamed the Taiwanese Cultural Center to 
reflect who funded the facility, with its 900-seat theater, classrooms and a 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 They also accuse center officials of discriminating against them because of 
their political views. As evidence, they claim that center officials have not 
made rooms available when they call to schedule meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They intentionally discourage (pro-independence) Taiwanese Americans from 
using the center; a lot of us don't want to do any activities under that flag," 
said Jack Liu of Palos Verdes, president of the Collegiate Alumni Assn. of 
Taiwan, referring to the Taiwanese flag that adorns the center's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 To draw attention to their concerns, Liu and other pro-independence Taiwanese 
Americans planned a press conference today at a San Gabriel restaurant. Some 
said they will boycott the center until the name is changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Liao, director of the center, denied Liu's claim and said the center 
welcomes all overseas Chinese organizations. He said thousands of Chinese 
Americans use the center each week to take out books, hold conferences or learn 
calligraphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to serve people, welcome people, regardless of their political 
associations, Liao said. "I have no grudge with them. I respect their opinions. 
But there is a current reality existing. What will happen in the future we 
can't tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate offers a rare public peek at the complex political crosscurrents 
battering Taiwan today that have blown across the Pacific to pit many of the 
500,000 to 600,000 overseas Chinese in Southern California against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side stand pro-independence Taiwanese Americans such as Liu who think 
that Taiwan's 21 million people should forget about negotiating a reunification 
with the People's Republic of China and declare themselves a free and separate 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are Taiwanese Americans such as Marina Tse, president of the 
Chinese American Educator's Assn. Tse, whose father was a senator in Taiwan, 
supports the government, which seeks an eventual reunification with mainland 
China under a non-communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sensitive issue," Tse said. But, referring to those favoring a 
free and separate Taiwan, she said: "Their ancestors moved from mainland China, 
so when they claim they're not Chinese and they want to be independent, I don't 
feel they're justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle are people such as Louis Kuan of Alhambra, who is 
president of the Chinese Americans Voter Education Foundation. Kuan's parents 
were born in mainland China. He was born in Taiwan. He sees himself as both 
Taiwanese and Chinese, comparing it to being an American and a Texan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel perplexed and very ambivalent; it's a touchy situation," he said. "But 
whatever happens to the destiny of Taiwan, it should be in the voters' hands. 
It's not up to us in America or overseas to determine what they should be 
called." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuan said the center provides a valuable service by giving people of Chinese 
origin in the San Gabriel Valley a place to meet and sponsor events, 
functioning as an unofficial town square. 
</P>
<P>
 Bao-Tyan Wang, a professor in clinical sciences at Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
used the facility last month to hold a symposium on high-tech products. Wang 
said the debate has not affected his willingness to use the center because his 
interests lie more in academia than politics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liu claims that when his group held a conference there last year, the 
lights and the air conditioning went out suddenly, leading him to suspect that 
the center was trying to sabotage him, a charge that center officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26,500-square-foot center, located in an industrial park, opened in 
December, 1992, and is one of two run by the Coordination Council for North 
American Affairs, Taiwan's unofficial consulate in the United States. There is 
a second center in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China. Mainland China, under its communist 
government, is the People's Republic of China. The feud between the two dates 
back 50 years, to when Mao Tse Tung's communists fought Chiang Kai-shek's 
Kuomintang party for control of the mainland.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1949, Mao had won and the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan, where they established 
a government in exile with the aim of eventually returning to the mainland once 
communism had been vanquished. They are still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the political differences, strong ties remain between the two nations 
separated by just 90 miles of water. More than 1.5 million Taiwanese visited 
mainland China last year and spent $600 million. Taiwan is China's biggest 
investor, with $11 billion in joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Taiwanese Americans here have entrenched themselves in the 
conflict, others believe the debate is being blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people here are too busy for politics," Tse said. "They're just 
struggling to survive."

 To the surprise of regional water authorities and the indignation of 
environmentalists, the operators of the controversial Azusa landfill have 
announced they will reopen the dump to household and municipal waste.

 "We never saw the train coming," said Rod Nelson, head of the Los Angeles 
Regional Water Quality Control Board's landfill division. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and local water officials thought they had heard the last of 
the Azusa landfill three years ago when its operators lost a court battle to 
dump household waste in a proposed 302-acre expansion. Opponents said the 
dumping would threaten the region's underground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and water officials believed the state Court of Appeal 
ruling meant the end to residential and commercial waste other than 
construction and demolition debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say officials at Browning Ferris Industries Inc., whose subsidiary 
Azusa Land Reclamation Co. operates the landfill in an old rock quarry south of 
the Foothill (210) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill operators say the court order and subsequent instructions from the 
State Water Resources Control Board allow dumping of household waste in the 
existing 80-acre landfill and the placing of inert construction materials in 
the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reopening of this landfill to household waste is imminent," said Les 
Bittenson, vice president of Browning Ferris Industries of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Bittenson said his firm stopped dumping household waste only because the 
original site was thought to be full. But through new mapping technologies and 
the decomposing of waste, the firm discovered it still has room for 3.2 million 
tons of trash, or 160,000 truckloads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take six or seven years at about 2,000 tons a day, five days a 
week to close out the original site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional water board first heard of the landfill operator's plans May 9. 
The board could not issue a notice to delay the reopening because the issue was 
not on the agenda, but the board did ask its attorneys to review the legality 
of a reopening to household trash, water officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board believed there was no room in the landfill, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the landfill operator is correct, the water board might prefer that the new 
dumping go into the expansion area, which has a triple liner to prevent damage 
to ground water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill sits atop a huge aquifer that supplies water used by 1 million 
San Gabriel Valley residents. The aquifer is also the nation's biggest 
Superfund site because of contamination from industrial solvents and degreasing 
agents. BFI officials say 10 years of testing show that the landfill is not to 
blame for the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In vetoing the dumping of potentially toxic wastes in the expansion, the 
three-judge panel wrote that the dump expansion "could cause numerous and 
substantial adverse changes" in the San Gabriel Basin, including "contamination 
of a public drinking water supply." 
</P>
<P>
 The Azusa City Council voted unanimously Monday to ask the regional water 
board to attempt to delay any opening of the landfill to household trash while 
the city assesses what action it can take.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a bad idea to put a trash landfill over a water supply," said 
Mayor Stephen J. Alexander. However, the city could make $1 million a year from 
a reopening of the landfill for household trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said they are still concerned about the possible dangers. 
"It's a bad day for Azusa. It's bad for our children and anyone else who has to 
drink our water in future years," said Jim McJunkin, a leader of Azusa-based 
Save the Foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This landfill is right over an aquifer. Needless to say I am not exactly 
ecstatic about it reopening," said Dr. Forrest Tennant, a former West Covina 
councilman who led the campaign against the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennant said he had met with the landfill's operators and is seeking advice 
from other activists on what action to take.

ELECTIONS; SENATE RACE FOCUSES ON BEACH CITIES; THE 28TH DISTRICT INCLUDES 
INLAND AREAS, BUT CANDIDATES EMPHASIZE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES TO ATTRACT VOTERS 
IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

 State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) promotes his opposition to oil field 
development in state tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Councilman George Nakano trumpets his endorsement from the Sierra 
Club and the California League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Public interest attorney Mike Sidley takes a tour of Santa Monica Bay, 
pointing out its most notorious polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28th State Senate District may include the inland areas of Carson, Compton 
and Torrance, but candidates are fighting it out in the beach cities, where 
they are hoping that a strong environmental stand resonates with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The environment "is a potent issue in the beach cities," Republican consultant 
Allan Hoffenblum said. "(Residents) want to clean up the bay. They don't want 
to see offshore oil drilling." 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth candidate, Jo Ann Rodda, has not emphasized environmental issues. But 
she notes that as a real estate broker in Manhattan Beach, she is familiar with 
the concerns of beach city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts say that Dills, 84, can expect to maintain a stronghold in 
the district's inland areas, including Compton, Carson and Wilmington. He has 
represented those areas at some point in his legislative and judicial career, 
which dates to 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 But by his own account, he is not known to as many as two-thirds of the voters 
in the 28th District, where he chose to seek reelection after his Gardena-area 
district was carved up in the 1992 reapportionment. Many of Dills' billboards, 
with the slogan "Too Old to Quit" and a picture of him playing the saxophone, 
were placed in the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fewer people know who I am than normal," said the gravel-voiced senator. 
"That's a disadvantage that I have to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has tried to use his longevity as an asset. He helped create Cal State 
Long Beach and the State Teachers Retirement System. During World War II, he 
refused to support the creation of Japanese internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people have any judgment, they will know that just because you are old, it 
should not be a negative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills points out that he has been praised by other senators for getting 
approval from the Government Organization Committee, which he chairs, for a ban 
on new oil drilling in state waters. And in a campaign brochure he cites 
legislation he is writing to save redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, someone my age has to defend something their age," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his effort to take a more friendly approach to environmental issues, 
Dills is on the League of Conservation Voters' hit list of incumbents to 
defeat. The political action group cites his campaign contributors as "a 
veritable who's who of polluters." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, however, defends his record on environmental issues and his current 
campaign approach. "I vote the district," he said. "When you run for office, 
you determine what is the will and the wish of the constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano, 58, has harshly attacked Dills' environmental record, including his 
acceptance this year of $2,500 in contributions from oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have much conviction in what he is doing," said Nakano, a former 
school administrator. "His actions are entirely political." 
</P>
<P>
 If he is elected, Nakano would be the first Asian American in the Senate since 
the 1970s. He is expected to get strong support in Torrance and among Asian 
American groups, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano said that he has formed a business advisory group -- which includes the 
president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce -- to come up with 
ways to improve the state's business environment. 
</P>
<P>
 He says no necessary contradiction exists between being business-friendly and 
pro-environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the environment is bad, businesses will not want to move in. People won't 
want to live here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also calling for further reform of the workers' compensation system and 
more tax incentives for companies to stay in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nakano, like Dills, has little name recognition in the beach cities, which 
have 37% of the Democrats in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley, 32, a member of the Los Angeles County Environmental Crimes Sentencing 
Task Force, says that he will fight for funding of the Santa Monica Bay 
Restoration Project, a bay cleanup plan. He also advocates a ban on handguns 
and a 50% tax on ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are ready for (the ban) here, in the state and in the nation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodda, 53, is running on a platform of legal reform after a bitter divorce 
four years ago. Her campaign calls for removing divorce from the courts and 
putting it in the hands of a government agency with no fees. She also proposes 
that the California State Bar be replaced by a consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very difficult time keeping up," Rodda said of balancing her legal 
hassles, the campaign and business responsibilities. "But is there any doubt 
that I can get the job (as state senator) done? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary will face Republican lawyer David Barrett Cohen, who 
is unopposed in his party's race. The district is heavily Democratic, but 
Republicans see a chance to win. Their choice to win the Democratic primary? 
Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The age issue will be very, very strong," Hoffenblum said. "He will be the 
easiest to defeat."

TOUGH BUDGET CHOICES REMAIN FOR INGLEWOOD SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wanda Soto's classroom at Woodworth Elementary in Inglewood is decorated with 
the crayon-paper-glue art that only first-graders can master. The signs are 
happy: Hola! Hello! 
</P>
<P>
 Soto, who spent $50 of her own money on the supplies, is proud of the busy, 
inviting atmosphere. This is her first job and she says it suits her. Except 
she would like some more textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of town, Hudnell Elementary Principal Michael Adelman bought 
the stack of trash bags that classrooms will need until school is out next 
month. "I'll eventually get reimbursed when we get some petty cash around 
here," he said. "Sometimes we can borrow supplies from other schools, but 
everybody's low."  
</P>
<P>
 Such is the tight state of finances in the Inglewood School District as it 
rounds the bend toward the end of a bumpy fiscal year. Yet, because of 
personnel and supply cuts, the district will finish the 1993-94 school year 
with about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news for a district that can use some: Last fall, county 
education officials assigned a fiscal adviser to the district when it teetered 
toward insolvency with a $2-million deficit. State officials cited poor 
leadership and bad management practices as reasons the district failed to 
anticipate its budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 To get out of trouble, the district closed Hillcrest Continuation School, laid 
off 18 teachers and 11 staff members and cut supplies, including textbooks. And 
it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not out of danger yet," said school board President Loystene Irvin. 
The proposed 1994-95 budget includes $1.8 million more in expenditures than the 
district expects in revenue, even with the $2-million carry-over from this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Income from the state is not definite yet. "Between now and June 30 we don't 
ever know what's going to happen," said Kermet Dixson, assistant superintendent 
for business services. "We just hope it doesn't get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 District finance officials say they've already cut to the bone and now must 
turn to the messy prospect of renegotiating teacher benefits to balance the 
budget before June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be very few opportunities for reduction," Dixson said. "We 
can't have wholesale layoffs. There aren't that many people left."  
</P>
<P>
 About 87% of the district's budget is tied up in salaries and benefits; 
another 9% is dedicated to hard such as utilities that can't be argued. 
</P>
<P>
 A state panel of experts sent to review the district in October pointed to 
work contracts and free health insurance for all employees' dependents as 
fiscally impractical. Last year, the district renegotiated the benefits for 
classified personnel but not for teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Dixson said the school board will be presented with budget reductions 
Wednesday and said a benefits renegotiation package is scheduled to be 
presented to the unions in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives did not return repeated telephone calls.  
</P>
<P>
 Some school board members wonder why Inglewood is again facing a painful 
budget balancing act. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kinds of things that got us into difficulty with the county and state 
should have been anticipated," said Larry Aubry, a board member for six years. 
"Somehow as a district we were not as vigilant as we needed to be. The board 
relies on the staff to inform it, but I guess these decisions are just too 
important to rely on other people for." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Dexter Henderson said at a recent budget workshop that the board 
needs to develop a philosophy on how the district should spend money.  
</P>
<P>
 Aubry agreed. "We are still reactive. We are not saying, 'These are the areas 
we want to put our dough into.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just how the board will set priorities depends on what kind of person takes 
the reins from Supt. George J. McKenna III when his contract expires at the end 
of next month, Aubry said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have not had the kind of communication and accountability that is 
required," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 But Dixson points to the state's recent crisis in funding education as the 
real issue. "They can tell us to make five-year budget plans and that sounds 
good, but when you don't know what kind of money is really coming in, it 
doesn't mean much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district would not be facing such a deficit if only enrollment hadn't gone 
down by 300 students, which translated to almost $1 million less revenue from 
the state, Dixson said. State money is based on the number of students who 
attend each day.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea why enrollment went down across grade levels as it did in the 
last semester," Dixson said. "We thought it might be the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, teachers and principals in the district's 18 schools must continue 
teaching about 16,695 children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good teacher can teach skills with just a blackboard and chalk," said 
Woodworth Elementary Principal Lacy Alexander. But textbooks help, he admits.

A DRIVING FORCE BEHIND EFFORT TO HELP BOSNIAN WAR VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Santa Monica tow truck driver Stewart Resmer put out a call last month 
for relief supplies for Bosnian war victims, hundreds of people throughout Los 
Angeles brought tons of food, clothing and medical supplies to Berth 53 in San 
Pedro. But the supplies wound up sitting on the wharf with no way to get to 
their destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, the more than five tons of relief supplies are on a ship 
somewhere between Savannah, Ga., and the Adriatic Sea. They are not bound 
directly for Bosnia but for a church organization in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Resmer figures that's close enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable with it," said Resmer, 43, who started the relief drive last 
month on an impulse. "I think (the supplies) are going to get to people who 
need them." 
</P>
<P>
 But given the conflicts and suspicions between Bosnian Muslims, largely Roman 
Catholic Croatians and largely Eastern Orthodox Christian Serbs, not everyone 
is convinced that relief supplies sent to a Croatian church organization will 
wind up in any Bosnian Muslim hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The supply shipment) probably will go mostly to Croatian people," said Subha 
Sulejmanagic of Culver City, a Bosnian Muslim who emigrated to the United 
States nearly three decades ago and is active in Bosnian relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But a representative of the Croatian community in Los Angeles said the relief 
supplies will be distributed to needy people in the war-ravaged areas of Bosnia 
regardless of ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian church group won't distinguish between needy people of any 
ethnicity, said Vladimir Lonza, secretary-treasurer of the Croatian American 
Club in San Pedro, which arranged transportation for the shipment. "They will 
give (the supplies) to whoever needs them." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to send relief supplies began in April, when Resmer asked a Santa 
Monica public radio station to broadcast an appeal to bring food, clothing and 
medical supplies to San Pedro. Resmer, a Vietnam War veteran with no 
international relief experience, hoped to load the supplies aboard the Lane 
Victory, a restored World War II cargo ship that was scheduled to sail to 
Europe for D-Day 50th anniversary ceremonies. Resmer had done volunteer 
restoration work aboard the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the World War II merchant marine veterans who own the Lane Victory nixed 
the idea, saying Resmer's plan to take the relief supplies to Europe and give 
them to international relief agencies for transfer to Bosnia was impractical. 
The Lane Victory left Los Angeles Harbor on April 30 but had to return earlier 
this week because of engine problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, carloads of relief supplies ranging from diapers to crutches to 
canned goods had been brought to the wharf. The supplies sat under tarps with 
no apparent means of getting to Bosnia.  
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian American Club eventually stepped in to help Resmer, paying about 
$2,600 for a shipping container and freight charges. Some donated clothing was 
held back and will be shipped later, Resmer said, because clothing was not 
considered critical. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for A. Hartrodt (USA), a San Pedro shipping company, confirmed 
that the relief shipment was sent by rail to Savannah and loaded aboard a ship 
called the Sarajevo Express, which departed May 8. The relief supplies will be 
delivered to the Croatian port of Rijeka in about a month and then taken to 
Split, another Croatian coastal city. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonza said the supplies will be delivered to Kruh Svetoga Ante, or "Bread of 
St. Anthony," a Catholic church organization in Split that performs relief work 
in Bosnia.

NASH AMONG SIX FINALISTS FOR INGLEWOOD SCHOOLS CHIEF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood school district trustees have selected six finalists for 
superintendent, including McKinley Nash, the former Lawndale superintendent who 
was fired amid allegations of racial tension in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash was among 31 applicants for the position now held by George J. McKenna 
III, whose contract expires next month. Other finalists include a deputy 
superintendent in Compton and a Torrance occupational school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood schools are facing many problems, including violence, ethnic tension 
and calls for more bilingual teachers. In addition, the district has been beset 
by financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day last August that school trustees voted 3-2 not to renew McKenna's 
contract, county education officials announced they were assigning a fiscal 
overseer to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members narrowed the list of candidates to six at a May 3 
meeting, said Wilson Riles, the former state schools superintendent hired to 
find Inglewood's new top administrator. Trustees were to interview the 
finalists today and Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates were selected because of their experience working in a multiethnic 
district and handling finances, Riles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other finalists are Thelma Moore, deputy superintendent of the Compton 
Unified School District; Eunice (Elizabeth) Nash, superintendent of the 
Southern California Regional Occupational Center; Joseph B. Crawford, assistant 
superintendent of the San Gabriel Unified School District; Linda T. 
Fortenberry, associate superintendent of New Orleans Public Schools in 
Louisiana, and Julian Lopez, former superintendent of the Mountain View 
Elementary School District in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nashes are not related. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley Nash, who is an administrator for the Assn. of California School 
Administrators, served as superintendent of Centinela Valley Union High School 
District in Lawndale from 1983-90. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fired from his post four months after 2,500 students walked out of 
their classes to protest racism at the district's two high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Two board members later accused Nash and other district employees of helping 
instigate the student demonstration to undermine the school board. Nash denied 
any involvement with the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The district agreed to pay Nash $150,000 in 1992 to settle a racial 
discrimination claim he filed, as well as two lawsuits that stemmed from a 
dispute over his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not return calls regarding his application for the Inglewood post. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 46, who served as deputy superintendent of the Richmond Unified School 
District before moving to the Compton school district in 1991, said Inglewood 
schools need more effective teacher development programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need a lot more bilingual and culturally competent teachers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford served as superintendent of the Pomona Unified School District from 
1979-84, when a newly elected school board voted not to renew his contract. He 
was hired as assistant superintendent in the San Gabriel Unified School 
District in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all budget people think they have to cut expenditures, but (the 
Inglewood district has) to increase income," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eunice Nash, superintendent at the Torrance-based Southern California Regional 
Occupational Center, declined to comment on her candidacy for the Inglewood 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was assistant superintendent of education services for the Montebello 
Unified School District from 1984-88 before moving to the Mountain View school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortenberry has been superintendent for New Orleans public schools since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and Fortenberry could not be reached for comment.

 The morning after the McIlwains' real estate agent put their three-bedroom 
home on the market, the couple found a buyer waiting at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene and Dolores McIlwain accepted the second of the three offers that week, 
about $3,000 more than their asking price of $159,950. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,244-square-foot house is on a quiet street lined with one-story homes 
built in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a real fancy neighborhood," said Eugene McIlwain, but walking distance 
from schools and shopping. He says he expected they'd sell their home in West 
Covina within a month or two. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't expect that once the deal was already in escrow, people would 
continue to knock at their door, or that about 30 realtors representing buyers 
would come to see it. 
</P>

 Quick-sale scenarios like the McIlwains' are becoming more common as the 
real-estate market in the San Gabriel Valley and the rest of Southern 
California transforms from a buyer's to a seller's market, said Barbara Leland, 
president of the East San Gabriel Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three months of this year, 3,214 homes sold in the San Gabriel 
Valley, up by nearly 16% over the same period in 1993. April sales were up by 
nearly 17%. Leland attributes the increase to a panic by first-time buyers who 
have seen interest rates rise and are rushing to purchase homes before they go 
up again. Buyers also are encouraged by lenders' incentive loans that require 
minimal down payments. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, homeowners are pricing their houses more realistically, 
attracting more buyers. Compared to 1993, housing prices were down 5.4% in the 
San Gabriel Valley for the first three months of this year despite the livelier 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joy Carothers, president of the West San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Realtors, 
said prices seem to be coming back as houses sell more quickly in her region. 
If she finds a house for someone and then tries to locate a comparable one for 
the same price, she can't do it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the growth in sales reflects the number of homes sold to first-time 
buyers, who last year made up more than half the market, according the 
California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Going, Leland says, is the time when first-time buyers had the luxury of 
poking around for the best deal and talking desperate sellers down to below 
their asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at one week in April, Leland said the number of homes on the market in 
her region went down from 3,681 active listings in 1993 to 2,750 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer homes are on the market because they sell more quickly, not because 
there are fewer offerings, she said. During the last week in April, sales were 
up by 24% from the same period last year in the eastern San Gabriel Valley.

 An increase in home sales in the first three months of the year shows that the 
real estate environment is changing from a buyers' market to a sellers' market, 
according to one local agent. Here are the number of houses sold in the first 
three months of 1994, along with the median price, expressed in thousands of

PEOPLE: UMPIRE STAYS AND BECOMES A BIG HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only once in Ronna Rosemond-Johnson's umpiring career has she felt so 
discouraged that she wanted to quit. As one of only a few female umpires in the 
South Bay, Rosemond-Johnson, 28, was making tough calls a couple of years ago 
that a coach didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy started yelling at me in Spanish," she said. "I couldn't really 
understand what he was saying, but I knew that they weren't nice things." 
</P>
<P>
 After that night, Rosemond-Johnson vowed never to umpire again. "I'd just 
started, and I was doing the best I could, and this guy was making it 
impossible," she said. "It was just a nightmare.' 
</P>
<P>
 But she stuck it out. In the last two years, with the support and 
encouragement of members of the Los Angeles unit of the California Softball 
Officials Assn., most of them male, Rosemond-Johnson has become a well-known 
and respected umpire, officiating at softball and baseball games for local high 
schools and for Parks and Recreation Department leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of support from the other umpires," she said. "They convinced me 
that quitting is not the answer. They told me that umpiring is about facing the 
challenges of the big mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Now when Rosemond-Johnson officiates the team that nearly made her quit, "they 
love me," she said. "I've improved. I'm more consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 When the same coach makes comments in Spanish, "I still don't know what he's 
saying," she said, "but I assume it's something good." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemond-Johnson, who lives in Lawndale, is among about half a dozen women in 
the Los Angeles unit of 60 umpires, said Garfield Finley, a Hawthorne resident 
who works for the Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department and 
instructs aspiring umpires. "We've always looked for female officials," he 
said. "There just haven't been that many."  
</P>
<P>
 Few women work as umpires, Finley said, because historically few women have 
played organized baseball or softball. "Now we're getting more females into 
high school softball, so we're seeing more women umpires."  
</P>
<P>
 Rosemond-Johnson started her softball career at 7 when she joined a girls' 
sandlot league in Los Angeles. She remained in the girls' league until she 
switched to high school ball. While in school, she also played basketball and 
tennis.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the oldest of three kids, and the other two aren't athletic at all," she 
said. "Neither are my parents. But they were so supportive. They took me to all 
the games and practices, and they came to my games. They were there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing softball for El Camino College, landing a job with the Gardena 
Parks and Recreation Department and marrying former Green Bay Packer Ken 
Johnson, Rosemond-Johnson became a free-lance umpire for softball and baseball 
games. She spent $45 on training and earns that much for each game she 
officiates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the sport so much," she said. "I like the authority, the quick 
thinking, using your judgment, being accurate, running around. I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, both male and female teams were surprised to see her. " 'A woman?' 
they said. I just smiled and said, 'Yeah, a woman,' and went on with the game. 
The men really like to flirt," she said. "They'll say, 'You're the cutest 
umpire I've ever seen.' " She paused. "It doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some games try her patience, especially when the crowd, the players or the 
coaches become unruly. Not long ago, when she was behind the plate, a batter 
threw his bat. It smashed into Rosemond-Johnson's head, knocking her 
unconscious. Though she went to the hospital, she refused to go in an 
ambulance. "I'm too tough for that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps her greatest asset is her ability to ignore screaming criticism. "I 
let it go in one ear and out the other," she said. "My focus is on the game."

BRIEFLY; HAWTHORNE: COUNCIL VOTES TO FIRE CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hawthorne City Council plans to fire City Manager James H. Mitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to notify Mitsch of its intent to dismiss him 
by June 17.Councilman Steven Andersen was absent.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitsch, 55, was criticized by council members for the city's financial woes. 
In the past, Mitsch and the council have often cited the poor economy and state 
funding cuts as the main causes of budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some basic hard times," said Mitsch, who has served as city 
manager since 1991. "When that happens, there's always a look for new blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne faces a projected budget shortfall of $2 million this fiscal year. 
The city has operated without a budget since July. The problems forced the city 
to change its budget cycle from one year to two in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the overall management of the city is in desperate need of change," 
Councilwoman Martha Bails said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitsch, who has been placed on paid leave, said he will request a hearing on 
the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council fires Mitsch, it is not clear who would succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has named Assistant City Manager Tim Brown as interim city 
manager. But Brown, who is weighing a job offer from another city, will only 
serve in the post until May 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials then plan to hire a temporary city manager until they find a 
replacement. SCOTT SANDELL

BRIEFLY; CARSON: APPOINTMENT FOR COUNCIL VACANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council appointed Planning Commissioner Mary Anne O'Neal to fill the 
vacancy on the council at an emotional meeting Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael I. Mitoma nominated O'Neal, whom he appointed to the Planning 
Commission two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for somebody (who) had a long record of service to the 
community without looking for higher office," Mitoma said.  
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 3 to 1, with Councilwoman Lorelie S. Olaes opposing the 
nomination. Olaes wanted the seat to go to Keith McDonald, who came in second 
in the April election for a council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Olaes angrily demanded to know the procedure for a recall. 
When O'Neal arrived at the meeting and was sworn in, Olaes left and did not 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers have remained frayed in the community since the election, when all 
three candidates backed by United Voice, an African American political group, 
came in a close second. Olaes, a Filipina, also backed the candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal is African American but is not a member of United Voice. She is the 
first black to serve on the council since Juanita M. McDonald was elected to 
the state Assembly in 1992. Keith McDonald is the assemblywoman's son.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who fills the vacancy created when Mitoma was elected mayor, will 
serve until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked for the Los Angeles Unified School District as a math teacher and 
was co-author of the Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools. She 
retired in 1986. MARY GUTHRIE

RELIGION; PASTOR FINED $12,500 FOR HAVING SEX WITH CONGREGANT IN '72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glendora minister has been fined $12,500 by the Presbyterian Church for 
having a sexual relationship with a member of his congregation 22 years ago, 
with the money compensating the woman for previous and future therapy expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was 18 when Dr. Walter A. Ray, pastor of Glenkirk Presbyterian 
Church, began a six-week sexual relationship with her in 1972. The Presbyterian 
Church's Permanent Judicial Commission ruled that although the relationship was 
consensual, the age of the victim and Ray's stature as pastor of her church 
constituted an abuse of his clerical power. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman attempted to bring a claim against Ray in 1978, but at that time the 
Presbyterian Church had a three-year limit for bringing disciplinary charges 
against pastors. The church recently dropped the limitation period for charges 
of sexual misconduct, and disciplinary proceedings against Ray, 57, began last 
fall. The judicial commission, which is based in Azusa, issued a judgment in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fine, Ray also received a sentence of two years' exclusion 
from the office of pastor at Glenkirk, but the sentence was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they wanted to say to me, 'Walter, you did something that was wrong 
and we need to be open to that,' " said Ray, who said he confessed the incident 
to his wife and later to his parish. " 'On the other hand, it was 21 years ago, 
and you repented and you have been rehabilitated a long time ago, and you have 
a clean record, so we want you to keep serving.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ray also said he thinks it is appropriate that he compensate the woman for 
therapy costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she has mixed feelings about the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I got a lot this late," she said. "But on the other hand, he did 
this terrible thing and he never lost a beat in his career. It also bothers me 
that he still doesn't see what he did wrong. He knows it was adultery, but he 
doesn't see that it was sexual abuse."

POLICE BLOTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: A 28-year-old man was shot Sunday by another man who was apparently 
upset over the victim's treatment of a girlfriend. Grady Bernard Blocker was 
shot at 9:50 p.m. in his apartment in the 900 block of West Arrow Highway, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an apparent argument, the man shot Blocker three or four times, police 
said. He was shot in the left arm, stomach and left hip and was taken to Pomona 
Valley Hospital Medical Center. The shooter fled in a white, four-door car with 
tinted windows, police said. Detectives are searching for him. 
</P>
<P>
 HACIENDA HEIGHTS: An argument Sunday in a bar over a mutual girlfriend turned 
deadly after one man pulled a gun and chased another through the parking lot 
before shooting him to death, deputies said. Ronald Coulter, 52, and Andres 
Llamas, 36, were reportedly arguing over the woman at 11:40 a.m. inside the 
Sportsman Bar. During the argument, Coulter allegedly threatened Llamas and 
said he was going to get a gun, deputies said. A short time later, Coulter 
confronted Llamas with a handgun in the bar's parking lot. Coulter chased 
Llamas through the lot, firing numerous rounds at him, deputies said. Llamas 
was struck several times in the upper torso and staggered back into the bar, 
where he collapsed and died. Coulter fled but turned himself in about an hour 
later at the Industry sheriff's station, where he was booked on suspicion of 
murder, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: The arrests of seven teen-agers riding in a stolen car Friday 
morning may have revealed a car theft ring. The youths were stopped in the 100 
block of East Greystone Avenue about 3 a.m., police said. Five were released 
and two others, 17 and 18, were charged with vehicular grand theft. The two 
Rosemead youths reportedly told detectives about a group of thieves who 
specialize in stealing Honda Civics; police said they were able to track down 
three additional stolen vehicles. Detectives hope to recover more cars. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A 27-year-old man suffered serious injuries Monday when his car 
crashed into a pole in a residential Pasadena neighborhood. Henry Vera Jr. was 
driving a blue Nissan compact at high speed about 1 a.m. in the 1500 block of 
North Marengo Avenue when he apparently lost control, police said. Officers 
said the car flipped and hit an electrical power pole. Rescuers used the Jaws 
of Life to free the injured man, who was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital. 
He was listed in critical but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: Four male teen-agers drove a 14-year-old girl from her home in 
Huntington Beach to Pasadena and left her in an abandoned house, where she was 
apparently raped by someone else Sunday, police said. The girl was driven by 
people she knew and was dropped off at the vacant house, police said. Police 
are still questioning the teen-agers, who reportedly told police they could not 
take the girl home. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A 31-year-old man allegedly under the influence of cocaine discharged 
two rifles and an AK-47 assault rifle early Friday morning in a home in the 
1200 block of Nashville Court, police said. No one was injured in the 25-round 
shooting spree, however, and Humberto Arias was apprehended without incident. 
He was booked at L.A. County Jail on charges of shooting a firearm within city 
limits and being under the influence of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN MARINO: Additional remains unearthed in the back yard of a San Marino home 
Friday were identified as chicken bones and the leg bone of a horse, deputies 
said. Sheriff's detectives said the bones were found just before noon, a few 
hours after investigators had cleared the site and allowed workers to continue 
digging a hole for a pool in the 1900 block of Lorain Road. Three bags 
containing a trisected human skeleton were discovered last week by construction 
workers, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives said the victim may have been a previous resident of the 
house missing since 1985. San Marino police said missing persons reports were 
filed on Jonathan Sohus and his wife, Linda, that year. The coroner's office 
determined the skeleton to be that of an adult male, and investigators hope 
dental records will reveal whether it is Jonathan Sohus, deputies said.

COVER STORY; WATERFRONT LAWMEN; LITTLE-KNOWN PORT POLICE OFFICERS PATROL ON 
LAND, SEA AND AIR TO SAFEGUARD LIVES AND PROPERTY IN THE SPRAWLING HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a city swarming with law enforcement agencies, the Port Police may be the 
least-known cops who ever walked, drove, pedaled, flew or swam a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody has heard of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. Most people are probably aware of airport, transit 
and school police, not to mention local police departments from Burbank to El 
Segundo.  
</P>
<P>
 Except for those who live or work at the Port of Los Angeles, it's probably 
fair to say that most Angelenos have never heard of the Port Police. In fact, 
while South Bay residents may be aware that the Port of Los Angeles is one of 
the busiest commercial shipping ports in the world, people in Van Nuys or 
Pasadena or Beverly Hills tend to think that the port is some kind of marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's a teeming center of industrialism interspersed with pockets of 
recreational activity, 28 miles of waterfront where oil tank farms, lumber 
yards and auto storage facilities sit cheek by jowl with marinas and beaches 
and restaurants with harbor views. It's a place where freighters tie up near 
luxury cruise ships, where grimy commercial fishing boats share the water with 
private yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year more than $60 billion worth of goods pass through the port, bound 
to and from almost every country in the world. Every day about 50,000 people 
pour into the port area to work. For hundreds of others, the "live-aboards" in 
the more than 4,000 marina slips, the port is their permanent home. For others, 
the transients who sneak into container yards and set up housekeeping in empty 
shipping boxes, the port is a temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrolling and protecting all that are the Port Police, 55 sworn officers who 
patrol on land, in the air, on the water and even under the water. But you'll 
never read a book or see a movie in which the hero draws his gun and shouts, 
"Freeze! LAPP!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the best-kept secret in law enforcement," says Lt. Ronald Boyd, Port 
Police operations commander. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he's working his special assignment beat, Port Police Officer Robert 
Myers doesn't come face to face with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 He comes face to face with fish. 
</P>
<P>
 About twice a month, Myers and others on the Port Police dive team put on 
scuba gear and descend into the oily, silty, bacteria-rich black water of the 
Port of Los Angeles to search ships. Armed only with flashlights, and working 
in water where the visibility may be measured in inches, they creep slowly 
along the bottoms of boats, looking for stashes of drugs concealed in rudders 
or stabilizer tubes or sea chests, the large grated openings that serve as 
water intakes for engine cooling systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they find what they're looking for. A couple of years ago, for 
example, dive team members found 55 kilos of cocaine sealed in welded metal 
boxes hidden below the waterline on a freighter from South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers admits that it can get kind of spooky down there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When everything around you is black and all you can hear is the sound of your 
breathing, it gets a little claustrophobic," says Myers, 36, an officer for the 
last dozen years, first with the Burbank Airport Police and for five years with 
the Port Police. "We've had some people drop out after their first dive. It's 
not exactly fun diving. But after a while, you get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly clean diving, either, particularly after a downpour sends 
every conceivable kind of bacteria and assorted other crud flowing through the 
storm drains and into the harbor. If the bacteria level is too high, the divers 
won't dive unless it's an emergency. They all carry mouthwash and 
anti-bacterial eardrops to reduce the risk of infection from a dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-member dive team was formed in 1989. All its members are volunteers who 
work patrol or other duties but are called in when divers are needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Dive team members do ship searches -- in conjunction with the U.S. Customs 
Service -- rescues, underwater searches for contraband or evidence (such as 
weapons), even retrieval of Harbor Department equipment from the ocean bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 In water that ranges from 30 to 60 feet deep, dive team members have to be 
prepared to find virtually anything on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are crabs down there," says Myers. "When you're doing a bottom search, 
you can't see very well because the silt gets stirred up. So when you pick up 
something and it bites you, it's a little surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the usual jetsam: beer cans and bottles, as well as boat parts, 
tools -- almost anything that can fall off a boat or wash through the storm 
drains. Divers recently found a 40-foot-long piece of machinery. Sometimes they 
find stolen cars. And in the past, they occasionally found cars with bodies in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until a few years ago, at least twice a year we'd get people and cars going 
into the water," says Lt. Martin Renteria, Port Police investigations and 
administration commander, who heads the dive team. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those cases were distraught people who drove their cars off wharves. 
After the port began putting up barricades at potential suicide sites, Renteria 
said, the port suicide rate dropped dramatically.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming around in murky water is only one of the duties of the Port Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating under the Los Angeles Harbor Department, with an annual budget of 
about $6 million, the officers also protect the port and enforce environmental 
laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Burglaries, robberies, truck hijackings, domestic arguments in the marinas, 
car thefts, assaults, and traffic violations by boats and vehicles all part of 
the job. Port Police officers also perform foot and bike patrols in the Ports 
O' Call Village, a waterfront restaurant and retail complex; the World Cruise 
Center, the embarking point for cruise ships, and at the Cabrillo Beach 
recreation area. Port Police officers make about 175 arrests each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety and environmental duties are more unusual. Last year, Port Police 
officers conducted nearly 30,000 safety inspections in container terminals, oil 
tank farms and ships berthing at the port. They also check the channels and 
other harbor areas for illegal dumping or discharge of hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the people they serve, the port cops are doing a bang-up job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're great," says Damaris Rausch, manager of the California Yacht Marina 
in the eastern portion of the port. "Any time we've called they've gotten out 
here immediately. They always seem friendly, and they're very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kleist, a spokesman for Evergreen shipping lines, one of the port's 
largest companies, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're totally professional, extremely cooperative, well-motivated, 
well-directed," Kleist said. "I think they do an outstanding job." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recurrent rumors that the Port Police would be absorbed by the Los 
Angeles Police Department, Boyd says it's not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "That rumor has been downgraded to even less than a rumor," he says. "This is 
our swimming pool, and we're going to continue to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most police officers, they feel underpaid: a non-supervisory officer 
makes about $2,800 to $3,200 a month. The salary is a sore point with most of 
them, as are the limited retirement and disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But most port officers say they wouldn't want to work anywhere else. They 
especially like the diversity of the job. One day they're on patrol in a squad 
car, another day they're on bikes, another day they may be diving or making 
environmental inspections from a helicopter.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like the flexibility," says Officer Daniel Aleman, a 13-year veteran. "For 
example, I'm a helicopter observer, I'm on the bike team, and I'm a senior 
patrol boat officer. This job allows us to wear a lot of different hats." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Water looks pretty clean today," Aleman says as he peers out the window of a 
Bell 206 helicopter, 600 feet above the port.  
</P>
<P>
 Aleman is an observer on the chopper, which is owned and operated by the city 
General Services Department. Aleman's mission is to check the water for signs 
of environmental contamination. That can range from a leaky oil pipe connection 
to a commercial fisherman illegally pumping out his bilges in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleman also checks for breached fences at container terminals, evidence of 
break-ins on warehouse roofs and signs of anything out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 If he spots something on the water, he will summon the Port Police patrol boat 
by radio to check it out, and if necessary cite the offender. If he spots 
something on the ground, a land unit takes care of it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not like being a forest ranger," says Port Police Officer 
Robert Reynolds as he steers his patrol car through a huge yard full of metal 
shipping containers stacked three and four high. "There's a lot of chemicals 
around here, hazardous waste stuff. You don't even know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a five-year veteran who earlier worked as an airport police officer, 
is on routine patrol today, which means that he'll cruise through everything 
from container yards to junk yards to slag heaps to the marinas -- some upscale 
and some not -- that line the waterfront. At night, some of the container 
storage yards become home to transient drug addicts and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a lot of people contact. And not all of it is bad. As Reynolds 
drives through a marina parking lot, the owner comes out to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Appreciate you coming by," the owner says, waving. "Nice to see you." 
</P>
<P>
 "People down here are pretty friendly," Reynolds says. "I think that's because 
we're friendly. We know all the people. We were doing community-based policing 
before they even called it community-based policing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a housing project," Officer Dave Knight, 51, says as Port 
Police patrol boat Bravo 15 cruises past a marina. "You get everything here 
that you'd get in any residential area -- burglaries, domestic fights, drugs, 
everything."  
</P>
<P>
 Knight and his partner, Officer Henry Gomez, 41, are two of the six Port 
Police officers permanently assigned to the department's two patrol boats. 
Knight has spent the last eight years on the boats. He is a 15-year veteran of 
the Port Police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good job," he says. "I like being out on the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is necessarily glad to see him, though. On this day Knight spots 
a boater who's exceeding the 5 m.p.h. inner harbor speed limit. He waves him 
over and does a safety inspection -- checking for life jackets and other safety 
gear -- and then cautions him about speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat driver has an explanation: He was having motor trouble and needed to 
rev up a little to keep the motor running. Knight lets him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten or 20 times a weekend, people aren't so lucky. They'll get speeding or 
safety violation citations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to maintain good relations with the public," Knight says. "But we have 
to think about safety too."  
</P>
<P>

 Port Police Detective Ken Huerta remembers well the strangest thing that he's 
ever seen stolen by cargo thieves. It was an entire truckload of rubber adult 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
 It just goes to show you, Huerta says, that cargo thieves will steal anything. 
Cargo containers, also known as "cans," are the 20- to 40-foot metal boxes that 
can be transferred from a ship to a truck or rail car. Port thefts have 
included containers packed full of disposable diapers, children's clothes, 
toys, bottled water, and quart cans of motor oil.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon for thieves to sneak into a freight yard somewhere in the 
vast industrial sections of the Los Angeles area, hot-wire a parked 
semi-tractor trailer and simply drive through a gate or crash a fence. Other 
times, they will catch a truck driver at a stop light, stick a gun in his face 
and take the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves can be murderous. Last year, hijackers shot and killed a truck 
driver near Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, the drivers are in on it. A "broker" will approach a driver 
who's making $5 an hour, non-union, and offer him $5,000 to give up a truck and 
then report it stolen. Often, Huerta says, the broker gets the truck and pays 
the driver only $500 or so, if he pays him at all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a huge business, probably the biggest criminal enterprise in Los Angeles, 
next to drug dealing. A container full of Pampers, for example, may be worth 
$40,000, and can be sold illegally, wholesale, for about $20,000. Container 
burglaries, in which the can is broken into in a yard and some of its contents 
taken, are a different category of crime. Huerta figures that every day in the 
Los Angeles area, about $1 million worth of goods are stolen or hijacked by 
cargo thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago it was even worse, Huerta says. That's when several law 
enforcement agencies -- including the Port Police, Sheriff's Department, LAPD 
and FBI -- created Cargo CATs, the Cargo Criminal Apprehension Team. Huerta, 
42, a burly ex-Marine and 13-year Port Police veteran, is his department's 
specialist in container thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Huerta's work takes place outside the port. Although several years ago 
the theft or hijacking of containers was a serious problem in the port area, 
recent security measures suggested by the Port Police -- such as encircling the 
container yards with heavy cables in addition to fences -- have virtually 
eliminated the problem inside the port. In 1993, five containers were stolen 
from inside the port area, compared to more than 500 container thefts and truck 
hijackings in the rest of the L.A. Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 As for container burglaries, Huerta says about one or two are reported to the 
Port Police every month, although the actual number may be much higher. Often, 
shipping companies don't bother to report such break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 That, Huerta says, is part of the problem. Too many companies accept cargo 
thefts as a fact of life, and don't invest in security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of big shipping companies just factor in a 5% loss of their cans," he 
says. "They don't care because that loss just gets passed on to the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen merchandise usually doesn't wind up in flea markets or the black 
market, either, Huerta says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the buyers are so-called legitimate businesses who buy it for 
one-third or one-half wholesale," Huerta says. "A lot of them will then sell 
the stuff at close-out sales." 
</P>
<P>
 But things have gotten tougher for cargo thieves since Cargo CATs was created, 
Huerta says. So far, the unit has made more than 400 arrests and recovered more 
than $70 million in stolen property.  
</P>
<P>
 But Huerta estimates that the recoveries are less than a quarter of the items 
stolen. And he doesn't figure he'll be out of work anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crooks are stupid and lazy," he says. "We catch a lot of them. But there are 
always more where they came from."

L.A. COUNCIL UPHOLDS FIRING OF GARDENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a lengthy debate, the Los Angeles City Council has upheld the firing of 
a gardener accused of using city time and equipment to work at a private 
residence in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 12-3 decision Tuesday will be challenged in court by an attorney 
and union representing Camilo Mandac, a six-year city employee who has denied 
the city's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, the Recreation and Parks Department fired Mandac, 44, on 
grounds that he performed gardening work, with a day laborer, at the home of a 
private customer. The department also found that he used a city truck to drop 
off his daughter at school and buy gloves at a local store. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandac insisted that he was at the home on his lunch hour to search for a 
missing ring. Further, he said, he needed the gloves for work and dropped his 
daughter off in a city truck on only one occasion and because she was being 
threatened by fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing his defense, the council unanimously agreed that Mandac had 
improperly used city equipment but disagreed over the fairness of firing the 
employee, whose work record was otherwise sound. Nevertheless, the council 
opted to stand by the parks department's decision.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: HOTEL FARE WORTH CHECKING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 H otel restaurant : The phrase suggests boring food served to a captive 
clientele. Swiss-born Claude and Ruby Oertle are aware of that ghastly 
reputation, but they have higher ambitions for Capistrano's, their restaurant 
at the Crown Sterling Suites in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 They chose Ramiro Medina as chef. His resume includes a two-year stint at the 
highly regarded La Chaumiere in the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City proving 
that a hotel site doesn't automatically ruin food. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor at Capistrano's is Mediterranean, with brick arches and a polished 
stone floor. In addition to the regular tables, it has booths set in an 
extension that juts out into the hotel's rooftop courtyard, where you can dine 
near a small waterfall that cascades onto a fish-filled pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Some interesting appetizers here include Gruyere cheese fritters ($5.95) 
served with a chunky tomato sauce. Spinach artichoke gratinee ($5.95) is a 
wickedly rich casserole of artichoke hearts, spinach, Parmesan and Cheddar. 
</P>
<P>
 An elaborate salad called pasta tango ($8.25) includes spinach cheese 
tortellini, a boneless chicken breast, artichoke hearts, olives, tomatoes, 
carrots and lettuce tossed with a garlic dill dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as a concession to its location in a hotel, Capistrano's lists the old 
hotel restaurant standby -- medallions of beef chasseur ($15.95), sauteed 
tenderloins with a brown sauce of shallots, tarragon and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh fish selections vary, but orange roughy is always available. So is 
swordfish ($11.95), grilled with fresh basil and Key lime butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano's is at 1440 E. Imperial Ave., El Segundo. (310) 640-1070. Open 
seven days, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

THEATER REVIEW; THE ENDURING SPLENDOR OF A SOPHISTICATED 'LADY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "My Fair Lady," which is essentially indestructible, spills over the 
1,400-seat Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center like "the rain in Spain," to 
commandeer one of the show's classic lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Now midway into its third season, the Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities, 
whose subscribers have increased from 1,000 to more than 9,000, is doing 
something right in a short time. While "My Fair Lady" may seem foolproof, its 
sweep, its tricky Cockney accents, its raffish edge and visual and musical 
splendors make it a lofty challenge for any company. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is tougher to pull off than, say, "Oklahoma!," the Civic Light 
Opera's last production. As pristine as that show was, this production is more 
bountiful and rounder in its great score, design, high-life/lowlife appeal and 
light comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Mahoney's Eliza Doolittle, the Cockney 
flower-girl-turned-shimmering-maiden, sufficiently negotiates her early 
guttersnipe persona but really finds her stride when she blossoms into a regal 
figure. No matter how many times theatergoers have heard it, when Mahoney 
warbles, "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" and William McCauley 
responds, "I think she's got it! . . . By George, she's got it!" you are 
reminded just how enduring this show is. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Professor Henry Higgins has erased Eliza's Cockney "A-o-o-o-w!" and 
restored her H 's to their proper place, co-stars Mahoney and McCauley slip 
into an unspoken bond. It convincingly prepares you for their subsequent and 
hurtful reproaches and Higgins' wryly lyrical lament, "Why can't a woman be 
more like a man?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the elitist mentor wagering an arrogant bet that he can transform scruffy 
Eliza of Covent Garden into a model of ballroom decorum, McCauley's Higgins is 
alternately irascible, vulnerable and peevishly affable. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, during McCauley's heartfelt capitulation to Eliza in the song 
"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face," McCauley gives the audience a Higgins who 
casts a poignant glow over this 1956 Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the show's program, unusually full of insightful background, 
including the lyrics to all of the show's vocal treasures, the major difference 
between the musical and George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" is stark and simple: 
Shaw insisted that Eliza wind up not with Professor Higgins but with her 
simpering suitor, Freddy Eynsford-Hill (the vocally robust Robert Townsend). 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing sharp flavor from the jumbo 35-member cast are Jack Ritschel's 
Colonel Hugh Pickering, Higgins' dear friend who is as cozy as a rumpled 
slipper; Tim Robu as Eliza Doolittle's up-from-the-gutter father suddenly 
wrestling with middle-class morality, and handsome Clare Alden Ryan as Higgins' 
wise mom padding about like a serene duchess. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, director Mark Madama re-creates a sublime union with the original 
Broadway achievement, especially in the delicious scene at Ascot Racetrack. 
There, Higgins tries out Eliza's untested sophistication on the landed gentry 
and assorted bluenoses as they bunch up in their lush attire (including 
dazzling black and white Victorian gowns with a modern feel) to follow the 
ponies with humorously studied indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 The sets are from the original touring production, dusted off and smartly 
refurbished by the Civic Light Opera. They're still a knockout, enough to make 
you feel like you could dance all night. 
</P>
<P>
 * "My Fair Lady," Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, at Aviation and 
Manhattan Beach boulevards; 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, matinees at 2 
Saturday and Sunday, 7 p.m. Sunday; $20 to $35. (310) 372-4477. Ends May 22.

TESTING: PARENTAL FEEDBACK ON CLAS EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to express my concern regarding the CLAS test that is currently 
required to be administered to fourth-, fifth-, eight- and 10th-grade students. 
I believe that this is an invasion of privacy and that it is an attempt to 
control and manipulate the family unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, in the English portion of the test, children are forced to read 
graphic and violent stories and then write their feelings or experiences as 
expressed in the story. I do not believe this is necessary and certainly should 
not be administered in a test at school. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also asked to name a circumstance(s) that changed their feelings 
about a member of their family. If they cannot do so, they are asked to make 
one up. If the story, for example, centers on abuse, it is reported to the 
proper authorities. Please understand that I am a firm believer in protecting 
our children from any sort of child abuse; however, I am against forcing a 
child to make up a story (they could have learned from a television program or 
courses taught in schools), and the government taking whatever action they feel 
necessary without knowing whether or not the story is make believe or true. 
This is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also my understanding that the CLAS test is not in any way an aptitude 
test. My child was administered an aptitude test recently and I have no problem 
with this. I think it is a helpful tool in educating our children. However, the 
CLAS test does not measure aptitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the above, it is my understanding that passage of the SB-1273 
would: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Make CLAS testing a graduating requirement; 
</P>
<P>
 2. Take away local school control by forcing schools to administer the test; 
and 
</P>
<P>
 3. Make it illegal for anyone to make unauthorized copies of the test. (This 
is of concern to me. I would like the right to peruse any test or school 
material my child is subjected to.) 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance schools are known to be some of the best in the state. Our local 
officials and schools are obviously doing something right. I would like my 
school district to have the option, and the parents of the children to have the 
right, to refuse to administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 I for one will be writing a letter to my child's teacher, principal, and 
district superintendent to excuse my child from taking the CLAS test.

LEGISLATION: A QUESTION ON FEDERAL WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why does our own Rep. Jane Harman (D -- Marina del Rey) oppose a vote on 
cutting federal waste? 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, she opposed "A to Z," a promising pending proposal to convene a 
special session of Congress during which any Representative could propose cuts 
in any federal program, subject to a roll-call vote. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 She has even sought to prevent a floor vote on "A to Z" by keeping the bill 
lodged in committee. If she were right to oppose "A to Z," then why would she 
also oppose letting the House vote on it?

OPEN LAND: DETAILS OF SALE AGREEMENT OUTLINED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with great interest your "Open Debate" South Bay section cover story of 
May 5. The "debate" as reported by you is that the Linden H. Chandler Preserve 
might be developed. It is unfortunate that no reader of the article can 
determine, based upon the information you provide in the article, which side of 
the "debate" is factually correct. 
</P>
<P>
 (I do not believe that there really is a "debate," only the self-created 
controversy generated by certain politicians who desire to achieve political 
gain. For instance, Rolling Hills Estates Councilwoman Jacki McGuire voted in 
favor of the Linden H. Chandler Preserve transaction on Dec. 23, 1993, only to 
claim she had questions after the transaction was signed.)

 As you know, I am the attorney who participated on behalf of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Land Conservancy in the transaction, and a member of the Board of 
Directors. (I might point out that not a single person on the side of the 
conservancy was paid any money for the many hours of work that went into the 
transaction.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was unfortunate that you failed to include in the article the critical 
information that would have allowed your readers to evaluate the merits of the 
supposed debate themselves. Specifically, you were provided the entire 
"Purchase and Sale Agreement" of the transaction. You were directed to those 
portions that directly answer the question of whether the land will be 
developed. Your readers would have been better served if you had similarly 
provided them that information, so that they could reach their own conclusion, 
rather than be left wondering which version of the facts is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that had you reported the substance of the transaction, your readers 
would have been convinced that the land is genuinely preserved. I hope that you 
will print this letter so that those details are made public, and the public 
can then reach a truly informed decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Purchase and Sale Agreement expressly provides in a number of places for 
the preservation of the Linden H. Chandler Preserve as open space. 
Specifically: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Recital D (page 1) states that: 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the parties hereto desire that the Property be held perpetually as 
'open-space land.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This clear and understandable statement of intention is then backed up further 
in Section 16 of the Agreement, a section titled "Open Space Restriction." 
</P>
<P>
 "(a) Buyer (Rolling Hills Estates) and the Conservancy shall hold the Property 
perpetually as Open-Space Land." (Page 13.) 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the end of the restrictions preserving the land. Section 16 (b), 
page 13 states: 
</P>
<P>
 "(b) Buyer (Rolling Hills Estates) and the Conservancy shall . . . keep the 
Property open and available to the public generally for the public's use for 
Open-Space Land purposes. Such use by the public shall be free of charge to the 
public. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As if these statements were not enough, the Land Conservancy, the City of 
Rolling Hills Estates and the Chandler beneficiaries provided similar 
restrictions in the deeds themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This grant is made on the condition that the Property be used solely and 
perpetually as 'Open-Spaced Land,' as such term is defined hereinbelow." (Grant 
Deed, page 1). 
</P>
<P>
 The deed transferring to the Conservancy its interest in the property 
similarly has a restriction requiring that the property be kept as open space. 
It recites: 
</P>
<P>
 "This grant is made on the condition that Grantee (Conservancy) shall not . . 
. cease to use any portion of the Property as Open-Space Land, as such term is 
defined hereinbelow . . ." (Grant Deed page 1). 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if the Peninsula Land conservancy does not keep the property as 
open space? The Conservancy ". . .shall forfeit all rights or title to the 
Property, and the Property shall revert to (Rolling Hills Estates.. . . " 
(Grant Deed, page 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Even this was not the end of the legal restraints placed upon the parties to 
ensure that the public obtains the land as open space forever. The agreement 
further protects the open-space character of the land by providing that when 
the city partitions its approximately eight acres and creates two parcels from 
the property, the city shall simultaneously grant to the Conservancy a 
conservation easement pursuant to California Civil Code 815 et. seq. That 
Conservation Easement also requires the land to be kept as open space in 
perpetuity. (Agreement Section 6, page 5.) 
</P>
<P>
 In short, I believe that your readers would have benefited greatly had you not 
only reported the alleged "debate," but also provided the reader the tools to 
evaluate the merits of the positions taken by the parties. The press best 
serves the public when it does more than report that a debate exists but 
instead advises the public on the facts that can allow the public to formulate 
its own opinions. I hope that this detailed letter fulfills that goal. Then it 
is up to the enlightened public to decide, based upon the record.

PARKING TOO COSTLY FOR HIS TASTE; POLICY: FISH TACO CHAIN MUST PAY $72,000 
BEFORE IT CAN OPEN IN HUNTINGTON. CO-OWNER SAYS CITY POSITION SMACKS OF 
EXTORTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How long does it take to make a taco in Huntington Beach? About a year if you 
are Ed Lee, co-owner of the expanding Wahoo's Fish Taco chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who began the application process last May to open a store on Huntington 
Beach's Main Street, said he has yet to sell a single order of the popular fast 
food, despite Huntington Beach's claim to would-be business owners that it is 
"The City of the Red Carpet Treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 "What a joke," Lee said Wednesday. "They sold me on the idea it was going to 
be easy. Now I am stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a new section in the city's 12-year-old code -- designed to steer 
redevelopment of the Main Street retail district -- that requires restaurants 
along the strip to pay thousands of dollars a year for parking spaces that they 
are required to make available to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wahoo's, which is allotted 12 spaces in the city's Main Street parking 
garage, that means coughing up $72,000 for 15 years of parking fees and 
depositing the funds in an escrow account -- or allowing the city to put a lien 
on the storefront property until the money is paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said he can't open for business until he chooses one of the options, 
though he is ready to start selling his tacos to surfers and fast-food-minded 
tourists right away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee says neither of the possibilities suits him. Besides, he said, he is 
tapped out financially and doesn't have the $72,000. In addition, a partner is 
hinting that she will demand her $600,000 investment back if Huntington Beach 
officials insist on a lien, because that would give the city first rights to 
seize the property if the business fails. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials acknowledged that they are withholding the business permit 
until the parking space fee is paid up front or they get a lien on the 
property. (Lee bought the store outright, rather than lease it.) 
</P>
<P>
 But city spokesman Keith Bohr said that Huntington Beach has been trying to 
accommodate Lee -- who is the first restaurateur faced with the new requirement 
-- by providing him with the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can stretch the code, but we can't break it," Bohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials now acknowledge that the code could be more lenient 
toward new businesses, which are needed to revitalize Main Street. That 
process, however, could take another year, Bohr said. In the meantime, Lee "is 
caught in the middle of the change." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bohr said, Lee is being intransigent by refusing to accept agreements 
that seem to be acceptable to other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Bohr said, the city was meeting Wednesday with executives of 
BJ's Chicago Pizzeria to sign a lien agreement that would guarantee the city 
its $106,000 for 18 spaces allotted to the pizza store. 
</P>
<P>
 The money collected from restaurateurs on the newly renovated strip is 
targeted for construction of a new parking garage. But Bohr said there are no 
immediate plans to build a second garage because the one in use is still 
"woefully underutilized." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lee, that is the rub. He wondered aloud what short-term benefit he will 
receive for the $72,000 payment as long as no new garage is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohr was quick to point out Lee's direct benefit: "What he will get for his 
money is that he will be allowed to open the restaurant. He will meet code 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said that answer smacks of extortion. He said he has not experienced such 
difficulty in opening a fish taco store before. Wahoo's already has two 
restaurants in Costa Mesa and one in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth eatery is scheduled to open this month in Lake Forest. The 
application process in that South County city, Lee said, took him only two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, he said, he began the application process before the city 
started assessing the parking space fee. He is willing to pay the money anyhow, 
he said, but insists on doing so in yearly increments of $4,800 for the next 15 
years, without signing over rights of the property to the city. A lien, he 
said, could prove onerous if he wanted to sell the Wahoo's chain or if lack of 
traffic closed the business. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already paid the first year's installment and has personally lobbied 
City Council members, including Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, to allow him to 
make annual payments without putting up the entire amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Councilman Jim Silva met with Lee at the shuttered store and 
vowed to spearhead efforts to change the code quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said that he arranged to have a meeting with City Atty. Gail C. Hutton 
as early as today to hash out the legal issues and try to get the restaurant 
open by Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to try and work with businesses, not chase them away," Silva said. 
"We are in a recession, and money is very tight for everybody. The city has to 
do everything it can to facilitate business." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said that, if nothing comes of those meetings, he may be willing to break 
the law and open for business anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does that, city officials said, he faces an immediate shutdown.

SEC FINDS HABITUAL ROGUES AT BIG BROKERAGES; SECURITIES: THE AGENCY HAS 
LAUNCHED DISCIPLINARY CASES AT A QUARTER OF THE OFFICES IT INSPECTED. TOUGHER 
RULES ARE CALLED FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a report that caps nearly two years of investigation, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission concludes that some of Wall Street's biggest investment 
houses have failed to weed out brokers who habitually defraud customers, 
according to a copy obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The report on rogue brokers, due to be made public today, calls for much 
tougher regulation of both brokerages and brokers. It discloses that the SEC 
has launched disciplinary cases involving fully a quarter of the 161 branch 
offices it inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal activities included making unauthorized trades, excessive trading 
to generate commissions for brokers, putting customers into unsuitably risky 
securities and improperly switching customers from one mutual fund to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC review focused on the nine Wall Street brokerages that do the most 
business with individual investors. Three of the firms accounted for 88% of the 
improprieties found. 
</P>
<P>
 While the report did not identify the three, sources have said one is 
PaineWebber Inc. Officials of PaineWebber could not immediately be reached for 
comment late Wednesday. But top executives have denied that the firm has any 
systemic problem with brokers and said PaineWebber has recently adopted 
advanced computer systems to ferret out fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC report concludes that the number of dishonest brokers is probably 
small. But "the fact that 25% of the branch office examinations conducted in 
this project resulted in referrals for enforcement investigation and possible 
disciplinary action," it said, suggests that firms are not adequately 
supervising brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding also shows the need for stronger sanctions by the SEC and stock 
exchanges, the report concludes. Among its recommendations: Give enforcement 
authorities the right to ban brokers from the industry for life, with no right 
to reapply. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC investigation was launched in response to a Times series on rogue 
brokers published in July, 1992. It also followed questions to the SEC from 
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance. A parallel inquiry is being conducted by the 
General Accounting Office, and Markey's subcommittee is due to hold hearings on 
the issue this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times series reported that PaineWebber, Prudential Securities and several 
other well-known Wall Street firms hired and kept on brokers who had long 
records of lawsuits, arbitration cases, customer complaints and disciplinary 
action. The series noted that the SEC itself seldom brought cases against 
brokers and firms for cheating individual investors. The Times found that 
inquiries conducted by the New York Stock Exchange, the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers and other exchanges were extremely slow and shrouded in 
secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers kicked out of one firm for unethical behavior often had no trouble 
finding jobs at other firms, the series reported -- a finding the SEC report 
confirms. But the commission said that only a few of the bad brokers it 
identified were among their firms' 50 top producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over rogue brokers prompted the NYSE and NASD for the first 
time to make disciplinary cases public as soon as charges are filed, instead of 
only after all appeals are exhausted. It led to an overhaul of an NASD 
investors hot line that had been withholding information about brokers' 
disciplinary records. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech he is scheduled to deliver today in Washington, SEC Chairman 
Arthur Levitt Jr. is expected to emphasize that the problems are not endemic to 
the brokerage business. Nonetheless, he will call for greatly enhanced 
enforcement measures -- including, if necessary, steps against the firms' top 
executives.  
</P>
<P>
 Since his appointment last year by President Clinton, Levitt has focused on 
beefing up protections for individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC found that many firms had failed to institute hiring and supervisory 
practices to screen out bad brokers. The report says that some branch office 
managers did not take routine steps required by regulations to weed out 
dishonest conduct by brokers and that compliance officers who objected to the 
hiring of brokers were often overruled by others at their firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Using more inspectors and stepping up the frequency of routine inspections 
by the SEC and stock exchange examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Implementing new regulations to make clear that top management at firms, and 
the firms themselves, will be held accountable for employing brokers who have 
"a history of regulatory problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring tougher penalties against brokers, including longer suspensions 
and, for severe violations, permanent bans from the industry without the right 
to reapply. Currently, most who are banned for life are allowed to reapply 
eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 * Giving firms' compliance officials more say in firing brokers who break the 
rules. The report says that firms' top executives should be held accountable 
when they overrule a compliance officer's recommendation not to hire a broker 
or to fire someone who has drawn customer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing continuing education for brokers, especially about "new and 
exotic" investment products firms are selling. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms included in the SEC investigation were PaineWebber, Prudential 
Securities, Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter Reynolds, Kidder Peabody, A.G. Edwards 
and Kemper Securities, as well as Shearson Lehman Bros. and Smith Barney, which 
have merged since the investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC noted that because the investigation focused only on the nine big 
firms, the report does not draw any conclusions about how widespread the 
problem may be in the securities industry as a whole, which includes hundreds 
of brokerages throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry focused on a sample of 268 brokers who had records of customer 
complaints, arbitration cases and disciplinary action.  
</P>
<P>
 But the report notes that when examiners visited the branches where these 
brokers worked, they often found other brokers in the same offices who appeared 
to have committed serious violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC also found that some firms were not complying with requirements to 
promptly report complaints filed against brokers.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: EDS-SPRINT MERGER APPEARS TO BE A 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PAPER TIGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any bets as to how Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt is 
going to queer this deal?  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, should the proposed EDS-Sprint merger ever be consummated, it will 
no doubt prove to be the least consequential multibillion-dollar merger in the 
history of American telecommunications. The combination of EDS and Sprint 
reveals nothing important about the future of media. 
</P>
<P>
 But given all the multimedia jockeying among the telephone companies, cable 
companies, personal computer companies, software companies and the studios, the 
very insignificance of this mega-deal assumes some significance. Somewhere, 
Tele-Communications Inc.'s John Malone is shaking his head and snickering. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say EDSprint would be a foolish or wasteful deal; on the 
contrary, it might even be good for shareholders. However, let's not view this 
combination as the inevitable byproduct of the "relentless convergence of 
computers and telecommunications" or a "bold, opportunistic thrust to wring 
synergies from systems integrators and network providers."  
</P>
<P>
 This deal offers no unique insights into the digital future or promise for 
interactive innovation. There's no grand strategic vision of customer service 
or high-bandwidth infobahns here, only the most parochial of self-interests. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS desperately wants out of its unhappy marriage with General Motors Corp. 
What Ross Perot and Roger Smith put together, current EDS Chairman Les 
Alberthal and GM Chairman Jack Smith seem prepared to rend asunder. Sure, EDS' 
systems integration contracts with GM have been responsible for the 
overwhelming majority of the company's growth and profit over the past decade. 
But so what? The world's largest systems integration company desperately wants 
to be free of reporting to Detroit. EDS has been trying to sell itself to 
companies like AT&T and British Telecom for years. 
</P>
<P>
 GM, for its part, has finally decided that it really is a car company after 
all. Besides, the auto giant has a humongous underfunded pension liability that 
a sale of EDS could help ease. EDSprint enables EDS to regain autonomy while 
taking a huge equity stake in the only global marketplace that's growing as 
fast as computer services. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint, meanwhile, hardly has a choice. It's the third horse in a three-horse 
race. Sprint may be an $11-billion-a-year company, but it trails far behind 
AT&T and MCI in market power. AT&T is a colossus that can easily afford to 
spend $12 billion to acquire the nation's largest cellular phone company. MCI 
has maneuvered British Telecom into being a multibillion-dollar strategic 
investor. Soon, perhaps by 2000, the seven Baby Bells will be allowed to 
compete in Sprint's markets. They'll go after long-distance's No. 3 laggard 
like cape dogs after a wounded gazelle. So Sprint understandably feels a bit 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 In the purest sense, EDSprint would be a multibillion-dollar bet on the 
benefits of vertical integration. That's not a bad bet. There's no doubt that 
computer-to-computer communications is one of the best opportunities in 
telecommunications today. As more and more information goes digital and demands 
higher bandwidth and transmission rates, the distinction between computer 
networks and telecommunications networks begins to blur. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS, with its impressive array of global computer service contracts, and 
Sprint -- with some excellent fiber-optic network technologies already in place 
-- should easily be able to figure out how to customize data networks for their 
clients. "We want to be a one-stop provider for all information and 
communications needs," EDS' Alberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but is that what the customers want? Are they prepared to pay a premium 
for that? Or is this all merely a multibillion-dollar "so what"? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget, EDS' success as an $8.5-billion computer systems integrator and 
facilities manager comes in large part from its reputation as an honest broker. 
When EDS puts together a system for a customer, it insists that it seeks the 
best technology for the best price. 
</P>
<P>
 If IBM and not Hewlett-Packard is the way to go, EDS will reconfigure its 
designs accordingly. If Oracle databases make more sense than Sybase software, 
then that's what EDS will integrate. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS wants its customers to know that it reaps no special benefits by promoting 
one brand of computer or software over another. Indeed, EDS already works with 
AT&T, MCI and Sprint on proposals for corporate data networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if EDS and Sprint wed, how will EDS convince customers they're 
getting the best deal on their networks? If MCI or AT&T are prepared to 
underbid the Sprint portion of an EDS contract, what should a customer do? 
Stick with the highest bid? Should EDS turn Sprint into a telecommunications 
loss leader to capture more business? Or vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
 By merging with Sprint, EDS makes itself into a broker with an equity 
incentive to be less than objective. Conversely, should Sprint customers be 
concerned that the telecommunications company will analyze their data traffic 
to do market research for EDS? These are genuine concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's not entirely out of the question that EDSprint could collaborate to 
design value-added networks that can command premium prices in the market. But 
in an era when telecommunications competition is getting stiffer and the trend 
is toward open, non-proprietary computer architectures, is that the best 
business bet to make on the future? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you put aside the challenges of integrating two radically dissimilar 
corporate cultures, merging EDS and Sprint represents little but a calculated 
gamble that the potential value of vertical integration to customers 
comfortably outweighs the potential for alienating customers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gamble doesn't pay off, look for a quickie divorce. If it does, it's 
hardly likely to transform the way computing or telecommunications is done in 
the world.

SALE OF ESZTERHAS SCRIPT SCORES A SCREENWRITERS' BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Eszterhas, already the highest-paid screenwriter in movie history since 
the record $3-million sale of "Basic Instinct" in 1990, made another 
precedent-setting deal Wednesday that further underscores the rising power of 
top screenwriters in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old Eszterhas, in a breakthrough for what has been the least 
powerful talent in the film industry, becomes the first screenwriter in line to 
earn "first-dollar gross," or a percentage of all revenue collected from a 
movie by its distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, only top-drawer directors such as Steven Spielberg and Sydney 
Pollack and stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Costner have received 
first-dollar grosses from their movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas won the deal from independent Savoy Pictures, the 2-year-old 
producer and distributor that outbid Columbia Pictures and Morgan Creek 
Productions for the writer's latest script, "Foreplay," a rock 'n' roll mystery 
about serial killings set in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the deal say the groundbreaking arrangement guarantees 
the writer $1 million up front and another $3 million to $4 million (depending 
on budget size) as of the day principal photography begins, and 2.5% of every 
dollar Savoy takes in from all domestic revenue sources, from box office to 
video store. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. distributors such as Savoy typically split a film's box office gross with 
theater owners. Eszterhas could also make money from foreign distribution of 
the film, but he won't get a share of the gross. 
</P>
<P>
 A source indicated that only a "small portion" of the purchase price of the 
script will be applied against the potential gross earnings. And, in another 
apparent first, Eszterhas will also participate financially in soundtrack sales 
from his movie. He will collect a minimum of 1% on each unit sold. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the negotiating parties -- including Eszterhas; his agent at ICM, Guy 
McElwaine; his attorney, Sam Fischer, or Savoy -- would discuss financial 
aspects of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers' agents affirmed Wednesday that it is unheard of for a screenwriter to 
get a share of "first-dollar" gross in Hollywood. "It shows how the power of 
the screenwriter has really increased," said Jeremy Zimmer, an agent at United 
Talent Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The deal is not without risk to Eszterhas, however. Instead of his usual 
enormous flat fee up front, he agreed to accept just $1 million in exchange for 
the chance to earn much more if the movie is a smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank Price, the former Columbia Pictures chief who will share producer 
credit with Eszterhas, and Savoy officials insisted that the script is on the 
fast track for production as soon as a director and cast are ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't make the movie, the script rights revert back to me after 30 
months," said Eszterhas, whose earlier successes include "Jagged Edge" and 
"Flashdance." 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Savoy was founded in 1992 by veteran movie executives Victor A. 
Kaufman and Lewis J. Korman, who serve as chairman and president, respectively. 
Among the company's releases are "Shadowlands," "A Bronx Tale" and the recent 
"Serial Mom" and "No Escape."  
</P>
<P>
 While Eszterhas will receive less advance money for "Foreplay" than he did for 
"Basic Instinct" and some of his previous scripts, McElwaine estimates that his 
client could earn as much as $10 million if the movie is a hit on the order of 
"Basic Instinct." That film, starring Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas, grossed 
$350 million worldwide at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for gambling the up-front money is to get the back-end money, 
because we know they are going to make it," McElwaine said, adding, "Many 
aspects of this deal are unprecedented in modern motion picture history." 
</P>
<P>
 McElwaine said he recalls some time ago that Neil Simon received first-dollar 
gross on the underlying sale of one of his plays when he adapted it to the 
screen, but "my understanding is that was part of the purchase price of the 
play" and thus differs from the "Foreplay" deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt the writer of a piece deserves to be compensated as well as 
directors and actors," Eszterhas said. "In the case of an original screenplay, 
it is the writer's vision up on the screen. This deal says to me, it's possible 
that if screenwriters stick to their work and their guns, they'll be 
compensated that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas' screenwriting credits also include "Music Box," "Flashdance" and, 
most recently, "Sliver" (a flop domestically). In the age of the computer, he 
writes exclusively on an Olivetti manual typewriter, but he is hardly risking 
impoverishment in taking a flyer on "Foreplay." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, he has made a $3.4-million deal with producer Jon 
Peters and Columbia to adapt a book about Mafia kingpin John Gotti. That script 
is not yet written. Last year, he sold an idea for a rock musical, called 
"Showgirls," to producer Charles Evans for more than $1.5 million, then later 
auctioned the script to Carolco Pictures for $2.2 million. The picture was 
never made because director Paul Verhoeven chose to do "Crusade," with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, for Carolco. (Verhoeven may be back as the director of 
"Showgirls," because the movie company is having budget problems with 
"Crusade.") 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas also sold a four-page outline of a courtroom thriller, "Jade," to 
Paramount for $2.5 million. William Friedkin is expected to direct that picture 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas says "Foreplay" is not a "straight-ahead thriller" like "Jagged 
Edge" or "Basic Instinct," but more of a "mystery that's spooky -- not quite a 
comedy, but very funny."  
</P>
<P>
 The story centers on the relationship between Trish, a 20-year-old rock 
singer, and Vince, a burned-out, thirtysomething bass player-turned-cop who, 
along with his 60-year-old partner, Carl, investigates several murders 
involving young men and women.

CALPERS CHIEF HANSON LEAVING TO RUN HIS OWN INVESTING FIRM; SECURITIES: ONE 
SOURCE SAYS THE SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS LEADER HAS BEEN UNHAPPY FOR YEARS WITH HIS 
COMPENSATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale M. Hanson, who has helped lead a nationwide shareholder rights movement 
as chief executive of the influential $80-billion California Public Employees 
Retirement System, said Wednesday that he will resign to run a new private 
investment firm based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, 51, said he will remain on the job until July 11 while a search is 
conducted for his successor. He announced his resignation at a CalPERS board 
meeting in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said that general counsel Richard Koppes will be interim chief 
executive, but he noted that Koppes has told the board he does not want the job 
permanently. There was no formal statement from the CalPERS board, which 
apparently was not expecting the announcement. It scheduled a news conference 
for today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanson, reached by phone, said the board "has known for some time that I 
was looking for opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement follows closely the resignation of DeWitt Bowman as the 
fund's chief investment officer. But people familiar with CalPERS described 
that as probably coincidental, saying both men left voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said Hanson has been "unhappy for a couple of years" and wanted to 
make more money. His salary at CalPERS -- $110,000 plus a maximum bonus of 
$22,000 -- is typical among public pension fund managers, but it pales in 
comparison to the money that can be made in private investment circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 27 years in the public sector, I felt it was time to do something a 
little more entrepreneurial," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodger F. Smith, a partner at Connecticut-based Greenwich Associates, a 
business strategy research and consulting firm, said Hanson's departure "raises 
the question of how large funds keep the talent they need to do the best job 
for their members." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, who landed the top job at CalPERS in 1987 from the No. 2 post in the 
Wisconsin Retirement System, probably won't be missed in many corporate 
boardrooms around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hanson, the California system wielded its huge portfolio aggressively to 
pressure corporate boards to be more accountable to shareholders and 
independent of management, notably at General Motors, IBM, ITT, Occidental 
Petroleum and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, CalPERS wrote the 200 leading Standard & Poor's companies, 
urging them to follow General Motors' lead and enhance the power of their 
non-employee directors. It pointedly asked the companies to respond by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS has also won praise for its administration of health care plans for 
its nearly 1 million members. The system has used its clout to cut health care 
fees charged by providers and has been cited by the Clinton Administration as a 
model. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members, however, have faulted the system's management for 
providing poor service to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said he will become chief executive of newly formed American Partners 
Capital Group, which will seek to invest in single-family housing in California 
with money from smaller public pension funds around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He identified his partners as two politically prominent San Diegans: financier 
Tom Stickel, a Republican who recently sold the mortgage firm TCS Financial to 
Mexican interests, and lawyer Byron Georgiou, a 1992 Democratic candidate for 
Congress who was in the Cabinet of former Gov. Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said the firm hopes to initially build two funds totaling $200 million 
to provide "equity gap financing" for single-family homes. CalPERS has made 
similar investments, triggering the construction and sale of 7,500 homes.

FOR VICTIMS, A BROKEN TRUST; PIONEER INVESTORS LOOK FORWARD TO TRIAL OF GARY 
NAIMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL and GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sy Brenner cannot afford to travel to Normandy for a D-day reunion as he had 
hoped, or pay for his grandchildren's college education. He and his wife, Resa, 
do not even have the money to paint their house. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brenners and hundreds of other investors in failed Pioneer Mortgage 
got a boost to their collective morale last week when Pioneer President Gary 
Naiman was arrested on charges of mail fraud and laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courtroom will be full (during the trial), I guarantee you," said 
Brenner, 72. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brenners were among 2,300 Pioneer investors, most of them retirees, who 
lost more than $200 million when Naiman's mortgage brokerage and investment 
firm collapsed three years ago, sending shock waves throughout this city. 
Investors are expected to get back less than 20 cents on the dollar once assets 
are fully liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say more charges in the Pioneer case will be filed soon. Naiman, 
56, who was released on $400,000 bond last Thursday, was not available for 
comment. His attorney, Robert Rose of San Diego, did not return telephone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer's failure is another example of the hazards of trust deed (or junior 
mortgage) investments, a lightly regulated industry that has been plagued by 
fraud and abuse for years in California. These investments proved particularly 
risky in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the state's real estate market 
was severely depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Pioneer investors have had to sell their houses, move in with relatives, 
return to work or cut back on medical care to make ends meet. The collapse 
proved particularly devastating to the city's Jewish community because most of 
the investors were Jewish.  
</P>
<P>
 Several synagogues in the San Diego area are now in serious financial trouble 
because so many of their members suffered heavy financial losses, said Shelley 
Berman, president of Congregation Beth Tefilah. Jewish outreach and charitable 
activities have been curtailed as a result, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of Pioneer Mortgage has attracted little attention outside of San 
Diego, yet it ranks as one of the largest mortgage investment failures in the 
state's history -- a list that includes such well-known cases as Universal 
Mortgage of San Bernardino, Property Mortgage in Los Angeles and Golden Plan of 
California in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 A common thread running through the failures is unscrupulous operators who are 
given "unbridled, unrestricted authority" over investor funds, said Robin 
Wilson, general counsel of the California Department of Real Estate, the agency 
charged with regulating these mortgage investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1946 by Naiman's uncle, Pioneer initially prospered by promising 
investors steady annual returns of as much as 12%. Until shortly before Pioneer 
went bankrupt in January, 1991, investors said they received their monthly 
interest payments like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer made good on the promises by lending investor funds back to borrowers 
at high rates. The borrowers were willing to pay the high rates because they 
typically could not get loans elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Pioneer's loans were secured by second and third mortgages, a strategy 
that worked well when real estate prices were rising. But it proved disastrous 
when prices began falling at the end of the 1980s and troubled borrowers began 
to default. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer, which started with home mortgage loans only, saw its problems 
escalate after it began making riskier loans involving troubled commercial and 
hotel properties. In case after case, as real estate prices fell, there wasn't 
enough value left in the underlying properties to pay off first mortgages, much 
less the junior loans arranged by Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, according to the indictment filed last week in U.S. District 
Court, Naiman was simply using new investor funds to pay off debts to previous 
investors. The charges capped a three-year federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman "got into trouble because he was out of his element," said Dennis 
Schmucker, who took over as Pioneer's chief executive after the firm went into 
bankruptcy. "He didn't have the sophistication or managerial abilities to 
handle this type of operation. . . . Investors were throwing more money at him 
than he could use." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are still waiting to find out how much of their investments they 
will recoup. Civil lawsuits have generated about $20 million in awards from 
Pioneer-related businesses, but it will be several years before the task of 
selling Pioneer's remaining assets and making distributions to investors is 
complete.  
</P>
<P>
 Naiman, described as charming and low-key, gained a high profile by making 
donations to various synagogues and the United Jewish Federation and by being 
active in the Israeli bond sales campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 "All our friends thought the world of Gary Naiman, so we started out small and 
kept giving him more and more," said retiree Desda Abild of Coronado.  
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Robert, ended up investing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars they made from the sale of their clothing manufacturing firm in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pioneer's failure forced the Abilds to sell their condominium on 
Coronado's oceanfront and radically change their lifestyle. They still need 
financial help from friends and family to rent an apartment in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
 The Abilds have learned to cope with their reduced circumstances, but like 
other investors, they are looking forward to Naiman's upcoming trial.  
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I've killed him many times, many ways, slowly and painfully," 
Robert Abild said, laughing slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investigators have been frustrated because of the three-year lag between 
bankruptcy and the filing of criminal charges. And those charges have accused 
Naiman of defrauding only one couple, though additional charges are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agents of the FBI and the IRS have been interviewing hundreds of people in 
the San Diego area," said Ted Kashuk, one Pioneer investor. "But to have waited 
3 1/2 years for (the indictment) is absolutely distasteful to us. We're 
outraged that it took this long." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Brady said the investigation took so long because 
of the complexity of the alleged crime and because of Naiman's shrewdness. "You 
don't get people to trust you with $200 million of their money unless you're 
pretty sharp," Brady said.

STOCKS RALLY FOR SECOND DAY, BUT DOLLAR STILL IN DOLDRUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar tumbled in value Wednesday after the Federal Reserve Board's latest 
boost in interest rates failed to restore confidence in the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But stocks, still basking in the afterglow of the Fed's tough anti-inflation 
moves, staged a strong rally. And bond yields were mostly lower for a second 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traders expected the dollar to gain after the Fed raised its two key 
interest rates half a point Tuesday, signaling an aggressive attempt to keep 
the economy's growth -- and inflation -- moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising U.S. short-term interest rates, the Fed in theory is supporting the 
dollar by making short-term securities here more attractive than foreign 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But currency traders sold the dollar on Wednesday, in part because the Fed 
indicated Tuesday that its latest rate increase may be the last for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, traders worried that today's government report on the nation's 
merchandise trade balance for March will reveal another huge deficit. That 
raised fears that the Clinton Administration could return to a policy of 
allowing the dollar to weaken in an effort to narrow the trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar slid to 1.658 German marks from 1.673 on Tuesday. It 
also dropped to 103.50 Japanese yen from 104.45. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials added just 12.28 points to 3,732.89 
after Tuesday's 49-point surge. But the broad market, which had lagged the Dow 
on Tuesday, was far stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 4.32 points, or 1%, to 453.69. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks surged 10.38 points, or 1.5%, 
to 721.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers by 16 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 15 to 
11 on Nasdaq, and trading in both markets was active. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said more investors were willing to bargain-hunt on the expectation 
that the bond market is settling down and that Wall Street will again start to 
focus on stocks' earnings growth rather than on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on most bonds eased for a second day, though the euphoria of Tuesday's 
Fed-induced rally was missing. Yields on one-year Treasury bills fell to 5.17% 
from 5.27% on Tuesday, and the 10-year T-note yield slipped to 7.02% from 
7.05%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 30-year T-bond, the yield edged up to 7.27% from Tuesday's 7.26%. 
Traders said longer-term bonds were hurt by worries about the dollar's next 
move. A weak dollar could prompt foreign investors to dump U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds may also have been held back by another surge in key commodities 
Wednesday. Massive buying by commodity funds propelled soybean prices to 
four-month highs, as the market felt the impact of an early Midwestern dry 
spell that could cut crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
 July soybean futures shot up 21.5 cents to $7.02 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil also rallied after a weekly report showed crude oil inventories fell, 
suggesting little slack in the refinery system. June crude oil futures rose 40 
cents to $17.99 a barrel on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking stocks continued to surge, helped by expectations for stable 
interest rates ahead. Wells Fargo jumped 1 7/8 to 148 3/4, BankAmerica gained 1 
to 48 7/8, Chase Manhattan added 3/4 to 37 1/8 and Banc One was up 3/4 to 33. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation stocks rallied. The Fed's signal Tuesday that it is finished 
raising rates for a while helped increase confidence in the economic recovery's 
sustainability. 
</P>
<P>
 Among transport issues, Conrail jumped 2 1/2 to 53 1/4, Burlington Northern 
gained 2 3/8 to 55 1/2, UAL added 2 3/8 to 120 1/4 and Airborne Freight surged 
1 3/8 to 37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rising industrial issues included Scott Paper, up 1 7/8 to 47 3/8; Monsanto, 
up 1 3/8 to 81 7/8; Nucor, up 1 1/2 to 62 1/2; Alcoa, up 1 1/8 to 71 5/8, and 
Inland Steel, up 7/8 to 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecom shares were also strong. AT&T jumped 1 3/8 to 55 1/4, Newbridge 
Networks gained 2 3/4 to 46 1/2, DSC Communications leaped 1 7/8 to 57 3/4 and 
Nextel Communications soared 3 3/4 to 34 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Woolworth fell 2 to 15. It reported a first-quarter loss 
and announced that an internal probe of accounting irregularities uncovered no 
wrongdoing by management.  
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 index eased 7 points to 3,116.5 while 
Frankfurt's DAX index added 7.70 points to 2,267.41. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index surged 431.94 points to 9,476.64. Tokyo's 
Nikkei index added 19.20 points to 20,152.73.

 Report Warns of Risk in Derivatives: A study concluded that the $12-trillion 
derivatives market poses serious risk to the U.S. financial system that could 
force a thrift-style bailout with taxpayers footing the bill.The report warned 
of "significant gaps and weaknesses" in the system of overseeing the biggest 
derivatives dealers. It called for laws to tighten control over the market, 
more disclosure of the firms' dealings, added safeguards against loss, closer 
scrutiny of dealers and global coordination of regulators. Banks, brokerages 
and other industry players disagreed with the conclusions in the 196-page 
report, saying the recommended changes would harm the U.S. economy.

SENATE PASSES BILL TO DELAY FOOD LABELING RULES FOR 3 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate has passed a bill that would give food manufacturers three more 
months to comply with federal food labeling rules, sparing them the cost of 
junking old labels. The House of Representatives is expected to approve the 
bill soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), passed the Senate late 
Tuesday after a week of intensive lobbying by food packaging groups, which said 
the industry would lose at least $100 million if forced to discard old labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a practical solution to a very pressing problem," said Steven B. 
Steinborn, an attorney with Hogan & Hartson in Washington, which represents 
several companies that package private-label foods for grocery chains. "The 
three-month extension will provide enormous benefits, giving manufacturers time 
to use existing labels." 
</P>
<P>
 Labeling rules that went into effect on May 8 require companies to display 
extensive nutritional information on food labels. U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration rules require that any package filled after that date must bear 
the new label. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA made no attempt to block Senate action. The extension is not expected 
to have a big impact on consumers, since many foods already have the new 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
 As the deadline neared, some packaging companies and food processors -- 
particularly those that make private-label foods for supermarkets -- began 
pushing for an extension that would allow them to use up their inventories of 
old labels.  
</P>
<P>
 The Can Manufacturers Institute, an industry group representing the nation's 
four largest beverage can makers, obtained a temporary restraining order on May 
6 barring the government from enforcing the rules against them.  
</P>
<P>
 The Senate bill permits all food companies to use labels printed before May 8 
until Aug. 8. To receive an extension, the companies must certify to the 
secretary of health and human services that it will comply with new labeling 
requirements after Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate bill makes a special allowance for producers of milk or juice 
products, allowing them to print old labels up to Aug. 8. This is because many 
small milk and juice producers have been unable to convert printing plates to 
the new label format.

 MEXICAN STOCKS 
</P>
<P>
 * The market rallied briskly Wednesday, helped by strength on Wall Street and 
by a fresh recommendation from brokerage Smith Barney Shearson. The Bolsa index 
jumped 86.59 points to 2,375.18. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smith Barney changed its rating on the market to "neutral" from "sell" and 
recommended stocks such as Telmex, Cifra and Grupo Carso. The firm predicted 
that Mexican interest rates are close to peaking. But at the weekly auction of 
treasury bills, or cetes, the yield on the 28-day bill rose to 16.41% from 
16.02% last week. Traders said the government restricted the amount of cetes 
sold in an effort to keep rates artificially low.

 Saudi Arabia, whose export income is almost entirely dependent on the volatile

steady its economy through a period of low oil prices. The government may also 
study selling some of its commercial state assets.

ARCO TRANSFERS MANAGEMENT OF SAVINGS PLAN; SECURITIES: THE COMPANY PLACES AN 
EMPLOYEE FUND WITH AN OUTSIDE MANAGER BECAUSE OF A 5.3% LOSS FROM DERIVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Atlantic Richfield Co. has transferred management of its Money Market Plus 
employee savings fund to an outside manager, in the wake of a steep loss the 
fund incurred in April because of derivative securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's 5.3% principal loss, reported in The Times last week, cost 
employees about $22 million of the $400 million they had invested in the fund. 
Arco has said it is seeking government approval to reimburse employees for the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco spokesman Al Greenstein confirmed Wednesday that the fund is now being 
directed by an outside money manager, which he declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
 The Money Market Plus fund had been run by Arco Investment Management Co., an 
Arco subsidiary that manages $1.5 billion in employees' retirement savings and 
regular savings. The subsidiary continues to run the savings plans' three other 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein declined to comment when asked if the Arco Investment Management 
employee directly responsible for the Money Market Plus fund was still with the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Arco this week gave employees more details on the derivative 
securities that had caused the surprise April loss in the fund, which had been 
marketed within Arco as an investment managed for "stability of principal." 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are often-complex investments whose value is derived from 
underlying baskets of stocks, bonds or other securities, or from changes in 
interest rates, currency values or commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives have exploded onto the financial scene in recent years, and they 
have been widely used by investment funds and corporations to make market bets 
or hedge. But since March several major companies have reported large losses in 
derivatives, mostly because of wild swings in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco said the derivatives that clipped the Money Market Plus fund were 
corporate notes and bank certificates that repaid principal only if market 
interest rates remained in a certain range. Because rates soared in April, the 
fund wasn't entitled to repayment of the notes and certificates in question, 
Arco said.

 Teamsters to Levy Extra Dues, Cut Spending: The executive board decided to cut 
the union's expenses at least $10 million and to assess each of its 1.5 million 
members another $1 a month until the organization's net worth, currently about 
$15 million, is restored to $25 million. The board also voted to suspend strike 
benefits in the meantime and to reconsider a program that allows thousands of 
local union officials to collect double pensions. Teamsters President Ron Carey 
has pushed reforms to head off financial disaster in the face of declining 
membership, frozen dues and soaring expenses.

 Venture Seeks to Tie Personal Computers to Cable TV: Intel Corp. has reached 
agreements with several major on-line service providers, including Prodigy 
Services, News Electronic Data and America Online, to deliver interactive 
services for personal computers via cable. Intel and General Instrument Corp. 
have been working with Comcast Corp. and Viacom International Inc. to offer 
high-speed access to services such as the Internet, home shopping and 
electronic news.Because of the huge amounts of data that can be sent over 
coaxial cables, data can be transferred to personal computers as much as 1,000 
times faster than today's fastest modems can transmit over the cable 
infrastructure. Intel said Tele-Communications Inc. and Rogers Cablesystems of 
Canada have also agreed to work on developing such capabilities.

 BMG and Sega Invest in Rocket Science Games: Sega Enterprises and Bertelsmann 
Music Group have invested a total of $12 million in Rocket Science Games, a 
small Palo Alto-based multimedia start-up that hopes to become the interactive 
age's equivalent of a major movie studio.The company said Sega's investment 
includes funding from Japan-based CSK Ventures. In the 10 months it has been in 
business, Rocket Science has gained notoriety for recruiting high-profile 
talent from both Hollywood and Silicon Valley to work on its sophisticated 
computer and video games. Veteran actor Ned Beatty stars in the company's first 
CD-ROM game, "Loadstar," due out this fall. BMG has agreed to distribute the 
firms' products in Europe.

 House OKs Credit Card Payment of Taxes: Taxpayers confronted with a bill from 
the Internal Revenue Service may eventually be able to say, "Charge it!" 
Wide-ranging tax legislation approved by the House would authorize the IRS to 
collect payments by credit card, in addition to the checks and money orders now 
accepted. If it happens, it would be part of the IRS plan to have far more 
taxpayers paying and filing by telephone and computer by the turn of the 
century.The legislation, approved on a voice vote, allows the IRS to negotiate 
arrangements with credit card issuers, includes provisions for resolving 
billing disputes and prohibits credit card companies from using customers' tax 
information for marketing. Senate approval is also required.

 State Senate Panel Rejects Taco Bell Tax Break: The committee turned aside a 
measure that would have granted a 6% investment tax credit to Irvine-based Taco 
Bell and other companies if they expand or establish corporate offices in 
California. The Revenue and Taxation Committee defeated the bill, offered by 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, after several members expressed concern that it 
would cost the state too much revenue.

 NYSE Denies Gutfreund's $56.3-Million Claim: A New York Stock Exchange 
arbitration panel rejected John Gutfreund's claim against the company he once 
led, Salomon Inc. The three-member panel said Gutfreund's claims against 
Salomon and its Salomon Bros. Inc. subsidiary were "denied in their 
entirety."In addition, the panel said Gutfreund must pay $96,000 in forum fees. 
Gutfreund, toppled in the wake of Salomon's August, 1991, U.S. Treasury bond 
scandal, sought "to recover compensation, benefits, other damages, interest, 
costs and attorneys' fees." Gutfreund and his lawyers were not immediately 
available for comment.

HAFT FAMILY SETTLES FEUD, WILL SPLIT RETAIL-REAL ESTATE EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARA SWISHER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Days before a trial that could have led to the breakup of one of Washington's 
largest retail and real estate fortunes, the Haft family has abruptly settled 
its bitter business feud in the quiet of a closed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the settlement, reached Tuesday, the two sides of the 
once-close clan will essentially go separate ways.Family patriarch Herbert H. 
Haft and his son, Ronald, will pay Herbert's wife, Gloria Haft, and the 
couple's other two children, Robert M. and Linda Haft, an undisclosed sum for a 
large part of their interests in Haft family assets, according to sources close 
to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's holdings include the largest portfolio of shopping centers in the 
area and retail chains such as Crown Books Corp. and Trak Auto Corp. The assets 
are estimated to be worth up to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, Herbert and Ronald Haft will continue to run 
the companies, and Gloria, Robert and Linda Haft will receive cash for much of 
their share of the family's vast privately held real estate assets. Gloria, 
Robert and Linda Haft own more than half the real estate, which is estimated to 
be worth more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But family members will continue to hold on to their various blocks of voting 
stock in the publicly held companies, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Herbert and Gloria Haft -- who built the family fortune together 
from a single drugstore in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood in northwest 
Washington -- have agreed to an uncontested divorce after almost half a century 
of marriage.

GROUPS SEEK EASING OF BANK RULES ON MINORITY LOAN DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of state community groups seeking to loosen federal regulations 
governing bank lending to minority businesses is taking its case to the public 
today in a full-page advertisement in West Coast editions of the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $3,000 ad headlined "Who's Afraid of Alan Greenspan?" the groups, 
spearheaded by the San Francisco-based Greenlining Coalition, argue for the 
loosening of Federal Reserve Board regulations prohibiting banks from 
voluntarily compiling data on minority and female business loan applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Chairman Greenspan has refused requests from the groups to do so. Bob 
Moore, a spokesman for the central bank, said changing the regulations would 
require action by the entire board. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups' goal is to allow banks to keep track of how many business and 
consumer loans they make to women and minorities, thereby making the banks more 
accountable. Banks already track the race and gender of home loan applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups also want the Clinton Administration to transfer oversight of 
community lending practices from the Fed to another agency, such as the 
Comptroller of the Currency. In a letter dated April 21, Comptroller Eugene A. 
Ludwig urged Greenspan and the Fed to revise its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of access to bank capital has been cited as a barrier to the economic 
development of minority and inner-city communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the regulations were instituted to prohibit banks from 
discrimination. PATRICK LEE

MORTGAGE RATES SLIDE IN WAKE OF LATEST FEDERAL RESERVE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mortgage rates retreated from their climb toward double-digit territory 
Wednesday following the Federal Reserve Board's latest and most aggressive 
inflation-fighting move this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That has brought a sigh of relief from mortgage bankers, real estate agents 
and prospective homeowners who feared a difficult market due to rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going to be a tough season. . . . This should help business," said Jim 
Antt, president of Jim Antt Realtor in Bakersfield. "We've already gotten more 
calls from people wanting to see property." 
</P>
<P>
 The average rate on a 30-year mortgage -- which rose two percentage points in 
just seven months to 1992 levels -- fell from 8.90% late Friday to 8.75% on 
Tuesday, when the Fed hiked two key interest rates, according to HSH 
Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Fed pushed short-term rates higher, longer-term rates -- used in 
setting mortgage rates -- fell in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 The average rate on a 15-year loan fell to 8.24% from 8.40%, while the 
one-year, adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 5.70% from 5.53%, HSH said. 
</P>
<P>
 By early Wednesday, some lenders had gone even lower, with at least four 
offering 30-year mortgages at 8.125% and about a dozen at 8.25%, among them PNC 
Mortgage Corp. in Greenbelt, Md., said Keith Gumbinger, a spokesman for HSH. 
Just last week, he said, several banks were firmly in the 9% range. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response (to the Fed increase) was virtually immediate," Gumbinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank sent a dramatic signal of its determination to hold down 
inflation by raising the discount rate it charges banks by half a percentage 
point, to 3.5%. It also boosted from 3.75% to 4.25% the federal funds rate, 
which banks charge each other on overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount rate increase was the first in five years. The Fed had already 
pushed the Fed funds rate up three previous times this year, though in smaller 
increments of a quarter percentage point each time. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, major banks raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage 
point, to 7.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rates on many short-term consumer and business loans are poised to go 
higher, long-term fixed-rate mortgages managed to buck the trend this time 
thanks to a rally in the bond market, which cheered the Fed tightening as a 
positive step against inflation.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL / SPOTLIGHT ON TAIWAN; TIPS FOR 
TAIWAN: DON'T FORGET BUSINESS CARDS -- OR UMBRELLA

<P>
 Taiwan, although it has limited official diplomatic relations, is one of the 
busiest trade and manufacturing centers in East Asia. The island's location -- 
near Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines and mainland China -- and the 
fact that it has one of the busiest airports in Asia make it easily accessible 
to business travelers. Getting There 
</P>
<P>
 Both a passport and a visa are required to visit Taiwan. Visas for up to 60 
days are free and can be obtained by contacting the Coordination Council for 
North American Affairs in Los Angeles at (213) 389-1215. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers are usually headed to Taipei on the northern part of the 
island, the country's center of commerce and its largest city. Industry in 
Taipei is primarily electronics and computers, said James Yu, spokesman for the 
nation's Coordination Council in Los Angeles. Taiwan maintains no formal 
consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major business destinations include Kaohsiung in the south, a harbor 
city convenient for export and import. The country's heavy manufacturing is 
concentrated in this area. Taichung, between Taipei and Kaohsiung, is a center 
for service industries such as real estate and banking. 
</P>
<P>
 Major Asian airlines, including China Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean 
Airlines, Philippine Airlines and Singapore Airlines, as well as U.S. carriers 
Northwest and Continental, fly into Taiwan. International flights go to Chiang 
Kai-shek International Airport, about 45 minutes outside of Taipei in Taoyuan. 
There is shuttle service to the older Sung-Shan domestic airport near downtown 
Taipei. Domestic Travel 
</P>
<P>
 For travel within the country there are two domestic airlines: China Airlines 
and Far East Air Transport. There are about two dozen 40-minute flights daily 
between Taipei and Kaohsiung. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Taiwan, it is best to rely on taxi drivers, according to Yu. "Traffic 
is very, very bad, particularly in Taipei," he said. Cabdrivers, who operate 
with meters and don't expect a tip (although it is customary to let the driver 
keep the change), can get you where you're going more quickly than you could on 
your own, Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Car rental is relatively expensive, and a Taiwanese driver's license is 
required if you are staying longer than two months. Drive on the right side of 
the road. Climate 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan is subtropical, with rain heaviest from April to August. Typhoons are a 
risk in summer and fall. A sweater or light coat may be needed from late fall 
to early spring. Snow occasionally falls in the mountains in midwinter. 
Security 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to some other Asian destinations, traveler's checks are widely 
accepted throughout Taiwan, Yu said. Note that banking hours are 9 a.m to 3:30 
p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to noon Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan is generally considered a safe place for foreigners to visit. According 
to the U.S. State Department, the crime rate is low. Theft is the most common 
crime affecting foreigners. Any theft -- of a passport in particular -- should 
be reported both to the local police and the American Institute in either 
Taipei or Kaohsiung. The American Institute in Taiwan is authorized to serve 
U.S. citizens as an embassy, as there is no embassy in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign businesses have occasionally been the subject of extortion attempts. 
Get recorded travel information from the State Department's Bureau of Consular 
Affairs ((202) 647-5225) before planning a trip. Travelers who register at the 
American Institute once they arrive will receive up-to-date security 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 As in all foreign travel, U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country 
they are visiting. Taiwan's laws on possession or sale of drugs carry stiff 
sentences and large fines. Customs 
</P>
<P>
 When doing business in Taiwan, be sure to have business cards bearing your 
name and title, Yu said. It's customary to exchange such cards with the person 
you are meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not customary to bring a gift to a first meeting with a new 
business associate, one is welcomed if you know the business contact well. 
Lodgings 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1970s, Taiwan has seen rapid economic growth, and with it has 
come a buildup in hotels. Major cities now have a number of quality business 
hotels. For example, in Taipei, business travelers can stay at the Hilton 
International Taipei (38 Chung-Hsiao W. Road, Sec. 1; (02) 311-5151) or the 
Lai-Lai Sheraton (12 Chung-Hsiao E. Road, Sec. 1; (02) 321-5511). 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer a traditional Chinese atmosphere but still want business 
amenities, Yu recommends the Grand Hotel, a Taipei landmark that resembles an 
ancient Chinese palace (1 Chung-Shan N. Road, Sec. 4; (02) 596-5565). 
</P>
<P>
 In Kaohsiung, there is the Ambassador Hotel (202 Min-Sheng 2nd Road (07) 
211-5211), or the Grand Hotel (2 Yuan-Shan Road, Cheng-Hing Lake, (07) 
383-5911). 
</P>
<P>
 While staying in hotels, be aware that although most staff members speak some 
English, they may not understand your requests even if they indicate they do. 
When in doubt, ask the hotel for an interpreter. Because of Japan's 50-year 
occupation of Taiwan, some older Taiwanese speak Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Most hotels and restaurants in Taiwan add a 10% service charge to bills, so 
tips are not required.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON TAIWAN; THE TAIWANESE ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taiwan, which in 1991 ended the nearly 43 years of emergency rule that had 
prevailed since Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang established a government opposed 
to the communist takeover of the mainland on the Formosa island in 1949, has 
also moved in recent years to restructure its economy, including decreasing 
protectionism, increasing foreign investment and allowing Taiwanese businesses 
to invest abroad. The economy is currently booming, as evident by a string of 
annual trade surpluses. Taiwan has the world's largest foreign currency 
reserves, now close to $90 billion. Labor 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% Taiwan's 20.6 million people are in the workforce. The government 
provides free primary and junior high education and schooling is compulsory for 
youth aged six to 15. The adult literacy rate is about 91%, considerably higher 
than mainland China's literacy rate of 73%, but slightly lower than Japan or 
the United States, which both average at about 98%. Manufacturing 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's major manufactured products are electronics and automobiles. Textile 
and garment making and toy manufacturing remain significant industries, but 
because Taiwan's wage rates have risen in recent years, jobs in these labor 
intensive industries have been moving to Asian nations with lower labor costs, 
particularly mainland China. Taiwan exports much of its manufactured output and 
in recent years has waged a campaign to increase exports of its higher value 
manufactured goods. Manufacturing accounts for 40% of the nation's gross 
domestic product. Services 
</P>
<P>
 Making up 45% of Taiwan's GDP, the service industry in Taiwan is expected to 
grow faster than other sectors in the next few years. Since the government 
loosened rules on foreign participation in its economy in the early 1980s, 
international advertising agencies and foreign management consultants have been 
flooding in. There are more than 30 foreign banks in Taiwan, but most have only 
one branch because foreign banks are still restricted to three branches. 
Transportation 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the government started a six-year program to improve infrastructure 
and promote domestic jobs. Foreign companies have been vying aggressively for a 
part of the program, expecting to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Most 
parts of the island are accessible by highway and railway networks. 
Construction of a mass transit system is underway in Taipei. Because Taiwan 
lies between two major business travel destinations-Japan and Hong 
Kong-Taiwan's Chiang Kai Shek international airport is increasingly becoming a 
hub for intra-Pacific air travel. Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture -- now 3.5% of GDP -- has played a lessor role in the economy 
since 1965 when manufacturing began to boom. However, agriculture is still 
crucial to Taiwan because of its political situation -- it is only recognized 
by about 30 countries. Intensive farming, for instance, has made it 
self-sufficient in rice. Other major crops include sugar cane, maize and sweet 
potatoes. Trade 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's major trading partners are Japan and the United States. The United 
States, which does not recognize Taiwan as a nation, has been pressuring Taiwan 
to reduce its huge trade surplus. Fearing, reduced trade with the United States 
because of approval of the North America Free Trade Agreement -- which reduces 
trade barriers among the United States, Mexico and Japan -- Taiwain has 
increased investments in manufacturing in Mexico.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON TAIWAN; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE...

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taiwan, isolated diplomatically since 1971, when the United Nations accepted 
the mainland government as China's legitimate representative, has nonetheless 
developed one of the strongest economies in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. 
companies will find Taiwanese executives easily adaptable, but they should be 
aware of strong Chinese cultural influences on the way business is conducted. 
DO: 
</P>
<P>
 * Work with Taiwanese partners on joint venture deals. It helps to cut through 
cultural barriers. As in any country, seek out partners with similar goals and 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make appointments about a week in advance. If you plan to meet with 
government officials, allow more time as a sign of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use lawyers who are registered in Taiwan for court cases. Foreign attorneys 
can draft legal contracts, but local lawyers are preferred. Taiwan's commercial 
laws reflect U.S. and European influences but are slightly different. 
</P>
<P>
 * Draft contracts in Mandarin Chinese, the official language. English can be 
used if both parties agree to it, but an official Chinese translation should 
always be available because the Chinese document will be used to adjudicate any 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use taxis in major cities, such as Taipei, where traffic congestion presents 
major problems during peak hours. As in New York, taxis are easily hailed from 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect to conduct negotiations in English. Though Chinese is the official 
language, many younger executives have been educated in the United States and 
are familiar with American business culture. DON'T: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't take disputes to court right away. In fact, contracts should specify 
how disputes should be resolved. The preferred way to handle a business 
conflict in Taiwan is through arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't rely only on foreign accounting firms. The government recognizes only 
those reports filed by accountants registered in Taiwan, because accounting 
standards are different. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be upset if business associates are late for appointments, especially 
in Taipei. Traffic jams commonly cause delays, and business executives usually 
have several appointments during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be surprised when your host uses his or her chopsticks to pick up food 
for you during a meal. It's considered polite in that culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't attempt to drive to appointments between cities, because cities tend 
to be far apart and traffic jams on highways can double traveling time. Fly 
instead. Domestic airlines have vastly improved their intercity schedules in 
recent years.

 Housing Project: Greystone Homes, the Newport Beach home builder, has closed 
escrow on 34 1/2 acres of land in Los Angeles County where it plans to build 
116 single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes, to be built in the Rowland Heights area, are to feature French 
Normandy-style architecture and have as many as five bedrooms.Prices will be in 
the low $300,000s. 
</P>
<P>
 Greystone, one of the 10 largest home builders in Southern California, 
purchased the land from the project's developer Ridgemoor Partners, an arm of 
Rockefeller & Associates Realty in New York. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purchase is part of our aggressive land acquisition program," said Larry 
Webb, president of the South Coast division of Greystone Homes. "Although we 
continue to be an active builder in Orange County, this purchase demonstrates 
our plans to branch out more into the growing areas of Los Angeles County."  
</P>
<P>
 Greystone now has projects in Mission Viejo, La Habra, Placentia and Lakewood.

 Looking to pay off its debts and increase its financial flexibility, Newport 
Beach home builder Presley Cos. filed Wednesday with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to sell $200 million in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Presley's capital restructuring plan, announced earlier, $95 million of 
debt will be converted into common stock.The company said it has also arranged 
a $150-million line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette will underwrite the bond sale, along 
with Bear, Stearns & Co. and Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley, hard hit by the early '90s real estate slump and tripped up by its 
own aggressive land acquisition policy, appears to be bouncing back. The 
company reported a profit of $1.46 million for its latest quarter, contrasted 
with a $3.25-million loss for the same period last year.

 So, you've never paid attention to Barbra Streisand before? Well, you're in 
for a dousing now. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next week, there will be a virtual Streisand tsunami surrounding her 
six appearances at The Pond of Anaheim starting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she going to wear the clothes she sketched and had made by pal Donna Karan? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is she going to make a switch in the middle of her concert tour and wear 
one of the three long, eggshell-colored empire dresses just sent over by Ray 
Aghayan, who has worked with her since her appearance on "The Judy Garland 
Show" in 1963? 
</P>
<P>
 And should you buy Streisand memorabilia at The Pond or at the Barbra Boutique 
at Bullock's in South Coast Plaza, Woodland Hills, Beverly Center and Century 
City? In the collection Streisand helped design, there are official concert 
tour jackets ($400), "Barbra -- Then and Now" commemorative photo T-shirts 
($25), anoraks with embroidered tour logo ($140) and nightshirts emblazoned 
with a B ($25). The thinking behind this is that while the haves have concert 
tickets, at least the have-nots have Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was more involved in product design than almost any other artist," says 
Mark Coopersmith, senior vice president of marketing at Sony Signatures, a 
division of the entertainment giant that's taking advantage of pent-up demand 
for Streisand-imprinted merchandise. "She sat in design meetings and gave us 
advice and sketches of how she wanted everything to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Given Streisand's penchant for directing, this isn't a surprise. She has never 
been shy about expressing ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment she stepped into the spotlight more than 30 years ago, 
everyone knew the Brooklyn teen was no conformist. When management suggested 
she change her name to something easier to spell on the marquee, she made it 
more complicated by keeping her last name and dropping the middle "a" from 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 For Streisand, 52, knowing what she wants and how she wants it done goes 
beyond directing her performances or personal merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 It extends to her makeup, which she's always done herself, including the 
infamous Cleopatra eyeliner that turned her looks instantly from odd to exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 It applies to her choice of onstage costumes, which have ranged from the 
gossamer gown she wore at a Central Park concert in 1967 to unusual choices for 
Oscar nights, including her peekaboo theatrics and bosomy gowns that would make 
Dolly Levi proud. 
</P>
<P>
 The common denominator in anything Streisand does, buys or wears is that it's 
original. It's always Barbra. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget for a moment the lapse of good taste that compels her to wear her 
fingernails in a ghastly length rarely seen outside the manicure hell of QVC, 
as well as past unfortunate frizzy poodle perms.  
</P>
<P>
 Her fashion taste is usually innovative and in the mid-'60s even landed her on 
the International Best Dressed List.  
</P>
<P>
 Streisand the shopper and collector was famous for being a thrift-store junkie 
well beyond the years in which that was all she could afford. Currently, she's 
tucked all her beloved '20s and '30s vintage finds and movie costumes away in 
closets. And in March she sold off some of her modern ornate gowns at the tail 
end of an auction of her decorative arts collection at Christies that brought 
in $6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her present taste in furnishings runs toward American Arts and Crafts, which 
is a more pared-down style, and her present fashion direction is equally 
uncluttered and solid. Her clothes are streamlined, and her hair is toned down 
in a flattering straight blond pageboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand sketched her costumes for the two shows she gave at the MGM Grand in 
Las Vegas New Year's Eve, and was so pleased with the results she incorporated 
them into this tour, says her spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 One costume is a long black velvet dress that shows off her curvy alabaster 
shoulders, with a perfect brooch at the bust and sweeping insert of cream 
satin. Another is an ivory suit with a long slit skirt. The classic designs 
were inspired partly by a recent visit to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, says 
her spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both outfits were stitched by seamstresses in the New York headquarters of 
Donna Karan, Streisand's close friend who happens to be the preeminent woman 
designer in American fashion. (Best buddy Karan even flew to London to attend 
the opening night of the singer's Wembley Arena concerts last month.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though Streisand has always liked to say she designs her clothes, these 
finished costumes are most accurately described as a "collaboration" between 
Streisand and Karan. "That's how Donna describes it, and that's OK with 
Barbra," says Patti Cohen, Karan's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand has been buying Karan's Collection -- a sophisticated line of sleek 
sportswear separates found in top department and specialty stores -- for many 
years, but their collaboration began with these costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her publicist, Streisand has been creating her clothes since she 
was a teen. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the outfits for the concerts illustrates how little things change," 
says publicist Dick Guttman. The costume on her first album cover, a recording 
at the Bon Soir, a bar in New York's Greenwich Village, Guttman says, "is a 
man's vest of herringbone tweed over a long skirt with a slit (she designed in 
1962 that is) not that different from the gray pin-striped wool ensemble she 
wore in performance last year at the inaugural ball of President Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 The ivory suit she wears in this concert is a similar style. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand has such strong ideas on wardrobe that she's even been known to 
advise Hollywood's legendary costume designers on their business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent book, "Her Name is Barbra: An Intimate Portrait of the Real 
Barbra Streisand" (Carol Publishing, $25), author Randall Riese relays the 
story of when Streisand met with Irene Sharaff to discuss the costumes for the 
1968 film, "Funny Girl." The star arrived with bags of shoes and antique 
clothing she wanted to wear as character Fanny Brice. 
</P>
<P>
 During "Hello, Dolly!" the two were again at odds, the author says, when 
Sharaff went for historical accuracy and Streisand wanted flattering styles, 
including anachronistic straight sleeves instead of authentic leg-of-muttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century-Fox Studio executives sided with Streisand, saying simply, 
"Give her what she wants." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that was music to her ears.

L.A. STORIES; NO ESCAPING THE CLUTCHES OF A CULT FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dozen years as a newspaper reporter, I have asked for only two 
autographs. One of them was from my childhood idol, pool player Steve Mizerak. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was from Becky. 
</P>
<P>
 You know -- Becky, the ex-topless dancer in the cult classic "Henry: Portrait 
of a Serial Killer." In the end of the movie, she gets hacked to pieces, her 
dismembered body abandoned inside a baby-blue suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 I first saw "Henry" four years ago as a Sunday matinee. During this 
inauspicious film, based on the lives of self-professed serial killers Henry 
Lee Lucas and Otis Toole, the not-so-dynamic duo kills 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dark-souled spirit of "Taxi Driver" and "Reservoir Dogs," the movie 
takes a sinister, unabashed look at violence in America, featuring a disturbing 
home invasion scene and others in which Henry -- the epitome of the urban 
bogyman -- snaps necks, wields a screwdriver and decapitates a dead victim with 
a kitchen knife. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, I needed instant therapy. I wanted to grab people by the 
collar as they filed to their cars and plead: "My God! How can we let people do 
this to one another?" 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's grip on me eventually wore off. (Although my wife still lives in 
fear, always locking the door, proclaiming, "Henry's out there.") 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the recent day at Hampton's in Hollywood. That's when I saw her: She 
set down my french fries and asked innocently if I wanted another Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 The glint of recognition slammed my cortex like some bad acid flashback. It 
was the same blond hair, that same petite frame and those sky-blue eyes. No, it 
couldn't be. Becky was my waitress! 
</P>
<P>
 I swallowed hard and asked the question that scores of "Henry" cult followers 
have asked before me: "Ahem. You're Becky, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 She smiled sweetly and nodded her head. But when I recited a few favorite 
lines from the film, Tracy Arnold looked at me and said, "Oh, you even remember 
dialogue. That scares me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then Arnold told her own scary story: how she'd been taken hostage by a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, then barely 22, the stage actress went "from Shakespeare to 
shock" -- landing her first film role in the low-budget "Henry," filmed in 
Chicago in just four weeks for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Paid $2,000 along with two other first-time film actors, Arnold played Otis' 
innocent kid sister who misguidedly falls in love with the brooding Henry and 
later falls to pieces as the movie's pitiful last victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold thought she had scored big-time with her first movie role. After all, 
she knew a lot about the real Henry Lee Lucas. Some of his supposed Texas 
victims were friends of her family. And Lucas -- now on Death Row -- spent time 
in jail near her hometown of Georgetown, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry," filmed in 1985, was shelved for five years after receiving an X 
rating for violence. But the film rose from the dead after critic Roger Ebert 
gave it a rave review at the 1990 Telluride (Colo.) Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, "Henry" has inspired a following of zealous fans who are either 
still losing sleep over the film or have now memorized Henry's deadpan lines 
during repeat viewings. I have friends -- grown men with sadistic streaks -- 
who still cannot bear to watch it. Still, the home video version even 
advertises "Henry" T-shirts and movie posters. 
</P>
<P>
 For co-stars Michael Rooker, who played Henry, and Tom Towles -- who portrayed 
Otis -- the movie's unlikely success translated into steady work: Rooker's 
resume includes roles in "JFK," "Sea of Love," and "Mississippi Burning," while 
Towles has scored regular film and television work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for Arnold, the film's success has spelled only frustration. And the 
public recognition she attributes to "my own little 15 minutes of fame." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time "Henry" hit the midnight market in 1990, Arnold had moved from 
Chicago to Hollywood to begin waitressing. She landed a few minor roles, 
including commercials for both McDonald's and Wendy's. Soon, though, the work 
disappeared. And the Becky sightings began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever just says 'Oh, you were in that little film,' " Arnold said. 
"It's always 'Oh, my God! It's you! You're Becky!' It's no small thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The sightings actually started before the film was commercially released -- 
among Hollywood insiders with access to bootleg copies of "Henry." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I was recognized, this guy just stared at me like I was a 
ghost," Arnold said. "When he finally approached me, I said, 'How did you find 
me? How did you get a copy of the film?' He just gave me a wicked little smile 
and said, 'Oh, it's around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has endured jokes among friends -- including the one that 
she'd make a great spokeswoman for American Tourister luggage. Once, Arnold was 
followed for several blocks by a grungy-looking character she believed was 
going to rob her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh, am I in trouble.' Then he walks up to me and says, 'Dude! You 
were in Henry! You were, like, so great!' " 
</P>
<P>
 But casting directors have been less than complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, these people can't see me as anybody else but Becky," Arnold said. 
"They all hear me read for roles and they say, 'Gee, you were great. We just 
don't know what to do with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's parents back in Texas can't bear to watch "Henry." 
</P>
<P>
 "I preferred to see Tracy in some sort of Cinderella-type movie," said Wayne 
(Pistol) Arnold. "I kept in mind that it was just a movie. After it was over, I 
told her 'Well, honey, at least you didn't take your clothes off.' We were 
pleased at that, at least." 
</P>
<P>
 Added mother Jean Arnold: "We're strict Southern Baptists and we don't even 
like to hear swear words. But it could have been worse. It could have been a 
porno movie. Women do those kind of films, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry" is still a topic of conversation in the Arnold family. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, my mother chided me for having an unlisted number -- which 
is unheard-of in rural Texas," Arnold said. "She wanted to know how people were 
going to get in touch with me. I said 'Mom, I have a movie out about a serial 
killer. I don't want people to get in touch with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now Arnold works three part-time jobs as she waits for mainstream Hollywood to 
come calling -- while trying to erase the black footnote a strange little movie 
has left on her career. (She has a role in "The Shot," an upcoming independent 
film; she plays a savvy Hollywood reporter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she makes the most out of her 15 minutes of movie fame. Like when I 
asked for an autograph for my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty," Arnold wrote, "I've made a deal with Henry and he's agreed to leave 
you alone. But I may come knocking." 
</P>
<P>
 That Tracy Arnold, she just slays me.

STREISAND, EVER THE DIRECTOR; SHE ACTS. SHE SINGS. SHE HELPS DESIGN HER TOUR 
CLOTHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If you've never paid attention to Barbra Streisand before, you're in for a 
dousing now. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next week, there will be a virtual Streisand tsunami surrounding her 
six appearances at the Anaheim Pond starting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she going to wear the clothes she sketched and had made by pal Donna Karan? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is she going to make a switch in the middle of her concert tour and wear 
one of the three long, eggshell-colored empire dresses just sent over by Ray 
Aghayan, who has worked with her since her appearance on "The Judy Garland 
Show" in 1963? 
</P>
<P>
 And should you buy Streisand memorabilia at the Pond or at the Barbra Boutique 
at Bullock's in Woodland Hills, the Beverly Center and Century City? In the 
collection Streisand helped design, there are official concert tour jackets 
($400), "Barbra -- Then and Now" commemorative photo T-shirts ($25), anoraks 
with embroidered tour logo ($140) and nightshirts emblazoned with a B ($25). 
The thinking behind this is that while the haves have concert tickets, at least 
the have-nots have Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was more involved in product design than almost any other artist," says 
Mark Coopersmith, senior vice president of marketing at Sony Signatures, a 
division of the entertainment giant that's taking advantage of pent-up demand 
for Streisand-imprinted merchandise. "She sat in on design meetings and gave us 
advice and sketches of how she wanted everything to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Given Streisand's penchant for directing, this isn't a surprise. She has never 
been shy about expressing ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment she stepped into the spotlight more than 30 years ago, 
everyone knew the Brooklyn teen-ager was no conformist. When management 
suggested that she change her name to something easier to spell on the marquee, 
she made it more complicated by keeping her last name and dropping the middle A 
from Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 For Streisand, 52, knowing what she wants and how she wants it done goes 
beyond directing her performances or personal merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 It extends to her makeup, which she's always done herself, including the 
infamous Cleopatra eyeliner that turned her looks instantly from odd to exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 It applies to her choice of onstage costumes, which have ranged from the 
gossamer gown she wore at a Central Park concert in 1967 to unusual choices for 
Oscar nights, including her peekaboo theatrics and bosomy gowns that would make 
Dolly Levi proud.

<P>

</P>
<P>
 The common denominator in anything Streisand does, buys or wears is that it's

</P>
<P>
 Forget for a moment the lapse of good taste that compels her to wear her 
fingernails in a ghastly length rarely seen outside the manicure hell of QVC, 
as well as past unfortunate frizzy poodle perms. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fashion taste is usually innovative, and in the mid '60s, it even landed 
her on the International Best Dressed List.  
</P>
<P>
 Streisand the shopper and collector was famous for being a thrift-store junkie 
well beyond the years in which that was all she could afford. Now, she's tucked 
all her beloved '20s and '30s vintage finds and movie costumes away in closets. 
And in March, she sold off some of her modern ornate gowns at the tail end of 
an auction of her decorative-arts collection at Christie's that brought in $6.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her current taste in furnishings runs toward American Arts and Crafts, which 
is a more pared-down style, and her present fashion direction is equally 
uncluttered and solid. Her clothes are streamlined, and her hair is toned down 
in a flattering straight blond pageboy.

 Streisand sketched her costumes for the two shows she gave at the MGM Grand in 
Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, and she was so pleased with the results that she 
incorporated them into this tour, her spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 One costume is a long black velvet dress that shows off her shoulders, with a 
perfect brooch at the bust and sweeping insert of cream satin. Another is an 
ivory suit with a long slit skirt. The classic designs were inspired partly by 
a recent visit to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, Streisand's spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both outfits were stitched by seamstresses in the New York headquarters of 
designer Karan, Streisand's close friend. Although Streisand has always liked 
to say she designs her clothes, these finished costumes are most accurately 
described as a collaboration between Streisand and Karan. "That's how Donna 
describes it, and that's OK with Barbra," says Patti Cohen, Karan's 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand has been buying Karan's Collection -- a sophisticated line of sleek 
sportswear separates found in top department and specialty stores -- for many 
years, but their collaboration began with these comeback costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her publicist, Streisand has been creating her clothes since she 
was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the outfits for the concerts illustrates how little things change," 
says publicist Dick Guttman. The costume on her first album cover, a recording 
at the Bon Soir, a bar in New York's Greenwich Village, Guttman says, "is a 
man's vest of herringbone tweed over a long skirt with a slit (that is) not 
that different from the gray pin-striped wool ensemble she wore in her 
performance last year at the inaugural ball of President Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 The ivory suit she wears in this concert tour is a similar style. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand has such strong ideas on wardrobe that she's even been known to 
advise Hollywood's legendary costume designers on their business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, "Her Name Is Barbra: An Intimate Portrait of the Real Barbra 
Streisand" (Carol Publishing, 1993), author Randall Riese relays the story of 
when Streisand met with Irene Sharaff to discuss the costumes for the 1968 film 
"Funny Girl." The star arrived with bags of shoes and antique clothing she 
wanted to wear as character Fanny Brice. 
</P>
<P>
 During "Hello, Dolly!" the two were at odds, the author says, when Sharaff 
went for historical accuracy and Streisand wanted flattering styles, including 
anachronistic straight sleeves instead of authentic leg-of-muttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives with 20th Century Fox Studio sided with Streisand, saying simply: 
"Give her what she wants." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that was music to her ears. The Way She Was 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand has always been a fashion trailblazer. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the first girl in the class of '59 at Erasmus Hall High School in 
Brooklyn, N.Y., to sport inch-long nails and "Cleopatra" eyeliner.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd experiment with different colored mascara on my eyes (and) try out all 
kinds of different hairstyles," she once told a Time magazine writer.  
</P>
<P>
 What path did she take between buying thrift-store clothes when she was a 
starving actress in the early '60s to designing her concert wardrobe today? 
Here's a brief history of her sartorial missteps and successes.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheer Panic: Streisand accepts an Academy Award as Best Actress in 1968 for 
"Funny Girl" wearing a see-through Arnold Scaasi pantsuit, an outfit costume 
designer Edith Head called shocking. She trips over her black tulle 
bell-bottoms walking up to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Train Wreck: In "Hello, Dolly!" in 1969, Streisand labors through her dance 
steps with added weight on her shoulders: her 40-pound gold beaded gown. The 
unwieldy 2 1/2-foot train keeps tripping up the waltzing waiters in the chorus, 
and it's removed during some of the takes. But the train is still there in the 
film, at the beginning of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Fur Ball: She wears a white mink bolero jacket with matching hat and muff to a 
gala with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1970. A decade before, she 
wore a monkey fur coat when she performed in Greenwich Village. But that got 
tossed away with success.  
</P>
<P>
 Temporary Permanent: Before he became a Hollywood mogul, Streisand's flame Jon 
Peters, the former beauty-salon owner, presented her with something she thought 
she'd never have: curls. She wore the corkscrews in the '70s and '80s, 
tightening them for the Peters-produced "A Star Is Born" in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Fits the Bill: Streisand sings at President Clinton's inaugural gala in 1993 
wearing a three-piece pin-striped evening suit she designed with Donna Karan. 
One newspaper report referred to it as "the peekaboo power suit." More dramatic 
than the yard-long slit in her skirt was her diamond nugget necklace, a present 
to herself.

WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD; THE SIREN'S SONG DREW THIS TRIO TO A LIFE CENTERED 
AROUND THREE LITTLE WORDS: SERVE AND PROTECT. HAS THE BADGE KEPT ITS GLEAM?

<P>
 David Schwacher, Pamela Pitcher and Samuel Rhone graduated from the Los 
Angeles Police Academy last May, after completing 30 weeks of training. 
</P>
<P>
 They spent most of the next year on probation in the L.A. Police Department, 
working with special officers who trained them to do in real-life situations 
what they had learned to do at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the three finished probation and became full-fledged members of the 
force. After a month's vacation, each returned eager to read the orders that 
would dispatch them to their first post-rookie assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times first interviewed these officers just after graduation, and again 
six months into their probation. They were interviewed recently about their 
final six months on probation and adjusting to their new careers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Schwacher never imagined himself sitting at a typewriter and answering 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 The wiry ex-Marine, 31, said he joined the LAPD for an active, exciting career 
that would also help the community. He finished probation in Northeast 
Division, took a month's vacation in his hometown of Milwaukee and came back 
"really eager to get out on patrol -- to use all the things I learned in 
training. I wanted the good habits to become ingrained in me."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, he was shocked to receive orders assigning him to a job four 
flights beneath City Hall, where he now sits at a computer all day, working as 
a 911 emergency operator. "I never even realized 911 operators were a part of 
the force," he said. "I don't type -- I'm learning to hunt and peck. I'll do 
the best I can with (this assignment), but it's real hard for me. And it seems 
it's such a waste." 
</P>
<P>
 During probation, he said, he was just becoming comfortable with the actions 
and judgments necessary in potentially dangerous situations out on the street. 
Now he fears he may lose it all and be in a vulnerable position when he does 
get assigned to patrol duty again. The 911 assignment could last nine months or 
more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many civilians that could do this job, so many injured officers 
and duty officers and pregnant female officers who would be right for it," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to sound ungrateful, he said, because he's so glad to be on 
the force and to have had such fine training. It's just that he's eager, strong 
and aching to use what he's learned. And he knows that the city needs more 
police out on the streets.

 He and his wife have two children and own a house outside the city in a 
community he prefers not to name. He does not think officers need to live in 
the areas they serve. "I served probation in Northeast Division, and I felt as 
committed to those citizens as if my family lived there," he said. 
</P>

 Pamela Pitcher, 25, spent her probation year in the San Fernando Valley's 
Foothill Division. There, she said, she was paired with veteran officers and 
had a chance to use all the techniques she had learned in the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she also learned to conquer fear. "It's unrealistic to say cops never 
feel fear. They do," she said. "In the academy, you go through scenarios to 
simulate what it's going to be like out there on the street. But the same fear 
isn't there because you know you're not going to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "On probation, you're in the real world. You get to see how highly experienced 
officers handle various situations. The more of those you deal with, the more 
comfortable you become in your job." 
</P>
<P>
 Even at 5 feet, 5 inches and 125 pounds, she can be an authoritative figure, 
she said. "It's all a matter of tactics, which they teach at the academy and 
reinforce during probation. If a suspect feels you are intimidated, he's got 
the upper hand. We are trained not to let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher is an athlete; she opposes lowering the physical qualifications to get 
more women on the force. "The department has 14% women right now. We're on a 
push to make those numbers go up. That's great. But there's also talk of 
eliminating some requirements, such as scaling the academy's six-foot 
(training) wall. I'm opposed. We need to keep that. I can't tell you the number 
of times I've already scaled walls that high while out in the field on a call." 
</P>
<P>
 After probation, she was assigned to Northeast Division, where so far she has 
worked the desk, taking reports from citizens who walk in with complaints. Each 
deployment period is 28 days, she said, so there is a good chance she'll be out 
on patrol soon again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher and her husband live in the same community as Schwacher; she too 
doesn't think an officer has to live in the city to serve it with integrity and 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many officers could not afford to live in areas where they would feel 
comfortable," she said. "We do not make enough money to buy the same kind of 
house in the city that we can afford to buy way out somewhere. We start at 
about $33,000 per year. If we have a college degree, it's a bit higher. After 
probation, we get a small raise. That's where we remain until we are promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 She has dedicated her life to helping others through police work, she said, 
and wonders how anyone can question her dedication because of her ZIP code.

 Samuel Rhone is a happy man because, in his words, "I like my work and I like 
the people I work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Compton, Rhone lives within the Southwest Division, where 
he spent his probation and where he now works as a patrol car officer. The 
division "has worst and the best -- a little bit of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhone, 30, said community policing has increased since he started his 
training. And it has had a positive effect on officers' ability to take care of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have senior lead officers whose job is to get close to the community, 
to organize neighborhood watch meetings, etc. They tell us about the people's 
concerns, exactly what and where the problems are. And they give us the tools 
to deal with those problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a gang hanging out in front of a certain house, for example, the 
senior lead officers tell us and provide us with tools, like appropriate 
statute numbers to cite the gang members for loitering." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he's proud that officers in his division "spend the time and take 
extra steps to try and solve such problems for the long run. They won't just 
issue citations, for example -- they'll find out who lives in that house. Is it 
rented or owned? How can we go about getting rid of the problem permanently, so 
the good people on that street can live more safely?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rhone is 6 feet tall and 195 pounds, with an athletic build. During the last 
six months of his probation, he said, he participated in numerous criminal 
pursuits, special assignments and emotionally gripping calls to defuse domestic 
violence. What gets to him, he said, are calls that involve small children 
living amid constant violence. "I hate to think of those kids growing up in 
that atmosphere -- and to think of what they may become because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Off duty, he volunteers at the Al Wooten Heritage Center. "We try to give 
youngsters an alternative to drugs and gangs. We have tutoring, computer 
learning and recreation for after-school hours and on Saturdays." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhone said his career goals change constantly. "First it was to get through 
the academy. Then through probation. Now, it's to become a training officer." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the next level up in police work, and Rhone said he and a number of 
others in his graduating class have already taken the test -- even though they 
are not yet eligible to be promoted. "I just wanted to see how I'd do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not believe that physical requirements should be lowered to allow more 
women to enter the police force. "We have to jump walls and fences all the time 
when we're in pursuit. Let's just get women who are able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He may soon move out of the city. "When I buy a house, which I hope will be 
soon, I may not be able to afford this area. I may have to move way out 
somewhere to get something nice. I'll still love this area and the people. One 
of them is my mother."

 Is Al Bundy of "Married . . . With Children" a heel because of his job? NO! 
Say shoe salespeople everywhere. Fitting feet is a distinguished profession, 
confirms David Lang, who's been doing it for five years.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allow people in the 
fashion industry to talk about their encounters .  
</P>
<P>
 At Rangoni & Huggins Shoes in Fashion Island Newport Beach, Lang, a 
fresh-faced manager and salesman, holds court over an array of better-label 
shoes -- Cole Haan and Stuart Weistzman, among others. He says he's working in 
paradise.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not really a gross thing, working with feet. It's not as bad as people 
think. With the customers who come in here, foot odor is not really a big 
problem, but if I am apprehensive, I will let them put on their own shoe. 
Still, I wash my hands about three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Most women who come in here dress pretty casually. At our shop on Lake Street 
in Pasadena, they're wearing their St. John Knits (outfits) with the (matching) 
hosiery and dress heels. 
</P>
<P>
 But here, nine out of 10 women don't even wear hosiery. And they don't usually 
come in wearing their best shoes. But they are sophisticated shoppers. They are 
used to nice things, and it's a lot easier to schmooze a really wealthy lady 
than someone who doesn't have a lot of money. The (Newport Beach customers) 
walk in wearing a $20 shoe and walk out with a $200 shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Women sometimes don't want to have to say they wear a bigger size shoe than 
they did when they were younger, so for vanity reasons, they fudge on the size. 
Age, having kids and wearing flats make the arches fall inward (and feet 
spread), and that can change the shoe size. And if they don't properly clip 
their big toenails, they may have to go up a size, too. Of course, I could 
never say that to them. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to sell jewelry and clothing, but I honestly prefer shoes -- they are 
more of a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to being spiritually akin to Al Bundy, overall I'd have to say 
I'm not. But sometimes I watch that show and I say to myself, "You know, you're 
doing the same things he's doing, (and) he gets ragged hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But really, my situation is different. My friends don't give me a hard time, 
because I make pretty good money. 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as it being a good place to check out babes, it is. I'm single, and 
I have met and kept in touch with some wonderful friends.

BY DESIGN; PULL UP A CHAIR; GO AHEAD, SIT A SPELL. OR CURL UP AND GET COMFY. 
THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE SHOULD OFFER SERIOUS COMFORT -- NOT JUST GOOD LOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Today's best interiors invite you to pull up a favorite chair, settle into a 
downy pillow and get really comfortable. Design as superficial window dressing 
is passe, L.A.'s top designers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can afford to be trendy or to buy furniture that's in some ephemeral, 
'amusing' style," says Mimi London, who creates interiors and furniture. "Quiet 
design, nothing overstated, is very pleasing now. People don't want furniture 
that yells at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Callaway agrees. "Interior design that looks right now is a whole 
amalgam of styles and design details. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the whole history of furnishing to inspire us," he says. "The days of 
one 'in' look are truly over." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcoming armchairs have become the iconographic piece of furniture, Callaway 
adds, because they're satisfyingly self-centered. Unlike sofas, you don't have 
to share them -- and you can move them around to please yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm in love with an upholstered club chair I designed," he says. 
"It's a takeoff of a late '20s Art Deco chair but resonates with an early '50s 
feeling" -- thanks to a Moderne geometric upholstery fabric by Clarence House. 
</P>
<P>
 London's pet piece of furniture is her open-armed fruitwood-finish spruce 
chair, whose broad arms and hefty body show the influences of Gustav Stickley, 
Frank Lloyd Wright and even Adirondack chairs. Upholstered in sheepskin, it 
stands four-square on solid legs and firmly planted feet. The pillows are 
down-filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "An armchair today should be a serious piece of furniture, not just an 
ornament," London says. "It must be comfortable enough for hours of reading or 
television watching, and conversation. It can be a piece you'll keep for the 
rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. designer Michael Smith, whose clients include Young Hollywood and 
Establishment types, says: "Life, not the fashion of the day, should dictate 
the design. Rooms should not be propaganda, or self-aggrandizement at the cost 
of comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 His preferred armchair has a sculptured, rather Edwardian silhouette tightly 
covered in washed cotton. It's classic but has a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can read the newspaper in it, (and) relax for a moment at the end of the 
day," he says. "Clients want that same ease and simplicity with their 
furniture. Rooms should reflect our day-to-day lives and provide for children, 
dogs and piles of books. Rooms full of fussy detail take too much maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Barry, known for her clean-lined and tailored interiors, also takes a 
reductionist approach to decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Less is more' is a very modern concept," she says. "I like just a few 
carefully chosen things on a table or a mantel. I prefer visual tranquillity, 
no clutter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barry seldom chooses patterned fabrics, opting to let the furniture, fresh 
flowers in a simple vase and even the people create the pattern and the focus 
of a well-composed room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a room that ranges wide in historical references," she says. "This 
grab-bag approach can be seen throughout our culture today -- in fashion, in 
art, even table settings. You dress and design to please yourself. Everything 
doesn't have to match. You can combine Chanel and Gaultier and Gap. It's much 
more interesting and very individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture designers Jeffrey Goodman and Steven Charlton agree that matching 
sets of furniture -- known in the trade as "suites" -- look all wrong. Their 
firm, Goodman Charlton, is noted for its beautifully upholstered, curvy chairs 
and sofas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want your house to look as if you just bought everything straight 
out of the showroom," Goodman says. "It's better to scout the market, 
experiment and take pride in finding furniture and collections that mean 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 He explains that when rooms are uncluttered, the outline and integrity of each 
piece becomes more important. "Shapes should be strong and clear, not overly 
articulated," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman Charlton recently introduced the Comet chair. The arms swoop and curve 
and seem almost sculpted by air current. Upholstered in cotton velvet, the 
chair stands on well-proportioned mahogany feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends describe it as turbo-charged Deco, but we see several modern 
influences, even sports cars," Goodman says. "We like to pay homage to a range 
of design icons." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even Shabby Chic, the company that made loose slipcovers and over-scale 
armchairs popular (and inspired a million imitations), is taking a more 
streamlined look. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Rachel Ashwell, who with partner Dara Buck launched Shabby Chic in 1989, 
says the company's designs are becoming simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still love the mooshy, downy cushions, but we're toning down the floral 
fabrics, going toward white and cream and smudgy, tea-dipped looking linens," 
Ashwell says.

SHE'S LEADING BY A NOSE, NATURALLY; CHARACTERISTIC: WHEN THE FEATURE IS 
FEATURED, THE CENTER OF THE FACE IS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. ESPECIALLY IN 
BARBRA STREISAND'S CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barbra Streisand has been a nose revolutionary, a nose nationalist and 
liberator, a preacher of proboscis pride, a nostro-terrorist, a prophet who saw 
the pert, snub, freckled, upturned, tidy, tiny, cute all-American cheerleader 
popularity of the ideal nose personified by Doris Day back in the 1950s, and 
she bloodied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept my nose to spite my face," she sings in "I'm Still Here," with new 
lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. 
</P>
<P>
 No bobbing, no jobbing -- at least in the sense of some suburban monument to 
rhinoplasty. More than 100,000 people a year get nose jobs, and there's nothing 
mysterious about the rules they're obeying: a bridge descending at a 38-degree 
angle from the face, down to a tip projecting at up to 110 degrees of snubness 
from the upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for Barbra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you checking to see if I had a nose job?" she was heard to say during her 
concert at USAir Arena in Landover, Md., to someone studying her through 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an odd organ. So utterly prominent, so easily hurt, so easily ridiculed. 
Failure and humiliation are summed up in the phrase "bloody nose." 
</P>
<P>
 A big, interesting nose can suggest sex, arrogance and mystery, three things 
that make our puritan democracy nervous. In a nose that's bony like a raptor's 
beak, it implies passion, energy, aggressiveness and a predatory aloofness. The 
Doris Day nose implies enthusiasm rather than passion, pep rather than energy, 
passivity rather than aggression. A big nose is serious. A little nose is 
sincere. Big is powerful; little is popular. Big is unique; little is one of 
the crowd. Big is ethnic; little is not. 
</P>
<P>
 But Basil Rathbone wasn't ethnic, and he had a nose that looked like a ritual 
knife from a Neanderthal excavation. Consider the rapacious aristocracy of the 
nose of Virginia Woolf, big, but so delicate you imagine from pictures that it 
must have moved a little with every breath. Would Charles de Gaulle have gone 
as far without a nose so huge and beaked that it took him so far into the 
ridiculous that he came out the other side and was the epitome of dignity? 
</P>
<P>
 In America, we said these were Saxon or Gallic noses, as if to explain them 
away. Lyndon Johnson was ethnic? If not, with that big, coarse cowboy nose, how 
was it he looked so much like Golda Meir? 
</P>
<P>
 It is undemocratic. If you have no nose, you're part of a crowd. Most 
democratic of all, if you have no nose, how can you look down it at people? 
</P>
<P>
 Noses are sexy. This may account for America's unease with them, and with 
Barbra Streisand's sexiness. 
</P>
<P>
 H. George Brennan, president of the Academy Academy of Facial Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgery in Newport Beach, says: "She's a plastic surgeon's 
dream. From a technical standpoint, surgeons drool when they look at her. It's 
not just her nose; it's her chin. She has a receding chin. It's as much of what 
throws her face off as her nose." 
</P>
<P>
 Where do these rules come from? Brennan says they're innate. He cites studies 
of small children who show greater interest in attractive faces. He says that 
reactions to composites show uniform standards of beauty across culture. Though 
not changes in fashion. Michael Jackson, for instance, may be the last 
entertainer in America to buy himself a Doris Day nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late 1960s, the cute, retrousse nose was in fashion," Brennan says. 
"Today, it's a high, elegant bridge." Barbra has ignored all of these. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people might like looking at Streisand's nose. "Some people like looking 
at Edsels too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, no. The nose has a strange glory to it, like those portraits whose eyes 
follow you around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we could have a Cyrano de Bergerac Memorial Nose Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Anjelica Huston; George C. Scott; the coarse, workingman's nose of 
Gerard Depardieu; the thick, flat bulldog nose of Robert De Niro playing Jake 
La Motta in "Raging Bull," Karl Malden's potato-truncheon whose tip starts to 
divide. King Saud. Anthony Quinn's Zorba-the-Nose. Jack Nicholson's slit nose 
in "Chinatown," Woody Allen kidnaping the president's nose in "Sleeper," W.C. 
Fields' enshrapneled fungus of an alcoholic nose, the ski-jump noses of Richard 
Nixon and Bob Hope. And, of course, Doris Day. It only seems fair. 
</P>
<P>
 And Barbra. 
</P>
<P>
 Those long nostril wings coursing back like the wake along the sides of an old 
mahogany speedboat, the Brancusi cartilage, the indomitably streamlined quality 
of a Chrysler Airflow from the late 1930s. It's a brave nose. Her whole face 
depends on it. With that nose, happiness becomes triumph; sadness is poignancy. 
The nose invokes the sine qua non of beauty: contradiction. It is exotic and 
banal, powerful and vulnerable, public and private. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra's sloping chin evokes a child, of course. Hence our sympathies. But the 
nose is utter adulthood. Another contradiction, a structural beauty spot, an 
oxymoron. The Colossus of Nose.

STUDY OF ASIANS IN U.S. FINDS MANY STRUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Although many perceive them as the affluent "model minority," Asian Americans 
are just as likely to be impoverished and disadvantaged as they are to be 
economically successful, according to a UCLA study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And even those who are thought to have made it have encountered "glass 
ceilings" and discrimination in the workplace, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an uphill battle to get decision-makers and the population overall 
to realize that the Asian Pacific American population is a diverse one," said 
Paul Ong, editor of the report and an associate professor at the UCLA School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asian Pacific Americans have made great strides and had great success in this 
economy, but you can't ignore the other side of this," Ong said. "There are 
tremendous challenges faced by this population." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping study, which Ong described as the first of its kind to address 
the role of Asian Americans in the U.S. economy, challenged policy-makers to 
make the best use of the talents of the well-educated while not ignoring the 
sizable segment of the Asian American population that lives in poverty. The 
report, issued by UCLA's Asian American Studies Center and Leadership Education 
for Asian Pacifics Inc., a Los Angeles-based nonprofit community organization, 
also made specific recommendations in several areas, including job training, 
business practices and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA study paints a picture of a rapidly growing population whose glossy 
veneer of success masks signs of some disturbing struggles, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * A poverty rate for Asian Americans in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New 
York that is nearly twice as high as that of whites. For every Asian American 
household with an annual income of $75,000 or more, there is another making 
less than $10,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * A growing reliance on welfare. In fact, Southeast Asians -- Vietnamese, 
Cambodians, Laotians -- have the highest welfare dependency rate of any racial 
or ethnic group. Southeast Asians make up only 13% of Asian Americans but 
account for up to 8% of all Asian Americans on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 * An explosion of entrepreneurship that focuses on low-margin, low-profit 
businesses. One-third of self-employed Asian Americans are in the highly 
competitive retail sector, most commonly operating restaurants. Asian American 
entrepreneurs accounted for 2.6% of all firms in 1987, but only 1.7% of all 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 * A disproportionate concentration in low- and mid-level jobs with little 
advancement into management ranks. A look at three major public hospitals in 
Los Angeles found that Asian Americans made up 34% of doctors and nurses, 28% 
of all supervisors and 12% of upper management. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California, the UCLA 
study came as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this model minority image is a myth," said Stewart Kwoh, executive 
director of the center, which specializes in employment discrimination and 
civil rights cases. "There are people who are well off and there is a 
well-educated group and a middle-income group, but there sure are an awful lot 
of poor people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the workplace, many companies maintain a "glass ceiling" preventing Asian 
Americans and other minorities from becoming managers, Kwoh said. "For Asian 
Americans, we find we have access as technical and professional workers, but 
when it comes to mid- and upper management, there is a declining percentage." 
</P>
<P>
 In the typical aerospace company, for example, Asian Americans make up 20% of 
the technical staff but only 1% to 5% of upper management, Kwoh said. A lawsuit 
settlement last year by the Los Angeles Police Department promised aggressive 
promotion of minority and women officers, but still no Asian American holds a 
rank higher than lieutenant, Kwoh added. 
</P>
<P>
 The study made three primary recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Promote multiculturalism and intercultural sensitivity within existing 
legislation, programs and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Modify the concept of civil rights so protection covers the types of 
discriminatory practices encountered by Asian Americans, such as denial of a 
promotion to a person with an accent and blaming it on "poor communication 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand programs that help Asian newcomers adjust to U.S. society. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have a simple picture of a population that is successful economically, 
then that argues for ignoring the needs of this population," Ong said. "The 
idea is to move public discussion on Asian Pacific Americans beyond where it is 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving toward a multiethnic society," he said. "We have populations 
with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds and we need to act in a more 
positive fashion in dealing with that."

<P>
 Just hours before this area exploded in celebration of Israel officially 
ending 27 years of military occupation, an Israeli colonel and his Palestinian 
counterpart stood in the darkness early Wednesday discussing the last-minute 
logistics of the historic transfer of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the Israeli stopped in mid-sentence. He looked up at Col. Faisal 
Fahoum, the Palestinian brigade commander who had just set foot on his home 
soil for the first time since he left as a child when modern Israel was created 
in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe we're standing here next to each other talking like this!" 
the Israeli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fahoum, a warrior once committed to destroying Israel, smiled and replied: "If 
you came to me two years ago and said we would be here together like this, I 
would have laughed and called it the Eighth Wonder of the World!" 
</P>
<P>
 The two lifelong enemies then laughed together. They clasped hands. And before 
the sun was up, they helped usher in the dawn of a new era of Palestinian 
autonomy, as Israeli commanders turned over the last of their bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus ended a two-week transition to Palestinian rule in Gaza. It was 
accompanied by farewell showers of Palestinian stones, retaliatory grenades of 
tear gas and thousands of rounds of joyous Palestinian gunfire. The encounter 
between the two colonels was but one of many scenes that captured the irony and 
incredulity of Gaza's first moment of freedom -- and the Israeli military's 
first taste of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God we're gone!" said a young Israeli soldier flashing the V-sign from 
a jeep crossing the border into Israel, where a young Palestinian soldier who 
lived his life in exile flashed V-signs on his way in. 
</P>
<P>
 When the last Israeli soldier left just after sunrise from the border post of 
the Israeli army spokesman's office, which issued the only official accounts of 
the hundreds of Palestinians and scores of Israelis who were killed during the 
decades of occupation, he threw his rucksack over his shoulder, slammed a door 
scrawled with the large Hebrew word for "Closed!!!" and declared: "Finally, 
it's really over." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a third-grade classroom of a Palestinian school at the refugee village 
known as Beach Camp, deep inside Gaza, an 8-year-old Palestinian boy reflected 
just how dramatic this week's transformation has been for the nearly 1 million 
Gazans. The boy's eyes grew wide with disbelief when he spotted through his 
classroom window the first armed Palestinian patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look!" he shouted to his teacher. "They are our Jews!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," his teacher explained gently and with cautious pride. "They are 
Palestinians. They are our new Palestinian security force, and today we are 
celebrating them. We are celebrating our new flag, our new freedom, the 
beginning of our new state." 
</P>
<P>
 But for most Gazans, it was just that -- a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the sun rose on the newly autonomous Gaza -- which will be governed 
along with a small enclave around the West Bank town of Jericho by a 
Palestinian Authority -- the celebrations quickly gave way to the realities of 
the limited self-rule agreement between Israel and Palestine Liberation 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord allows almost 5,000 Jewish settlers to remain in 13 sprawling 
enclaves throughout Gaza. There Israel merely redeployed many of its soldiers 
to protect the settlers during the coming years of continuing negotiations. 
Israel also will control Gaza's borders, its airspace and territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlements, in particular, are problematic. The Israeli military was 
forced to cancel a ceremony pledging their future in Gaza when leaders of the 
settlement where the event was to occur said they wanted no part of it. And 
foreshadowing how the Israeli enclaves are likely to become flash points for 
violence, a Jewish settler was wounded at the Gaza settlement of Nitzarim in a 
Wednesday night drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Gen. Nasser Yussef, commander of the new Palestinian security force -- 
the symbol of the first real change here since Israel began making peace with 
the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors almost three years ago -- said he told 
his Israeli counterparts early Wednesday: "This is a partial agreement, and it 
needs more." He insisted that the settlers ultimately must leave Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Yussef spoke with cautious pride when he met with reporters at the Gaza City 
Governor's Mansion -- the headquarters of Israel's military governor and the 
Egyptian and British occupation commanders in the Gaza Strip before him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of feeling that was paid for with thousands of lives of our 
people," he said, describing Wednesday. "This is an immortal day. This is a day 
we have all dreamed of. This is a day of great joy. . . . But it is just a 
first step." 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly turned to more practical matters. As his ragtag force fanned out 
into military bases that the Israelis had stripped bare, other Palestinian 
officers began directing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yussef established his goals, saying, "Our first priority is security." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his new force has no plans to confiscate weapons from Gaza's many 
well-armed resistance groups, including Islamic fundamentalists and leftist 
underground militias that oppose Arafat's autonomy plan. He said he hopes that 
owners will quickly register their weapons and that the arms ultimately will be 
brought under his commanders' control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas is part of our nation," he said of the best-organized, most potent 
fundamentalist opposition to Arafat's PLO faction. "They are our brothers. We 
have had a lot of contacts and meetings. . . . We will work together." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, Yussef's departing Israeli counterpart and the 
last Israeli to leave the autonomous Gaza Strip, was less certain. He was 
reacting to vows by Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups to continue 
their attacks on Israeli targets until the last Jewish settlement is out of 
Gaza. "I'm walking on tiptoes," he told Israel Radio. "I estimate there will be 
terrorist activities, and we, as any army, have to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 But Almog also found reasons for optimism Wednesday. "The Palestinian police 
are very motivated for peace, and that gives us great hope," he said of the 
force reassembled from Palestinian brigades that have served under half a dozen 
Arab armies for the last three decades. "And also they are disciplined -- not 
organized, but disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Gazans, especially after the celebrations had died down later Wednesday, 
shared Almog's concern about the security in the Gaza Strip in the days to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the views of Nasser Dajany. He owns the Jala Theater, which was shut 
by the Israelis, along with every other movie theater in Gaza, seven years ago. 
"We want very much to start up again, but we will wait two or three months. It 
depends on how secure the situation will be," Dajany said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has complete confidence the new Palestinian police can keep order. 
But he fears opposition to his enterprise from Islamic fundamentalists, who 
have condemned movies as a sinful and decadent form of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, he and other Gazans found great happiness in a simpler pleasure: 
They again can stroll the streets after 8 p.m. For seven years, since the start 
of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising, the Israeli military imposed a 
strict nightly curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night and Wednesday night, however, the streets of Gaza City were 
jammed with families. "It's such a great joy just to be able to walk in these 
streets at night," one young woman said. 
</P>

FRENCH PULLBACK FROM BOSNIA SPARKS FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 France's decision to withdraw almost half its troops from the troubled U.N. 
Balkans mission has stirred fears of a Western exodus. It could leave a 
volatile mix of foreign peacekeepers with historic loyalties, which could draw 
them into the war's deadly endgame. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of almost 3,300 British troops here was the focus of Wednesday's 
visit to U.N. Protection Force headquarters by British Chief of Defense Forces 
Gen. Peter Inge. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, the French Defense Ministry announced that it will pull out 
2,500 soldiers by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada and Spain, the next-largest contributors to the Bosnian mission, have 
also threatened to leave unless a negotiated settlement is reached soon to end 
the conflict here that has killed 200,000 and left 2 million homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 But with battles intensifying across a wide swath of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
chances for a peace accord receding far into the distance, the departure of 
soldiers sent by NATO countries appears increasingly likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the well-trained and more disciplined Western troops, the U.N. mission 
in Bosnia would be dominated by soldiers from Eastern Orthodox nations with 
historic ties to the rebel Serbs and by Islamic forces who openly sympathize 
with Bosnia's aggrieved Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officers and Bosnian civilians worry that if the Western troops leave, 
having only forces whose countries clearly favor one faction could result in 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a chance for this to become an international war if it is not solved 
properly," said Husajn Smajic, leader of Sarajevo's moderate Islamic community. 
"Foreign troops will not be partisan as long as they are under the control of 
(the U.N. force here). But if the U.N. troops from the West withdraw, the 
Islamic forces here will surely not stand by idly and watch the destruction of 
Bosnia's Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
 And without the moderating effects of British, French and other West European 
forces, Russian and Ukrainian troops would be at great risk of siding with the 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia opened a Pandora's box of partisan deployments in February when Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin won the Serbs' agreement to pull back heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo by promising to deploy Russian peacekeepers to 
provide their traditional Serbian allies with "psychological comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the most generous offers of new troops for the U.N. mission in 
Bosnia have come from Turkey, Pakistan and Iran -- the last a fundamentalist 
Islamic state that demands the right to defend Bosnia's targeted Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's offer of 10,000 peacekeeping troops has, so far, been spurned by the 
U.N. Security Council. But 1,000 Turkish troops and almost 2,000 from Pakistan 
are due next month to bolster the 15,000 thinly spread U.N. forces in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all wear blue berets and come under a unified command," U.N. spokesman 
Maj. Rob Annink said of the Islamic peacekeepers, stating the official line 
that the multinational mission is neutral. "But we have to think about where to 
put them -- and it will not be on the confrontation lines." 
</P>
<P>
 The Turks are to be deployed to central Bosnia to escort aid convoys and 
patrol reconciled Muslim and Croatian communities, said Annink, emphasizing 
that will make it unlikely that they will come into contact with hostile Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having been accorded Russian patrols in their territory, Bosnian Serbs 
have vehemently protested the U.N. plan to deploy Turkish troops in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia and Bosnia were both ruled by Ottoman Turkey for almost 500 years, 
leaving a legacy of resentment among the Serbs, whose forebears refused to 
convert to Islam and often suffered more severe repression than those who 
embraced the rulers' faith. Most of those who today describe themselves as 
Muslim or Bosnian were Christian Slavs converted by the Turks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistani troops may be deployed to the eastern Bosnian "safe havens" of 
Srebrenica and Zepa, relieving European troops for relocation to more active 
battle zones, Annink said. But those assignments depend heavily on the U.N. 
mission's overall troop strength, which has come into doubt with the French 
decision to at least scale down. 
</P>
<P>
 France is now the mission's largest troop contributor, with 6,800 soldiers, or 
about one-fifth of the total force, deployed along political and ethnic fault 
lines in Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The French contingent has sustained 20 deaths and more than 300 injuries, and 
a recent increase in attacks on U.N. forces has compelled Paris and other 
Western capitals to reconsider their commitment to the dangerous, expensive and 
ineffectual mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is obliged to do the absurd," French Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
said Tuesday. "Before the end of the year, there will be about 2,500 fewer 
French soldiers in former Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 1,000 French troops are already pulling out of the Serb-occupied 
Croatian town of Glina; 1,500 more are to leave the mostly Muslim Bihac area in 
northwestern Bosnia later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ukrainian battalion that planned to deploy to Gorazde has been reassigned to 
the Glina area, depriving peacekeepers in Bosnia of crucial reinforcements at a 
time when fighting between Serbian rebels and government troops is heating up 
across the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the French exasperation with the U.N. mission -- shared by most 
Western officers here -- is the labyrinthine civilian bureaucracy imposed on 
the military structure. When troops come under attack, they must seek backup 
through the civilian hierarchy, which administers the force from the distant 
Croatian capital of Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 Most requests for air cover from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have 
been rejected by U.N. Special Representative Yasushi Akashi or have been 
granted after so many hours of delay that the attackers have had time to finish 
firing and withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bosnian Serb militia freed 11 French aid workers after their humanitarian 
group paid $44,000 in "bail" to win their release from nearly six weeks of 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been held in Lukavica, a Serbian-held district outside Sarajevo, 
since April 8. Serbian leaders charged that the aid workers were trying to 
smuggle arms to troops of Bosnia's Muslim-led government and threatened to put 
them on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plans to test a Bosnian Serb cease-fire pledge at the Tuzla airport were 
canceled because civilian pilots refused to risk making supply flights. U.N. 
flights were suspended Tuesday when Serbian shells struck the airport in 
northeastern Bosnia shortly after a plane landed.

COLUMN ONE; SLIME TURNS BAYS INTO CESSPOOLS; TOXIC ALGAE IS CHOKING MARINE LIFE 
AND THICKENING CRYSTAL WATERS INTO PEA SOUP. SPAWNED BY SEWAGE AND FERTILIZER 
RUNOFF, THE PROBLEM COULD SWELL INTO A GLOBAL EPIDEMIC.

<P>
 The attack of the phantom killers came on a warm September night in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools of menhaden, a herring-like fish, were swimming down the Neuse River 
on their annual migration to the sea when they suddenly began battling an 
invisible foe. By the time the massacre ended six weeks later, millions of 
corpses were piled along three miles of beach, and it took a caravan of 
bulldozers to clear the sand of rotting carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious fish kill -- the worst in state history -- was traced to a 
microorganism that dwells in the phosphate-laced waters of Pamlico Estuary, a 
bay along the Atlantic seashore overlooking the Outer Banks. The killer algae, 
which since has been detected in six states from Delaware to Florida, is the 
prime suspect in dozens of unsolved attacks on fish and shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Algae blooms are not new; they probably date back to biblical times. The first 
plague visited upon Egypt -- a "bloody" river, dead fish, stinking water -- was 
almost certainly what is known today as a red tide. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, algae slimes dense enough to suffocate marine life have 
been swelling around the world, especially in coastal bays such as Pamlico 
Estuary. They are largely caused by fertilizing pollutants called nutrients in 
human sewage and farm runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some marine experts call this "fertilization" a silent, global epidemic that 
if unabated could destroy America's most scenic and commercially valuable 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a few high-profile success stories, most notably Lake Erie, nutrient 
pollution is worsening. One of America's premier environmental laws -- the 1972 
Clean Water Act -- has failed to cure the most insidious threat to bays, rivers 
and lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nutrient loading is probably the single biggest problem to coastal ecosystems 
in the U.S. right now, and it will continue to get worse before it gets 
better," said Brian Howes, a scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution 
in Massachusetts who has researched the problem for 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are upset about oil spills, and they should be, but the thing with 
nutrients is that it is happening every day, all day, and in many, many areas 
it is widely spread and causing declines in coastal water quality and shellfish 
harvests," he said. "Whole fisheries have collapsed. It can bring wholesale 
mass destruction or more subtle impacts on marine animal communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says that at least 3.2 
million acres of lakes, 4,700 square miles of estuaries and 82,000 miles of 
streams are impaired by nutrients, which means they cannot fully support 
fishing, swimming and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 From Long Island, N.Y., to the Florida Keys, nutrients have devastated many of 
the East Coast's popular fishing spots and shellfish beds. Many coastal bays 
have turned the hue of pea soup, and some have regressed to "dead zones" -- 
water so depleted of oxygen that only primitive creatures such as bacteria and 
algae can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an unexplained surge of bizarre, poisonous forms of algae is 
occurring around the world; scientists suspect excessive nutrients could be a 
primary cause. Ten toxic species -- which do not just suffocate fish, but 
poison them -- have been discovered since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 127 coastal estuaries in the United States suffer some symptoms of 
nutrient overload, although the damage varies greatly, according to government 
data and interviews with scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Long Island, a dense bloom as dark as coffee appears every summer and has 
wiped out bay scallops by smothering the eelgrass that fish use when nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Florida Keys, a deep bay that a decade ago was as transparent as gin 
is covered with thick green scum. Coral beds are dying and the shrimping 
industry has virtually collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Chesapeake Bay, the nation's largest estuary, the oyster industry has 
declined 90% in 35 years because of nutrient buildup, overfishing and disease; 
striped bass and other fish also have declined dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Near Cape Cod, Mass., Waquoit Bay is covered with thick carpets of green 
algae that resemble steel wool; once-abundant oysters and scallops are 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 70 miles of Gulf waters at the mouth of the Mississippi River are 
virtually without oxygen. The problem could stem from a variety of pollutants, 
but the river has a serious nutrient problem largely because more than 600 
sewage plants dump into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The brunt of the damage, both economic and environmental, has hit bays along 
the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. These poorly flushed, slow-moving waters are 
more vulnerable to vast volumes of sewage and farm runoff than the deep, 
churning Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "The East Coast estuaries are typically quite shallow and they drain very 
large rivers. The combination of the two makes the coastal zone a target," said 
Raymond Alden, director of the Applied Marine Research Laboratory at Old 
Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning up such widespread pollution is a massive challenge because nutrients 
-- nitrogen and phosphorus -- come from many sources, mainly sewage plants, 
septic tanks, livestock farms and fertilizer used on crops and yards. 
</P>
<P>
 New research also shows that large volumes of fertilizing nitrogen are falling 
from the air, mostly from car exhaust. In some urban areas, one-third of 
nutrients polluting waterways are linked to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether it is sewage, farms or cars, the problem mainly stems from 
burgeoning populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nutrient load has been increasing exponentially with the population. 
Anywhere you have a growing population you have a problem," said James T. 
Hollibaugh, director of San Francisco State University's marine laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Called nutrients because they nourish plants, phosphorus and nitrates are 
beneficial to marine ecosystems in small quantities. But such large volumes of 
human waste and farm fertilizer carried into streams can trigger a phenomenon 
called eutrophication -- algae blooms so dense that oxygen levels drop to zero 
near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Without oxygen, many fish suffocate and sea grasses, where fish and shellfish 
breed and nurse, die. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Shepard, a commercial fisherman in North Carolina for 35 years, said 
finding enough fish to make a living has become harder. He said he is 
absolutely certain the nutrients from farms and sewage are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pollution in our rivers in North Carolina is absolutely terrible," said 
Shepard, 60. "In some of our rivers, there are areas two-thirds of the way down 
where not even clams live. They have gradually died. There are less fish of all 
kinds." 
</P>
<P>
 Marine scientists suspect such fishermen's tales are true because they believe 
nutrients are forcing subtle shifts in the food chain of coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can change everything, the whole dynamics of an area, because there are 
such delicate threads among species," said Karen Steidinger, a senior scientist 
at Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg who is known for her 
work with algae. "What happens with high nutrients, you get different species 
compositions, different species dominating. What you wind up with is a 
blue-green algae that nothing wants to eat and spits out. You're 
short-circuiting the ecological efficiency of an area." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal waters also contain lots of bacteria, which come hand-in-hand with 
nutrients in sewage and farm waste. In nearly every coastal bay in the nation, 
shellfish beds that are critical to local economies and recreation have been 
shut down by the human disease threat posed by contamination, according to the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvesting of shellfish has been banned or restricted in 37% of the nation's 
waters -- more than 6 million acres -- and experts predict that more beds will 
be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although declines in any given year are not dramatic, an almost inexorable 
trend that threatens to destroy the harvest of wild or natural shellfish 
continues throughout the nation's coastal areas," according to the 1990 
National Shellfish Register, a five-year study by the NOAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California streams have the dubious distinction of carrying the 
nation's heftiest volumes of both nitrogen and phosphorus because of the 
region's enormous volumes of urban runoff, sewage and farm waste, according to 
U.S. Geological Survey measurements taken at about 400 sites. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a few California estuaries, including Newport Bay in Orange 
County and Elkhorn Slough near Monterey, have murky, algae-prone waters and the 
state's once-productive shellfish industry has been virtually wiped out by 
bacteria contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impact on aquatic life in California is much more discreet than in the 
East Coast, where waters routinely are discolored and millions of fish 
smothered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We typically have deeper, colder waters that assimilate nutrients much better 
than East Coast waters," said Craig Wilson, chief of bays and estuaries at the 
California Water Resources Control Board. "We just haven't had the same kind of 
depressions in oxygen concentrations that kill fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Progress has been made in tackling some of the most visible symptoms of 
nutrient overload. Twenty-five years ago, Lake Erie was loaded with so much 
phosphate that soap bubbles piled up on its surface in 15-foot heaps. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, phosphates were banned nationwide in laundry detergents and 
industries were regulated. Congress passed the Clean Water Act, setting a lofty 
goal of making waterways safe for fish and people by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Many freshwater lakes, including Erie, did improve in the 1970s. But the 
nutrient problem began to re-emerge in the mid-1980s, this time in coastal 
estuaries, primarily because more people were moving to the coast and bringing 
sewage and runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are places where it is really bad, there are places where it is getting 
worse, but there are only a few places where it has gotten better," said 
Suzanne Bricker of NOAA, which launched a project in 1992 to assess the 
nation's estuaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem's persistence is a main reason environmental groups are pushing to 
strengthen the Clean Water Act. The debate, heating up in Congress this year, 
centers mostly on the cost. Who should pay to cleanse the dirty waterways? 
Farmers, home builders and small municipalities all fear the burden will fall 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewage plants are the leading cause of pollution in the nation's coastal bays, 
with agriculture and urban runoff close behind, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Many coastal communities conduct no sewage treatment -- they still rely on 
septic tanks where raw waste seeps into the ground and eventually into streams 
and bays. Most cities and counties with treatment plants have not installed 
expensive technology that removes nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the real quiet crises is when we put sewage in our estuaries and it's 
gone -- out of sight, out of mind. Very, very small concentrations are causing 
dramatic changes," said JoAnn Burkholder, a North Carolina State aquatic 
botanist who identified the toxic algae in the Pamlico Estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cape Cod, the number of homes has risen dramatically along Waquoit Bay 
since World War II, yet all sewage is handled by septic tanks. Nitrogen in the 
waste filters rapidly through the sandy soil and seeps into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It slowly builds up over time. We're mainly just documenting a resource that 
is degrading," said Charlene D'Avanzo, a marine ecologist at Hampshire College 
in Massachusetts.

 The transformation of Florida Bay, a deep estuary nestled between the tip of 
the Everglades and the Keys, is one of the most alarming examples. The waters 
appeared turquoise crystal until 10 years ago, when algal blooms started 
appearing and turned the water greenish-brown. Algal blooms now occur 
year-round and stretch over hundreds of square miles, said Brian La Pointe of 
Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 As the algal blooms started, coral beds and sea grasses began dying and shrimp 
populations declined dramatically. Fishermen report fewer grouper, snapper and 
other popular fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's going to get greener and greener," La Pointe said. "The reason we 
are going to eclipse places like Chesapeake Bay, Boston Harbor and Lake Erie 
(in damage) is because tropical ecosystems like this have exceedingly low 
thresholds for die-offs. They are the most sensitive ecosystems in the world's 
oceans." 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers say nitrogen from sugar farms and phosphate flowing into the 
Gulf from a mine near Tampa are to blame, although there is no conclusive 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
 La Pointe said the connection is unmistakable, and he blames the state and 
federal governments for allowing increased volumes of farm runoff to flow 
through the Everglades into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sounded this alarm way back in '84 and '85 and it (has) fallen on deaf 
ears. The denial of the problem has continued up to present," he said. "Nobody 
wants to believe that Florida Bay, which is surrounded by one of the world's 
most famous wetlands, could possibly be polluted because of its remoteness." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coastal areas have had obvious problems for years. Since the 1980s, 
Peconic Bay on the east end of Long Island has had a devastating series of 
summertime brown tides that kill shellfish. Researchers believe the problem is 
tied to massive sewage plants serving the New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It grows very rapidly and shades out the light so that eelgrass, which is 
essential for scallops and other marine organisms to use as a nursery area, 
dies. This (algae) has caused many, many millions of dollars in damage," said 
Edward Carpenter, a professor of biological oceanography at State University of 
New York who wrote a book on nitrogen pollution in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Chesapeake Bay, the nation's largest estuary, is perhaps the most famous case 
of nitrogen overload. It has pea-soup water, no grasses where fish spawn and 
suffers periodic fish kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, there is no single cause such as a sewage plant. The 
huge bay catches the urban waste, air pollution and farm runoff that flows from 
one-quarter of the Eastern Seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement drawn up by four states surrounding the Chesapeake calls for a 
40% reduction in phosphorus and nitrogen by 2000, including efforts to build 
advanced sewage plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas also are starting to search for solutions. In Pennsylvania, dairy 
farms are installing costly systems to contain cow manure. In Delaware, a 
municipal sewage plant is spending $12 million to remove nutrients discharged 
into Rehoboth Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is next to impossible to find who to regulate because the problem is 
essentially the citizenry," said Alden of Old Dominion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best we can do is implement some controls and slow the decline," he said. 
"There are a lot of people who want to turn the Chesapeake Bay back to when 
(colonist) John Smith first floated in on it. I don't want to say I'm 
pessimistic, but I'm not a starry-eyed optimist either." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Scientists look at the link between poisonous algae and human health. 
Portrait of a Troubled Bay 
</P>
<P>
 Many bays along the Atlantic Coast have been devastated by a buildup of 
pollutants from the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous, which come mainly from 
human sewage and farms. Here is an example, based on Delaware's Inland Bays, of 
how such damage occurs in shallow estuaries along the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Waste from farms, dairies, sewage treatment plants and household septic 
tanks flows into creeks that empty into a coastal bay. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Waste flowing toward the coast meets ocean tides. The salt water is held 
underneath the waste, forming a nutrient trap. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Nutrients become concentrated on the water surface and begin nourishing 
phytoplankton, causing thick algae blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Algae take in oxygen from the bottom of the bay and block sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Without sufficient oxygen and light, the bay bottom becomes a dark dead 
zone that smothers areas of submerged sea grasses where marine life spawns. 
Fish, oysters, clams and other species start to die. The entire food chain can 
be affected, including birds that feed on fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Life in an Estuary 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some examples of sealife found in estuaries, the places where 
freshwater streams meet the sea: 
</P>
<P>
 A) Eelgrass: This submerged, ribbon-like plant, once common along the East 
Coast, has been virtually wiped out by pollution and development. 
</P>
<P>
 B) Striped bass: These fish, which grow to six feet, live mostly in or near 
estuaries, moving between fresh and salt water. The species was in severe 
decline along the Atlantic coast, but is on its way back because of fishing 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 C) Blue crab: These tasty crabs, an important commercial species, reach a 
width of nine inches. They are common in estuaries and seem to be doing well 
despite pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 D) Shrimp: Found in shallow waters along the Atlantic coast that are 
vulnerable to pollution, these crustaceans have been depleted in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
 E) Oysters: These shellfish have been decimated on both coasts. Chesapeake 
Bay's harvest, 32 million pounds per year in the 1950s, dropped to 3.7 million 
pounds in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 F) Soft-shelled clams: These whitish clams with gaping shells are found in 
water depths to 30 feet. Waters off New Jersey are the biggest source of 
harvested clams. 
</P>
<P>
 G) Winter flounder: Adult flounder spend summers in the ocean but move into 
estuaries in winter to spawn. They are declining because of estuary pollution.

CLINTON PREDICTS INTEREST HIKES WILL AID GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, breaking with some members of his own party, Wednesday 
endorsed the Federal Reserve Board's latest boost in interest rates and 
predicted that several years of sustained economic growth will follow -- 
especially if the European and Japanese economies bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Oval Office interview, Clinton said that he expects no further rate 
hikes but suggested that the four increases in interest rates that the central 
bank has ordered since February to head off inflation will prove helpful to his 
domestic policy agenda. Economic growth with low inflation is vital to any 
expansion of federal spending on social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's position on higher interest rates reflects a clear political 
gamble. Some Democrats in Congress, including Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), 
have warned that the higher rates will hurt home-building, cost jobs and 
generally slow the economy. And a group of 45 senators and House members sent 
the Federal Reserve a letter protesting the rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as the economy is coming back up for air, the Fed is pushing it back 
down again," Sarbanes said. "The Fed launched a preemptive strike against 
inflation, but it's actually a preemptive strike against growth." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton, although he insisted that he expects no adverse economic impact 
from the rate hikes, clearly has decided that he will be better off politically 
if any economic pain develops now instead of next year or the year after -- 
when he will face reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as part of his effort to chart a middle course for his party and regain 
the support of moderates who defected to the GOP during the Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush years, Clinton worked hard to present himself as a President who 
favors sound, careful fiscal policies -- whether the issue is curbing the 
deficit or preventing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that he feels "pretty good about" what the Fed has done, Clinton 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, what we want for America is steady, sustained growth, where we get 
more jobs and we keep them for as long as possible. We don't want to put the 
American people on another roller coaster where they go way up and then they 
turn around and go way down. If we can keep steady, sustained growth, that's 
what we want. And I think that's where we are now." 
</P>
<P>
 The President initiated the session with the journalists Wednesday ostensibly 
to discuss his efforts in a series of recent speeches to lay out what he sees 
as the need for a two-pronged approach to such festering social problems as 
crime, racial polarization, violence against children and the disintegration of 
family and social structures in the nation's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with these problems, Clinton said, increased government action must be 
accompanied by an increased sense of personal and community responsibility. 
Passing the crime bill now pending in Congress will put more police on the 
streets and help in other ways, he said, but government cannot do the job 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to be energized and they have to wipe away enough of their 
cynicism to be willing to take personal responsibility for themselves and to 
try to rebuild their communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the interview quickly moved beyond that theme to focus on the 
Administration's more immediate problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at one point about critics' claims that he suffers from the character 
flaw of indecisiveness and that he has caved in and abandoned his positions on 
important issues, Clinton bristled. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it a "bum rap," the President said that he found it "amazing people 
could say that with a straight face." Over and over again, on issues ranging 
from deficit reduction and health care reform to gun control and free trade, 
Clinton said, he has taken on more entrenched interests and fought them harder 
than any President in recent times. Winning approval of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, for example, had required him to take on "a big part of my own 
political base" -- including organized labor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And "this health care thing has incurred the wrath of a whole new range of 
enemies of all kinds," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that his use of the bully pulpit has been undercut by months 
of controversy over allegations of womanizing and financial transactions of the 
Whitewater real estate development that are being investigated by a special 
counsel. He said that his answer is to go about his job and let the American 
people "make up their mind what they think about me and whether they believe me 
or those who are attacking me." 
</P>
<P>
 A President or any public official today, he said, "has very little protection 
against people who wish in an organized way to pillory or vilify the President. 
And so, the only protection is, it seems to me, to keep working and keep taking 
on the tough challenges and to demonstrate to the best of your ability who you 
really are to those people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said: "I don't think that it requires a great perception to conclude that a 
lot of the motivation for this is to deprive me of my voice." 
</P>
<P>
 The vehemence of some of the attacks on him, Clinton said, stems from his 
efforts to change the country in ways that challenge either vested beliefs or 
vested interests. He suggested that the only difference between attacks on him 
and some previous political leaders "is the extent to which that sort of thing 
can be spread widely across the citizenry through telecommunications technology 
and through the loosening of restraints about what is or isn't said." 
</P>
<P>
 A "big part" of some of the more bitter attacks on him, Clinton declared, 
involve people who are trying to stop health care reform. Americans may be 
entertained "by this sort of bitter, personal stuff," he said, "but I think not 
past a certain point. I think they are turned off." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans, he insisted, would like to move beyond the way his 
conservative critics have framed the debate on health care. Their debate, he 
said, "is about liberal, conservative; right and left; evil and good, and bad 
government and benign neglect." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our public discourse," Clinton said, "ought to be about how can we genuinely 
help one another improve our lives and overcome these divides and actually talk 
in calm terms about how to solve this."

DESPITE HELP, WHALE FAILS TO HEAD SEAWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A baby gray whale that has veered far off its northward migration route foiled 
the well-laid plans of rescuers Wednesday, reversing course and swimming back 
up the Petaluma River after an exhaustive, all-day effort to herd it out to 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-foot whale, dubbed Phyllis or Petaluma Pete by its delighted Sonoma 
County hosts, was about seven miles shy of the river mouth when it put on the 
brakes and made an abrupt U-turn, forcing a flotilla of escort boats to back 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 At dusk, the bullheaded whale was floating comfortably just north of the 
Lakeville Marina, where a throng of spectators waited to catch a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so spectacular to have a magnificent whale right in our back yard," said 
Lana Sutton, who runs a Greek restaurant at the marina. "What could be more 
exciting?" 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists were somewhat less thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whale is clearly running the show right now," said Joe Cordaro, a 
wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. "Our hope is 
that at some point he'll get bored and remember he has other things to do in 
his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it ended in frustration, Wednesday began on a hopeful note, with Navy 
scientists armed with sophisticated acoustical equipment joining the growing 
rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to entice the whale seaward, the Navy scientists used an underwater 
amplifier to broadcast gray whale sounds downriver from the cetacean. Following 
about 100 feet behind the whale, volunteers on three other vessels herded it by 
banging with hammers on specially designed steel pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress was painfully slow, and it was hard to determine whether the 
zigzagging whale was responding to the acoustical coaxing or just moseying 
about on its own. In any case, it has so far shown no interest in swimming 30 
miles southwest and out the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The wayward whale, believed to be between 1 and 2 years old, was first spotted 
in the Petaluma River on Saturday. Although whales occasionally get sidetracked 
in bays, it is extremely rare for one to swim up a river, and scientists can 
only speculate about what diverted this mammal from its seasonal journey to 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, experts were content to let the six-ton cetacean snoop about the 
murky inland waters and, they hoped, find its own way back to the Pacific. But 
on Monday, when it became briefly stranded on a mud flat and snagged between 
some dock pilings, concern for its safety grew. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he gets stuck in the mud, then we'd have to tow him out and that poses the 
risk of injury," said Peigin Barrett, director of the Sausalito-based Marine 
Mammal Center. "So we're hoping these methods will eventually do the trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, masses of whale watchers continued to swamp Petaluma, crowding the 
river's shore and delighting merchants along the normally sleepy waterway. 
Hundreds gathered Wednesday outside Papa's Taverna, a Greek restaurant the 
whale had passed the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has doubled, or maybe tripled," said Sutton, who opened an extra 
parking lot for the crush. "Today we're serving the whaler's special -- bits of 
halibut wrapped in pita bread, with lettuce, tomato and tzatziki sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 As they waited for a glimpse of the slow-swimming celebrity, spectators 
swapped theories about what had caused the whale to take such a dramatic 
detour. 
</P>
<P>
 One self-described mammal expert, Curt Kinkead, speculated that Phyllis, or 
Pete (its sex remains undetermined), had come up the river to get rid of the 
orange lice that coat its back. Scientists politely rejected the notion, noting 
that all gray whales have lice. 
</P>
<P>
 Also abundant on shore were suggestions of methods for urging the whale back 
to sea. One woman insisted that classical music -- especially Beethoven -- 
would work. Another onlooker recommended that the experts broadcast sounds from 
the killer whale -- a predator of the gray whale -- to scare it out of the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordaro said that was an option, but one that must be exercised with care in 
the shallow, muddy Petaluma River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to panic or stress out the animal, because it's already 
confused and might strand itself," he said. Today, he added, the rescue team 
might simply back off and wait for the mammal's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's time for us to just do some whale-watching, like everybody else."

1ST GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD APPROVED BY FDA; AGRICULTURE: CALGENE TOMATOES 
COULD BE IN SOME STORES IN 10 DAYS. FOES TO LAUNCH CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRODUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a 
genetically engineered food, clearing the way for a Davis, Calif., company to 
sell its laboratory-designed tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene Inc. said the tomato, designed with its "FlavrSavr" gene and bearing 
its MacGregor label, could be in food stores in 10 days, with consumers in the 
Midwest and parts of California getting the first chances to buy them. The 
tomato is billed as better tasting; it can be ripened on the vine and will stay 
fresh longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's long-anticipated approval ends a five-year process and gives birth 
to a new era of food production that supporters contend will lead to more 
nutritious and environmentally safer -- and potentially less costly -- ways to 
feed the world's hungry. It was also a signal for opponents to launch what they 
vowed would be a vigorous, nationwide campaign urging consumers not to buy the 
tomato or any other genetically engineered food. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said the Calgene tomato is just as safe as conventionally bred 
tomatoes. "We have approached our review of this product with scientific rigor 
and a commitment to full, public disclosure of that science," FDA Commissioner 
David Kessler said in a statement. "Consumers can be confident that we remain 
committed to assuring that foods produced by genetic engineering are as safe as 
food in our grocery stores today." 
</P>
<P>
 The tomato was developed using Calgene's patented "antisense" technology: The 
tomato's gene that initiates rotting was cloned and reinserted in reverse, thus 
slowing the rotting process. This antisense technology could be used to 
neutralize rotting or other undesirable traits in other crops as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tools of genetic engineering are allowing developers to modify plants 
faster and with greater precision than traditional methods of cross-breeding 
plants or animals for desired traits. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene's ability to disseminate the FDA's assurances of safety and win 
consumer acceptance of the tomato is seen as a critical first step in 
developing a market for the next generations of genetically engineered food 
products. As many as 50 genetically modified crops -- including 
insect-resistant corn and potatoes that absorb less fat when fried -- are in 
various stages of development, although none has been submitted for FDA review. 
</P>
<P>
 Several organizations of produce growers and grocers, and other companies 
working to develop food crops through laboratory manipulation of genes, praised 
the FDA action, calling it a boon for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, three public-interest groups Wednesday expressed their 
disappointment, particularly with the FDA's reiteration that it would not 
require explicit labeling of genetically engineered foods or products made from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund decried 
as inadequate the agency's oversight of genetically engineered foods, 
contending that future products might pose health and safety risks that would 
be overlooked by the agency. Those groups again called for labeling 
regulations, saying that future products might contain substances harmful to 
some consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA has said its process for reviewing all foods has built-in safeguards, 
regardless of the process used to develop them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another opponent, the Pure Food Campaign, a group led by longtime 
biotechnology foe Jeremy Rifkin, vowed to file suit against the FDA because of 
its review policies, and to organize boycotts and tomato-dumping demonstrations 
as its initial salvos in a "tomato war." Rifkin urges a longer safety testing 
period and mandatory labeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Salquist, who as Calgene's chief executive has shepherded the tomato 
through the precedent-setting and often-frustrating approval process, was in a 
celebratory mood Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer who wants a better-tasting tomato . . . (doesn't) want to be 
dictated to . . . as to what they can and can't buy in a supermarket," Salquist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grocery Manufacturers of America, the largest trade group of companies 
that manufacture and market brand-name grocery products, again affirmed its 
support of the FDA approval process and the use of biotechnology in the 
development of food products. 
</P>
<P>
 However, individual grocery chains and stores, as well as distributors and 
restaurateurs, will be taking careful note of consumer reaction, especially in 
light of the response to a Pure Food Campaign-led drive this year against 
bovine somatotropin, a biotech drug designed to increase cows' milk production. 
When the FDA approved the Monsanto-developed drug for sale this year, Rifkin's 
group successfully persuaded dozens of grocery chains around the country to 
pledge not to accept dairy products from cows treated with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, some Southern California produce distributors said Calgene's 
tomato will face stiff competition from new varieties of vine-ripened tomatoes 
that, although selling at a premium above artificially ripened tomatoes, will 
still cost less than Calgene's MacGregors. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene's tomatoes could be priced as high as $2.50 a pound, twice that of 
many premium, traditionally bred tomatoes. Still, Calgene expects that within 
three years, its tomato will have captured 15% of the $3.5-billion market for 
fresh tomatoes. That would mean $500 million in sales -- far outstripping the 
estimated $25 million to $30 million cost of developing the tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Calgene's biggest hurdle in selling the tomato may be of its own 
doing. Farmers contracted by Calgene to grow the tomato did not plant enough 
acreage, Salquist said, "because we didn't know when the approval would come 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be small quantities of the tomatoes available for the next six 
weeks in as yet unspecified markets in California and the Midwest. After that, 
there could be a small gap in availability until the company is able to 
increase harvests, Salquist said.

TOBACCO FIRM PAID $950,000 TO PLACE CIGARETTES IN FILMS; MOVIES: COMPANY PAID 
ACTORS IN CASH, CARS OR JEWELRY IN EARLY '80S, MEMOS SAY. INDUSTRY SAYS IT HAS 
HALTED PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Internal memos say that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. spent more than 
$950,000 in a span of four years to feature its cigarette brands in more than 
20 movies -- including payments of at least $300,000 to action film star 
Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 The payments took the form of checks, cash and merchandise -- including 
jewelry and automobiles for such stars as Paul Newman, Sean Connery and 
Stallone -- over the years 1979 to 1983, the documents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Product placement, which involves payments for display of brand-name 
merchandise in films, is a legal and potentially large source of revenue for 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But use of the practice by tobacco companies drew harsh criticism in Congress 
and from health activists in the late 1980s. Critics charged that the tobacco 
companies were making an end-run around federal laws that require warning 
labels on cigarette ads and banish tobacco ads from television, where many 
feature films eventually appear. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brown & Williamson spokesman Tom Fitzgerald, the nation's No. 3 
cigarette manufacturer -- which makes Kool, Barclay and other brands -- halted 
the use of product placement agreements several years ago. Tobacco foes believe 
that the practice continues in the industry, citing what they consider an 
otherwise inexplicable rise in smoking scenes in films and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the papers, recently leaked to anti-smoking leaders in Congress and 
several news organizations, is an April 28, 1983, letter signed by Stallone in 
which he agrees for a fee of $500,000 to "use Brown & Williamson tobacco 
products in no less than five feature films." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said Stallone had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bergman, executive director of the anti-smoking group STAT -- which has 
accused tobacco firms of using movies to hook young smokers -- said Wednesday 
that the revelations are dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's purposely putting advertising in the movies but pretending that it's not 
advertising, knowing that the movies that Sylvester Stallone is in appeal to 
children and youth more than anyone else," Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, then-Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio) conducted hearings on the use of 
product placement deals by tobacco firms. In the biggest expenditure disclosed 
during Luken's inquiries, Philip Morris said its Tokyo-based advertising agency 
had paid $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in a James Bond film that was to 
run in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the placement effort described in the Brown & Williamson documents is the 
most extensive and costly ever to come to light. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers include a 1983 audit of the tobacco company's agreement with 
Associated Film Promotions, a now-defunct Los Angeles product placement firm. 
According to the audit, Associated Film's records showed that "they have 
attempted to make placements for B & W in over 150 movies or television shows 
and have succeeded in making placements in 22 movies and one television show." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said B & W was paying Associated Film a $30,000 quarterly retainer 
in 1983 and had paid a total of $278,000 in retainer fees since their 
relationship began in mid-1979. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, B & W spent an additional $687,000 for "special 
placements" arranged by Associated Film in a variety of movies -- including 
$100,000 apiece for "Where the Boys Are" and "Harry & Son," both 1984 releases, 
and $50,000 for the Clint Eastwood picture "Killing Ground," released in 1983 
as "Sudden Impact." 
</P>
<P>
 About $300,000 of the special placement monies went to Stallone as part of the 
five-picture deal worth $500,000, the documents said. Among the Stallone films 
in the deal, according to the documents, were "Rhinestone Cowboy," "Rocky IV" 
and "Rambo," which was released as "Rambo: First Blood Part II." 
</P>
<P>
 The documents suggest that B & W officials were not sure they were getting 
their money's worth, after sitting down to view seven films in which their 
brands were to be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Body Heat," the blurred image of a Kool poster appeared three times, but 
two lead characters were "observed . . . smoking Marlboro" -- industry leader 
Philip Morris' flagship brand -- throughout the film, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same story with "Only When I Laugh." That film included "a blurred 
pack of Kool," but "the lead character . . . smoked Marlboro throughout the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco executives also discovered that in some cases, Associated Film was not 
paying with "checks to individuals" because movie producers "prefer cash, 
jewelry, cars, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the report said, Associated Film's records showed that of $20,000 
paid for placement in the James Bond film, "Never Say Never Again," $12,715 was 
spent on "jewelry for Sean Connery." 
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000 purportedly paid for placement in "Harry & Son" included $42,307 
for a "car for Paul Newman," the documents said. And of $50,000 listed for the 
film that became "Sudden Impact," $22,047 was said to have been spent on a "car 
for Clint Eastwood," according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Connery and Newman did not return phone calls seeking comment. A 
spokesman for Eastwood said the audit entry had to be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't receive a car," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kovoloff, a public relations man and former president of Associated 
Film, declined to discuss the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with this right now. My answer is I have nothing to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 Several tobacco companies told Luken in 1989 they no longer paid filmmakers to 
feature their brands, but had done so in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, cigarette firms wrote a prohibition on placements into the 
industry's voluntary advertising code, according to an official with the 
Tobacco Institute. The code states that tobacco companies will "not . . . 
engage in paid movie product or cigarette advertising placements." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice remains common among other makers of consumer goods. One current 
release, "Major League II," includes prominent displays of at least eight 
recognizable brand names.

FEES OR TUITION? CONTROL OF STATE COLLEGES AT STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like tuition. It fits the definition of tuition. And to the 
university students or their families who pay it, it certainly feels like 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the state of California steadfastly refuses to use the dreaded "T" word to 
describe the thousands of dollars it charges residents to attend University of 
California or the California State University campuses. By law, these charges 
are merely "fees." 
</P>
<P>
 This may seem like a silly little word game, but it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether to call the fast-rising tab fees or tuition , say 
lawmakers and college officials, underscores the political struggle over who 
should control funding for colleges. It is also about the power of language and 
California's deep cultural agony over reconciling its pewter future with a 
golden past. 
</P>
<P>
 To a growing chorus of fiscal realists, state officials who insist on using 
the word fee in reference to the spiraling costs of attending a public 
university are in deep denial, unwilling to admit today's harsh fiscal reality 
and desperately clinging to the notion of California as a land of limitless 
educational opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me as dysfunctional," said Cal State Chancellor Barry Munitz, who 
favors the change of nomenclature for "truth in advertising" by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these days when everybody is concerned about being honest with consumers, 
in effect we're forced into being dishonest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists, meanwhile, accuse Munitz and others who prefer to use tuition 
of breaking faith with California citizens -- and perhaps using the state's 
economic woes as an excuse to gain more budgetary control and further raise 
student charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about semantics," said Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who opposes 
the move to tuition and has attacked escalating university fees in his maverick 
gubernatorial campaign. "It's about soul. It's the soul of the university 
disguised as a word game." 
</P>
<P>
 To both sides, the soul in peril -- or already lost, depending on who is 
talking -- is the 125-year-old promise that any California resident who wants 
to can go to college without paying tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers first struck this bargain with the people in 1868, when the 
Legislature created the University of California and declared that "admission 
and tuition shall be free to all residents." The ideal was further refined in 
the 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education, which established California's 
three-tiered college system of today. 
</P>
<P>
 State law and policy define tuition as the "direct cost" of college 
instruction -- money for faculty salaries, classrooms, equipment, supplies. 
Over the years, lawmakers have paid these costs with huge appropriations, 
opening doors for the poorest of students. The return on the public investment: 
an economy that prospered from a steady stream of educated employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Students began paying fees in 1921, when UC imposed its first annual charge of 
$50 to cover "incidental" expenses. The fees grew gradually over the years, but 
even when they broke $1,200 at UC and $600 at Cal State during the 1980s, state 
officials said they were keeping the tuition-free promise because student money 
was used only for non-instructional needs such as dormitories, health clinics, 
athletics and cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
 This distinction was also enshrined in state law, which pointedly refers to 
the student charges as fees. Except for an obscure 1977 statute allowing Cal 
State to collect $25 a year in tuition from each student, the law expressly 
forbids using fees for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has been the rub. Fee wars have been fought over what exactly 
constitutes an incidental cost. Students cried foul in the early 1980s when 
budget cuts prompted UC to use a new definition allowing the university to 
divert fee money to help pay for the registrar, financial aid and admissions 
offices on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But most fee watchers argue that it has been just in the last four years, as 
the state belly-flopped into its worst recession since the Great Depression, 
that lawmakers and college officials crossed the historic T line with both feet 
as they scrambled to make up for substantial legislative budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Student fees have doubled at Cal State and increased 130% at UC since 1989. In 
UC's case, the increases have been so dramatic that the relative student cost 
has jumped since 1990 from 19th to fifth among the nation's top 23 public 
research institutions, according to a recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cal State officials have used millions of dollars in student fees 
during the past two years to offer about 6,500 courses that otherwise would 
have been axed. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, both systems have gone on record vowing to begin using student 
fees to pay directly for instruction. Cal State trustees adopted a policy in 
March, 1933, pegging fees at a third of the cost of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 And in January, the UC Board of Regents approved language that, for the first 
time, allowed fees to be used to "fund all costs related to instruction, 
including faculty salaries." They also voted to charge an extra $620 to 
undergraduates next fall, a $2,000 differential to students entering five 
professional schools and $6,000 extra to anyone who earns a duplicate degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it remains official university policy to use the word fees, something UC 
President Jack Peltason admits makes him "stutter." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is tuition," Peltason conceded at a recent lunch with Times editorial 
writers, "but by calling it tuition . . . we kind of shut the door on the 
debate and say, 'Yes, the students will pay the cost of instruction. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not being hypocritical, we are just not prepared to say we've crossed 
that (line) and we can't come back," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such Orwellian logic, one expert contends, is part of a self-deception born of 
fear and the desire to hold back a sea change in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This part of the social contract has been over for a while, but to admit that 
the state has reneged on the tuition-free commitment is breaking some ties that 
have bound the society together since the state was formed," said Kurt Knudsen, 
policy analyst for the California Research Bureau in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is true, lawmakers show no willingness to admit it. Last year, they 
chewed up a bill sponsored by the California Postsecondary Education 
Commission, a state agency focused on higher education, to lift the 
prohibitions against using student fees for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Without using the word tuition, the measure would have capped student charges 
for Cal State at 30% of instructional costs and UC charges at 40%. But the bill 
never made it through the first Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lawmakers passed budget language encouraging Cal State in 
particular to divert student fees for the restoration of classes. Underscoring 
what others have called a charade, commission Executive Director Warren Fox 
quipped, "We did it practically but not legally." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, say some lawmakers, is that swallowing tuition as a policy would 
surrender some budgetary power to college officials, who could automatically 
increase student charges. The Legislature's historic obligation to pay tuition 
also gives it control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part of this is that for the first time, tuition is used to pay for 
faculty salaries," said Hayden, speaking specifically about the new UC policy. 
"So now the faculty has a vested interest in pushing tuition up in order to 
guarantee their own salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles), chair of the Assembly 
Higher Education Committee, said that "at some point, we're going to have to 
bite the bullet and recognize that we're going to have to charge tuition." 
</P>
<P>
 But the paradigm shift will come only after college officials are more 
forthcoming about how they spend the money and are willing to guarantee 
results, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say this straight out: I don't think there are 10 members of the 
Legislature who know the difference between tuition and fees," she said. "Most 
members of this Legislature are concerned about the rapidly escalating costs to 
students and they want to know why it is . . . the institutions are finding 
money for whatever they want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "If students are going to pay . . . can they expect to graduate in four years 
because there are courses available? Can they expect that students have 
adequate parking, classrooms, financial aid?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is precisely the point, said Cal State Chancellor Munitz. "You've got to 
face the tuition issue or at least stop this hypocrisy of barring us to use the 
fees for student benefit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're in the worst of all worlds. Students are paying more and 
they're calling it fees, although technically we can't direct the payment to 
where we need it most -- the instructional program." 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz said people privately approach him about the fee-versus-tuition dispute 
and say, "Thank God that's on the table, somebody's got to confront that 
issue." Addressing it officially and politically is another thing and Munitz 
said the key is a California psyche that "doesn't want to believe the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been able to see that the next time got better," he said. "If we 
admit now that there's a need for a fundamental change in the way we do 
business, then in effect we admit that California has lost the ability to 
recover." Is It Tuition? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the University of California nor the Cal State University system 
collects formal tuition. But as shown below, annual student fees have risen 
sharply.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; FIELD POLL FINDS 30% OF GOP VOTERS FAVOR UNZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Unz, the 32-year-old computer magnate who has waged a well-funded 
insurgent campaign against his party's incumbent governor, Pete Wilson, found 
himself at the center of the state's political universe Wednesday. And he was 
happy to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, the traditionally influential Field Poll showed Unz winning 
the support of 30% of the state's registered Republican voters, while a 
relatively paltry 47% backed Wilson. That a virtual unknown could come within 
shooting range of the incumbent governor put Unz in a celebratory mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it say about Pete Wilson that he's now below 50% and in a tighter 
race with me than John Garamendi is with Kathleen Brown, when nobody heard of 
me five weeks ago?" Unz asked reporters after a speech in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Pete Wilson can't even win a Republican primary at this stage with a 
convincing percentage against a political unknown like me, I think it says he's 
in terrible shape in November," Unz added. 
</P>
<P>
 If the news struck a glancing blow at the Wilson campaign operation, it could 
not be discerned. The collective upper lip remained stiff, as campaign 
officials took pains to point out that the same poll showed Wilson gaining a 
slight bit of ground against Democratic front-runner Kathleen Brown in 
projected November matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Field Poll number just doesn't jibe with any other poll we've seen," said 
spokesman Dan Schnur, who forwarded three smaller polls that show Unz with 
significantly less support. "But even if it is accurate, it's not impacting the 
general election race at all. We're almost even with Kathleen Brown in a 
general election matchup and that's the one that counts." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, almost all candidates except Democratic state Sen. Tom Hayden -- who 
was running well behind everyone in all matchups -- had something to crow about 
Wednesday. At this stage of the campaign, as voters are just beginning to sit 
up and take notice, perception is everything. And so more than a few attempts 
at perceptual spin were in order: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brown campaign trumpeted its glee at Field Poll results that showed the 
state treasurer 19 points ahead of Insurance Commissioner Garamendi in 
prospective primary balloting, with a 41%-22% margin. It ignored a smaller poll 
that showed the gap at 10 points. And it chortled, through press secretary John 
Whitehurst, at Unz's Field Poll showing against Wilson. "It's clear that a big 
segment of Republicans want change and are willing to take a gamble on a 
32-year-old to say to Gov. Wilson that 'we want change,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Wilson campaign set its sights on the Field Poll's general election 
matchup that showed Brown defeating Wilson, 50% to 42%, a slightly smaller gap 
than in the last such survey, and statistically close to a dead heat. Moreover, 
Wilson aides noted, Brown had held a 23-point lead over Wilson one year ago. 
"Dead even is a lot more fun for us coming up than it is for her coming down," 
Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Garamendi campaign chose to emphasize a smaller poll, done for a 
consortium of newspapers and television stations in the state, which showed 
Brown with a 32%-22% lead over him in the primary. "This actually is very 
consistent with what we believe to be the case," said Garamendi campaign 
manager Darry Sragow, whose organization has not done independent polling. "We 
clearly have a shot at it." He also noted that the Field Poll showed Garamendi 
beating Wilson by a larger margin than Brown, 13 points to 8 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unz said the Field Poll results corroborate his campaign's polling, which he 
said showed a 15%-20% bump in his support in the wake of a $1-million 
television advertising campaign. "Over half of the Republicans in California 
have already made up their minds that they don't want four more years of Pete 
Wilson," he said. "What they haven't decided is whether they want to vote for 
me instead, and I think I can get those undecideds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur said he is deciding whether to flood the 
airwaves with a new set of ads that would reinforce the radio spots still 
running. His first set of television commercials scored Wilson on a number of 
fronts, from his vote for tax increases to the failure of the National Guard to 
quickly quell the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 With his out-of-nowhere strategy, Unz has positioned himself against Wilson 
much as Republican presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan did against 
incumbent President George Bush in 1992: as the repository for his party's 
internal dissatisfaction with the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Buchanan did to Bush, Unz has essentially been keeping Wilson's 
substantial political wounds fresh, reminding voters why they have had a low 
opinion of the incumbent. Buchanan did that to virtual perfection in the 1992 
New Hampshire primary, when he won 37% of the vote in a state that four years 
earlier had given Bush a huge victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks ago, Wilson aide Schnur predicted that Unz could score in the 25%-30% 
range, but he disputed the notion that the criticisms leveled by Unz would help 
a Democrat win in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's partly an anti-incumbent vote, but it's more an expression of the 
frustration that people have who have dealt with the economic situation in the 
last few years," Schnur said. "But the economy is recovering, people are more 
enthused about their futures, and it's going to be much more difficult for a 
challenger, either in the primary or general election, to capitalize on those 
emotions over the duration of the election." 
</P>
<P>
 If Unz cannot move closer to Wilson by Election Day, the lasting impact of the 
Field Poll for Wilson will be the ignominy of winning the support of only half 
of his party just three weeks from Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's spokesman Whitehurst said political consultants frequently hear 
warning bells when an incumbent registers in the low 60s or high 50s in 
head-to-head polls, far higher numbers than Wilson is demonstrating. "He's at 
panic," Whitehurst said of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In other campaign news, the three Democratic campaigns came to an agreement 
that may allow the May 24 television debate to be aired in Southern California. 
However, it was unclear whether any Los Angeles stations would agree to 
schedule the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two debates are to be held in Sacramento on May 23, and in Los 
Angeles on May 25. The latter will be on the Michael Jackson radio show.

LIKE FINDING 'SNOWBALLS IN HELL'; MERCURY: RADAR HAS ENABLED SCIENTISTS TO 
CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF ICE IN CRATERS ON THE HOTTEST PLANET IN THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM. THE FROZEN LAKES AT THE POLES MAY BE MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astronomers taking a closer look at Mercury, the nearest planet to the sun, 
have confirmed the existence of frozen water in an arid, airless land where 
daylight is hot enough to melt lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The planet's lakes of ice, cupped in polar craters miles across and shielded 
by constant shadows, may be millions of years old, said researchers at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory and the National Astronomy Center at Arecibo, Puerto 
Rico. The finding is surprising, in part because Mercury is so close to the sun 
that the temperature at its equator reaches 800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, said one UCLA planetary scientist, like finding "snowballs in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any question that it is real," said David A. Paige, a 
professor of planetary science at UCLA. "It is very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 The research, based on new high-resolution radar maps of Mercury, is published 
in today's issue of the science journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The study offers convincing evidence that one of the rarest commodities in the 
inner solar system -- the water that gives the orb of Earth its distinctive 
blue hue when viewed from space -- may be more abundant than has been thought. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives additional impetus to the theory that the Earth's moon may also 
harbor secret reserves of water in its polar regions and may have an important 
impact on any future human exploration of the moon, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if there is water on the moon, but now there is a better reason 
to look," said Bruce Murray, an expert on planetary science and geology at 
Caltech. Murray was among the first to raise the possibility, more than 30 
years ago, that water might be found on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you find it on Mercury, you certainly expect to find it on the moon," 
Murray said. "If there are ice deposits on the moon hidden in these craters, 
that would to me at least change the game a great deal about where you put a 
lunar base." 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that Mercury could have water was first raised about two years 
ago when radar images of the planet revealed distinctive bright, reflective 
patches near its poles. The radar echoes reflected by these patches were 
characteristic of water, the researchers said, but they were initially unsure 
why any water reserves had not boiled away long ago under the hellish 
conditions on Mercury's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige theorized that at the poles, where the sun's light would cast permanent 
shadows across the floors of large craters, it could be cold enough -- well 
below 32 degrees Fahrenheit -- to preserve frozen water for billions of years. 
Scientists have not ruled out the possibility that the ice is protected by a 
thin layer of soil, which would be transparent to the radar signals broadcast 
from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first discovered that the poles of Mercury had these anomalous 
bright spots, it wasn't clear what they were," Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 Impact craters immediately came to mind. "These are places there where the sun 
never shone. The sun never peeks down into the crater," Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent radar studies were detailed enough to line up the reflective 
patches with known craters on Mercury, apparently confirming the idea. Older 
and more eroded craters did not contain the deposits.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; FARM WATER ISSUE DAMPENS 
BROWN'S BUOYANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Basking in the results of a poll that puts her 20 points ahead of her nearest 
Democratic rival, Kathleen Brown drove into this little farming town Wednesday 
and got wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain dribbled out of the sky as Brown's campaign bus arrived at Perry's Chuck 
Wagon truck stop. But that was nothing, compared to what was waiting for Brown 
when she stepped off the bus and strode into the small crowd: a walnut farmer 
with ostrich-skin boots and a lot of tough questions about water. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position is that water is an absolutely precious resource and that 
agriculture is an industry that is No. 1 in California," Brown told the farmer, 
a Republican named Jim Verboon. She asked Verboon if he was conserving water 
and talked to him about reallocation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Verboon, who farms 100 acres near Layton, wasn't satisfied. Brown, he said 
later, had given him "kind of a shine-on -- a standard answer that doesn't tell 
you much." 
</P>
<P>
 A little farther south, when the bus pulled up at Perko's Koffee Kup in 
Delano, the drizzle had lifted. But the questions kept coming. Leon Moore, a 
grape farmer, called out his query from where he sat in an orange and green 
booth: Where did Brown stand on water? 
</P>
<P>
 "Water is a big issue in the Valley," Brown said carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," Moore muttered, "we know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since May 7, when she kicked off her so-called California Jobs Bus Tour, Brown 
has spent several days rolling around the state. On previous jaunts, the 
48-year-old state treasurer has toured Northern and Southern California. But on 
Wednesday, she ventured into the agricultural belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she was traveling by bus "so I can be as close to the people of 
California as possible and to let serendipity take us to the highways and 
byways." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like truck stops. You meet interesting people there," she told the throng 
of reporters who hitched a ride with her. "I like to stop, check it out, and 
hopefully meet voters." 
</P>
<P>
 One TV cameraman was incredulous. "Are there really going to be voters there?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we'll find out," said Brown happily. "You never know." 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, serendipity would bring Brown face to face with several dozen 
voters. More than a few, however, couldn't vote for her in the June 7 primary 
even if they wanted to -- they were registered Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tour, touted as a chance for Brown to "localize" her indictment of Gov. 
Pete Wilson, began at a truck trailer plant in Fresno that had shut its doors 
in 1992. Brown arrived at the plant's deserted parking lot in mid-morning, 
determined to talk about her pledge to create 1 million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, 1 million jobs plus one," she said. "Because Pete Wilson's going to 
need one." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Fresno, too, the water issue cropped up. 
</P>
<P>
 When a local television reporter asked if she supports the Miller-Bradley 
bill, which rewrote federal water policy in favor of environmental and urban 
interests, she said, "It's the law. Let's stop talking about history and let's 
start talking about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, at a Fresno shopping mall, she attempted to use the foul 
weather to address the water issue more simply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these clouds are actually little rays of sunshine," she said. 
"Because they've been bringing a little rain -- and isn't water what we want?" 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, which was decked out in Brown buttons and hats and waved Brown 
campaign placards, applauded Brown's joke. But if Verboon, the walnut farmer, 
had been there, he would have told her that rain this early in the season is 
bad news for many farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you grow cotton or alfalfa, it's not good," he said later. "It's not good 
for fruit either. It's unfortunate weather." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But then that's what Brown had said her bus tour was for: to listen and to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love learning from the people of this state what their hopes and 
aspirations are," she said as her bus rolled along California 99. 
</P>
<P>
 And Brown is nothing if not a good listener. Her speaking style may be wooden 
at times, but one on one, she is nearly irresistible -- warm, attentive and 
accessible. All day Wednesday, she asked people about themselves, their 
families, their troubles. She seemed to enjoy the chance to make small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kingsburg, Brown wandered into an antique co-op. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fiesta china -- can you believe how popular that is now?" she asked one of 
the vendors, Karen Grilione. "I'm a garage sale and antiques lover." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the questions. How was business, Brown wanted to know. Where had 
Grilione grown up? Had she lived in Kingsburg all her life? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love California," Grilione said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, too," Brown said. "And I'd love to have your vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bakersfield, the site of a trucking plant that has moved out of state 
served as the backdrop for more talk about the need for new, quality jobs. But 
Brown lit up the brightest when she was introduced to a small girl with sand 
dollar earrings and pink jacket who said her name was Vanessa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanessa!" Brown said. "I just had a brand new grandbaby and do you know what 
her name is? Vanessa!" 
</P>
<P>
 The girl looked shyly at the ground.

RELATIVES OF VICTIMS SUE GUN MAKERS; COURTS: ACTION BROUGHT BY SURVIVORS OF 
FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN SAN FRANCISCO RAMPAGE IS A NEW TACTIC IN THE BATTLE 
AGAINST FIREARMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Survivors of four victims killed in last year's bloody rampage at a San 
Francisco high-rise filed lawsuits Wednesday against manufacturers of the 
semiautomatic weapons used in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel suits, a new tactic in the war against guns, are similar to legal 
actions brought by smokers against cigarette companies. The lawsuits charge 
that the gun manufacturers were negligent in selling the weapons to the public 
because they have no legitimate civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 Gian Luigi Ferri, the assailant in the July 1 shootings, killed eight people 
and wounded six at the law firm of Pettit & Martin before killing himself. 
Ferri left a rambling letter blaming food additives, lawyers and others for his 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors' suits are being handled by four of San Francisco's major law 
firms, working for free with the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, chaired by 
Sarah Brady, wife of former Ronald Reagan aide Jim Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't think we could win this suit, we wouldn't be doing it," said 
Dennis Henigan, an attorney for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two similar lawsuits filed in Louisiana and Connecticut against gun makers in 
1989 failed, but Henigan said the California case will fare better for a 
variety of reasons, including new statistics that he said show such guns are 
disproportionately used in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough lawsuit but not without merit and one worth trying," said Gene 
Erbin, a lawyer familiar with gun liability issues and counsel to the Assembly 
Judiciary Committee. "It is going to be very, very expensive. The manufacturers 
and the NRA (National Rifle Assn.) will defend it strenuously." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a San Francisco court probably would be receptive to the claims. "I am 
very confident this will not be dismissed," Erbin said. "If they want to, this 
will go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Gary Schwartz said the law firms handling the case are 
prestigious and would not bring suit "unless they had done enough work to 
convince themselves that the theories are not frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a long shot, but it is not ludicrous," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits allege that the sale of the TEC DC-9 assault pistol to the public 
constitutes an "abnormally dangerous activity" and that the manufacturer should 
be held strictly liable for damages to those injured by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling such assault guns is negligent, the suits contend, because they have 
no legitimate civilian use and are designed for crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A gun industry lobbyist said the suits would fail, but acknowledged that they 
posed a "little different twist" from previous litigation against gun 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Feldman, lobbyist for the American Shooting Sports Council, said the 
guns are used in sport for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I own four of them, and I like to shoot them," said Feldman, speaking on 
behalf of two manufacturers named in the suit. "They are fun guns to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to hold the weapon's manufacturers responsible would be akin to forcing 
car makers to pay damages for injuries caused by drunk drivers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suing the equipment manufacturers won't do anything but make lawyers richer 
and make the families of these victims a continuing part of the tragedy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors of the dead attended a news conference by the gun control group to 
announce the lawsuits in the building where their loved ones were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sposato brought his 20-month-old daughter, Meghan, dressed in a flowered 
dress and white tights and sandals. Her mother, Jody, 30, was a client at the 
law firm and was shot in the back through the glass of a conference room where 
she was giving a deposition. Meghan, their only child, was 10 months old at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to have more children," said Steve Sposato, 37, a 
telecommunications engineer, as his chubby, blue-eyed daughter squirmed next to 
him in a pink stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Merrill, whose husband, Mike, was killed, said "the trauma is 
impossible to erase." 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently my 4-year-old daughter, Kristen, asked me what I wanted to be when I 
grew up," Merrill said. "I told her I wasn't quite sure but that I may have to 
go back to work soon. Kristen became hysterical and told me she didn't want me 
to do that, because if I went to work I might not come back -- like her daddy 
didn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants are Intratec, which manufactured the two guns used by 
Ferri; USA Magazines, which manufactured the high-capacity ammunition 
magazines; Hell-Fire Systems, which made the trigger system, and Super Pawn, 
the Las Vegas store where Ferri purchased one of the assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Super Pawn said the company's president was unavailable for 
comment. Hell-Fire Systems could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors seek unspecified damages. Henigan said the lawsuits were filed 
separately because each survivor has different damages, based on such factors 
as the amount of income they lost because of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an industry that for too long has been able to wash its hands for of 
all responsibility for gun violence on the grounds that somebody else pulled 
the trigger," Henigan said.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: UGLY ADS FIND THEIR WAY INTO PRIMARY RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ghost of Willie Horton has haunted every major political campaign since 
1988. No candidate wants to be accused of running in slime, as George Bush was 
with his odorous Horton TV ad. 
</P>
<P>
 But most candidates also have a bigger fear -- that of losing the election, as 
Michael S. Dukakis did to Bush. So the determined and the desperate will play 
their cards -- using lies, bigotry, fear, demagoguery -- and worry about the 
consequences after the people vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Political commercials basically come in three types: Positive, negative and 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of a positive ad was Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, in a 
checkered flannel shirt, happily "working for California." A negative ad was 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown's stark footage of forlorn men as she blamed Gov. Pete 
Wilson for the loss of 550,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Horton ad set the modern standard for ugliness. It showed rotating mug 
shots of Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and the bushy-bearded Horton, a furloughed 
African American murderer who raped a pregnant white woman and tortured her 
husband. The ad clearly appealed to racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are two ugly political ads running on TV screens in California. One 
is by Republican Wilson. The other is by Democrat Phil Angelides, an underdog 
candidate for state treasurer. The ads are distinctively different, but both 
odorous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday the 13th of last week, Wilson was not bashing immigrants. He was 
bashing a system that allowed and encouraged 100,000 foreigners to illegally 
enter California each year, increasing pressure on public education, health 
care and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the way I saw it and said so in a column. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last Friday, the governor began airing a new commercial that tends to 
arouse the dark side of human nature and further polarize an inflammatory 
issue. And in this ad, he is bashing illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas his previous public statements attacking illegal immigration 
invariably included praise for the courage and tenacity of people seeking a 
better life, Wilson's commercial contains none of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep coming," a narrator intones. "The federal government won't stop 
them at the border. . . . Gov. Pete Wilson sent the National Guard to help. . . 
." The governor then says, in part, "I'm working to deny state services. . . . 
Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the text that is especially nasty, but the pictures and the tone. 
Played in dramatic black and white and accompanied by a rhythmic bass beat 
suitable for a horror film, the ad shows Latinos racing across the border at 
San Ysidro, dodging cars. Some might see it as an invasion of brown hordes. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign consultants use black and white film to evoke emotion and often to 
subliminally connote good and evil. The Wilson camp says its border footage 
originally was in color, then was changed into black and white. That's because 
the color was of poor quality, it says. 
</P>
<P>
 I figure there are two main reasons for the ugly ad at this time. One is to 
depress Kathleen Brown's vote in the Democratic primary and reduce her 
anticipated momentum going into the general election. A new version of the ad 
concludes by attacking Brown on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is to draw right-wing Republicans away from maverick Ron Unz 
and keep the governor's little-known primary opponent from embarrassing him 
with, say, 20% of the vote. A new Field Poll puts Unz at 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angelides ad is one of the sleaziest in years. He attempts to link in 
voters' minds his opponent -- Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) -- with the 
1993 murder of a doctor at a Florida abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides, a developer and former state Democratic chairman, does this by 
running film of violence outside a clinic while a female narrator says: "A 
doctor murdered. But L.A. Sen. David Roberti refuses to vote to protect 
clinics." The flimsy link is that Roberti abstained on a meaningless 
legislative resolution calling upon Congress to pass a bill protecting abortion 
clinics. Roberti says he never saw the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad continues by stating that Roberti "writes a constitutional ban on 
abortion." This is a distortion; 17 years ago, he was co-author of another 
meaningless resolution urging federal adoption of an anti-abortion amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is a Catholic who opposes abortion on religious grounds, but has never 
made that part off his legislative agenda. Nevertheless, he's potentially 
vulnerable on the issue in a Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion has little to do with being state treasurer, but that's a whole other 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates won't stop running the ugly ads until they no longer influence 
voters. And in recent years they have.

U.S. CONSIDERS MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO CAMBODIA; SOUTHEAST ASIA: STRENGTH OF 
REBEL KHMER ROUGE PROMPTS CONCERN. THAILAND, OTHER NATIONS OPPOSE ARMS 
SHIPMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is considering sending military assistance to Cambodia after 
a series of battlefield victories by anti-government Khmer Rouge rebels, a 
senior Clinton Administration official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, 
told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that the United States is consulting 
with Australia and Cambodia's neighbors about what kind of aid should be sent 
to help it "promote development, stability and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said his government is also 
"seriously considering" a request from Phnom Penh for military aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any military assistance to the Indochina area has a lot of historical 
resonance and potent political sensitivity, so we would want to work extremely 
closely with the Congress on this," Lord said. "On the other hand, the Congress 
feels very strongly about the return of the Khmer Rouge to power." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has sent no arms to Indochina since the fall of Saigon in 
South Vietnam and Phnom Penh in Cambodia to Communist forces in April, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Arming Indochina is a highly emotional issue for many Americans because few 
have forgotten that the ill-fated U.S. involvement in the region began when 
President John F. Kennedy sent advisers to aid the South Vietnamese army in the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he favored sending U.S. military personnel to help train Cambodia's 
army rather than sending arms, Lord replied: "The new integrated army needs 
training and a lot of help to be effective as a fighting force." 
</P>
<P>
 The Khmer Rouge are widely blamed for the deaths of more than 1 million 
Cambodians in a reign of terror in the late 1970s. The group refused to take 
part in U.N.-sponsored elections in Cambodia last year and has refused to 
surrender large areas of western Cambodia to the newly elected government. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Cambodia's newly integrated royal army seized Anlong Veng and 
Pailin, two important Khmer Rouge-held towns near the border with Thailand. The 
government lost Anlong Veng almost immediately and managed to hold on to 
Pailin, a gem-mining center and the Khmer Rouge headquarters, for only a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the two towns represented a public relations catastrophe for the 
fledgling government in Phnom Penh, especially after reports that its army, 
which had clear numerical superiority, bolted when its commanding officers fled 
in panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners and thousands of residents of the western Cambodian city of 
Battambang were reported to have pulled back to Phnom Penh as anxiety rose 
about a looming Khmer Rouge offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern appeared to have receded slightly Wednesday when Western aid 
officials reported that a Khmer Rouge attack against the northwestern town of 
Mongkol Borey appeared to have been repulsed by government troops and that the 
Maoist guerrillas had pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cambodia's neighbors in Southeast Asia are growing anxious that the 
deteriorating military situation might unravel the delicate power-sharing 
arrangement that was hammered out last summer after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that deal, King Norodom Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, became 
the country's first prime minister, while former Communist Premier Hun Sen 
became second prime minister, and other top jobs were similarly parceled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we can afford now is to have a conflict and crisis in our 
region," Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar told a conference on 
Asia's future Wednesday. "We are watching the developments in Cambodia with 
some concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gravity of the situation, Cambodia's appeals to its neighbors for 
arms aid in the last six months have been met by stony silence. The government 
army is said to have nearly exhausted its inventory of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand repeated Wednesday that it opposes the United States or Australia 
sending arms to Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan told the same international conference in 
Singapore that Bangkok "questions the wisdom of sending arms to Cambodia," 
preferring instead to see a political solution to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambodian government has accused the Thai military of resupplying the 
Khmer Rouge from stockpiles kept on the Thai side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Thais have denied the charges, last year, Thai police publicly 
displayed captured Khmer Rouge trucks carrying tons of war materiel at a base 
inside Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by past practice of seeking "consensus" before taking joint action, 
Thailand's opposition effectively means that the Assn. of Southeast Asian 
Nations -- which includes Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and 
the Philippines -- is likely to try to block Western assistance to Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reach a peaceful settlement of the civil war, Sihanouk has 
proposed that the Phnom Penh government hold talks with the Khmer Rouge in 
Pyongyang, North Korea, on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranariddh, Hun Sen and National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim announced Wednesday 
that they had agreed to attend the talks with the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, 
Khieu Samphan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihanouk, who left Phnom Penh for Beijing on Wednesday to continue treatment 
for cancer, has suggested that the Khmer Rouge declare a unilateral cease-fire 
and open up their territory while a role for the party in the government is 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Khmer Rouge have rejected the suggestion.

BERLUSCONI WINS CONFIDENCE VOTE FROM SENATE; ITALY: DESPITE MISGIVINGS ABOUT 
NEO-FASCISTS IN HIS CABINET, THE UPPER CHAMBER HANDS HIM A KEY VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi narrowly won parliamentary approval Wednesday 
to launch a novel, untried right-wing government, despite widespread misgivings 
about the inclusion of neo-fascist ministers in his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days and 16 hours of often acerbic debate, the Senate gave the 
57-year-old Milan media mogul a vote of confidence Wednesday night. Berlusconi 
triumphed 159-153, picking up crucial last-minute votes to forge a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day of charged emotions, high tension and offstage thunder. As a 
violent storm lashed the city, lightning struck Parliament not long before the 
Senate convened. Once mounting votes signaled his victory, Berlusconi sneaked 
out of the Senate chamber for a few minutes to join most other Italians in 
watching television as his soccer team, Milan, won a big game, 4-0, against 
Barcelona in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative victory means that, only a few months after turning from 
business to politics, Berlusconi can now put into motion Italy's 53rd postwar 
government. It is the first to vigorously espouse private enterprise and 
free-market economics, and the first to include participation by heirs of 
fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing senators Wednesday, Berlusconi promised a vigorous legislative 
initiative to revitalize the Italian economy with tax relief, streamlined 
public administration and control of the public deficit. He reiterated his 
campaign promise to create 1 million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's relations with its West European partners and the United States loom 
large in the early stages of a Berlusconi administration that could last four 
years without a new election if he retains parliamentary support. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 2, President Clinton comes to Rome for ceremonies marking the 50th 
anniversary of World War II landings. In July, Clinton and leaders of the other 
Group of Seven industrialized nations return to Italy for a summit Berlusconi 
will host in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi told senators Wednesday that the coalition he had assembled was the 
only option for government. Failure to win parliamentary approval would mean 
new elections, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of Italians have established with their vote that . . . this 
coalition has the honor and burden of government," he told a Senate in which 
most of the 315 members, like himself, are political rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-made billionaire, Berlusconi jumped into politics earlier this year to 
head off what seemed at the time like certain victory in March elections by 
Italy's former Communists. Scandal had destroyed parties that dominated all 52 
postwar governments, fueling a historic voter revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning on a strongly anti-Communist platform with the unabashed backing 
of his three national television channels, Berlusconi assembled an electoral 
alliance with the federalist Northern League under Umberto Bossi and the 
National Alliance, a neo-fascist movement headed by Gianfranco Fini. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, renegade Christian Democrats joined the coalition, which 
has a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies, making a confidence vote there 
a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate in the lower house begins today and will parallel Senate discussion 
that underlined broad distrust with Berlusconi's neo-fascist allies. 
</P>
<P>
 A demonstration by 200 young Nazis in the northern town of Vicenza on Sunday 
received big headlines. Italy's partners in the European Union are outspokenly 
concerned, although the United States has expressed no alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi says he will have no truck with fascism. For his part, Fini is 
quick to distance himself from youthful extremists whose small but virulent 
demonstrations have brought controversy and dispute to a party he is seeking to 
pull away from the extreme right. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate debate Wednesday mirrored the alarm many Italians feel at any possible 
return of the kind of authoritarian regime that made the trains run on time 
from 1922 to 1945 at great cost to personal and national freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are facing not a renewal, but a return of fascists who are still heirs of 
a dictatorship that brought the country to war. . . . They are trying to show 
they are different but can't succeed however hard they try," Sen. Antonino 
Cuffaro charged Wednesday in announcing that Communist Refoundation, an 
assertively Marxist party, would join former Communists and centrists in voting 
against Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini, 42, a polished and well-spoken political veteran, says his movement is 
"post-fascist" and has proved its democratic credentials over the past four 
decades. Fini studiously avoids any contact with extreme right-wing movements 
elsewhere in Europe, and by comparison, his rhetoric and policies are moderate. 
But he has also said that he considers Mussolini the century's greatest 
statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible for me to vote for a government in which there are ministers 
who have not repudiated fascism," said Leo Valiani, an 85-year-old resistance 
hero who is one of Italy's nine life senators. He spent six years in a 
Mussolini jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Five ministers of Berlusconi's Cabinet are members of the National Alliance 
that Fini forged to participate in the March election; three of those five are 
also members of the Italian Social Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The MSI, as the party is known, was founded in 1946 as the lineal descendant 
of Mussolini's Fascist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the constitution of the Italian republic banned the 
Fascist Party, forcing Mussolini's heirs to find a new name. 
</P>
<P>
 In every legislature since 1972, as a matter of principle, the MSI has 
automatically submitted an outsider's wish list of laws: One would rescind the 
constitutional prohibition against the formation of a Fascist Party by that 
name, another would lift a ban on the return to Italy of any member of the 
country's royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 With neo-fascists in government for the first time, the two proposals were 
supposed to have been held back this year, but were mistakenly filed April 26, 
MSI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An embarrassed Fini ordered them withdrawn.

MORE LAWMAKERS BACKING CHINA ON TRADE; COMMERCE: SUPPORT IS GROWING IN CONGRESS 
FOR SEPARATING HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS FROM BEIJING'S LOW TARIFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley declared his support Wednesday for severing the 
link between China's questionable human rights record and its U.S. trade 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Democrat's announcement came a day after 106 other House 
members, Republicans and Democrats, urged President Clinton in a letter to 
renew China's most-favored-nation trade status without conditions and set up a 
new, bilateral commission to confront human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the actions are further evidence of the growing support in 
Congress for extending the benefits and separating them from China's progress 
on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 They also indicate the extent to which pragmatic concerns for the health of 
the U.S. economy are taking precedent over human rights considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton -- who at one time was a staunch supporter of linking 
China's special trade status to progress on human rights -- is expected by June 
3 to make his recommendation on whether to extend China's trade benefits, with 
or without conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 That recommendation will be based on his review of Beijing's human rights 
performance in seven key areas. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have indicated that the President, under heavy pressure 
from wary U.S. businesses, is likely to continue the special trade status in 
some form. But he is said to be considering some kinds of sanctions to force 
human rights concessions from China. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, returning from a Middle East trip, 
planned to present the President with four options this weekend, in hopes of 
producing a decision sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The most-favored status allows countries to enjoy the same low tariffs as most 
U.S. trading partners on goods they export to the United States -- a privilege 
that China has enjoyed since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Chinese regime crushed a pro-democracy movement in a bloody 
confrontation at Tian An Men Square in 1989, Congress passed legislation 
canceling the status. Former President George Bush successfully vetoed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after Clinton became President, Congress extended the trade 
benefits for a year on condition that China improve its human rights 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, economic concerns about the $8.8 billion worth of U.S. 
exports to China have been given more consideration in the debate than 
traditional concerns over repression by China's aging Communist hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 A pivotal congressional figure in the debate, Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), is preparing legislation to place some sanctions on China if 
most-favored status is retained. 
</P>
<P>
 A passionate advocate for human rights in formation of U.S. foreign policy, 
Mitchell said he believes that the Chinese have failed to meet all the 
President's requirements on human rights progress outlined in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing continues to imprison political dissidents, for example, and has 
failed to change its repressive policy toward Tibet or to halt its jamming of 
Voice of America radio broadcasts. It has only recently agreed to discuss the 
VOA broadcasts and has freed some political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley -- who outlined his position to reporters at a news conference -- said 
the withdrawal of trade benefits for China would be self-defeating in advancing 
human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only would we have a trade disruption . . . but the very reason for 
withdrawing it, which would be dissatisfaction with China's human rights 
record, would make us less influential, not more influential, with the Chinese 
on that subject," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter to Clinton was signed by leading figures such as Rep. Lee H. 
Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and the 
two top House Republicans, Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois and 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas has taken a similar position.

N. KOREA SAID TO BE AMASSING NUCLEAR FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of international inspectors determined Wednesday that North Korea has 
begun withdrawing spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor in defiance of 
repeated warnings not to do so by the United Nations and the United States, 
according to U.S. and diplomatic sources. 
</P>
<P>
 During its first full day of inspections at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear 
complex, the three-member U.N. team found unspecified evidence that the fuel 
withdrawal was under way, and relayed the information to senior officials of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western governments and intelligence agencies believe that North Korea 
used other fuel rods, withdrawn from the reactor in 1989, to make one or two 
nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has denied this, but its refusal to work out an inspection deal 
has provoked concerns that the country may be attempting to build more weapons.

<P>
 At least eight lawyers were arrested Wednesday and accused of instigating a 
clash with police over the death of a colleague in police custody, the Interior 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the arrested attorneys were among Egypt's leading defenders of 
suspected Islamic extremists. Four have represented Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, a 
blind Egyptian cleric jailed in the United States on federal charges involving 
a plot to bomb the World Trade Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The clash occurred Tuesday when about 400 lawyers tried to march from downtown 
Cairo to the palace of President Hosni Mubarak.

PALESTINIANS WORRY ABOUT BLUEPRINT FOR LIVING; MIDEAST: ARAFAT HAS SENT FAXES 
ON MINOR CHANGES SUCH AS WORKING HOURS. BUT GUIDELINES ON HOW TO RUN A 
GOVERNMENT ARE NONEXISTENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first message from Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and head of the new Palestinian government here, was reassuring -- 
all 11,200 Palestinians employed by the Gaza Strip's civil administration will 
keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The second message, also faxed from PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, left 
Mohammed Abdul Aziz, acting head of the Gaza administration, bemused: He and 
other senior officials, who had all worked through the long Israeli occupation, 
had been appointed colonels in the Palestine Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The third and fourth messages from Arafat changed the government's working 
hours, shortening them but adding Saturday to the workweek to eliminate the 
Jewish Sabbath as a day off. 
</P>
<P>
 But after that -- nothing. No broad policy guidelines, no 100-day plan, no 
list of senior officials and, of most concern to Abdul Aziz, no information on 
how he is to meet the administration's $3.3-million monthly payroll and other 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will work out," said Dr. Zakaria Agha, one of 18 members of the 
provisional council that will govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho prior to elections. "Step by step, we are assuming power, and step by 
step we will put things in order after 27 years of Israeli occupation. Our 
first job is to make life easier for our people." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is a sense among many Palestinians, including leaders here and in 
the West Bank, that the PLO will be tested hard as much by the problems of 
day-to-day administration as by the challenge of establishing a democratic 
government among a people who have never governed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no plan," said Tawfik Mabhouh, a leader of the pro-Communist 
Palestine People's Party. "Tunis has no blueprint, no scenario, no timetable. 
All the decisions are ad hoc, and most deal with minutiae. . . . I suppose the 
PLO thought this day would never come, though it has been clear for months that 
it would eventually, and so it saw little need for concrete planning. This has 
meant a very slow start to autonomy. When their jubilation quiets down, people 
will ask what comes next." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Aziz, a 31-year veteran of the Gaza administration, said he and his 
workers will carry on, as they have under the Israelis, running hospitals and 
schools, issuing driver's licenses and marriage certificates, collecting taxes 
and taking care, as best they can with very limited money, of the local 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The civil administration is, and always has been, Palestinian at its core -- 
working for the Palestinian people of Gaza," Abdul Aziz said. "Before, under 
the Israelis, we did whatever we could to help our people. Now, under this new 
Palestinian Authority, I am sure we will be free to do much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike at Gaza's military bases and police stations, which Israeli forces 
stripped before leaving them to Palestinian police, Israel left behind a 
sophisticated $1-million computer system with meticulous files documenting all 
aspects of life among Gaza's 850,000 people for the past 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impoverished Gaza Strip is an infrastructure nightmare. Its streets 
are piled with garbage, and they wind for miles through the squalor of more 
than half a dozen refugee camps. The municipal water system is dangerously 
saline. Forty percent to 50% of the work force is unemployed. And, after 
decades of occupation -- by Britain, then Egypt and finally Israel -- there is 
no tradition of local government as there is in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Zakout, a PLO negotiator, said the new Palestinian Authority will keep 
current government structures -- a bureaucracy of 38 departments -- intact for 
now but plans to overhaul them to make them more responsive to people's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obliged to begin from zero, but we do not want to always be like 
this," Zakout said. "The PLO has ordered all employees and directors to 
continue their jobs, but when the national authority comes, it will fix a new 
structure. What was appropriate for an occupation is not appropriate in 
self-government." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no date for the new 25-member Palestinian council to begin 
operations, and not all the members have been named. At the administration's 
main office, employees are so unsure of the changes in the days ahead that they 
have closed the gates until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The 700 Israelis who administered Gaza -- in actuality, the military 
government for the region -- were largely in supervisory and policy-making 
posts; Palestinian administrators, engineers, physicians, educators, clerks and 
other employees made up most of the civil service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is complex and complicated, but all in all what you need is experience to 
get on top of all the issues," Brig. Gen. Dov Gazit, the outgoing Israeli head 
of the civil administration, said this week as he turned over control to the 
Palestinian Authority. "There will be difficulties. There must be difficulties. 
But there is a big difference between daily difficulties, even big ones, and 
chaos. I do not expect chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel withdrew the last of its troops from Arab population areas in Gaza 
early Wednesday under its agreement with the PLO on limited Palestinian 
self-government. Last Friday, it completed its pullout from Jericho, the other 
autonomous area. Israeli troops will remain stationed around Jewish settlements 
in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace Israeli administrators in Gaza and Jericho, the PLO plans to send 
in 1,000 of its people from Tunis and other centers, in addition to the 7,000 
officers it is bringing in this month for its security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transfer of authority is more difficult than most people suppose -- it's 
not simply a matter of taking over an office and putting your own men in," said 
Jamil Tarifi, former mayor of the West Bank town of Al Birah, who negotiated 
the transfer of civilian functions on behalf of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite faxed orders from Tunis, a power vacuum is already developing because 
Agha, and Arafat's other appointees, lack real authority and must refer all 
issues, big and small, to PLO headquarters in Tunis. There, Arafat attempts to 
micromanage everything and largely ignores the extensive planning done by West 
Bank and Gaza residents for Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them 'mailmen' because all they do is take the problem back to 
Tunis," Mabhouh said of Arafat appointees. "Yes, our bureaucrats can run the 
civil administration from one day to the next, but they have no policy 
framework. Beyond that, there is a question of legitimacy that only elections 
can answer. So now we are in the transition, hoping for elections later this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Those elections appear likely to be contested fiercely. Fatah, Arafat's own 
group within the PLO, is divided into 11 factions in Gaza and two more in 
Jericho. Other PLO groups will field candidates; the fundamentalist Islamic 
movement Hamas also appears likely to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we have to send faxes to Tunis and wait for Arafat's answer, but in the 
future authority will be here," said Tawfik abu Khousa, a leader of the Fatah 
Hawks militia in Gaza and a Fatah dissident. "We are against the appointment of 
people from outside. The PLO's thinking is a top-down pyramid, but people here 
believe that authority flows from them."

RIVALS WAGE FIERCE FIGHT FOR BASE HELD BY SOUTH IN YEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fierce artillery, tank and rocket battles raged Wednesday around a key 
military base here that is the last major obstacle in the north's advance 
toward the southern stronghold of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting around the Al Anad base, 35 miles northwest of Aden, has gone on for 
days in what could be the decisive battle of Yemen's two-week civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize in the seesaw battle is control of the country's main north-south 
road and the gateway to Aden, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting broke out May 5 after months of small-scale skirmishes between 
the rival leaderships of the former North and South Yemen, which merged in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern-controlled Sana radio appealed Wednesday to the estimated 250,000 
people living in Aden to declare their loyalty to the north under President Ali 
Abdullah Saleh. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last chance for those who are misled by the forces of apostasy 
and secession to join the ranks of their brothers," the broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern command said its forces had crushed an attempt to capture Al Anad 
and routed a northern brigade 30 miles east of Aden. It said 400 northern 
soldiers were killed but did not mention its own casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern forces said they had captured Al Anad on Monday, but their commanders 
told reporters Wednesday that a sprawling air base south of the main Al Anad 
complex was still in southern hands.

 People beheaded black roosters and drivers tooted horns Wednesday to celebrate 
early vote returns that showed Africa's longest-ruling dictator heading for 
defeat in Malawi's first multi-party election. 
</P>
<P>
 President H. Kamuzu Banda, who has ruled since independence from Britain in 
1964, was far behind a former ally, Bakili Muluzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Small groups of Muluzi's supporters danced joyously holding headless black 
roosters the symbol of Banda's ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 A source at state-run Malawi Broadcasting Corp., which stopped reporting 
results, said the latest unofficial returns gave Muluzi about 900,000 votes. 
Labor leader Chakufwa Chihana, a onetime political prisoner, had 400,000, and 
Banda had 350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3.7 million people in this southeast African nation were eligible to 
vote in the election, which was forced by growing domestic unrest and pressure 
from Western aid donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The election had been expected to end Banda's reign and put the nation, one of 
the world's poorest, on the road to recovery.

ENEMIES NEGOTIATE U.N. CONTROL OF RWANDA AIRPORT 
</P>

<P>
 Rwanda's warring sides met in delicate negotiations Wednesday to give U.N. 
troops full control of the capital's airport, the lifeline for the embattled 
city and the staging point for 5,500 new peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials want rebel and government troops to withdraw all weapons at 
least 1 1/4 miles from Kigali airport. That would force the army to abandon its 
heavily defended Kanombe camp, which rebels have been attacking, and force the 
rebels to give up strategic positions. 
</P>
<P>
 A lull in fighting around the capital recently allowed aid workers to rush 
relief supplies to about 15,000 people living under U.N. protection in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. spokesman Abdul Kabia in Kigali said the situation is growing 
steadily worse in areas where refugees have sought protection. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many are sick with malaria and dysentery, and the United Nations and 
relief groups cannot provide adequate care. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabia said both sides have agreed to give the United Nations full control of 
the airport. Cooperation from both sides is a key element in U.N. plans to 
reinforce its peacekeeping force with 5,500 new troops and to set up safe areas 
for civilians in the city and countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council authorized the new, all-African force for Rwanda on 
Tuesday, but Kabia said it was not known when the first troops will arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris on Wednesday, Bernard Kouchner, former French humanitarian action 
minister, described the horror of beheaded children in Kigali and urged the 
United Nations to set up a rapid action force. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk all over children's bodies. You find in the grass heads of children 
aged 6, 8, 2, beheaded with machetes," Kouchner told French television after 
returning from Rwanda. "What we want is a United Nations rapid action force in 
order to prevent massacres from occurring rather than go in later and deplore 
them -- firemen prior to the blaze." 
</P>
<P>
 Kouchner said the massacres were not ethnic fighting but a genocide carried 
out by the majority Hutu government against the Tutsi minority and its Hutu 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings began April 6, after the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both 
Hutus, were killed in a mysterious plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 All the figures about Rwandan dead are estimates. Nobody has tried to count 
the dead piled up on city streets, hidden in the countryside, buried in mass 
graves or dumped by the tens of thousands into rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters Wednesday in Bonn that 
information gathered by Europeans indicated that about 500,000 people have been 
killed, a figure cited by some aid workers.

'WE ARE KILLING THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGGS'; WATERWAYS: SCALLOPS, 
OYSTERS AND THICK RIBBONS OF EELGRASS HAVE VANISHED FROM DELAWARE'S INLAND 
BAYS. THE FISHING TRADE AND TOURISTS FEEL THE CRIPPLING EFFECTS.

 As a little girl, Til Purnell swam in the crystalline bay waters here, 
scooping up soft-shell crabs, oysters and clams for dinner. She could see her 
toes wriggle on the sandy bottom and watch the fish brush by her ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before poultry became big business in Sussex County, bringing in 
83 million chickens. Before the summer crowds arrived with their roaring Jet 
Skis. Before the hot-dog joints and T-shirt shops popped up along the 
boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 And before Delaware's Inland Bays started to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when Purnell wades at her waterfront home in Millsboro, her feet look as 
if they are lost in a sea of chocolate milk. Old-timers complain of this so 
often that people joke about the crazy old folks of Sussex County who can't 
seem to find their own feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who grew up in this area either swam in the Inland Bays or fished 
there as a child, and they have strong memories they're trying to hold on to," 
said Paul Petrichenko, a federal soils expert who works with farmers to control 
runoff into the bays. "What people say is they want to be able to see their 
feet again." 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the sick estuary illustrates why, from Santa Monica Bay to Cape 
Cod, nutrients that clog coastal bays pose such an intractable problem. The 
circumstances are nearly always identical: A growing community watches its 
cherished swimming and fishing holes turn into cesspools. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sussex County, chicken farmers blame retirees, retirees blame tourists and 
tourists blame farmers. They all are right -- everyone shares the blame. The 
Inland Bays, a trio of shallow estuaries where streams meet the sea, are a big 
nutrient trap -- the depository for everything flowing off streets and farms 
over 300 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bays are under siege by nutrients from all directions -- air, land, 
underground -- at a rate of 6,700 pounds per day in 1990. Nitrates and 
phosphates are 10 to 20 times greater than under natural conditions and the 
bays are too shallow to handle the load, said Kent Price, a marine biologist at 
the University of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of nutrients, it is highly likely this is one of the most enriched 
estuaries in the United States," said Price, who heads an Inland Bays 
scientific advisory team. "We all contribute to the problem in some way -- by 
flushing our toilets, by watering our lawns, by driving our cars." 
</P>
<P>
 For residents of such a sparsely populated state -- Delaware has fewer people 
than San Francisco -- it is a matter of fouling their own nest. Unlike the 
Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes that cross state boundaries, the Inland Bays 
are Delaware's own, and their decline is a subject of deep embarrassment as 
well as intense political debate and economic worries. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of World War II, Purnell and her husband, Lewis, bought 20 acres on 
Herring Creek -- one of the bays' biggest tributaries -- then spent 30 years in 
the foreign service. 
</P>
<P>
 When they retired in 1976, they were horrified. "I saw huge, enormous, 
disastrous changes," said Til Purnell, now known for her feisty efforts to 
revive the bays. "I almost burst into tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the scallops, oysters and thick ribbons of eelgrass where crabs and 
other fish nurse have vanished. Longtime residents such as Crabbin' Jim Murray, 
who owns a bait shop, and Milton Cooper, who worked 22 years for the Coast 
Guard, say that once-plentiful striped bass, white perch and winter flounder 
are almost gone. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the area's shellfish beds are off limits to harvesting because of 
bacteria. Blue crabs and hard-shell clams are about the only local shellfish 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is more than childhood memories of fish fries. Delaware has a 
$950-million annual tourist and recreation trade, mostly at the bays. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round, only about 50,000 residents live within the bays' watershed, but 
in the summer the population quadruples with urbanites plunking down $1,200 a 
week to rent waterfront homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs," Purnell said, "and it's 
so stupid I can't stand it." 
</P>
<P>
 This stretch of Atlantic coast is not industrial; in fact, Delaware's 
shoreline can have no major factories under a 1972 state law. Sussex County 
essentially remains rural, with slim grain silos, pastel dogwood trees and 
weathered, milk-white farm houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The poultry industry, which spreads 520 million pounds of manure a year on the 
ground in the bays' watershed, is considered the largest source of nutrients. A 
Rehoboth Beach waste-water treatment plant, household septic tanks and boats 
exacerbate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a cleanup plan seeking to alter the widespread practices 
affecting the bays emerged from a task force of residents, farmers, government 
officials and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The waterfront homeowners -- mostly senior citizens in modest mobile homes -- 
are not eager to convert their septic systems to expensive sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The chicken farmers, however, are slowly solving their manure disposal problem 
under new federal and state programs. For decades, they spread tons of manure 
on their crops or stored it in six-foot mounds on the ground. In the 1980s, 
they also began nourishing their fields with liquid nitrogen, which moves 
rapidly through creeks and sandy soils. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrichenko, of the Soil Conservation Service, said 40 of the area's 300 
farmers have built $12,000 sheds to shield manure piles from rain. Farmers also 
are building composters for chicken carcasses, learning to spread manure just 
before planting instead of letting it lie in fields all winter and using 
lighter formulas for liquid nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 But farm traditions die hard. Even if every ounce of new manure was 
controlled, the bays would keep degrading from the tons already seeped into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall trend," Petrichenko said, "is from real bad to better."

CONGRESSMAN DECIDES TO RUN, AND HELP RECOVER HIS STOLEN CAR

 A California congressman says he helped police catch a man who allegedly stole 
his car while it was parked two blocks from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time in four years someone has stolen our car in 
Washington," said Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands)."Both of them were at least 10 
years old and were hardly worth the effort. Still, no one's going to steal my 
car without a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lewis and his wife returned from dinner about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, they 
found a man sitting in their 1984 Oldsmobile at 2nd Street and Pennsylvania 
Avenue in southeast Washington with the motor running, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man drove off, and Lewis said he ran after the car down the middle of 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A District of Columbia police officer patrolling the area in his cruiser 
noticed Lewis, called for backup and joined the pursuit. The man in the car 
crashed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry M. Powers, 42, of Wallace, N.C., was arrested and charged with 
first-degree theft.

KENNEDYS VISIT ONASSIS AFTER CANCER SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis gathered at her bedside Wednesday 
night after the former First Lady suffered serious complications in her fight 
against cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis, who had been admitted to New York Hospital on Monday "as a result of 
serious complications of her malignant lymphoma," was discharged "in accordance 
with the patient's clearly expressed wishes and with the concurrence of her 
physicians," the hospital said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Her somber brother-in-law, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), and his wife, 
Victoria, traveled from Washington to be with her and afterward the senator 
told reporters, "I think all members of the family are distressed by the 
medical reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love Jackie. All the members of the family love her very deeply," Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said Onassis' children -- John F. Kennedy Jr. and Caroline Kennedy 
Schlossberg -- were at her bedside. Both live in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old widow of President John F. Kennedy has been undergoing 
chemotherapy since January, when she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 
which affects the lymphatic system. 
</P>
<P>
 "While in the hospital, she received further diagnostic evaluation and 
treatment," the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the hospital denied a published report that Onassis had taken a 
serious turn for the worse, saying her prognosis was excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seems to be going as the doctors planned and as scheduled," a 
hospital spokesman said in the earlier update. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Onassis had been admitted Monday for "routine treatment dictated by 
her condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis's admission was her third since January. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent six days in the hospital last month recovering from emergency 
surgery for a bleeding ulcer, believed to have been caused by the chemotherapy.

CLINTON SIGNS EXPANSION BILL FOR HEAD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With dozens of children looking on, President Clinton signed legislation 
Wednesday to open the doors of Head Start to thousands more preschoolers and 
some of the country's most vulnerable infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a White House ceremony timed to mark Head Start's 29th anniversary, Clinton 
said the law begins to move the popular preschool program into the next century 
with quality improvements, new services for infants and toddlers, and more 
full-day and year-round programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the legislation also seeks to preserve the "richness and the 
vision and the hope and the self-esteem" that children gain from the program 
when they leave Head Start, so they can "hold it close and live by it and gain 
from it throughout their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation is based on the recommendations of an advisory board, which 
"provides a road map for Head Start's journey into the next century," said 
Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services. It allows Head Start 
to operate through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Head Start provides a wide range of services to poor preschool children, 
including child development, parent involvement, health and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is pressing Congress to boost Head Start's budget 
from $3.3 billion this year to $4 billion in fiscal 1995, which would allow its 
enrollment to grow from 750,000 children to as many as 840,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, the General Accounting Office released a report that 
underscored the challenges Head Start faces at a time when growing numbers of 
children are living in poverty, without health care and in single-parent 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the congressional watchdog agency said the number of children 
under age 5 who will have trouble in school rose significantly during the past 
decade, while programs to help them failed to expand nearly as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 It said Head Start has too few qualified staff to meet the needs of children 
with complex personal and family problems and must cope with rising costs and 
limited community resources.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS STUDY OF PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY; LAW: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS 
ASKED IF CHIEF EXECUTIVE CAN BE SUED FOR ACTS THAT ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE BEFORE 
HE WAS ELECTED. PROBE IS LINKED TO HARASSMENT SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House, hoping to defuse a sex-harassment lawsuit against President 
Clinton, has asked for a Justice Department opinion on whether a sitting 
President can be sued for acts that allegedly took place before he was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue goes to the heart of Clinton's defense against charges by Paula 
Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who filed a complaint May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's attorneys, led by Robert S. Bennett, have signaled that they 
will argue as their first line of defense that allowing such suits would open 
the doors to legal maneuvering that could tie up the chief executive so 
seriously as to prevent him carrying out his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that a President cannot be sued for official 
acts that took place during his tenure. But the courts have never addressed the 
issue of lawsuits filed against a sitting President involving actions allegedly 
occurring before he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' suit apparently marks the first time that a sitting President has been 
sued over something that took place before his presidency began. But many 
lawyers say they believe that, given the litigious habits of Americans, it will 
not be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones claims in the suit that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance at a 
Little Rock, Ark., hotel on May 8, 1991, while he was governor of Arkansas. She 
seeks $700,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 If the defense plea is unsuccessful, the plaintiffs could embark on a lengthy 
discovery process that could bring out a wide range of witnesses whose 
testimony, even if legally dubious, could be politically damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The request to the Justice Department means that the agency's lawyers 
essentially will be doing legal research for the President, at no cost to him. 
But Administration officials defended the request, saying that the public 
expense is justified because the opinion could benefit future presidents as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 They said lawyers in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel would 
research only the immunity question and not consider the facts of the Jones 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is done in connection with the institutional role of the President and 
the needs and the history of the office," said Carl Stern, the chief Justice 
Department spokesman. "The White House did not ask the Justice Department to do 
personal lawyering for Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said the expense is 
appropriate. "He is the President of the United States," she said. "Everything 
that happens to him affects his capacity as President of United States, 
regardless." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House's request was made several days ago. White House Counsel Lloyd 
N. Cutler asked Walter Dellinger, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel, for 
the legal research. 
</P>
<P>
 If the courts bar such a complaint now, Jones will still have the option of 
filing her suit after Clinton leaves office.

GOP PUMMELS KENNEDY HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSAL; CONGRESS: REPUBLICANS ON 
SENATE PANEL BLAST BILL AS A PLAN FOR SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. MEASURE CONTAINS KEY 
PARTS OF CLINTON'S AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Republicans unleashed a furious assault Wednesday on a health care 
reform bill crafted by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that is patterned 
closely after President Clinton's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with more than 91 amendments that would virtually dismantle the bill, 
all but one Republican member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee 
contended that Kennedy's proposals would lead to a massive federal intrusion 
into the nation's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) called Kennedy's measure "a pasteurized version 
of the Clinton health plan for socialized medicine." And Sen. Nancy Landon 
Kassebaum (R-Kan.), the ranking GOP member of the panel, characterized it as "a 
casserole made from the leftovers of the previous evening's meal -- the 
ingredients are mixed up differently, but they are still all the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, the committee chairman, had drafted the legislation with the help of 
the White House and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) in hopes 
of overcoming some Republican concerns about the direction of Clinton's health 
care reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had hoped that his panel might be able to take control of the health 
care reform debate by being the first -- and perhaps only -- committee to vote 
on a bill before the Administration's Memorial Day deadline. Five congressional 
committees have some jurisdiction over health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Labor and Human Resources Committee's 10 Democrats -- along with one 
Republican supporter, Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont -- can out-vote the six 
other Republicans, Kennedy had hoped for other GOP converts who could be 
counted on for support later in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acrimonious tone of the day's debate indicated the difficulty he faces 
in winning over the Republicans. The session convened at 8 a.m. but quickly 
became mired in florid rhetoric and the committee adjourned without taking any 
votes. It will resume deliberations today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy contended that he is not discouraged by the withering GOP attack. Yet 
at one point, he turned to Republicans with a rueful smile and said with 
obvious understatement: "We might have some difficulty persuading some of you 
folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffords was the only Republican who had positive words for Kennedy's bill, 
calling it "a good start" and saying that its "central features must be 
retained." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill contains the key principles of the President's agenda, including the 
controversial employer mandate, albeit in a scaled-back fashion. The mandate, 
which would require employers to pay at least part of their employees' health 
premiums, is designed to achieve the President's goal of health care coverage 
for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy would cap a firm's overall liability at 12% of payroll and an 
individual's contributions at 3.9% of income. He would also exempt businesses 
employing five workers or less, although they would be required to make a 
2%-of-payroll contribution to a pool to help subsidize coverage of the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 His bill also would eliminate the mandatory insurance-purchasing alliances 
that Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more promising development for the Clinton Administration, Sen. John B. 
Breaux (D-La.) signaled to Democratic colleagues at a luncheon Tuesday that he 
might be willing to reconsider his opposition to the employer mandate. Breaux, 
a member of the Senate Finance Committee, has co-sponsored a bill written by 
Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) that excludes the provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux also produced a document outlining some compromises that he said could 
make the mandate less onerous to small businesses -- largely by exempting the 
smallest firms, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux suggested that firms with 10 or fewer employers might be exempted, 
while companies with 10 to 20 employees might be permitted to choose either to 
provide insurance or pay an "assessment." That fee could be set at 1% of 
payroll for firms with 11 to 15 workers and 2% for firms with 16 to 20 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers with between 21 and 1,000 workers would be subject only to the 
mandate, while those with 1,000 or more employees would be subject to both the 
employer mandate and the 1% tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "This potentially breaks the logjam in the Senate Finance Committee," said one 
congressional analyst. "This could get the employer mandate out of that 
committee. It's not a done deal, but it's a cracking of the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 On the House side, the Ways and Means Committee also began meeting Wednesday 
to debate health care reform, but it is not expected to begin voting on the 
particulars until after Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), like Kennedy, expressed hope of bipartisan 
action on health care reform.

OFFICIALS GET GUN TIED TO HUEY LONG SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gun some people believe was used to kill Huey Long was turned over 
Wednesday to the Louisiana State Police, which lost possession of it more than 
half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three years, the Browning 7.65-millimeter automatic has been the 
subject of a court fight over its ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Most historians believe that Dr. Carl A. Weiss pulled the gun and shot Long in 
the state Capitol on Sept. 8, 1935. Long's bodyguards killed Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Some historians claim Long was killed by a bodyguard's errant shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged assassin's son, Carl A. Weiss Jr., claimed ownership of the gun 
and eventually won. His attorney gave the gun to state police Wednesday as a 
donation valued for tax purposes at $265,000.

SURVEY FINDS LESS PUBLIC INTEREST IN RECENT NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American public seems less interested than usual in the news lately and 
has failed to absorb even basic facts of many recent stories, a Times Mirror 
survey released today has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Americans know that Nelson Mandela was elected president in 
South Africa, only 39% know that the stock market has been in decline in recent 
months. Only 22% can identify Vincent Foster, the White House aide who 
committed suicide last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are a few of the results of the Times Mirror News Interest Index, a 
continuing study of public response to the news. The study is sponsored by 
Times Mirror, the parent company of the Los Angeles Times and owner of other 
newspaper and communications companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent charges of sexual misconduct involving President Clinton also have 
not riveted the public, the poll found. Only 15% of those polled said they are 
paying very close attention to the lawsuit by former Arkansas state employee 
Paula Corbin Jones, who alleges that Clinton sexually harassed her while he was 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 And a majority of those polled, 54% to 23%, said Clinton is far more 
believable than Jones. The poll also found that Clinton's approval rating 
stands at 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Washington scandals generally do not generate wide fascination, even 
by these standards the Jones story is not registering. Nearly twice as many 
people, for instance, said they very closely followed charges that former 
President George Bush's chief of staff misused military airplanes for personal 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 The press did not fare well in the survey. Only 53% of those questioned said 
they think the press is being fair to the President, 15 to 30 percentage points 
lower than the rating given the press during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, which surveyed 1,206 adults between May 12 and 15, has a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, and the results could be subject to 
further error because of the wording of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Americans are oblivious to most major foreign events, the poll 
suggests. Only 33% know that the leading presidential candidate in Mexico was 
recently assassinated, and 29% know that the slaughter in Rwanda has reached 
hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one in five of those polled said they know that North Korea again has 
raised the specter of nuclear war by threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, and about the same number know that the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization has used air strikes against the Serbs in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other recent stories dominating the news, none won "very close" 
attention of even 40% of the public. Most months, at least the top one or two 
stories attract at least that level of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six percent of those polled said they paid very close attention to the 
death and funeral of former President Richard Nixon, the same percentage that 
paid such attention to the congressional ban on assault weapons. Thirty-seven 
percent said they were paying very close attention to news about health care 
reform.

CLINTON ORDERS DRAFT SYSTEM TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Wednesday ordered continuation of draft registration, 
rejecting a Pentagon conclusion that ending the process would pose no risk to 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he followed the recommendation of his National Security Council 
in deciding it was essential to continue registration and the Selective Service 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 "While tangible military requirements alone do not currently make a mass 
call-up of American young men likely, there are three reasons I believe we 
should maintain both the SSS and the draft registration requirement," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
 His reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Draft registration serves as "a hedge against unforeseen threats and is a 
relatively low-cost 'insurance policy' against our underestimating the maximum 
level of threat we expect our armed forces to face." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ending registration now "could send the wrong signal to our potential 
enemies who are watching for signs of U.S. resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 * As fewer people in the general population have direct experience with the 
armed forces and military life it is important "to maintain the link between 
the all-volunteer force and the society at-large." 
</P>
<P>
 "The armed forces must also know that the general population stands behind 
them, committed to serve, should the preservation of our national security so 
require," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton urged Congress to support his Administration's request for $23 million 
for the Selective Service System for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon concluded in a report to Congress in early March that 
reinstatement of an actual draft is highly unlikely. "Consequently, peacetime 
draft registration could be suspended without irreparable damage to national 
security," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon stopped short of recommending an end to the Selective Service 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 But it said suspending peacetime registration could be accomplished with "no 
effect on military mobilization requirements, little effect on the time it 
would take to mobilize and no measurable effect on military recruitment."

WORLD TRADE PACT BACKERS, FOES LOBBY CALIFORNIANS IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the new world trade agreement facing unexpectedly difficult hurdles in 
Congress, advocates on both sides are making the California congressional 
delegation the focal point of intense lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that the Administration wants the trade accord approved this year, 
the White House dispatched a group of top officials Wednesday to meet with 
members of the state delegation. Among other things, the Administration 
addressed fears that the accord will take a back seat to redesigning the 
nation's health care system, which is clearly President Clinton's top priority 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be no delay," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said. 
"The President has made that clear." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would slash tariffs -- the taxes imposed on imports -- by as 
much as one-third and write new rules governing the conduct of trade with the 
goal of opening up markets around the world. It would take effect July 1, 1995, 
or perhaps sooner, if it can clear the hurdle of gaining majority approval in 
the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the pact, including consumer advocate Ralph Nader, are trying to 
stir up concern in California and other states, arguing that rules and laws 
governing food safety, protection of workers and the environment will be 
overridden by the sometimes less stringent regulations of the new World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal of the agreement, which was negotiated over a seven-year period and was 
signed in Morocco in April, is to limit laws that have the effect of 
restricting international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you persist in pushing for congressional approval, you will put in place 
the mechanisms to allow federal food safety, motor vehicle safety, motor 
vehicle fuel efficiency and other laws to be challenged under the WTO regime," 
Nader said in a letter to Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), a senior member 
of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader said the new organization, which would replace the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, "will be an international autocratic system of governance 
that subordinates standards and policies -- such as health, safety, 
environmental and workplace conditions -- beneath the dictates of foreign trade 
imperatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Its rules, he said, "would place maximization of trade over all else, with our 
federal, state and local laws subject to challenge by foreign nations within 
secret, unaccountable panels operating from Geneva, Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Nader raised the possibility that the trade agreement would 
hamper enforcement of the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement 
Act, regulations restricting lead in ceramics and wine and specific tax and 
recycling measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui, a leading backer of the trade plan, said the new trade organization 
"does not affect sovereignty one bit" in the United States or California. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing such arguments as Nader's as specious, Matsui told reporters that 
the United States, as the largest member of the World Trade Organization, would 
be free to ignore its dictates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go our own way," he said. "The only sanction is we'd be kicked out of 
the WTO, and no one is going to kick us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Matsui said, the United States would be the most likely to use 
provisions of the new trade agreement to force open the markets of India and 
other developing nations that have a history of using local laws to block U.S. 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. budget regulations remain a major obstacle to the pact. According to 
estimates, tariff reductions under the accord will cost the U.S. Treasury $14 
billion to $18 billion over the first five years. 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. budget regulations are not waived, Congress must impose higher taxes 
or reduce spending so the trade plan will not increase the federal budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that the increased trade made possible under the pact will 
lead to greater tax collections. But budget regulations do not allow such 
income to be counted against the lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate international trade 
subcommittee, is expected to call today for the Administration and Congress to 
acknowledge that government will be unable politically to raise taxes or cut 
spending -- and to instead agree to waive the budget rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we get closer to the election, the waiver begins to look more attractive," 
Matsui acknowledged. But the Administration is opposed to the waiver, arguing 
that it would set a bad precedent, and plans to push for tax increases instead. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate meeting with reporters, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) said it would be "intellectually dishonest" to consider the trade plan 
as a revenue loser just because budget rules do not allow consideration of the 
anticipated income. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gingrich, whose support helped the Administration win approval last 
November of the North American Free Trade Agreement, said he opposes elements 
of the World Trade Organization plan that would give each nation one vote in 
its deliberations, regardless of size.

EMPRESS MICHIKO DELIVERS A SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese Empress Michiko, looking thinner but in good spirits, gave her first 
public address Wednesday, almost seven months after she was struck by a mystery 
malady that left her speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent practice run before a hectic U.S. tour next month, Empress 
Michiko gave a brief speech in Tokyo at the annual convention of the Japanese 
Red Cross Society, for which she serves as honorary president. 
</P>
<P>
 Empress Michiko fainted on her 59th birthday Oct. 20 and, upon regaining 
consciousness several hours later, was unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it was believed she had suffered a minor stroke, but palace 
officials said medical tests for a stroke were negative. They later attributed 
her mystery illness to "deep sorrow" after the publication of several magazine 
articles criticizing her as a dictator determined to take over palace 
management from courtiers.

POLICE INVESTIGATING FORGERY CASE FIND BODY BURIED IN MONTCLAIR YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police investigating a suspected check forgery case Wednesday found a corpse 
in a Montclair back yard and said it could be tied to the disappearance six 
months ago of a 68-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair police Lt. Kevin Piper said the decomposing body was found by 
detectives who were looking into suspicious checks that had been cashed in the 
name of John Sullivan, a Montclair man who lives in the 9800 block of Saratoga 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper said detectives found the house empty, but investigation prompted them 
to excavate the back yard, where they found the remains of a dog and a male 
corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's two adult sons also live in the house, Piper said. The 
investigation is continuing, he said.

SUPPORT GROWS FOR DELAYING BASE CLOSINGS; MILITARY: HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS 
WOULD PUSH BACK NEXT SPRING'S ROUND OF SHUTDOWNS FOR TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prospect of delaying -- or softening -- another punishing round of 
military base closings in California has suddenly gathered significant 
momentum, bolstered by a combination of legislative pressure, budgetary 
restraints and political pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous efforts to slow the process of shutting down excess Defense 
Department facilities have been swiftly defeated. But proponents have new hope 
and bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to push back next 
spring's round of closures -- expected to be the most ambitious yet -- for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, Defense Secretary William J. Perry last week issued a 
statement signaling his concern over the pace and cost of the base-closing 
process and expressed willingness to request additional rounds of closures to 
diffuse the impact on states and regions reeling from previous cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must proceed to close bases in order to save money," Perry said, " . . . 
(but) too much too soon jeopardizes our current program. . . . If closures 
beyond the amount we can responsibly accomplish in 1995 are required . . . we 
will seek authority for future rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's remarks reflect a growing consensus that a pause is needed in a 
process that has worked almost too efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, 70 major bases have been ordered closed -- 21 of them in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though we need to downsize our military in the aftermath of the Cold War, we 
need to slow down and catch our breath," Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said 
last week as she introduced a bill to delay the 1995 round of closings for two 
years. Feinstein offered similar legislation last year, but it was soundly 
defeated, 79-18. 
</P>
<P>
 Several forces are combining to make the prospects for a delay more promising 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With midterm elections looming in November, political pressures are building 
to offer some relief to states, such as California, that have suffered from 
massive closings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably would be very popular to delay," Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), 
chairman of a House armed services subcommittee overseeing base closings, said 
recently. "Any time we can delay pain, whether it's going to the dentist or 
cutting the budget, we will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 So obvious are the potential political benefits that top Clinton 
Administration officials are carefully avoiding any appearance of promoting the 
idea, preferring to let Perry take a lead role. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of delaying the next base-closing round point out that projected 
savings are less than Pentagon planners anticipated. According to a 1993 
General Accounting Office report on savings from previous base closings, 
revenues from land sales were "significantly less" and environmental cleanup 
costs were "substantially higher" than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also argue that the base-closing decisions are being driven too much 
by budget considerations and not enough by long-term military requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfair to subject many additional communities to the ravages of the 
base-closure process without more detailed analysis," said Rep. James V. Hansen 
(R-Utah), who is leading the fight in the House for delaying the 1995 round. 
His bill, identical to Feinstein's, has attracted about 30 co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 But strong arguments also are made against tinkering with the base-closing 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed the law in 1990 in full recognition of its inherent inability 
to put impartial base-closing decisions ahead of local political 
considerations. Under the law, an independent commission, beholden to no 
legislative district or party, makes the base-closing recommendations, and 
Congress can only approve or reject the entire list -- with no changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing political and economic considerations to affect the process would 
subvert the law's sound public policy foundation, some members of Congress say. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first concern was the manner in which (President Clinton) was politicizing 
something and was predicated on the notion that it would not be politicized," 
said Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas), a highly partisan Republican considered the 
father of the base-closing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey also predicted that members from districts that have already suffered 
from closings would strenuously object to minimizing the unpleasantness for 
other regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the strongest constituency for the law is the military itself. 
Defense budget cuts have reduced forces by about 30% since 1990, but the number 
of bases has dropped only about half as much. The uniformed military, hoping to 
free scarce funds for new weapons programs, opposes any delay in base closings. 
Military leaders want the process to go forward so they can afford to modernize 
their forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson strongly favors delaying the 1995 round because the impact of 
base closings has been so large in California. But for California House 
members, the issue is a delicate one. Only four members have co-sponsored the 
Hansen bill -- Reps. Randy (Duke) Cunningham (R-San Diego), Steve Horn (R-Long 
Beach), Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) and Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon). 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling in Congress, from members in a number of states, that we 
should put off the round to 1997," Horn said last week. "Personally, I think 
they're right. The money is not in the defense budget for the environmental 
cleanup of these bases (or) to implement the closure recommendations from the 
last two or three rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Naval Shipyard -- in Horn's district -- barely survived the 
1993 round and remains highly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) has not signed on to the Hansen bill, 
fearing that delaying base closures will force the Pentagon to cut back on 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to save the L.A. Air Force Base," said Harman, who sits 
on the Armed Services Committee, "but it is also important to fully fund a 
number of defense programs which impact L.A. County enormously. If you take 
some bases off the table, that throws (defense budget) calculations into 
chaos."

GHOST TOWN IN SIERRA GETS 1 1/2 FEET OF SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A storm swept across the Sierra on Wednesday, blanketing the historic ghost 
town of Bodie, Calif., with 1 1/2 feet of snow that piled up at a rate of one 
inch an hour. Accumulations of more than six inches were common elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The heaviest snow fell in the Mammoth Lakes area, where the storm was 
centered, but rain left 0.5 of an inch of moisture in McDermitt, on the Oregon 
border, and 0.4 of an inch in Tonopah. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow level dropped to around 5,000 feet in the central Sierra, with three 
to six inches common at the lower levels and five to 18 inches above 8,000 
feet. A snow advisory was in effect throughout Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8,300-foot Bodie, roads were inaccessible because of the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists on U.S. 395 through Alpine and Mono counties also were slowed by the 
snow. Caltrans reported five inches of snow on 8,036-foot Deadman's Pass just 
north of Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 South of Lake Tahoe, U.S. 50 picked up 1 1/2 inches of snow overnight on Echo 
Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 A thunderstorm produced rain and small hail in the Reno area, and Humboldt 
County got a little bit of everything.

MIKE PENNER: LACHEMANN'S WORD BETTER BE MUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our condolences today go out to Marcel Lachemann, the 14th and latest man to 
sign on as field manager for the Front Office That Can't Think Straight, and 
with them, a few words of friendly advice. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to keep your job longer than Buck Rodgers did, Lach, you better 
learn the following phrases, commit them to memory and spout them every so 
often -- say, oh, on the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat after me: 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have three pitchers in our starting rotation who were released by 
other teams. We have three pitchers in our starting rotation who were simply 
granted their independence. And darn it, isn't that exactly what this great 
country of ours was founded on?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Bavasi offered to make a waiver claim on a pitcher today, but I told 
him, 'Whoa, Mr. Bavasi, slow down. Please. (Remember: Always say please.) 
You've loaded this team with far too much talent already.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "You call her Mrs. Autry. I call her Mrs. Generosity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil Leftwich or Lefty Grove, I can't tell the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend, you must have misunderstood me. I never said Chris Turner might be 
better on the bench. I said Chris Turner might be better than Bench." 
</P>
<P>
 "J.T. Snow is my first baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 And, most importantly: 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Brown sure knows his baseball. What an eye for talent. Bryan Harvey, 
Jim Abbott, Dante Bichette, Devon White, Dave Winfield, Wally Joyner, Luis 
Polonia -- Mr. Brown and his general managers found good jobs for all of them 
all throughout the major leagues. And who else could have pioneered the 
revolutionary one-man, one-year system for general managers? The man's another 
Branch Rickey, I tell you. In fact, he should be our next commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 What else does Lachemann need to know? 
</P>
<P>
 That the First Amendment, something he may have heard about while coaching 
pitchers for his brother in Florida, does not apply out here. Free speech? Kiss 
it goodby. This is a totalitarian state, this vacuous lot on the corner of 
Katella and State College, where the act of speaking one's mind is a criminal 
offense, punishable by swift and inscrutable termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Got an opinion? 
</P>
<P>
 Better keep it to yourself. Rodgers didn't, and because he couldn't, he could 
be found standing in front of a podium at the Jolly Roger Inn Wednesday 
afternoon, shaking his head as he tried to understand why he was no longer 
managing the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 30 minutes, Rodgers took a few stabs at it, though. And along the 
way, might have uncovered a new strain of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its scientific name: Richardbrownanoma . 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers stumbled upon his discovery during a line of questioning that produced 
an almost comical process of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry began after Rodgers admitted to a "personality conflict" within 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "A personality conflict with whom?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "I don't know, I don't know. It wasn't Billy Bavasi. It wasn't Gene 
Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, it wasn't Jackie Autry." 
</P>
<P>
 Long pause. 
</P>
<P>
 A smattering of laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "Was it Rich Brown?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "I don't know. I'm not going to . . . All I know is that this 
situation with the California Angels has gone on a long time. And I know that 
Mike Port was let loose, Doug Rader was let loose, Dan O'Brien is not here any 
longer, Whitey Herzog is not here any longer. Um, I'm here no longer. But 
there's still some kind of cancer here with the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I know. I think that's very obvious to anybody who's been around 
this club for 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Port, Rader, O'Brien, Herzog, Rodgers -- all summarily dispatched during 
Brown's reign as Angel president. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers believed he had happened upon a common thread. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization isn't all bad," Rodgers said. "This organization is very 
salvageable. But there are some things that are not gonna happen. There's a 
certain amount of paranoia that has to get out of here. There's a fear of 
failure that has to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Paranoia? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers alluded to a conversation he had with Brown last week in which he said 
Brown accused Rodgers of stabbing him in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that I said he didn't know anything about baseball," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I believed that, I wouldn't say that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that if I believed that, I would say it to his face. And I didn't 
say it. I deny saying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers believed the conversation ended on a positive note -- "When I walked 
out of there, he said 'Fine,' and I said 'Fine,' -- but a few days later, all 
was not fine. Rodgers was gone, and firmly convinced that Brown was the one who 
pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers isn't the first former Angel employee sent out the door muttering 
about Brown. Privately, Port and Rader made similar complaints after their 
dismissals, and after Port was fired, Joyner commented, very publicly, that the 
ax should have been directed instead at Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 And if not an atmosphere of paranoia, Brown has certainly fostered an 
atmosphere of instability in his 3 1/2 years in charge of the Angel front 
office. Consider the exit list of the Brown era: 
</P>
<P>
 -- General managers fired/forced out: (3) Port, O'Brien, Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Managers fired: (2) Rader, Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fan favorites run out of town: (6) Joyner, Bichette, Winfield, Abbott, 
Harvey, Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are some heavy casualties, but none was a bigger hit than Rodgers, whose 
firing has already drawn comparisons to that all-time gaffe of Angel gaffes, 
the Nolan Ryan Decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this one was that bad. For once, the Angels had the right man in place. 
The patient, buoyant Rodgers was as perfectly suited for this young, 
under-skilled group as gritty Gene Mauch was for the jaded veterans of the 
mid-80s. If anyone could lead the Angels back to respectability, it was 
Rodgers, who had been there before with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience told him it would be painful, though, and Rodgers refused to 
sugar-coat it. He was the Last Honest Man in the Angel Organization, given to 
calling a spade a spade, even if Brown preferred nothing but aces and 
24-hour-a-day happy talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing wrong with the Angels got better with the announcement of Rodgers' 
firing Tuesday. Everything lacking with this team and this organization remains 
in place. The only difference is that Rodgers won't be around to remind us of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 So welcome back, Lach, and do remember this as you add your name to the 
Angels' merry-go-round tonight: 
</P>
<P>
 You have the right to remain silent.

RODGERS: BROWN 'CANCER' TO ANGELS; BASEBALL: FORMER MANAGER SAYS MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED FIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers, still having difficulty believing he was unemployed Wednesday, 
accused Angel President Richard Brown of being a cancer in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said Brown had him fired as manager of the Angels, and that General 
Manager Bill Bavasi simply was following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources close to Bavasi confirmed the firing was Bavasi's idea and Brown 
and chairman Jackie Autry approved it. Owner Gene Autry told Rodgers in a phone 
call that he wasn't aware of the firing until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers indicated it was difficult to believe that Bavasi, who was hired Jan. 
12, would fire him this quickly. Sources, however, insist Bavasi was troubled 
by Rodgers' stubbornness and was convinced they could not coexist. Bavasi 
wanted to hire his own manager, and his only choice was Marcel Lachemann. If 
Lachemann had rejected the job, Bavasi said Wednesday, Rodgers would still be 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers lashed out at Brown at a news conference he called at an Anaheim 
hotel. The Angels sent a club official to monitor it and report back to the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still some kind of cancer here with the California Angels," Rodgers 
said, directing his comments toward Brown. "I think that's very obvious for 
someone who's been here for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization is not all bad. This organization is very salvageable. But 
there's a paranoia here. There's a fear of failure that has to go." 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown was informed of Rodgers' comments during the 30-minute news 
conference, he refused to address them. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bavasi: "You've got a guy who's been through a tough, traumatic 
experience, and (Rodgers is) entitled to make any comments that he deems 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what I told you (Tuesday) is the absolute truth. I know what happened. 
Rich knows what happened. The Autrys know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand by what I said, and it was totally my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers says his confrontation with Brown during the Angels' last home stand 
might have triggered his dismissal. Rodgers was summoned for a private meeting 
to discuss comments that Brown heard Rodgers had made about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that I said that he didn't know anything about baseball. Even if I 
believed that," Rodgers said smiling, "I wouldn't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Bavasi vehemently denied the meeting had anything to do with 
Rodgers' firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, 55, an original member of the Angels' expansion team, has said that 
Brown is threatened by those who played the game. Brown was named the Angel 
president on Nov. 1, 1990, and had been the team's legal counsel since 1981. He 
never played professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a paranoid person, you're threatened by everything and anything 
about you," Rodgers said. "There's something against people who played the 
game: 'You're not as smart as the next person or you can't do the job as well.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't after anybody's job. I have trouble enough with my own job, which I 
don't have anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 It may take days, if not weeks or months, to convince Rodgers that Brown was 
not behind the firing. Take a look at the track record since Brown has been 
president, Rodgers said, and you'll find his fingerprints on the departures of 
general managers Mike Port, Dan O'Brien and Whitey Herzog and manager Doug 
Rader. But while the role players have changed throughout the year, Brown has 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, his eyes watering, his voice choked with emotion, still had trouble 
believing Wednesday that he was standing behind a lectern without a job. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been 24 hours since he had been fired as manager of the Angels, and 
still, he had no answers as to why he was unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent 30 years in the organization," he said. "I was given no reason. I 
asked for a reason, and he still gave me no reason. The whole thing took 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read where Bill said, 'I had a tough time with Buck in the meeting.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if that's tough, he's got a whole lot of tougher times coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who will be paid $600,000 this year and $600,000 in 1995 -- and is 
expected to earn $3 million to $5 million in his settlement involving the 
Angels' 1992 bus accident -- said that he probably will sit out the rest of 
this season before considering another managerial job. He still would like to 
return to the field, but no matter what transpired with the Angels, he refuses 
to change his style. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job is never going to change me," he said. "If I'm not a man standing 
before you, I'm not going to be less of a man to keep my job. If I have to do 
that, I'll get out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers also said that he won't talk about his firing again after Wednesday. 
It's just not fair to the organization, he said, or to Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he said, he would like one favor. He still would like an explanation. He 
deserves, at least that, he said.

BEVERLEY, OWEN OUSTED IN KINGS' LATEST CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a disruptive season in which the Kings failed to reach the playoffs, 
made questionable trades and were divided by an off-ice power struggle, General 
Manager Nick Beverley and Bob Owen, director of player personnel and 
development, were fired Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither move was a surprise, coming two days after former majority owner Bruce 
McNall sold 72% of the franchise for $60 million to telecommunications 
executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and entertainment executive Joseph M. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverley's two seasons as general manager were punctuated by two controversies 
that might have been beyond his control. In his first season, he exchanged 
words -- in print -- with Wayne Gretzky over the team's difficult travel 
schedule. This season, Beverley's philosophical differences with Coach Barry 
Melrose became public in December and divided the team into two factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverley had been with the organization since retiring as a player in 1980 and 
was named general manager in June 1992. In his first season, the team reached 
the Stanley Cup finals. This season, the Kings missed the playoffs by 16 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverley, 47, did not return phone calls from The Times. He had a little more 
than a year left on his contract, which pays him about $200,000 plus some 
deferred money, according to sources. Owen, 45, also has more than a year 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Nick and I are very close and we've worked together a long time," 
Owen said from his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. "Today is not an easy day. There's 
new ownership and a new direction. They've spoken and you just have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen was asked if he ever felt hampered by the Kings' lack of first-round 
draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some instances we felt limited," he said. "We understood when Mr. McNall 
brought Wayne (Gretzky) to L.A. and the draft choices that had to be given up. 
There was nothing wrong with that. That was accepted, but there were some other 
times when other draft picks were traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business, and when you have a chance to improve the team, we've got to 
do what's best." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority owners and McNall were not available for comment, but McNall 
issued a statement, saying: "Both Nick and Bob have been loyal and dedicated 
employees of the Kings for many years. The future of the Kings looks very 
bright thanks to the hard work both have given to this organization. I am 
extremely grateful for the jobs they performed for us and wish them nothing but 
the best in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The team is expected to interview a handful of candidates for the jobs and 
hopes to fill the positions within a week. A possible scenario has the workload 
being divided between two executives, the way it is done in Anaheim with 
General Manager Jack Ferreira and assistant GM Pierre Gauthier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said Wednesday that there have been discussions with Bob McCammon, who 
had interviewed with the Mighty Ducks for a front-office job. 
</P>
<P>
 McCammon was a general manager and coach with Philadelphia in the late '70s 
and early '80s and drafted several prominent players for the Flyers, such as 
Rick Tocchet. McCammon also coached the Vancouver Canucks and more recently was 
a coach and front-office executive with the Tri-City Americans junior team in 
the Western Hockey League. Currently, he has his own business in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the Kings will need to act quickly, before the NHL's entry draft on 
June 28-29 at Hartford, Conn. For the first time since 1990, they have retained 
the rights to their first-round draft choice (seventh overall). There is almost 
no chance that Melrose would be named GM, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Melrose, he questioned his own job status on ESPN Wednesday. Co-host 
John Saunders jokingly reassured him that he had a job with the cable network 
if the Kings fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that in writing?" Melrose said, laughing.

WORKING WONDERS; DARREN DREIFORT IS CLOSING GAME AFTER GAME, BUT SOME SAY IT'S 
TOO MANY TOO SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park, the one babe of summer, was sent to the minors for more work. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort, the other, is getting plenty where he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much? 
</P>
<P>
 Some are already wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 At 22, acclimating to his first professional season while thrust into the 
do-or-die role of a major league closer while Todd Worrell remains on the 
disabled list, Dreifort was setting a record rookie pace through Tuesday, 
having appeared in 19 of the Dodgers' 39 games, working 23 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 If he continues at this pace, not including the number of times he has warmed 
up and not been called on, he will appear in 78 games and pitch about 94 
innings. The 78 would equal the National League rookie record set by Tim Burke 
of the Montreal Expos in 1985. The major league record of 80 was set the next 
year by Mitch Williams, then of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerical projections seldom become reality, but there is conjecture that an 
arm projected for bullpen greatness could be significantly taxed before 
Dreifort has seen every National League city -- particularly after he blew a 
save opportunity against the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night only 24 hours 
after Manager Tom Lasorda inexplicably used him in the ninth inning of a game 
the Dodgers were leading, 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who had pitched in seven of the 10 games on the last trip, including 
three of the last four, breezed through his first assignment on this one but 
lacked similar location and stuff when brought back with the game on the line 
the next night, giving up hits to the only three batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Dreifort's employment in the 9-2 game, Lasorda said that a closer 
is a closer regardless of the score, adding: "He's strong and can pitch two 
days in a row." Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said only that the decision was 
the manager's. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a process of education for the pitcher fresh off the Wichita State 
campus, where Coach Gene Stephenson continues to chart his progress. Stephenson 
and the Shockers reached the College World Series in each of the three years 
that Dreifort served as designated hitter and middle reliever, playing in the 
championship game in 1991 and '93. Dreifort pitched in 30 of 78 games last 
year, working 101 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches have a reputation for riding a hot horse to death, but that's 
not the case at Wichita State," Stephenson said. "Our reputation among pro 
scouts is probably the best of any program in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darren always got proper rest. We were always concerned with what could 
happen if he was overused. I told Tommy (Lasorda) when he was here that Darren 
would be successful in any role -- starting, middle relief or short man -- and 
I told him he doesn't have to worry about Darren getting beat up mentally as so 
many young relievers do because Darren understands the reality. He knows he 
can't be perfect every time and that if he does get beat, he knows the best 
thing for him is to get right back in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, he's not facing anything now he can't overcome mentally. My only 
concern is with the physical aspect of sometimes pitching two or three games in 
a row. He didn't have to do that here because we don't play every day and he 
wasn't my closer. I pitched him in the middle. Sometimes two innings, sometimes 
seven. He often finished what he started, but he always got his rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, of course, dismisses the concern. 
</P>
<P>
 What would you expect from a pitcher whose mental and emotional makeup draws 
as much praise as his darting and sinking fastball and who is such a team 
player that he always remembers to turn his soiled socks right side out before 
dumping them in the clubhouse hamper? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to get whatever innings I get," he said. "The fact that I pitched 
more than 100 in relief last year should be an indication I can handle it. The 
only problems I've ever had with my arm came at the start of a season because 
it was cold and it wasn't in shape yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you have to develop a feel for your body, but every pitcher has to 
throw through stiffness and tightness at times. My attitude goes back to Little 
League and high school when your arm would be killing you from throwing so much 
and you'd ice it and go out and throw some more. You might not have a lot on 
the ball, but that would force you to concentrate more on the job. Those were 
the situations in which you learned how to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 With Worrell sidelined and the Dodgers hoping for stability from a bullpen 
that has blown more saves -- nine -- than it has recorded -- seven -- Dreifort 
is experiencing another crash course, to use his own definition, in the 
toughest of classrooms, trying to take what he has worked on in the bullpen 
between his frequent appearances into critical game situations. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 0-2 with five saves and a 4.30 earned-run average. He has given up 29 
hits and 11 walks in 23 innings, striking out 19. He has blown four saves, but 
is yet to be hammered. "I'm the type of pitcher who is either going to live by 
the ground ball or die by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, a ground ball isn't good enough. A strikeout is frequently 
required in the high-wire world of the closer. Dreifort was summoned to a 
meeting with Lasorda and Perranoski in Los Angeles last week for a lecture on 
location and putting hitters away when ahead on the count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darren has a major league presence," Perranoski said. "Win, lose or save, you 
can't tell the difference. With his temperament and ability, once he knows how 
to cut up a hitter, he's going to be a great one. It's a matter of refinement. 
We're working to develop a curveball to go with his sinking fastball and 
slider. We communicate every day and would never do anything detrimental to his 
career. We'll back off even at times when he says he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell is expected back soon, which will ease some of Dreifort's force-fed 
burden, but not the long-range expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said: "We don't try to overuse anybody at any point in their careers. 
We've installed the young man in a very tough position, but we feel he has the 
makeup and ability to handle it. It's a question now of utilizing the ability 
in the right way. When he has the edge on a hitter, he has to learn how to chop 
him up. It's more location than anything, and it comes through experience and 
application." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger McDowell can take Dreifort on a tour of New York, but he is alone on the 
mound. Stephenson, on the phone from Wichita, said Dreifort will be fine, that 
it is only a matter of adjusting (1) to hitters far more selective than those 
he was pitching to only a year ago and (2) to "the postage stamp strike zone in 
the majors that makes it very difficult to get a called strike and forces a 
pitcher to throw fatter pitches than he'd like." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson added: "Darren has to learn to live with that zone and he will. He 
not only has great physical and mental makeup, but he has the best movement on 
his fastball of any reliever I've ever seen. He also has a great slider that 
moves down and in on left-handers. He gets left-handers out big time. I've 
wondered why he hasn't thrown it more with the Dodgers, but Tommy and those 
people know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Dodgers know what they were doing when they made Dreifort their No. 1 
draft choice last June? 
</P>
<P>
 His rookie workload is an indication of how strongly they believe it.

JIM MURRAY: ROAD TO PAR BECOMES A HORROR SHOW 
</P>

By JIM MURRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This column is not for the squeamish. It is a portrait of a man about to lose 
friends in high places. As they say on TV, "May contain material offensive to 
some." Strong language, but no nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about golf, a game with which, if you've been paying attention, you know 
I've had a 40-year unrequited love affair. 
</P>
<P>
 They are tampering hopelessly with it, doing terrible things to a great game. 
</P>
<P>
 They're building golf courses these days for Fred Couples, not married 
couples. Or any other kind of couples. The more diabolical, the more maniacal 
the layout, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know why. Ninety-five percent of the people who play the game can't. 
That is to say, they are like us -- every shot is a mystery wrapped in an 
enigma, as Churchill would say. We don't need tilted fairways, glassy greens or 
doglegs to nowhere, bunkers with trees growing out of them, greens surrounded 
by water, and we certainly don't need railroad ties till you can't figure out 
whether you're playing a golf course or the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, if they want to test the best golfers in the world, let them go to 
Pebble Beach, Pine Valley, Pinehurst, Oakmont or Shinnecock Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the 20-handicappers among us? We're not trying to make the 
Ryder Cup, we're trying to break 100. A golf game should be a walk in the park, 
not an afternoon in Gestapo headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a challenge, you go to Riviera, L.A. North, Winged Foot or 
Southern Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me ask you something. If you want a day at the beach, you don't try to 
find the most shark-infested or jellyfish-plagued strand, do you? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the way they're building golf courses today, they have everything but 
alligators and quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 I belong to a complex of golf courses in the desert, one of which the pros 
refused to play, forcing their tournament to a more friendly locale. The others 
have things like 170-yard carries over water to reach the green and fairways so 
canted toward lateral water hazards that even pretty good shots on the right 
side of the fairway trickle inevitably into the water. They have target greens 
surrounded on three (or four) sides by water. They are built for 
one-handicappers but are played in lots of cases by auto dealers' wives or 
stockbrokers and their brothers-in-law. Or sportswriters with eight-piece 
swings. 
</P>
<P>
 And who is devising these torture racks? What Machiavellis are at work here? 
I'll tell you. Golfers, that's who. Guys who shoot 63s in U.S. Opens. Guys who 
broke 80 when they were 9 years old. Guys who think nothing of teeing off with 
a one-iron on long par fives. Guys who hit four-irons 225 yards. Guys who have 
no feel for anybody who isn't a scratch player. 
</P>
<P>
 Old golfers, like old soldiers, never die. They become architects. They 
incorporate every golfing horror they have ever encountered and build it into 
an 18-hole course. It's as if they never wanted to see anybody break 90 again. 
</P>
<P>
 I played on a golf course one day that had three sand traps on three different 
holes no more than 90 yards out from the tee. I had asked the player-architect 
why they had tricked up the course so callously. At first, he said the members 
wanted it. That didn't wash. "I'm a member," I told him. "I don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said the owners wanted it. They prided themselves on the degree of 
difficulty and, besides, it was good publicity. Also, they wanted a tough track 
for tournament play. "Tournament play!" I scoffed. "Chi Chi Rodriguez won't 
even know that trap's out there! But your wife or your father-in-law will hit 
into it every time. It's got nothing to do with tournament play, but it is a 
play-slower for recreational play." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what these guys are driven by. Ego? Vengeance? Are they getting 
even with the game by leaving indignities for newcomers to suffer? 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't used to be this way. Golf layouts were blueprinted not by former 
players but by landscape engineers more interested in aesthetics than scoring. 
Sure, their courses were demanding, even difficult, but not impossible. There 
was a feel for the weekend player. There isn't a drop of water on Riviera or 
Merion, and the only water at Pebble is the Pacific, which comes into play only 
if you hit a really wild shot on 18. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if Babe Ruth were hired to design a ballpark and he made right 
field -- where he had a 296-foot target in Yankee Stadium -- 600 feet out. What 
if Lou Brock or Rickey Henderson designed the bases to be 100 feet apart 
instead of 90? No one would break their base-stealing records. Former tennis 
players can't raise the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf, after all, is a game, not a punishment for our sins. Have a heart, 
fellows. It's the king of games, but not so long ago more people were giving it 
up than taking it up. This obsession with difficulty can turn that clock back. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of places for the superstars and the macho wanna-bes to test 
themselves. What about us in the silent majority? They are making the game an 
unplayable lie for us. 
</P>
<P>
 When this comes up, I am always reminded of the first time Bobby Jones played 
Riviera. He shot 73 and came in to be asked what he thought of the course. 
"Riviera?" he asked. "Well, it's very nice. But, tell me, where do the members 
play?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a revealing statement. You see, in those days, you had an L.A. North 
that was difficult. And you had L.A South that was for the members. Medinah, 
Winged Foot and other country clubs had similar dichotomies. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing was, in those days, they knew there were two games -- one for Bobby 
Jones and the other for, well, the ones who couldn't keep up with that Jones. 
For every guy who brags at the 19th hole, "I shot 70 from the blues!" there are 
dozens of us who have to say "I picked up on 15. I ran out of balls -- hit 10 
in the water, nine o.b. and the rest of them I couldn't find in the fairway 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no place for the members to play anymore.

WORLD CUP '94: 29 DAYS AND COUNTING; TEMPERED TANTRUMS; A MORE MATURE WYNALDA 
EAGER TO ERASE MEMORIES OF HIS 1990 RED CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He wore his notoriety proudly, like a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wynalda was determined to do things his way on the soccer field, to vent 
his feelings how he pleased and when he pleased. If other people didn't like 
it, too bad. He was sure of himself -- too sure, some said -- headstrong and 
undisciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the greatest natural scorers the United States has produced. 
</P>
<P>
 His knack for finding the net was never in doubt. The only question was which 
would win out: his temper or his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he left home nearly two years ago to play in Saarbrucken, Germany, a 
small town on the French border, Wynalda figured he could get by on his 
athletic gifts. He always had, during his three years at San Diego State and 
before that at Westlake High. But in a country where he didn't speak the 
language and was held to impossibly high standards on and off the field, he 
couldn't slide anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to fend for himself, Eric Wynalda grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in college, I liked the idea of being the bad boy of soccer. I had 
32 letters to the athletic director complaining about my conduct on the soccer 
field. I was basically volatile and uncontrollable," he said by phone from 
Saarbrucken. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Germany, you'd never know that. They've never seen that side of me. As a 
soccer player, you learn, as time goes on, not to sweat the small stuff. Here, 
you don't have time to worry about things that might ruin your day. Things have 
happened, but I look at it as water off my back. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can come down on you really hard as far as the press and the fans (are 
concerned), but you can't dwell on it. Every single day of your life, you've 
got to figure out how to do your job better." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, his job varied between forward -- which he has always preferred 
-- and midfield, where he sacrificed his goal totals to serve as a link between 
the forwards and the defense. He performed both roles well enough to be named 
Saarbrucken's captain when it resumed play after its winter break, an honor not 
given lightly and only rarely to an American. 
</P>
<P>
 Having proved he can handle those responsibilities, Wynalda would like to 
prove he can handle a starting role on the U.S. World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will be handed to him. For Wynalda, who acknowledges everything else 
has come so easily on the field, this will be a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 His skills are indisputable. In 50 appearances for the national team, Wynalda 
has scored 14 goals, the third-highest total in team history. The all-time 
leader, Bruce Murray, scored 21 goals in 93 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, who scored 12 goals for Saarbrucken before rejoining the U.S. 
national team Monday, is too good not to play -- especially for a team that 
lacks offensive punch and is eager to put on a good show as the host nation of 
the monthlong competition that starts on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talent is important, but it is not only talent that makes a great player," 
said Bora Milutinovic, the U.S. national team's coach. "You must have many 
things to be a great player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for Eric, it is not a problem of technique. It's very important to 
have maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda's immaturity has left blots on his extraordinary record. There was the 
time he was supposed to play for the national team against Brazil in February 
1992, but arrived at the Miami airport without his passport and was sent home 
by Milutinovic and fined $1,000. Three months later, he elbowed a teammate in 
the face and was again banished by the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 There were problems with his contract and with his teammates when he played in 
the American Professional Soccer League for San Francisco, which released him. 
And most notably, there was his ejection in his World Cup debut, in 1990, for 
stomping on a Czechoslovakian player's foot after he had been warned for 
elbowing another player in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the kind of fame he had envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two and a half years ago, when I was in my apartment in San Francisco, a 
buddy called me," Wynalda said. "He said, 'I'm playing "Trivial Pursuit" and 
got the question: Who is the American who got a red card in the World Cup? And 
I won the game because of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Also counting against him is the improved caliber of the U.S. team. Ernie 
Stewart, who has played in the Netherlands, will probably be one of two 
starting strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic isn't saying where Wynalda fits. He kept track of Wynalda's German 
season and visited Europe to chat with Saarbrucken's coach, Gerd Warken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to play in another country, and it is much more difficult 
to play in the Bundesliga (German First Division) and Second Division (than in 
other European leagues)," Milutinovic said. "He came to be captain, which is 
not very simple. For that, I am pleased for the progress he made. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, he is a great player, but now we need to speak and see what we need 
to do and which way we will go." 
</P>
<P>
 So eager is Wynalda to erase the memories of 1990 and prove his maturity, he 
doesn't care where Milutinovic asks him to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bora says sweeper, I'd play sweeper," said Wynalda, who will turn 25 on 
June 9. "He's the best coach I've ever had. He sees things in you that you 
don't know about. If he says it would be best for me to play midfield, I'll 
play midfield." 
</P>
<P>
 All he wants is a chance to show the child who overreacted to pressure four 
years ago has become a man who can turn adversity to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has definitely matured," said U.S. midfielder Cobi Jones, who has known 
Wynalda since their days at Westlake. "Living in Germany by himself, going 
through tough times over there, as well as being captain of his team, there are 
many things that have made him more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being captain put a lot of pressure on him, as does being an American in 
Germany and having to prove yourself and win the respect of your teammates. It 
takes a lot of swallowing your pride." 
</P>
<P>
 That maturity has come slowly, and not altogether easily.  
</P>
<P>
 When Saarbrucken acquired his rights from the U.S. Soccer Federation for 
$450,000 in the summer of 1992, it had just been promoted from the German 
Second Division to the Bundesliga, widely considered one of the world's top 
leagues. He was an immediate success, scoring eight goals in the first half of 
the season, but he and the team slumped in the second half. Saarbrucken 
finished last and was relegated to the Second Division again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, unhappy over the team's demotion, asked to be traded to a First 
Division team. Saarbrucken's management agreed -- but then put a $2-million 
price tag on him, far above the going rate. He threatened not to play but 
relented when Saarbrucken made him "an unbelievable offer" to stay. His 
contract is over, and he hopes to move on next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disappointed when the team went down (to the Second Division)," he 
said. "I had a very bad hamstring injury and missed four games, and Saarbrucken 
lost all four. 
</P>
<P>
 "People (in Germany), they don't care if you're injured, they're just mad if 
you're not playing. People were blaming (the team's losses) on me and I wanted 
to leave. Plus, I talked to Bora, and he indicated it might be a problem for me 
preparing for the World Cup if Saarbrucken were playing in the Second Division. 
But the club was great to me, and they told me they considered me a very 
influential player. I communicated that to (Milutinovic) and he said, 'I'll be 
watching you.' We talked at the break and he said, 'You seem happy and the team 
is doing well,' so I stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, despite two coaching switches and repeated changes of his 
position, Wynalda had 12 goals and 17 assists by his last week of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second half of the season has been probably the best form I've been in in 
my life," he said. "I've scored a lot of goals and assisted on more goals and 
been really vital to the team. We've been unlucky." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not leaving anything to luck with the U.S. team. He desperately wants to 
earn Milutinovic's respect and create happier World Cup memories than the ones 
he took from 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deserved the red card. There's no sense in saying, 'I got cheated,' " he 
said. "Looking back, I can say I'm 10 times the player I was then. There's no 
reason for me to forget it. I don't want to forget it. It may have changed my 
life as a soccer player. . . . Either you dwell on it and let it affect your 
life in a negative way, or you analyze it and say, 'What was I thinking? What 
was my problem?' I had a temper, but it was that I had a will to win that 
needed to be channeled into other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "(U.S. assistant coach) Sigi Schmid, who has known me since I was 14, told me, 
'You made it a personal vendetta. Now you have to go out and play soccer.' I've 
been in Germany and scored 25 goals in 60 games. That's something I'm very, 
very proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 That experience benefits him in many ways. He has faced players he will 
encounter in the World Cup, "and I can say, 'This is so-and-so. He has a good 
left foot and he's very tricky on the ball.' This means my defender has 
second-hand information that can help." 
</P>
<P>
 It also means his skills have improved immensely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look back at (1990) and our attitude and you see how much our team has 
changed since then," he said. "We were, and I mean this in the nicest way 
possible, totally amateur. In regards to the soccer world, you play for your 
club team and compete in the World Cup. We had no players who had played in 
Europe. Now, we do. Almost everybody has played professionally. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to play well, which is definitely within our capability, we can prove 
to the world we can play. That can be our main motivation: to finally see 
America be enthusiastic about the sport. If America decides to accept soccer, 
so be it. I don't think it's good to put extra pressure on us, to say that our 
success will make the game successful here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's senseless for us to try and oversell the sport. It will sell itself. 
Those people living in Boston, you're going to have foreigners dancing in your 
backyard, waving flags. I hope Americans pick it up. (The World Cup) is Cinco 
de Mayo, Mardi Gras and (Brazil's) Carnival all in one, and people should 
embrace it."

 Michael Andretti was asked about drivers he would want to see behind him while 
leading on the last lap of this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to see Dad," Michael said of his father, Mario. "On the 
other hand, if I did and I beat him, I think I would be the most unpopular 
winner ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, who won in 1969 and is in his 28th Indy race, will be driving 
in his last 500. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 62 Indy 500 starters fielded by Roger Penske, pole-sitter Al Unser Jr. 
and Emerson Fittipaldi will be the 28th and 29th to start from the front row. 
</P>

 The St. Andrews Apostle grade school decal is again on Willy T. Ribbs' No. 24 
Lola-Ford Cosworth in the Derrick Walker stable. It first appeared on Walker's 
cars in 1991, the team's first year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Walker said sponsors were needed for Ribbs' entry, the story reached 
students at the Indianapolis school, who raised $20 and sent a check to Walker. 
It was the team's first sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribbs brought students from St. Andrews to the track for a day in 1992 and has 
visited the school regularly since during May. Walker still has not cashed the 
check. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the seventh consecutive day, Fittipaldi was the fastest driver on 
Wednesday. He ran 229.510 m.p.h., his fastest lap of the month. The Brazilian 
defending champion has also been the busiest driver here, having logged 676 
laps to 649 for Teo Fabi and 610 for rookie Adrian Fernandez.

qualifying for the Indianapolis 500, but I must admit dealing in front of a 
live audience without a helmet was much tougher that qualifying." SHAV GLICK

RAMS, WRIGHT AGREE; TERRELL HEADS TO JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' transition at strong safety continued Wednesday when they agreed to 
terms on a three-year contract with rookie Toby Wright and reserve safety Pat 
Terrell came to terms with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, the Rams' second-round pick (49th overall) from Nebraska, agreed to a 
three-year, $1.1-million deal that includes a $400,000 signing bonus, said his 
agents, Steve Feldman and Jim Wand. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell was in New York on Tuesday preparing to sign with the Jets after 
agreeing to a two-year deal that includes a $100,000 signing bonus and will pay 
him $375,000 this season and $525,000 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams view Wright, six feet and 203 pounds, as their future starter at 
strong safety with the departures of Terrell to the Jets and free-agent Michael 
Stewart, last year's starter, to the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell, Stewart's backup last season, figures to back up Brian Washington and 
Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly, a starter with the Raiders last season, has signed a 
one-year contract worth $500,000, Feldman said. Kelly had agreed to terms last 
week.

ALCOHOL RESTRICTED AT WORLD CUP GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to control potential rowdiness, a Pasadena official decided 
Wednesday to ban alcohol sales and consumption by the general public in and 
around the Rose Bowl during eight World Cup soccer games this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking of alcohol will be allowed only in luxury and press box areas inside 
the Rose Bowl and in hospitality areas on stadium grounds during the 
tournament.A violation would be a misdemeanor, said City Manager Philip. A. 
Hawkey, who made the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Organizing Committee officials could not be reached for comment, but 
Hawkey said he did not anticipate any objections. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the organizing committee asked city officials in March to impose a 
citywide ban on beer, wine and liquor during games to prevent hooliganism that 
has marred contests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, such bans are common on game day to try to quell violent fan 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials rejected the citywide ban as "Draconian" after local 
restaurant and bar owners objected, saying they would lose business. RICK

 Mike Lavin, a cement contractor from Mission Viejo who has had Angel season 
tickets for nine years, summed up the way the majority of Angel fans seem to 
feel about the firing of Buck Rodgers in two words: "It sucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 20 fans interviewed before Wednesday night's game against 
Chicago, only one said the Angels might have been justified because Rodgers was 
"overly blunt" and refused to sing the company tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, agreed with Lavin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were finally going the right way, going with youth instead of 
bringing in one has-been after another," Lavin said, "and I thought they made a 
great move when they brought Buck in to handle the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really disappointing. I think Buck was doing a really good job of 
getting the most out of these kids. This is just more proof that (the front 
office) doesn't know what it's doing. I mean how many arms can you deal away 
and expect to win in professional baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Loredo of San Bernardino also thinks new Manager Marcel Lachemann won't 
fare any better than Rodgers unless management makes moves to improve the 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the pitching is that bad, there's only so much a manager can do," Loredo 
said. "It's not like they gave him the Braves' pitching staff to work with. How 
can they blame him? It just makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Most fans interviewed were as upset that Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi 
refused to give a reason for the firing as they were about the firing itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we deserve a reason," Mary Bowden of Anaheim said. "I've been 
supporting this team since I started coming here with my dad as a little kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not naive. I know the fans can't vote on these decisions and I know 
baseball is a big business and they have to make business decisions. But I 
still think we deserve a reason and I think they would want us to know why they 
did something like this. After all, we're the ones who buy the tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 While many were surprised and confused about the decision to replace Rodgers, 
a number of fans had no intention of being the voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck was outspoken, yeah, and I think they should have listened to what he 
was saying," said Chris Frost of Malibu. "But it's the kind of thing we've come 
to expect from this front office. They have no clue what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another case of a non-baseball person making the decisions instead 
of the decisions being made by somebody who knows something about the game. 
Look at (Wally) Joyner, (Dante) Bichette, (Jim) Abbott, (Luis) Polonia and 
especially the Bryan Harvey fiasco, which is totally ludicrous, especially when 
you consider who they've got in bullpen now. Why are these people gone? Who did 
they get for them? 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck says it the way it is and they just didn't want to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 And some suggested that Bavasi made the move only because he was jealous of 
Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you justify a move like that," said Brad Sandstrom of San 
Diego, a gaggle of very little Little Leaguers gathered around his legs. "I 
think this franchise is more (messed) up than the Padres, which is saying a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, something weird is going on behind the scenes that they don't want 
to make public. But if you want my opinion, I think Bavasi is just a young guy 
who's trying to make a show of power so everyone knows who's boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was just trying to make a name for himself."

 Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott, suspended from baseball last year for using 
racial and ethnic slurs, reportedly said she doesn't want her ballplayers to 
wear earrings because "only fruits wear earrings." 
</P>
<P>
 Schott's remark, reported in today's editions of The Cincinnati Enquirer, was 
made to about 115 people at a meeting of the Ohio County Treasurers Assn. on 
Wednesday.She was talking about the appearance of ballplayers with scruffy 
beards or who wear earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's come to the point that the city has become used to being embarrassed by 
Marge Schott's mouth," Tomm Kamm, spokesman for Cincinnati's Gay & Lesbian 
March Activists-ACT UP, told the Enquirer. "I'm sure people will respond to it, 
and I'm offended. But she knows what she's saying. I think it's mostly a 
behavioral problem and people should just ignore it. Unfortunately, that's just 
Marge." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's ruling executive council, chaired by Milwaukee Brewer owner Bud 
Selig, will investigate Schott's comment.

 Representatives for baseball owners and players gathered in New York for 3 1/2 
hours to negotiate for the first time in 1 1/2 months, appearing closer to a 
work stoppage than an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Union head Donald Fehr said the talks were "not productive in any significant 
way," but management negotiator Richard Ravitch termed the talks "productive 
and useful."

LONG, CASTANON GET DAYS FOR WHIP-SWINGING FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Brian Long was suspended for 10 days and fellow rider Antonio Castanon 
was suspended for five days Wednesday because of their whip-swinging battle 
through the stretch of Sunday's 10th race at Hollywood Park and their brief 
wrestling match afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, the aggressor in the incident after Castanon's mount, Someluckything, 
veered out and interfered with Long's Vibrato Star, was suspended May 21-June 
2.Castanon was suspended May 21-27. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner with two of 20 mounts through Sunday, Long was cited for striking 
with his whip at another jockey during the race and for his conduct after the 
race. Castanon, who had one victory in 26 mounts through the meeting's first 15 
days, was cited only for striking with his whip at another rider. BOB

ZITO HOPING TO STRIKE GOLD IN PREAKNESS; HORSE RACING: TRAINER CONFIDENT THAT 
WITH GO FOR GIN, MCCARRON AND LUCK, HE'LL WIN MIDDLE RACE OF TRIPLE CROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Nick Zito, this is Preakness redux. When Go For Gin, this year's Kentucky 
Derby winner, runs at Pimlico Saturday, it will mark the fourth consecutive 
year the 46-year-old trainer has saddled a horse for the middle race of the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Too Wild, 11th last year, and Agincourt, seventh in 1992, are but footnotes in 
the Zito history. His most memorable Preakness came in 1991 with Strike The 
Gold, because he, too, reached Baltimore after having won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin has a different personality, and the circumstances surrounding his 
Preakness bid are also different. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners aren't squabbling, as they were about Strike The Gold. Zito is in 
control. Go For Gin is his horse, and he's calling the shots. Chris McCarron is 
the jockey, a world-class Hall of Fame rider who will listen to Zito's paddock 
instructions and adjust during the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Antley is a good rider," Zito said, "but the way he rode Strikey in the 
Preakness, he took us out of our game plan. I couldn't have a better rider than 
McCarron (who rode Go For Gin for the first time in his two-length Derby 
victory). He's won more than 5,900 races, and about half of them have come here 
(in Maryland). He's a guy who analyzes a race better than, or at least as well 
as, any guy around." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early going, Strike The Gold was almost nine lengths back, and that's 
not the ideal way to win a Preakness, a 1 3/16-mile race -- 110 yards shorter 
than the Derby and 5/16ths of a mile shorter than the Belmont, the finale to 
the Triple Crown. Horses with good tactical speed, who can be positioned within 
striking distance early, are the most successful in the longer races at 
Pimlico. Go For Gin has this effective speed and led for all but the first 
quarter-mile at Churchill Downs on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike The Gold's dismal sixth-place finish in the Preakness was the beginning 
of a sour end to his once-promising career. Antley was off and on the horse 
after the Preakness, and the defeat started a 12-race losing streak that didn't 
end until May of 1992, when he won the Pimlico Special, only a few days after 
Bill Condren and Joe Cornacchia had bought out their estranged partner, B. 
Giles Brophy. Looking over Zito's shoulder was Brophy's style when he ran the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Strikey ran in the Preakness was not the way the horse had trained 
for the race," Zito said this week. "There was the owner problem, which created 
incredible tension, and then for the race we had come out of our game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Condren and Cornacchia paid $150,000 for Go For Gin at a yearling auction, 
after the Cormorant-Never Knock colt had first been sold as a weanling for 
$32,000. The limelight from a Derby victory seems to be big enough for both 
owners, and Zito is a more relaxed trainer, even though he has been put on the 
defensive because of the way his horse won this Distress Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin had never won a major race, was winless in three pre-Derby starts 
and was the 9-1 sixth choice at Louisville. When the track came up sloppy, 
however, he was handed a running surface that he was expected to relish. Then 
the two favorites, Holy Bull and Brocco, got away poorly, which was a prelude 
to what one of the Churchill Downs stewards, Bernie Hettel, said was the 
roughest Derby he'd seen in about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about everybody had trouble but the winner," said trainer Ron McAnally, 
whose Valiant Nature was roughed up at the first turn. "The winner didn't break 
straight, but he still got out of there quick enough so that he was up front, 
clear of all that trouble that happened on the turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco and Holy Bull finished fourth and 12th, respectively, and Valiant 
Nature was 13th in the 14-horse field. Holy Bull and Valiant Nature are 
finished in the Triple Crown, and Brocco is skipping the Preakness to rest for 
the Belmont on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Derby didn't prove anything," said Jimmy Jones, a Hall of Fame trainer 
who combined with his father, Ben Jones, to win the race eight times. "It was 
like a rodeo. Everything happened. Everybody stepped on everybody's toes. Holy 
Bull got turned upside down at the start. Valiant Nature got turned upside down 
at the first turn. There was one incident after another. The winner got a 
springboard at the start and never looked back. If you ran those horses again, 
you'd probably get a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 The congenial Zito has been handling these speculative Derby analyses with 
equanimity. He has to because he frequently says luck is one of the important 
ingredients in racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to stick to my guns," Zito said. "My horse has won some races over 
tracks that weren't muddy. As a 2-year-old, he won the Remsen (at Aqueduct), a 
race that's been won by the great Northern Dancer and the great Damascus." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, only two Derby winners -- Alysheba in 1987 and Sunday Silence in 
1989 -- have also won the Preakness, and both were thwarted in the Belmont. The 
11th and most recent Triple Crown champion is still Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to try for a shot at destiny," Zito said. "The opportunity is the 
big thing. Winning the Preakness means everything, because then you can go back 
there with two-thirds of the crown. Then if you lose the Belmont and the $5 
million (in purses and bonus for a Triple Crown sweep), at least you can say 
that you gave it your best shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, who rode the race of his life on Sunday Silence to edge Pat 
Day and Easy Goer by a nose in the 1989 Preakness, has replaced Eddie 
Delahoussaye on Numerous for Saturday's Preakness. Delahoussaye notified 
trainer Charlie Whittingham Tuesday that flu would keep him out of the 
Preakness, and Valenzuela was excused from his mounts Saturday at Hollywood 
Park. . . . A field of 11 is likely for the 119th Preakness. Besides Go For 
Gin, the probable starters are Blumin Affair, Kandaly, Numerous, Polar 
Expedition, Powis Castle, Silver Goblin, Tabasco Cat, Shiprock and the Dick 
Small-trained entry of Concern and Looming. . . . The early morning line lists 
Go For Gin as the 2-1 favorite, with the Small entry at 7-2 and Numerous at 
9-2. . . . Paradise Creek, who upset the 3-10 Lure at Churchill Downs two weeks 
ago, will meet the two-time Breeders' Cup Mile winner Friday at Pimlico in the 
$150,000 Early Times Dixie Handicap.

EXPERIENCE IS EVERYTHING AT KENNEDY; SOFTBALL: COACH HAS WON A TITLE. NOW SHE 
WANTS HER PLAYERS DO THE SAME THING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Sue Hall tells a story at practice. In it, she describes what it's like to win 
a Southern Section softball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never know what it's like," she tells her Kennedy players, "until you 
win one yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 She flashes her championship ring before them. It's from 1988, the year 
Kennedy beat La Mirada for the Division 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you all to experience that feeling," Hall tells them. "You deserve to 
experience it." 
</P>
<P>
 First-round games take place Friday and half the 32 teams in each division 
will advance to Tuesday's second round. That's where Hall and the Fighting 
Irish are hoping this season is different from last. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get that far a year ago. Kennedy was No. 1 in Orange County and 
expected to at least match 1992's semifinal performance. Instead, a 
ninth-inning meltdown ended in a 4-1 first-round loss to El Toro, an at-large 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's best team was gone -- snap! -- like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was devastating," second baseman Laurie Fritz said. "Extremely 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time Kennedy players had felt such emotion. The Fighting 
Irish were No. 1 in Orange County and the top-seeded team in the playoffs in 
1991, but were beaten in the second round by Katella, an even bigger upset than 
the El Toro loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Three current players, Kristy Hensel, Laurie Fritz and Joy Hannifin, were on 
that team. 
</P>
<P>
 And the next year Kennedy reached the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannifin, the catcher on those Irish teams, says the atmosphere this year is 
similar to the one that accompanied the '92 semifinal run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big difference between this year and last year is that this team is much 
more focused," Hannifin said. "I would compare it to my sophomore year. I have 
a lot of the same feelings. Miss Hall keeps saying, 'If I'm going to win a 
championship while I'm coaching at Kennedy, this is the year.' From Day 1 she's 
said that." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Hall is counting on her team learning from its mistakes. A year 
ago, the Irish (then 24-2) were looking ahead. This year, their approach is to 
take one game at a time. Has anyone learned anything? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hits in clutch situations win games," Fritz said, "not just being the better 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall has emphasized that over and over. For the past few weeks, she has 
written motivational phrases on the team bulletin board. And when the players 
get out to practice, it's re-emphasized in a discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does that phrase mean to you?" she asks them. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hannifin of the daily routine: "It re-establishes your focus every day." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hall's six previous years, Kennedy has won a championship, appeared in the 
semifinals three times and made early departures twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven players are back from last year's early exit. Kennedy (20-5-1), ranked 
fourth in the county, shared the Garden Grove League title with third-ranked 
Pacifica and entered the playoffs as its No. 2 entry. As such, the Irish didn't 
get the cushy fourth-seeded position Pacifica did, but they are in the same 
spot in the bracket from which Los Alamitos reached last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Hall is stressing the mental game a lot more than the physical game," 
Hannifin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I've been on a tear the last three weeks that we can't overlook 
anything in CIF," Hall said. "We can't waste any time. We must understand that 
everything counts. We overlooked the first round a year ago. We're perfectly 
capable of losing if we don't play well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone has learned something, I would hope it would be us. Just because 
you're ranked very high, you're not going to go all the way unless you perform 
at that given moment."

STATE RULING MAKES IT A NEW BALLGAME FOR CITY ATHLETICS; OPEN ENROLLMENT: SOME 
COACHES CLAIM NEW POLICY WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE WHO RECRUIT TO 
CIRCUMVENT THE REGULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Recruiting is quickly becoming the fourth "R" of education as the Los Angeles 
Unified School District addresses open enrollment, yet high school coaches 
itching to compete for students find themselves left on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation enacted this year enables students statewide to choose any school 
in their district as long as space is available. Beginning this week until the 
end of June, LAUSD students are allowed to apply to the school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice for high school students is vast: Fifty schools, each putting their 
best face forward to attract the best and brightest. Schools have rushed to 
take out ads in newspapers and on cable television. Flyers promoting high 
schools are raining on junior high campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Open enrollment is making the gentle art of persuasion a vital administrative 
skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches, however, remain bound by California Interscholastic Federation 
regulations that prohibit recruiting. The rule is designed to ensure that "a 
student-athlete is making a free and unpressured choice of his or her high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Where does information end and pressure begin? 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be such a fine line that it is difficult to understand," said 
Barbara Fiege, City Section athletics commissioner. "I've gotten a lot of calls 
already from coaches and parents asking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches at Grant High paid $400 recently for a newspaper advertisement 
promoting the school. The ad focused primarily on the school's academic 
virtues, but also pointed out recent championship athletic teams and the 
school's "fully equipped weight room supervised by certified strength and 
conditioning specialists." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant violated no recruiting rules, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools should be proud of their athletic program," she said. "They should 
let kids know what kind of college players they produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advertise your program, but don't advertise for ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
 An exception is made for players living within the residential boundaries of a 
school. High school coaches traditionally visit junior highs that feed their 
schools, providing information and promoting their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those visits take on added importance under open enrollment, serving to keep 
neighborhood players from skipping town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm selling my program so they don't go somewhere else," said Jeff Engilman, 
the Sylmar football coach. "I point out our success, point out the number of 
guys going to college who played at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take along a couple of my ballplayers who went to that school. The 
(junior high) kids sit and talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches fear that a handful of their colleagues will step over Fiege's fine 
line, however. In fact, some City Section programs have used desegregation 
programs that have existed for nearly two decades to attract players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Open enrollment makes it more of a free-for-all than it already was," said 
Howard Levine, boys' basketball coach at Grant. "It's easier for coaches who 
already recruit in an illegal or backhanded way. They have a system in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing can be proven, but somebody goes out and talks to players and gets 
them. It's always five people removed from the coach, but it's there. These 
programs have a distinct advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches might feel emboldened because the enforcement of recruiting violations 
will be more difficult than ever. Fiege said that when her office is presented 
with evidence of recruiting, the investigation is conducted by administrators 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Administrators are our first line of defense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under guidelines adopted Monday by the City, athletes will have immediate 
eligibility the first time they transfer from one high school to another within 
the first 15 days of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are immediately eligible when transferring back to their school of 
residence. One year of varsity eligibility is lost, however, when an athlete 
transfers a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rules apply to athletes transferring under any of three vehicles offered 
by the LAUSD: open enrollment, magnet schools and permits with transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want one set of guidelines regardless of how someone transfers," Fiege 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An athlete who transfers must complete a form signed by the principals of both 
schools stating that no recruiting was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The forms) also will allow us to monitor the number of athletes 
transferring," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Will those numbers become mind-boggling? 
</P>
<P>
 "What you are going to see at the onset is excitement and a lot of movement," 
said Joel Schaeffer, Reseda's football coach. "It will be abused, a lot of kids 
will try it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it will run full circle and go back to the way it was. Kids will see the 
grass isn't always greener at another school." 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale transfers will not occur, Levine believes. Those changing schools, 
however, often will be key players who have been recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Key movement, yes, a lot of movement, no," he said, adding that he fears the 
creation of district super teams that will ruin competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet competition for students is being encouraged by the district for the first 
time. As in athletics, there will be winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to give schools tremendous flexibility and autonomy," said Bill 
Rivera, a district spokesman. "Open enrollment promotes competition." 
</P>
<P>
 And, many coaches believe, it encourages recruiting despite the fact that it 
remains against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation is like throwing gasoline on fire," Schaeffer said. "People 
are tired of enforcing the rules and now they don't have to worry so much."

MAGDALENO LIKES TO HORSE AROUND; CAL LUTHERAN COACH BRINGS OUT BEST IN HITTERS, 
PRANKSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Mark Magdaleno drives a pickup truck he affectionately calls "The Scud," 
which, like its namesake, is a bomb that moves very deliberately and is prone 
to stray off course. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are days when it's colder in this truck than it is outside," Magdaleno 
said as he guided the broken-down vehicle around the Cal Lutheran campus, 
smiling and waving at almost every passerby. "The Scud has what I call natural 
air-conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
 The truck also has a payload that speaks volumes about the man at the wheel. 
The inventory: a load of manure, a quarter-bale of hay, hay hooks, half of a 
Wiffle ball and a purple and gold baseball bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno, 34, works full time for Cal Lutheran in a rather unusual dual 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning he is a horseman, managing the school's equestrian center and 
85-acre hay farm. In the afternoon, he is assistant coach and hitting 
instructor for the Cal Lutheran baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a little boy, I grew up dreaming of cowboys, horses and baseball," 
Magdaleno said. "I loved John Wayne just like I loved Babe Ruth. People ask me, 
'How come you're so happy all the time?' Hey, how many people get paid for 
something they once dreamed of doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno is in his third season as a college assistant, his 15th month as 
ranch manager, and is considered equally qualified at both tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely a cowboy," said Mary Jo Lord, one of three horse trainers 
who teach equestrian skills to Cal Lutheran students. "He knows exactly what 
he's doing and he manages this place really well." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Magdaleno's skills as a batting instructor, the numbers tell the story. 
Cal Lutheran (29-6-1) takes a batting average of .349 into a best-of-five 
series against UC San Diego in the NCAA Division III West Regional in La Jolla 
beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He puts things into perspective, explains things in a way you can understand 
and that makes the game fun," said Jason Wilson, Cal Lutheran's center fielder 
and leadoff batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wilson batted .299, scored 30 runs, had eight extra-base hits, 15 
walks, 17 stolen bases and 14 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 This season the 5-foot-7, 150-pound senior is batting .344, has scored 51 
runs, has 12 extra-base hits, 25 walks, 29 stolen bases and has struck out only 
10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Scott Sebbo batted .344 last season. This year, he is batting 
.374 with 14 doubles, 36 runs and 45 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He works with what you have," Sebbo said. "When I first came here, I was a 
little undisciplined with my swing. But he doesn't try to change you. He helps 
you make adjustments that make you better." 
</P>
<P>
 Younger players benefit right along with his college pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 During spring break and summer vacation, Magdaleno is a prime attraction at 
Cal Lutheran baseball camps. The key to hitting, he explains to campers in a 
language they can comprehend, is to "squish the bug" and "slap the midget." 
</P>
<P>
 Squishing the bug is Magdaleno's catch phrase to remind a batter to pivot on 
his back foot. Slapping the midget is his way of explaining that a batter must 
pull the nob of the bat down, slapping with the back of his bottom hand and 
punching with his top hand. Imagine you are pummeling a short person who is 
biting your knee, he tells hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno tends to be a little more technical when it comes to helping 
college-age players, but the same mechanics apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "He puts things into perspective and in a way you can understand and 
remember," Sebbo said. "You think about things like squish the bug and slap the 
midget. Fundamentally, they're correct. The thing about Mags is that whatever 
he's teaching you, he always keeps it fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, at the very least, he makes it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can make baseball pleasurable and still be disciplined, you're going 
to be more successful," Magdaleno said. "This game has a lot of dead time in 
it. You don't always need that football mentality. You need to be a little 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Magdaleno's reputation as a practical joker is legendary. His 
feud this season, as usual, is with the team's pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmishes started innocently enough. One day while pitcher Kevin Koschik 
was loosening up in the outfield, Magdaleno heaved the player's equipment bag 
onto the roof of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew, so the joke was on me," Koschik said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Koschik found his running shoes tied in knots to the dugout 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Magdaleno) comes over and says, 'Who did that?' " Koschik said. "I said, 'I 
think you know.' He said, 'Who? Who did that?' I said, 'I'm going to get you 
back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just the threat caused Marty Slimak, Cal Lutheran's head coach, to wince. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slim told me, 'I'll give you a little advice: Don't mess with Mags,' " 
Koschik recalled. "So I said, 'All right. I'll leave it alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Koschik was back in the outfield when he turned toward the 
dugout just in time to see Magdaleno again throw his equipment bag on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after that, Koschik found a dead rat in his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mess with Mags. . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, other members of the team were drawn in. 
</P>
<P>
 After finding a snail shoved down one of the fingers in his glove, pitcher 
Sammy Arroyo vowed revenge. In early April, Magdaleno opened his equipment bag 
to find his fungo mummified. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of having tape wrapped only around the bat head, Kingsmen players had 
encased it entirely, scribbling the message, "Don't screw with the pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay-back," Magdaleno growled. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Koschik strolled into the locker room to find his cleats tied in 
knots. Undaunted, he went to put on another pair of shoes that appeared 
untouched, their laces still in bows. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Koschik lifted the tongues of the cleats the bows fell off. 
Underneath, they had been snipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to go out there with my shoes taped," Koschik said. "He called me Deion 
Sanders the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mess with Mags. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Too late. War was declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The players found the keys to Magdaleno's truck, took out his prized fungo, 
coated it with deodorant and tied his shoes to it. Then they placed a theft 
deterrent device on the steering wheel, locking it in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno had campus security use bolt cutters to remove the device. "It cost 
them $50 to play that practical joke on me," Magdaleno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not true, the players reminded him. The device had a money-back guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, several players found horse manure stuffed into their 
shoes, jacket pockets and gloves. "Oooh, it was fresh, too," Koschik recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after that, a group of players recycled the mess, which wound up in 
the coaches' offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Slimak finally called a mandatory truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've kept one of the local drugstores in business," Slimak said. 
"They've been sold out of shoelaces for weeks. And the manure thing was the 
last straw. It gets to the point where you have to say, 'OK, that's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was -- until the players got bored during a 14-0 rout of Occidental 
on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno, sitting on the bench talking to Koschik, was given a hot foot by 
pitcher Marc Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked down and it was a big flame," Koschik recalled. "I thought, 'Should 
I tell him? . . . No way!' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle of pranks, the players figure the hot foot has them in the lead 
-- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he's waiting for a big one," Weiss said of Magdaleno. "He's saving 
the best for last." 
</P>
<P>
 Slimak, who is forced to play referee in such jousts, all but guarantees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mags does not like to lose," he said. "Whether it's a game of checkers, a 
game of marbles, Nintendo or a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy, if you get one up on him, he won't be able to sleep at 
night. I've tried to tell these guys. . . . 'Look, you think it's fun now, but 
you will lose. Sooner or later, you will lose.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran hitters attest to Magdaleno's competitive side. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebbo learned quickly not to watch the flight of a well-hit ball when 
Magdaleno was pitching batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at it, you'd better just give your back up right there," Sebbo 
says. "If he catches you looking, the next pitch is coming at you. I got 
bruises on the back of my hamstrings last year. One time, he hit me right on 
the spine." 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno credits his father, Narciso, for instilling "a competitive fire." 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad, he was my hero," Magdaleno said. "He never got the opportunity to 
coach or go to school -- I think he only got through the fourth grade -- but he 
taught us the fundamentals and a work ethic you could see every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Narciso worked long days at the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu and in the 
evening taught sports to his daughter and six sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd practice and practice," Magdaleno said. "He knew the fundamentals. 
Things he taught me I'm still teaching now." 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno played baseball at Buena High and Westmont College in Santa Barbara. 
"I was an average athlete, but I got the most out of my ability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping others stretch the limits of their ability might someday land 
Magdaleno a job in pro baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer he will manage an independent Class-A team that is starting in 
Palm Springs. Because of his track record and his ability to speak fluent 
Spanish, Magdaleno hopes to land a job as a minor league instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he is content with his dual positions. 
</P>
<P>
 His typical day starts between 7 and 8 in the morning when he makes rounds of 
the 20 or so horses that are boarded at the equestrian center. After checking 
water and feed supplies, he splits chores with Abran Nava, a ranch hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno winds up his ranch duties by noon, grabs lunch at one of the 
school's cafeterias, and is on the field by 1:15 p.m. for "early outs" -- extra 
practice for any of the Cal Lutheran players who need additional work. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular practice session begins at 2:30 p.m. and goes until about 5:30, after 
which Magdaleno takes a final tour of the ranch facilities before going home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky," he said. "I'm one of the few people I know who looks forward to 
coming to work in the morning."

SISCO, HIS CAREER SURVIVE DANGEROUS DITCH; BASEBALL: FORMER TITAN HAS RECOVERED 
NICELY AFTER SNOWMOBILE CRASH THREATENED HIS LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed like such a frivolous endeavor to Steve Sisco, hopping on a 
snowmobile for a joy ride over the fields of Oregonia, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former Cal State Fullerton standout ended up in a ditch, covered with 
blood, his arm and back broken, his head woozy, and his professional baseball 
career -- and, possibly, his life -- in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not Sisco, who learned a hard lesson last Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first time on a snowmobile," said Sisco, who is in his third 
season in the Kansas City Royals' organization. "I never even thought of the 
consequences -- you never do. Unfortunately I got more confident as the day 
progressed, and the last ride got me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say how fast I was going or how much fun I was having because 
I haven't told anyone in the organization. I'm trying to make it as painless as 
possible for them. But it doesn't matter whether I was going 20 m.p.h. or 160 
m.p.h., the point is I shouldn't have been doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sisco was spending Christmas with the family of his girlfriend, Titan gymnast 
Karena Mills, and the two were heading to the Cincinnati airport for a flight 
to Los Angeles when they stopped in Oregonia to visit Mills' sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisco joined Mills' father, Gene, for the snowmobile trek, and the first-time 
driver quickly developed a knack for handling the machine. But as he turned 
around to head home for the last run of the day, Sisco hit a patch of ice and 
slid into a drainage ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 He was thrown into the dashboard, then off the snowmobile, the left side of 
his body and his head bearing the brunt of the collision. Fortunately, Sisco 
was wearing a helmet -- it might have saved his life -- but that didn't spare 
him from serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisco suffered a broken left forearm, compression fractures of vertebrae in 
his back and neck and a concussion. He was unconscious for a minute or two 
after the accident, during which time Gene Mills ran to the house to call for 
help. Karena Mills thought the worst at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my dad came to the door, I'd never seen that kind of look on his face 
before," she said. "He was white as a ghost and completely in shock. I thought 
Steve was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Mills reached Sisco, he was standing but staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had this glassy-eyed look and there was blood all around his face and 
nose," Mills said. "He was in total shock, but I was just thankful he was 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sisco: "I didn't know where I was or who I was. I don't remember any of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 An ambulance took Sisco to a hospital, where he was treated and released in 
time to fly to California the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst experience of my life, sitting in a plane from Ohio to 
L.A.," Sisco said. "I had some pain pills, but they didn't work very well. I 
was very uncomfortable and looked like a wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 Sisco's back and neck were sore several weeks, and his left arm was in a cast 
for nine weeks. Still, that didn't stop him from being a member of former Titan 
teammate Phil Nevin's wedding party Jan. 15 in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a blue cast removed and a black one put on for the wedding," Sisco 
said. "I had to match my tuxedo. It actually worked out pretty well -- my arm 
was at a perfect angle to escort the ladies down the aisle." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast was removed for good at the beginning of March, but his arm healed 
slowly. Sisco, who helped Fullerton reach the College World Series in 1990 and 
'92, missed all of spring training and didn't return to action until April, 
which he spent in the Royals' extended spring training camp at Ft. Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The second baseman finally joined the Class-A Wilmington (Del.) Blue Rocks 
last week and was batting .292 in six starts through Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great, ready to go," said Sisco, who had a .322 career batting 
average, 45 doubles, 10 homers and 129 runs batted in in three seasons 
(1990-92) at Fullerton. "I'm in better shape now than I've been for a long 
time. Things are finally getting back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Sisco credits Mills, to whom he was engaged Jan. 29, his parents and former 
teammates Nevin and Jason Moler with inspiring him throughout his recovery. But 
Sisco, described as "an overachiever" by Bob Hegman, the Royals' director of 
minor league operations, didn't need a lot of pushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream of mine to make the major leagues, it's the only thing I've 
really wanted since I started playing," Sisco said. "I can't see any other way 
to go about it except giving 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 A 16th-round pick of the Royals in 1992, Sisco hit .330 at Eugene, Ore., 
Kansas City's short-season, Class-A affiliate, his first season. He batted .286 
at Class-A Rockford (Ill.) in 1993 and now has ascended to the Royals' highest 
Class-A team, Wilmington of the Carolina League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve has great work habits, he plays hard all the time, and he's a manager's 
dream to have on the team," Hegman said. "He'll continue to advance until the 
level of competition stops him. I don't know how far that will take him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hegman said the organization was disappointed about Sisco's accident but did 
not dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately he's back to his old self, and I don't think this will slow his 
progress," Hegman said. "It's nothing to harp on. We just wanted to get him 
healthy, and now it's full steam ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sisco, the accident was a painful reminder that if baseball is to remain 
his livelihood, he needs to avoid such risky activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I could have got hit by a car walking across the street, but this was 
different," Sisco said. "It was self-inflicted. I've worked hard to reach this 
level, and the accident will make me work even harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Will he ride a snowmobile again? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not for a long, long time."

RAM NOTES; WITH TERRELL LEAVING, WRIGHT AGREES TO TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' transition at strong safety continued Wednesday when they agreed to 
terms on a three-year contract with rookie Toby Wright, and backup safety Pat 
Terrell came to terms with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, the Rams' second-round pick (49th overall) from Nebraska, agreed to a 
three-year, $1.1-million deal that includes a $400,000 signing bonus, said his 
agents, Steve Feldman and Jim Wand. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell was in New York on Tuesday preparing to sign with the Jets after 
agreeing to terms on a two-year deal that includes a $100,000 signing bonus. 
Terrell will earn $375,000 this season and $525,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams view Wright, 6 feet and 203 pounds, as their future starter at strong 
safety with the departure of Terrell to the Jets and free-agent Michael 
Stewart, last year's starter, to the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell figures to back up Brian Washington and Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly, a starter with the Raiders last season, has signed a 
one-year $500,000 contract, Feldman said. Kelly agreed to the deal last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dollars and sense: The Rams' rookie salary pool for this season will be 
$3,015,850, the fifth-largest in the league. But some of that money could go to 
veteran free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie pool money counts under the league's $34.6-million salary cap, but 
money unused on rookies can be spent to sign veteran players. The Rams drafted 
10 players last month, including four in the top two rounds, and seek a veteran 
wide receiver and a cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis leads the league at $3.9 million, and much of it will go to 
signing two top-seven picks, running back Marshall Faulk and linebacker Trev 
Alberts. Cincinnati is second ($3.25 million), followed by New England ($3.212 
million) and San Francisco ($3.19 million). 
</P>
<P>
 The league pays rookies from a pool of revenue that is 3.5% of defined gross 
revenues, primarily income from broadcast revenues and ticket sales. The league 
rookie pool is about $66.5 million, an 18.7% increase from last year's 
inaugural pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the picture: By losing free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires to 
Houston, the Rams are left with Flipper Anderson as their top veteran receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox said Anderson, entering the final year of his contract, 
has "had the best off-season in the three years we've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's shown some speed and he hasn't missed a (voluntary) workout," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson struggled last season, catching only one touchdown pass in one 
10-game stretch.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that Jeffires is out of the picture, the pickings are slim for free-agent 
receivers still available -- Ricky Sanders, Clarence Verdin, Reggie Langhorne 
and Webster Slaughter, who plans to re-sign with Houston. However, the Rams 
could wait until after June 1, when teams are expected to release several 
players for salary cap reasons.TERRELL, PAT

ALL SEASON, NOTRE DAME HITS CAME BY BUNCH; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: KNIGHT 
OUTFIELDER RECOVERED FROM CHILDHOOD ACCIDENT TO BECOME A FORMIDABLE HITTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A toddler wandering into the kitchen. A coffee pot filled with boiling water. 
A dangling electrical cord within easy reach of tiny fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Horribly, it all combined to become a parent's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Bunch was 18 months old the day scalding water splashed over him, 
causing third-degree burns over much of his body. At 17, Bunch, a senior 
outfielder for Notre Dame High, still bears scars from the accident, which 
nearly cost him his left ear and full range of motion of his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, Bunch has recovered, as his .508 batting average and eye-opening 
performance this season attests. He can recall nothing of the frightful 
experience -- the accident, the month in intensive care, countless skin grafts 
and plastic surgeries, months of salve treatments, and many more months spent 
swaddled in cotton bandages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Constant doctors," Ray Bunch said succinctly of his son's ordeal. "And two 
years of excruciating pain." 
</P>
<P>
 What Bunch does remember is years of teasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids can be ruthless," he said. "As a kid, I was real 
self-conscious. Taking my shirt off, people would just go, 'Ooh, what's that?' 
Just having them say that was the worst. I felt like dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch admittedly has struggled with feelings of insecurity and is still 
self-conscious about the scars -- even though they have faded over the years to 
the point that Bunch barely resembles a burn victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Through baseball, Bunch has been able to put on a happy face. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first varsity season as a starter, Bunch (6-feet-1, 183 pounds) has 
emerged virtually from nowhere to become one of the area's best hitters, 
leading Notre Dame (18-5) to a Mission League championship and into Friday's 
opening round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs against Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is, probably, one of the best clutch hitters I have ever seen," said Notre 
Dame Coach Tom Dill, who began coaching Bunch on the junior varsity two years 
ago. "He is a difficult out, especially with two strikes. And about three times 
since I've been coaching here, I've seen him make the other team walk off the 
field with a game-winning hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his lofty average -- tops among area Mission Leaguers -- Bunch has 
three home runs and a team-high 17 runs batted in, and he ranks second among 
area players with 12 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really determined about this year," Bunch said. "I've always known I 
could hit. I'm just finally getting the chance to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Bunch was hyperactive, always getting into things. That was the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also proved to be the solution. As an aid in rehabilitating Justin's 
shoulder, Ray Bunch began playing catch with his son at an early age. Young 
Justin couldn't get enough of the game -- even when he was unable to catch the 
ball. The games quickly progressed, and so did Bunch's skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started firing ground balls at me and I liked it a lot," Bunch said. "He'd 
hit me grounders and I couldn't catch even one. Then I finally got one and I 
remember the feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch's demeanor varies little in or out of the batter's box. He appears 
serious, cautious, controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an internal toughness about him that has made him an excellent hitter 
in two-strike situations from the time he was 9 or 10 years old," Ray Bunch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch's performance is even more impressive considering he failed to make the 
cut during tryouts for the freshman team. That was painful, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a 103-degree temperature and I got out there and didn't play well," he 
said. "I didn't even make the freshman ball team, and I know a lot of players 
did who weren't very good." 
</P>
<P>
 The following season, Bunch made the junior varsity and the most of the 
opportunity, batting better than .450 to lead the team. He made the varsity as 
a junior, but while a cast of talented seniors led Notre Dame to the division 
semifinals, Bunch rode the bench, logging only nine at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those guys in front of me kind of discouraged me," Bunch said. "Here are 
all these guys going to (college) and who's this Justin Bunch on the bench? I 
got up there thinking I wasn't as good as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent much of his life feeling that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty and Ray Bunch, who were divorced when Justin was 13, describe their only 
son as an introvert. And the reason is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't even have scars on his face, but I think he feels like he does," 
Patty Bunch said. "It has definitely taken an emotional toll on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Years after the accident, Patty Bunch has been awakened in the middle of the 
night by her son's screams: No more needles! No more needles. It hurts!  
</P>
<P>
 It has hurt less with each passing year. Scars on Bunch's forehead and neck 
are virtually absent, and a mark on his left forearm could pass for a lingering 
reminder of a head-first slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the measure of maturity gained over the past few years has made the 
difference. If college offers come his way -- none have so far -- he'll be 
prepared for the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a kid in seventh grade and being really skinny and starting to (be 
involved with) girls. . . . of course, it's something to be self-conscious 
about," Bunch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking the shirt off, I still feel a little embarrassed. But now, it's not 
that big a deal. People say, 'What's this?' I say, 'Oh, I was burned when I was 
little.' "

CYPRESS, RANCHO SANTIAGO TAKING SEPARATE ROADS IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Cypress hopes to continue its winning ways at home and Rancho Santiago hopes 
the road remains a favorable place when the second round of the Southern 
California baseball playoffs begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (36-10) is playing host to a four-team regional that starts at 11 
a.m., with the Chargers taking on Chaffey (35-8). Cuesta (34-12) plays 
Southwestern (36-7) at 3 p.m. in the other game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (35-10) is in the other regional at Los Angeles Harbor. The 
Dons, the defending State champions, play Harbor (31-12) at 11 a.m. Riverside 
(33-9) takes on Citrus (34-8) at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Play continues at both sites Saturday and the title game is at 11 a.m. Sunday 
at each site. The winner of each regional advances to the State tournament, May 
28-30 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, the Orange Empire Conference champion, has won nine consecutive 
games, including a two-game sweep of East Los Angeles in the first round last 
weekend. Jason Hodges, a sophomore designated hitter, had a home run in each 
game, giving him 13 for the season. He is tied for the Cypress single-season 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers are expected to start sophomore right-hander Josh Belovsky (9-1) 
Friday. Aaron France (11-3), a sophomore right-hander, probably will start the 
second game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the kids that it keeps getting more exciting every time you step on 
the field this time of the year," said Cypress Coach Scott Pickler, who led the 
Chargers to the 1991 State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Don Sneddon isn't sure who will start for Rancho Santiago, but said he 
is leaning toward Brian Martineau (4-3). Sneddon is also considering Brandon 
Hoalton (11-2), who has 23 victories in his two-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Sanchez leads the Dons with 15 home runs and Joe Fraser is hitting a 
team-high .406. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento and Fresno are playing host to the Northern California regional 
tournaments.

SUITS ALLEGE RACIAL BIAS AT SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: TEACHER SAYS POMONA'S 
'TRACKING' SYSTEM DISCRIMINATES AND THAT OFFICIALS THREATENED TO FIRE HER FOR 
COMPLAINING. THEY DENY HER CHARGES. 
</P>

<P>
 A Pomona high school teacher has filed two lawsuits against the school 
district alleging that district officials routinely turn a blind eye to 
policies that discriminate against black and Latino students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Zephyr Tate-Mann, who has taught social studies at Ganesha High School since 
1980, filed a federal and a state lawsuit against the Pomona Unified School 
District that accuses the superintendent and members of the school board of 
violating her civil rights by threatening to fire her if she kept speaking out 
about what she perceives as systemwide racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate-Mann, who is African American, and two other teachers filed a lawsuit 
against the district in June, 1992, that dealt with similar issues of racial 
discrimination, said her attorney, Leo Terrell. Terrell said a tentative trial 
date for the first suit has been set for June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona Unified's legal counsel, Adrienne D. Konigar, said the district had 
just received a copy of Tate-Mann's second suit and had not yet had time to 
formulate a formal response. She said the district is vigorously defending 
itself against Tate-Mann's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Tate-Mann's case is the school district's "tracking" system. 
Tate-Mann believes that the tracking system is used to fill college preparatory 
classes with white students while putting Latino and black students in 
lower-level classes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, minority students are deprived of textbooks and other materials 
that would allow them to study at the higher level, the suit charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also states that white teachers deride black and Latino students with 
racial comments disparaging their ability to succeed in college or in classes 
to prepare for post-secondary education. The suit alleges that black and Latino 
teachers are excluded from consideration for department chairmanships and 
denied professional growth available to white teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Tate-Mann charges that school board officials threatened to fire her 
when she brought a complaint against the son of a former board president, Linda 
Stevens, after he apparently turned in notes containing racial epithets after a 
class discussion about apartheid and equal rights for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the pages of Judd Stevens' notebook reveal that he wrote several 
racially insensitive remarks, including "United States government made AIDS to 
kill blacks," in June, 1992. Stevens was never disciplined by school officials, 
Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told her she would be fired if (she) continued to keep expressing (her) 
opinions on this letter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made these remarks even after they were put on notice that I was 
representing her. We feel her 1st Amendment rights have been violated. . . . We 
feel we have a pretty straight-up case," Terrell said. Tate-Mann is seeking a 
court order barring discrimination in administrative, teacher and student 
assignments, plus unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Stevens and other district officials named in the lawsuits said they 
could not comment on the matter because of the pending litigation and referred 
all questions to Konigar, who rebuffed the discrimination charges and said 
Pomona Unified will present records during the trial that will clear the 
tracking system of any discrimination. She said the district would release the 
tracking system records before the trial only if a request is filed under the 
Freedom of Information Act.

POMONA TARGETS BORDER PATROL TACTICS, CONSIDERS FILING SUIT; IMMIGRATION: 
COUNCIL ASKS CITY ATTORNEY TO PUSH FEDERAL AGENCY FOR STRICTER CONTROLS ON 
SWEEPS, WHICH SOME CALL ARBITRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After the most recent sweep by the U.S. Border Patrol, the Pomona City Council 
is considering taking steps against the federal agency, including a possible 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At a closed session Monday night, the Pomona City Council directed the city 
attorney to draft a resolution asking the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service to establish stricter guidelines for its Border Patrol arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also asked the city attorney to explore grounds for suing the INS 
if the guidelines do not halt what Pomona leaders call arbitrary and terrifying 
practices by the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona city leaders have a history of acrimony with the immigration agency 
over its periodic raids in the city, whose population is more than 50% Latino. 
The Border Patrol has said it is responding to complaints about illegal 
immigrants, but residents and some city leaders say border agents harass and 
indiscriminately question the city's Latinos, including legal residents. Pomona 
is on the western fringe of the area covered by the Border Patrol's Riverside 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest sweep occurred May 10, when border agents arrested eight illegal 
immigrants in what supervising agent Ray Fuhrmann described as a routine 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona Mayor Eddie Cortez and activist Fabian Nunez, however, charged that 
city residents were arbitrarily accosted by agents near Roosevelt Elementary 
School on North Huntington Avenue while dropping off and picking up their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just sick and tired of them doing this in Pomona" and near a school, 
Cortez said at a press conference the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next? What is sacred in America?" he asked. "On Sundays they will hit 
the churches." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann said no parents or children were harassed and that the agents were 
near the school solely to pursue illegal immigrants who had pulled into an 
alley in a pick-up truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann said the agents are supported by most Pomona residents. He gets 
numerous calls daily from Pomona residents trying to blow the whistle on 
illegal immigrants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann said he believes a small group of influential Pomona leaders are 
trying to intimidate the agency and make political points with townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
 But some activists see the raids as anti-Latino rather than anti-illegal 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practice, there are no other factors other than skin color they use to 
determine whether someone is undocumented," said Nunez, who directs the 
Pomona-based Alliance for Immigrants Rights. "The community is literally 
terrorized by just the appearance of the INS." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress gave INS agents the power to pursue anyone they believe might be an 
illegal immigrant, said Rebecca Chiao, a lawyer with the Immigration Law 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But court cases have recently held that agents need a firmer basis of 
suspicion than ethnicity to detain suspects or to invade their privacy. Cortez 
and Nunez said a recent federal appellate decision lends credibility to their 
concerns; the court ruled that the Border Patrol committed an "egregious 
constitutional violation" by stopping a car along the San Diego Freeway because 
its occupants looked Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez, who brought the issue before the council Monday night, said he hopes 
to get a hearing with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to present the city's complaints 
and the forthcoming resolution.

NEW CLUBS IN THE CARDS?; CASINO DEVELOPERS ARE BETTING ON POMONA AND OTHER AREA 
SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's tough to find people who look like they're actually having fun at Los 
Angeles County's five card clubs. The sea of green-felt card tables in these 
casinos is dotted throughout with the stony faces of poker players assessing 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Tradewinds. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hopes to build the first card club in the San Gabriel Valley, 
proposing to bring more than a touch of Las Vegas to the Southern California 
gambling scene. Theirs is the most ambitious of five casino proposals during 
the past several months that seek to gain a toehold in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tradewinds plan calls for a complex on leased land on the Los Angeles 
County Fairgrounds in Pomona with the look of Disney's "Pirates of the 
Caribbean" and featuring live bands, stage productions, ethnic restaurants, and 
rooms for playing video games and shooting pool. In addition to poker and Asian 
card games, the center would offer off-track, satellite wagering on horse 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 The main building at Tradewinds would be fashioned after a make-believe 
shipwreck turned upside down; palms and waterfalls would aim for a tropical 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you went to the Bicycle Club (in Bell Gardens) and didn't play cards, 
you'd be bored out of your skull," said Jon Langbert, who is forming a 
corporation with three Pomona architects to build and run the casino. "We're 
looking at the trend in this country away from just games and toward a whole 
product with multiple forms of entertainment, like the new Treasure Island 
resort in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Langbert -- now an employee of New Jersey-based Capital Gaming, which manages 
casinos on Indian reservations in several Western states -- also sees the theme 
park aspect as his best chance for wooing customers in a business that's 
getting more competitive as proposals for card clubs blossom around Southern 
California in general and the valley in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another group in Pomona is proposing a club on farmland along the Pomona 
(60) Freeway. The promoters say their casino, to be called Champs, would cater 
in part to Asian Americans with a first-class Chinese restaurant and variety of 
Asian card games. 
</P>
<P>
 The council paved the way Monday night for both developers to come forward 
with formal proposals. The council voted 5 to 2 to allow card clubs in areas 
zoned for light industry and at the fairgrounds. Also on a 5-2 vote, the 
council modified its existing gaming ordinance, first adopted in 1964, to allow 
dancing and alcohol sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino promoters Michael Meczka and Frank Santin have vowed to take their 
casino proposal to Irwindale voters after a harsh rejection from that 
community's City Council. Just before voting to oppose the club last year, 
Councilwoman Jacquelyn Breceda had just one question for the developers: "What 
will it take to make you go away?" 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership proposes to build the 40,000- to 60,000-square-foot club on 
Arrow Highway near the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway. They say the club would 
create about 500 jobs and generate at least $3 million in annual gaming tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * In South El Monte, one of Southern California's lowest-income communities, 
the City Council voted 3 to 2 last week to put a card club proposal to a vote 
in an Aug. 9 special election. A newly formed corporation called San Gabriel 
Valley Enterprise is behind the proposal, according to that group's attorney, 
Jerry Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuman said the developers want to build a 50,000- to 70,000-square-foot 
building with roughly 150 game tables on about 22 acres south of the Pomona 
(60) Freeway at Santa Anita Avenue, less than 200 yards from South El Monte 
High School. He said the landowners, a joint venture of WB-Core Co. and South 
El Monte Associates, have offered to compensate the city for the cost of the 
special election to decide the casino's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 protesters marched May 12 at City Hall to oppose the council 
vote. Citing fears of crime, prostitution and drug use spawned by the card 
club, residents and Catholic priests demanded unsuccessfully that the council 
force card club proponents to collect signatures for a ballot initiative before 
the issue is put to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Monterey Park, some believe a card club proposal by BCTC Development 
Corp. may resurface now that a new council is in place. BCTC officials did not 
return phone calls. But former Councilman Sam Kiang, was voted out of office 
last month, speculates that the company was funding opposition to him and two 
other losing candidates who oppose gambling in that town. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiang took the lead in opposing BCTC last year when the company made its 
tentative plans known. None of the three newly elected council members have 
opposed the prospect of gaming in town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They have everything to do with why I wasn't reelected," Kiang said of BCTC. 
"I'm the staunchest opponent of the card clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 BCTC's name popped up toward the end of the council campaign in the Monterey 
Park election when about 13,000 city residents received an official-looking but 
anonymous flyer printed in English and Chinese that warned of $10,000 fines and 
imprisonment for those who disobeyed voting laws. The flyers were traced to 
Steven G. Mott, a consultant to BCTC. Kiang said he believes that the flyers 
were aimed at suppressing turnout by his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1984 state law placed the decision on card clubs in the hands of voters in 
Irwindale, South El Monte, Monterey Park and other cities that had no gambling 
law at the time. But because Pomona already had a gaming ordinance on the books 
before that law was passed, the council votes on card club proposals.  
</P>
<P>
 As they mull the casino issue, some council members question whether they've 
been dealt a royal flush or a losing hand. When it comes to approving card 
clubs, they fear, it's a case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say that, over time, card clubs breed crime and tarnish a city's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pomona has a bad enough reputation as it is," said community activist Bob 
Jackson, a council critic and onetime unsuccessful council candidate. "If the 
council approves a card club, that's what this city will be known for, and it 
will be that way for decades." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pomona is hurting financially, with one of the state's highest utility tax 
rates (10%), one of the county's highest unemployment rates (11.9% in February) 
and the city's biggest budget deficit ever ($4.5 million). 
</P>
<P>
 As they grapple with these difficulties, council members are eyeing 
communities such as Commerce, which makes $1 million a month from its gaming 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling has always been that addictive behavior is not something you want 
to encourage," said Councilwoman Paula Lantz, a self-described fundamentalist 
Christian who has been to Las Vegas a few times but doesn't consider herself a 
gambler. "But then I have to think, 'Should the city refuse revenue from bars 
or grocery stores that sell alcohol and cigarettes?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eddie Cortez says he is a teetotaler who abhors gambling because, like 
alcohol, it could have a deleterious affect on families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'd close all (gambling houses) down. But that's like trying to 
wipe out alcohol," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the words of the Eddie Cortez who is a father of eight and 
grandfather of 20. But he added: "When I have my mayor's hat on, I have to 
carefully weigh any proposal that could be worth $10 million a year in tax 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The question they face, Lantz and Cortez said, is whether the money and jobs 
are reason enough to eschew moral concerns. Both voted for the card-club zoning 
and updated ordinance Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to know how my constituents feel about it" before voting to actually 
allow either of the clubs to be built, Lantz said. "If they say it's awful and 
evil and that they'll drown me in tar and feathers if I even think about it, 
then I have to remember these people elected me and I'll listen to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tradewinds developers want to build their 60,000-square-foot casino to 
capitalize on the thousands of weekly visitors already visiting the Fairplex 
for conventions, trade shows and, of course, the County Fair in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tradewinds developers say they will spend $12 million to build their 
casino at the Fairplex, using local builders and suppliers. Langbert estimates 
that once completed, Tradewinds would employ about 540 people -- mostly locals 
-- and contribute $3.7 million in game tax revenue to the city the first year 
and as much as $10 million by the fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradewinds will also need a thumbs up from the County Fair Assn.'s board of 
directors, which was waiting for the council to decide on the plan before 
studying the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, businessman Leo Chu, owner of a women's apparel company in Los 
Angeles called California Ivy, has applied for an operating license for a 
proposed 55,000-square-foot card club to be called Champs, which would be 
located on Reservoir Street south of the Pomona (60) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Schaefer, an attorney representing Chu, said Champs would employ about 
800 people and bolster city coffers by about $4 million the first year and $10 
million by the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which Schaefer said would resemble an upscale version of the Bicycle 
Club, would feature several eateries, including an upscale Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If successful in winning over a majority of the seven-member Pomona City 
Council, the Pomona card clubs would join five others operating in the county: 
the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens, the Commerce Casino in the City of Commerce, 
the Normandie and El Dorado clubs in Gardena, and the Huntington Park Casino in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a 200-table card casino at Hollywood Park in Inglewood is expected to 
open this summer. And in Compton, the City Council has approved a club, 
although developers are still trying to line up financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate in the San Gabriel Valley about the pros and cons of casinos echoes 
in numerous cash-strapped Southern California communities where card clubs have 
been proposed over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, voters in West Hollywood, Lynwood, Pico Rivera, Bellflower and in 
Los Angeles County rejected campaigns to license card clubs. In addition, the 
proposed club in Monterey Park never got off the ground last year because of 
strong opposition from city officials and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the San Diego County district attorney and San Diego police chief 
issued reports denouncing two proposals to bring large card rooms to that 
county. Both plans were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, San Diego Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. cited the histories 
of California's two largest casinos, the Bicycle Club and the Commerce Casino, 
as evidence of the corrupting influences of casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Casino was the center of a high-profile 1984 scandal in which 
four city officials -- including three City Council members -- pleaded guilty 
to participating in a hidden ownership scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also mentioned in Miller's report is that the federal government seized the 
Bicycle Club in 1990 after a jury found that the $22-million casino was built 
mostly with profits from illegal drug sales. Federal authorities currently own 
20% of the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Card club promoters say concerns about crime and corruption are based on 
outdated stereotypes. In fact, they say, the hefty doses of tax revenue that 
the clubs provide cities actually help cure crime by funding more police. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Financial Director Tom Bachman said: "But for the (Commerce Casino), 
we'd have some very serious financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 10 years, the city has built up a $15-million reserve -- 
something it couldn't have done without the card club. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Robert Hoffman of the Sheriff Department's East Los Angeles station said 
that, since the Commerce Casino opened in 1983, the surrounding community has 
not experienced a significant increase in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's crime occurring in association with the club, it's so underground 
as not to be visible," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Sutphen, chairwoman of the division of political science and criminal 
justice at Cal State Fullerton, recently studied 12 years of FBI crime 
statistics for several Southern California towns with card clubs. Her 
conclusion: "Card clubs don't cause crime." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, not street crime such as robbery or prostitution. She does believe 
that, at one point or another, card clubs have tended to go hand-in-hand with 
political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez and Lantz say they toured card clubs in Commerce and Bell Gardens and 
were surprised at how clean and well-run they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting to see a smoke-filled room with guys wearing visors with 
garters on their sleeves, scantily clad women, guys with big cigars and lamps 
swinging back and forth," Cortez said. "But I didn't find any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the notion that card clubs spur crime, Cortez said, "Why would you 
invest $10 million in a (card club) and then let prostitutes destroy it for 
you?"

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The AIDS Service Center in Pasadena has joined a coalition of 20 Los 
Angeles-area AIDS organizations for an education project targeting the Latino 
community, believed to be the fastest-growing demographic group affected by the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, "Nuestros Recuerdos -- A Family Portrait," will include a mural 
by grade-school and college students, as well as by people with HIV and AIDS. 
Educators will use the mural to open discussion on AIDS in the Latino 
community. The mural will include the names of Latinos who have died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The final mural will be displayed throughout Los Angeles County by October. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is supported by staff and volunteers from the sponsoring agencies.

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; MAYORS FAIL AGAIN TO FILL AQMD BOARD SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the San Gabriel Valley has some of the most severe air pollution in 
the nation, its mayors recently were unable for the 15th time to elect a 
representative to the Southland's air quality board. 
</P>
<P>
 The valley's cities, as well as 32 others that ring Los Angeles, have been 
without representation on the Southern California Air Quality Management 
District board since February. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest vote, Pomona Councilwoman Nell Soto again fell short of the 
two-thirds of 63 cities, with at least 2.3 million combined population needed 
for victory. Soto received 60% of the vote, but La Canada's Joan Feehan 
continued to receive the support of enough cities to block Soto's election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to break the deadlock, Monrovia Mayor Bob Bartlett, president of the 
California League of Cities, nominated Monrovia Councilwoman Lara Blakely as "a 
consensus candidate."  
</P>
<P>
 After much argument, the mayors allowed Blakely to enter the race, but several 
Soto supporters, including Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell, walked out.

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; CHINA POET LAUREATE SEEKS POEMS FOR CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Classical Chinese poetry can be exquisite but difficult to compose. Now comes 
Kuanling Fan, a poet laureate from China, who exhorts those with writing 
aspirations to try their hand at a new type of classic Chinese poetry he has 
invented called "Hsinku." 
</P>
<P>
 Fan is soliciting poems in English or Chinese for a worldwide Hsinku contest 
to be held in Taipei and urges people to send their works directly to him. The 
deadline is May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules for Hsinko are simple: Four lines per poem, with no limit on the 
number of words per line, unless the writing is in Chinese, in which case there 
must be the same number of words in each line. The second and fourth lines of 
each poem must rhyme. 
</P>
<P>
 Fan, who met with writers and poets in the San Gabriel Valley last week, gives 
an example of a favorite Hsinko poem, called Shining Moon: 
</P>
<P>
 "The day is late and children starving/Beyond old bamboo doors in valley 
great/She smiles only upon rich men's houses/Why does shining moon 
discriminate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Submissions can be sent directly to Kuanling Fan, Suite 13A, 177 Chung Hsiao 
E. Road, Sec. 4, Taipei, Taiwan. They can also be faxed to: 886-2-711-1080.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ONE AND ONLY' MARKS A STYLISH END TO CIVIC LIGHT OPERA ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tasty, tap-happy production of Ira and George Gershwin's nimble musical "My 
One and Only" marks a stylish end to shows produced under the banner of the San 
Gabriel Valley Civic Light Opera. Beginning Monday, the 10-year-old 
organization officially assumed a new identity: The Music Theatre of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the new name, short of boosterism, is hard to fathom. 
Administrators claim that the San Gabriel Valley Civic Light Opera is no longer 
merely a San Gabriel theater but one that "draws audiences from throughout 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, but it's still in San Gabriel, in one of the most historic and 
architecturally distinctive theaters in greater L.A.. The old name is surely 
more site-specific and colorful than the amorphous, bland-sounding Music 
Theatre of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 What's done is done. The show indeed goes on (in this case, through Sunday), 
and one might say it succeeds with almost everything the 1983 Broadway and 1985 
L.A. Music Center productions enjoyed, except Tommy Tune. But the gangly, 
light-footed star at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, Roger Castellano, is 
almost as graceful and wispy as Tune (not to mention an uncanny, if shorter, 
look-alike). And that's saying a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the Gershwin brothers' 1927 "Funny Face," with an entirely new book 
by Peter Stone and Timothy S. Meyer, the show has previously (although not in 
this instance) been billed as "a new Gershwin musical." In other words, the 
great old Gershwin songs ("Nice Work If You Can Get It," "High Hat," " 'S 
Wonderful," among others) are sandwiched around a new and less silly story, all 
of it enhanced by updated staging techniques (warmly re-created under director 
Bill Shaw and choreographer Rikki Lugo). 
</P>
<P>
 Lugo has done a terrific job with the clattering feet of the New Rhythm Boys 
(Andre Garner, Mark Nordike and Sam (Red) Savage). But nothing tops the tap 
artistry of Greg Poland's Mr. Magix instructing Castellano's bushy-tailed Capt. 
Billy Buck Chandler in the creamy-soft rat-a-tat-tat seductive steps of the 
title piece, "My One and Only." 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics of dance are further punctuated in the stars' splashy foot-duet 
in a pool of water on a deserted beach. As they playfully kick water on one 
another, their dancing is almost as much fun as watching Gene Kelly kicking up 
raindrops in "Singin' in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of easygoing musical they don't write anymore, complete with 
a rotund villain (Ric Stoneback) who's straight out of vaudeville. More 
original is the romantic lead (Castellano), an eager aviator attempting to be 
the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic to Paris. The object of his 
affection, in a cross-country romance, is an Aquacade star and English Channel 
swimmer, (the pearly-voiced, ideally cast Leslie Becker). 
</P>
<P>
 Becker looks just right in that flapper hairstyle, she dances passably well 
next to the gliding, champagne-and-black-tie panache of Castellano, her singing 
is sweet and strong, and she nicely captures her character's doubts and 
anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 One minor but nagging complaint: Subtle tunnel chamber acoustical bugs often 
make the dialogue sound slightly tinny and metallic, calling undue attention to 
the hidden microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, what the going-going-gone San Gabriel Valley Civic Light Opera has 
here is a musical valentine floating on a balloon. 
</P>

LACK OF FUNDS COULD DELAY O.C. BASE CLOSURES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although cutbacks in civilian jobs may start "early next year," the commander 
of the El Toro and Tustin Marine Corps air stations warned in a recent letter 
that budget shortfalls may prevent the bases from closing on the schedule 
mandated by law. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the military's realignment plans, both bases are supposed to close 
-- trimming billions in annual maintenance and operational costs from the 
federal budget -- by 1999. Recently, the Marines even announced they hoped to 
accelerate the withdrawal and shut down both bases by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But the letter from Maj. Gen. P. Drax Williams to base civilian employees 
raised questions about whether the Marines will be able to move their 
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to the Miramar Naval Air Station in San 
Diego by either deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a problem: not enough money for the move to Miramar," Williams wrote 
to civil service employees, who number roughly 2,150. 
</P>
<P>
 "It now appears that both El Toro and Tustin will remain open until at least 
1999. We will move a few units to Miramar before then as funds become 
available. This could change, but right now it looks as if we may not be able 
to meet our 1999 closure date," Williams wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget shortfall is also likely to force the Marines to trim their 
civilian work force "by early next year," Williams continued. He did not say 
how many jobs would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "The base appropriated-fund budget has been reduced by $5 million for 1995," 
Williams wrote. "The reduction occurred because of the overall Department of 
Defense budget cuts and in anticipation of base closures." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement took some local officials by surprise, but an El Toro 
spokesman suggested that Williams' statement simply makes clear that without 
additional money previous schedules can't be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Shingleton, assistant city manager for Tustin and the city's 
coordinator for the base closure there, said Wednesday that she was surprised 
by Williams' letter. Shingleton said she met with Williams two weeks ago, and 
he did not mention the possibility of such a long delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about 1997 being unlikely (for Tustin), but not 1999," Shingleton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Master Sgt. Don Long, an El Toro spokesman, insisted Wednesday that the 
Marines are still trying to meet their self-imposed deadline to close the bases 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still making the effort to move. But it's all dependent on funding. 
We're ready to move and are making plans to make the move. We're still trying 
to meet our timelines," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the letter from Williams was an effort to keep civilian employees 
"informed of the (closure) process and assure them we're doing everything 
possible to make the transition as comfortable as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Base officials are currently working with the U.S. Department of Labor to 
establish job training classes for civilians who will lose their jobs when the 
closures are completed, and the letter offered assurances that some will be 
able to transfer to jobs at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Marine Corps figures, closing El Toro and Tustin and moving 
troops and equipment to Miramar will cost about $1.6 billion. This is the 
amount requested by El Toro officials from Marine Corps Headquarters in 
Washington and expected to be forwarded to the Navy Department. The Marines are 
a part of the Navy, which controls the purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the military, which is bound by a 1993 law to close and realign several 
bases within six years, has been hampered by a critical shortage of funding 
almost from the outset. Congress appropriated about $1.1 billion in the 1994 
fiscal year to implement the 1993 closures and realignments, but about $508 
million of that was used to help pay for the earthquake disaster in Los Angeles 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Jackie Yost, a Navy spokeswoman in Washington, said the Navy has 
only received $438 million this fiscal year to implement the closures and 
realignments mandated last year, including the moves from El Toro and Tustin to 
Miramar. Yost refused to say how much of this money will be given to the 
Marines for El Toro and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Williams' letter said the Navy "doesn't have enough money to move 
their squadrons" out of Miramar and "we don't have enough money to move ours to 
Miramar." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Randy (Duke) Cunningham (R-San Diego) has warned for several months that 
the schedule for closing the Marine bases and realigning Miramar is 
unrealistic, given the lack of funds. On Wednesday, Frank Collins, a spokesman 
for Cunningham, said Congress is looking for ways to come up with enough money 
to fund the base closures and realignments required by law in 1993 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major funding problem," Collins said. "There's not enough money to 
complete the closures mandated by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 More closures and realignments are scheduled in 1995, but Collins said there 
is a move in Congress to delay those until 1997.

SENATE PANEL REJECTS BILL TO AID TACO BELL; LEGISLATION: DEFEAT OF 
TAX-INCENTIVE MEASURE IS SEEN AS A SETBACK IN EFFORTS TO KEEP COMPANIES' 
HEADQUARTERS IN STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dealing a blow to efforts to keep Irvine-based Taco Bell in California, a 
Senate committee Wednesday narrowly rejected a measure that would have given a 
tax break to companies that expand or establish corporate offices in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee defeated the bill by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown on a 5-4 vote after several committee members expressed 
concerns that the tax cuts would drain the deficit-racked state treasury of too 
much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who has put his prestige and muscle behind state efforts to keep Taco 
Bell and other corporations from moving out of state, was undeterred. "Anyone 
who knows Willie Brown knows I'm not going to give up," the San Francisco 
Democrat said. "I'm never done on any issue until term limits take me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and backers of the proposal had trumpeted the tax break as a way to win 
the battle to keep Taco Bell from moving its Orange County corporate 
headquarters, which employs 1,000 people, to Texas. Capitol insiders said the 
tax breaks yielded by Brown's bill would have been close to the $10 million in 
incentives being offered the company by Texas, making the move out of state no 
longer worth the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have provided, among other inducements, a 6% investment tax 
credit for companies locating or expanding their headquarters in California. 
Companies could have accumulated the credits over five years for construction, 
jobs created and other expenses, and taken as long as 15 years to use the 
credits in their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Taco Bell's Irvine headquarters would not comment Wednesday after 
the committee's action. But before the vote, corporate spokesman Jeff Lightburn 
said that Brown's bill was "one of many factors being considered in the greater 
scheme of things" and would be "viewed very positively in our final decision." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, who is supporting Brown's efforts, said the 
governor remains confident that the proposal will ultimately win approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news for Taco Bell and other California companies is that the 
governor and Willie Brown are working in lock-step to see that this legislation 
passes successfully," said Sean Walsh, the governor's spokesman. "We're 
confident that, working with the Speaker's office, we can get this legislation 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Controller Gray Davis, who joined Brown in making a pitch for the bill, 
predicted that Taco Bell will stay put until the Legislature has another crack 
at the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-food company, a subsidiary of soft-drink giant PepsiCo Inc., has been 
looking for a new, larger headquarters site for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, it narrowed its search to Orange County and the Dallas-Ft. 
Worth area. Chairman John E. Martin said recently that the company was "this 
close" to moving to Texas when California officials "got religion" at the end 
of March and began to offer inducements to keep the company here. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and state officials are trying to convince Taco Bell that, 
even if the tax incentives under the new California bill fall short of the 
offer from Texas, the estimated $20-million cost of relocating to the Dallas 
area and the hassle of replacing staff members who did not move would make 
remaining in California worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has missed three self-imposed deadlines to announce a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 "My belief is they'll see the process out," Davis said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Revenue and Taxation Committee put a crimp in those plans with its 
razor-thin decision rejecting Brown's bill. The vote split along nonpartisan 
lines, with Sen. Tom Campbell (R-Stanford) joining with four Democrats to 
defeat the measure. Two Republicans -- including Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden 
Grove) -- joined with two Democrats on the nine-member committee in support. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and other opponents voiced doubts that taxes are the reason 
businesses are leaving California to set up shop in other states. He suggested 
that California's strict regulatory climate and workers' compensation problems 
are the reasons most often cited by businesses leaving the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Several others expressed worries that the tax break would only further drain 
the state's already strapped coffers, which are experiencing a $5-billion 
revenue gap. Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), for instance, said he was 
concerned the ultimate loser would be the state's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lenny Goldberg of the California Tax Reform Assn. said that studies 
have found that California ranks relatively low in state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm suggesting that lowering taxes is a strategy that's not going to make a 
difference," said Goldberg, who also complained that the bill's definition of 
what constitutes a corporate headquarters was so broad that virtually any firm 
could reap the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, said opponents had failed to consider the negative effect on 
the state's economy as corporations pull up stakes and move to other regions 
where they are offered alluring incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "If tomorrow a particular corporate headquarters moved out, how could you not 
conclude that there would be some loss to the general fund at some level?" he 
asked members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Franchise Tax Board, however, predicted the tax credit would cost 
California upward of $420 million in revenue over a five-year period. Moreover, 
a Revenue and Taxation Committee staff analysis of the bill determined there 
was no evidence tax incentives stimulate enough economic activity to guarantee 
they pay for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But an analysis performed by proponents of the bill estimated that revenue 
losses would be offset by nearly $550 million in additional income taxes and 
other fees generated by a boost in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Brown's office said that a company building a $100-million 
headquarters would cost the state $7.2 million in tax credits, but provide 
1,500 jobs and attract an additional $33 million in state revenue for a net 
gain of nearly $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Brown would not discuss how he intended to revive the 
proposal, but lawmakers in Sacramento typically breathe new life into moribund 
bills by amending them into other measures, often during the final days of the 
legislative year. 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been talk between Brown and other legislative leaders of a 
summer conference committee to craft legislation providing corporate tax breaks 
designed to keep California companies from leaving and to entice others to 
relocate here. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate leader Bill Lockyer, a Democrat from Hayward, had expressed skepticism 
about Brown's bill in recent weeks but conceded that lawmakers would probably 
pass some sort of business tax break this year to try to stimulate the economy. 
He advocated an across-the-board corporate tax cut that would save businesses 
about $160 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Fred Mickelson, a Southern California Edison executive who is leading the 
state's effort to keep Taco Bell in Orange County, said he was disappointed but 
not discouraged at the committee's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that when you have innovative legislation like this, it takes 
time," he said. "This is just Step One. I'm looking at the glass as half full, 
and we just have to pour more votes into it."

NEW GRAND JURY HAILED AS O.C.'S MOST DIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping an unprecedented recruitment effort, Superior Court officials 
Wednesday named a new Orange County Grand Jury and hailed the citizen panel as 
the most diverse ever in age, gender and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The new grand jury, which will be sworn in July 1, is comprised of eight women 
and 11 men. Two are Asian American, two are African American and three are 
Latino. The rest are white. Their ages range from 33 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, who have accused the previous grand juries of ethnic and racial 
insensitivity, said the changes were a start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is giving the big message to the community that the grand jury 
recognizes the diversity of Orange County, and is willing to put a high value 
on the contributions of our diverse communities to the overall system," said 
Zeke Hernandez, past state director of the League of United Latin American 
Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 LULAC filed a complaint with the U.S. Civil Rights Commission after the 
county's 1992-93 grand jury released a report calling for a three-year 
moratorium on immigration nationwide and linking illegal immigration to a host 
of social ills. The commission is expected to review the complaint in hearings 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 James Colquitt, president of the Orange County chapter of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, praised the current grand jury's efforts 
to recruit replacements in Orange County's minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sent brochures and application procedures to the churches and 
neighborhood organizations," he said. "They made a tremendous outreach, 
comparatively speaking, and it was all due to the existing grand jury. I'm not 
going to give anybody else any credit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Colquitt tempered his praise, noting that that while the incoming grand 
jury may be more ethnically diverse than those of previous years, the panel 
still favors the wealthy. Grand jurors receive only $25 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's prohibitive. That's to keep poor people off the grand jury and to keep 
minorities and young people off the grand jury," Colquitt said. "My contention 
is if we can pay an attorney $125 an hour out of public funds to defend someone 
who has already committed a murder, then we can pay a grand juror more than $25 
a day." 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-member Orange County Grand Jury is an independent panel of citizens 
that can bring indictments against people accused of crimes. Members also act 
as government watchdogs, scrutinizing the actions of local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's grand jury system has come under repeated attack during the past 
year. In addition to complaints by minority groups and the U.S. Civil Rights 
Commission probe, criminal attorneys argued that their Asian clients were 
unfairly indicted by a panel that was predominantly white and elderly. No one 
of Asian descent was included on at least the past five grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints also sparked an unprecedented reform effort, which showed the 
first signs of change Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the selection process provided more diversity this year than it ever 
has," said Alan Slater, Orange County Superior Court executive officer. "We 
have a very good panel, a very diverse panel, in ethnic makeup, age and from 
all over the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury impaneled last July included 16 whites, one Latino, one African 
American and one Native American. Their average age was 64, and the youngest 
juror was 44. During the course of the year, two alternate Latino jurors 
replaced one white and the Native American juror, bringing the number of 
Latinos to three. 
</P>
<P>
 While 159 people applied for last year's jury, 217 applied for the new grand 
jury selected Wednesday, an increase attributed to the outreach efforts, said 
Gai Spickard, judicial support analyst with the Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 217 candidates this year, 13 were of Asian descent, eight were black, 
22 were Latino and one was a Native American, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To recruit a more diverse group, the grand jury sent out 15,000 flyers to 
libraries, churches, civic groups, chambers of commerce, and the city halls of 
all 31 Orange County cities, said Bahia Wilson, chairwoman of the current grand 
jury's special issues committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plastered Orange County with posters and flyers," she said. "This was a 
very proactive effort to get the word out and increase the level of public 
awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson praised Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner, who oversees the grand 
jury, for making many of the committee's outreach efforts possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast Cablevision produced an announcement at no charge and provided the 
grand jury with 15 video copies to distribute to other local cable companies, 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The special issues committee, formed last year specifically to broaden 
representation on the citizen panel, met with more than a dozen African 
American, Asian American and Latino civic leaders since last summer to 
encourage new applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's recommendations to raise community awareness and diversify the 
jury were spelled out in an eight-page report in January. By then, Wilson said, 
the current grand jury already had begun working with Superior Court officials 
to implement many of the suggestions, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for example, applicant background checks were conducted by the U.S. 
marshal's office instead of the district attorney's office, another 
recommendation of Wilson's committee and a point of contention in the minority 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Several civic leaders had expressed discomfort with the background checks, 
because they feared the district attorney's office, which prepares criminal 
cases for presentation to the grand jury, could exclude candidates at will. 
Wilson called that belief a "myth," but she said the important thing was to 
ease the public concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi willingly turned the task over to the 
U.S. marshal's office, which already performs the task in some other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, 29 finalists attended the name-drawing ceremony to select the final 
panel. The first 19 whose names were pulled from a twirling box will serve on 
the grand jury and the rest will serve as alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression is we've done everything we can to advertise, and to get as 
much interest from people of different backgrounds and gender," Assistant 
Presiding Judge Theodore E. Millard told the group of potential jurors and 
county officials who gathered for Wednesday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new jury is still overwhelmingly made up of retired people who can 
afford to make the civic commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into retirement in the beginning of the year," said Yuuji (Ted) 
Tamura, 61, a former program analyst with Rockwell International who was 
selected for the panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I have time now I decided to become involved, to learn something and 
see how it all works. But most of us have to work. The only people who can 
really spend a whole year on this is someone who is independently wealthy or 
retired. That's a reality that's hard to challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman, who led the unsuccessful legal 
challenge over the lack of Asian jurors, said he is pleased with the diversity 
of the 1994-95 panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me they are now attempting to comply with the law -- they have a 
diversified grand jury and a proper ethnic representation," Schulman said. 
"They obviously made some dynamic changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman and several other local defense attorneys have charged that Asians 
have been systematically excluded from serving on the grand jury. The attorneys 
were seeking the dismissal of indictments in several high-profile criminal 
cases, arguing that the lack of racial representation on the panel denied 
defendants their constitutional rights. A Superior Court judge in January 
rejected that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Rene Lynch contributed to this report. A More Diverse Panel 
</P>
<P>
 This year's grand jury will be slightly younger, somewhat less white and more 
likely to be retired.

I-5 REOPENING COULD DERAIL MASS TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU and DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the opening Wednesday of the entire Golden State Freeway in Santa 
Clarita for the first time in four months, hundreds of northern Los Angeles 
County commuters stuck to mass transit, following a routine adopted after the 
Northridge earthquake cut off road access to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates of public transportation warned that commuting alternatives such 
as the Metrolink train service must aggressively market themselves to attract 
new passengers and retain riders no longer held captive by impossible road 
conditions. And even then, experts said, mass transit will likely face an 
uphill climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep it in front of the public eye," said Santa Clarita City 
Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who is also a Metrolink alternate board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy that the I-5 is open from the standpoint that less will be 
happening to our city," Heidt said, noting that heavy traffic has clogged and 
rutted area roads. "On the other hand, I'm ambivalent about it. After the quake 
we were telling people to get out of their cars and take alternate 
transportation. What message are we sending to people now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Southbound lanes on the Golden State were opened Tuesday, three weeks earlier 
than expected. Two lanes on the northbound Gavin Canyon overpass were opened 
before dawn Wednesday after work crews finished clearing away The Old Road 
detour. The remaining lanes were opened by 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the freeway was available for a seamless commute, about 5,500 people 
Wednesday rode the periwinkle-and-white Metrolink trains to and from Downtown 
Los Angeles from the north, consistent with the average over the last two 
months, officials said. Deputy Executive Director David Solow said the rail 
service does not expect a sharp drop in patronage from the renaissance of the 
Golden State Freeway, which lies "substantially west of the Santa Clarita train 
station. It's not the right market." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials acknowledge that the real test will come in a few weeks when 
monthly passes expire and again at the end of July, when Caltrans expects to 
reopen the crucial interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
Freeway (Highway 14). 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the one that's a direct link" to Downtown for the vast majority of 
Metrolink riders from the north, Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they open the 14, we'll be praising God," said Merci Shaw, whose husband 
currently shuttles between Lancaster and Downtown Los Angeles by train. "For 
our family, the 5 means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 To persuade passengers like Shaw's husband to stay loyal, Metrolink is looking 
at ways to reward longtime riders through prizes or incentives similar to the 
frequent-flyer programs used by airlines, marketing manager Ray Shea said. A 
high-profile promotions campaign to draw new riders will begin next month, 
including a free trial-ride offer to be advertised in newspapers, over the 
airwaves and in direct mailings to about 400,000 households along the Santa 
Clarita and Ventura County rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are also scrambling to finish $50 million worth of track improvements 
by June 20, a few weeks ahead of schedule, to keep train use appealing by 
shaving another 26 minutes off the ride from Lancaster to Union Station. 
Currently, the journey takes two hours, eight minutes, already 17 minutes less 
than when Antelope Valley service was first instituted as a relief measure 
after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor was a blessing in disguise for Metrolink, which swiftly added five 
new stations on the Santa Clarita line and watched ridership shoot up from 
about 1,000 to nearly 22,000 a day in both directions. The number has since 
dropped to 5,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Golden State Freeway-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange is rebuilt,

 "Mass transit under any circumstances is not prepared to compete at all with 
heavily subsidized automobiles," said Martin Wachs, who teaches urban planning 
at UCLA. "The commuter will choose the mode of travel that is most convenient, 
cheapest and most reliable. For most people in most locations in most 
circumstances, that's the automobile, even with the promotional campaigns for 
mass transit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Solow said even a 25% to 30% increase over pre-quake levels -- or 1,300 
riders -- would match the retention rate of new riders by the Bay Area subway 
system after the Loma Prieta quake in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of north county Metrolink riders hold monthly passes, which have 
been discounted since the earthquake as a relief measure.

 Also Wednesday, Caltrans announced that the Fontana-based Brutoco Engineering 
and Construction Co. had finished repairing the eastbound side of the bridges 
at San Fernando Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek on the Simi Valley Freeway, 
the main artery across the northern San Fernando Valley. The work had been 
scheduled for completion Sunday.

INFANT DEATH RATE FALLS IN L.A. COUNTY; OBSTETRICS: OFFICIALS REPORT SUCCESS IN 
EASING THE LOAD ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. INADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE REMAINS 
AN AREA OF CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five years ago, Los Angeles County's public health system was overwhelmed by 
huge numbers of poor women looking for a place to give birth, many of whom had 
received no prenatal care, and infant mortality figures were on the rise. 
Today, county health officials are rejoicing over a modest decline in infant 
mortality and the success of efforts to ease the county's obstetrical crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Infant mortality fell from 9.3 deaths per 1,000 babies in 1988 to 7.2 deaths 
in 1992, according to a report from the March of Dimes and the county 
Department of Health Services. The number of babies born too small has also 
dipped slightly, as has the overall number of births. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems remain. The infant death rate among African American women is 
disturbingly high. Huge numbers of teen-agers are giving birth. And babies born 
to Latinas face an abnormally high risk of neural tube defects such as spina 
bifida, officials noted Wednesday at a forum at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it's a tremendous success story," said Dr. Irwin Silberman, director 
of family health programs at the Department of Health Services. "But the 
population of the county is changing fast. There is a lot of poverty and 
cultural issues to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Silberman credited the efforts of public and private agencies with easing the 
nightmarish scene in the county's obstetrical units five years ago. In 
particular, an expansion in Medi-Cal services gave more women access to care, 
and more private health providers were persuaded to accept Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal still pays for half of the births in the county, but county 
facilities serve only one-fifth of pregnant women today, compared to one-third 
in the late 1980s, Silberman said. The private sector lessened the burden on 
the county by absorbing more patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We helped organize the nonprofit, community-based clinics to provide the 
care," he said. "This has made a tremendous difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Early prenatal care includes educating mothers to avoid tobacco, drugs and 
alcohol and is associated with a much brighter outlook for newborns, including 
healthier birth weights.  
</P>
<P>
 Although they are cautiously optimistic over the improved infant death rate, 
health officials said they worry about substance abuse among pregnant women, 
high birth rates among young teen-agers and the possibility that state budget 
cuts could dismantle some prenatal care programs that have sprung up in the 
past five years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although we've made good progress since . . . 1990, there are serious 
questions on whether we can continue to maintain the current level of care and 
invest in improving the situation," said Dr. Bruce Allen, chairman of the March 
of Dimes Health Professional Advisory Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 540 births each day in the county, 140 babies are born to mothers who 
received prenatal care only late in their pregnancies or not at all, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic variations also continue to frustrate medical professionals. For 
instance, the infant mortality rate for African Americans is double that of the 
rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Substance abuse is also a problem among all races, with about 10% of all 
babies exposed prenatally to tobacco, drugs and alcohol (about 22,000 of the 
total 197,415 births in 1992). That statistic is based on urine tests at the 
time of delivery, health officials noted, and probably underrepresents the 
extent of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Latinas had the highest rate of substance abuse during pregnancy. 
African American women had a high rate of abusing illicit drugs, Latinas had a 
particularly high rate of alcohol abuse and whites had the highest rate of 
non-illicit drug and tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino babies had a higher-than-normal rate of neural tube defects, for 
unknown reasons.

CRIPS AND BLOODS FACTIONS PREPARE GROUND FOR WIDESPREAD GANG TRUCE; CEASE-FIRE: 
MORE THAN TWO DOZEN RIVAL GROUPS PLAN TO RAISE FUNDS TO SUPPORT LEGITIMATE 
BUSINESSES. THE PROFITS WOULD GO TOWARD RECREATIONAL CENTERS, DRUG TREATMENT 
AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES.

 Some of Los Angeles' most notorious Crips and Bloods factions Wednesday 
announced a cease-fire among more than two dozen rival groups, laying the 
foundation for what could be the most far-reaching truce yet among the city's 
black gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional gathering at a Crenshaw district youth center, "shot-callers" 
who once would have shot at each other -- in the name of the Rollin' 60s, 
Eight-Tray Gangsters, Hoover Crips or Black P. Stones -- arrived unarmed and 
exchanged embraces. Although their negotiations have been under way for nearly 
two months, they said they waited to reveal their efforts until they were sure 
that more than a decade of deadly violence had been halted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're black men -- not gangsters or hooligans or thugs -- but black men 
trying to take care of ourselves, our people, our women and our children," said 
Lil Cat, 32, one of about half a dozen ex-gang leaders on the cease-fire's 
coordinating council. "It's time to say: 'I love you, homeboy.' It don't matter 
where you from." The cease-fire is designed to rekindle some of the momentum 
lost since the 1992 riots, when Bloods and Crips first exchanged vows of peace 
in Watts. That truce, still a unifying force among the community's three 
largest housing-project gangs, never really caught on with most of Los Angeles 
County's 300 other Crips and Bloods factions. 
</P>
<P>
 The current effort is rooted in what South-Central gang members generally 
consider the Westside -- any turf between the Harbor Freeway and Inglewood. It 
is the domain of such infamous gangs as the Eight-Trays, which control the 
corner of Florence and Normandie; it is also home to their once-bitter enemies, 
the Rollin' 60s, who were responsible for the fatal 1988 shooting of a Japanese 
American woman in Westwood, which opened the eyes of many middle-class 
residents to the horrors of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started this mess," said Big Ship, a 30-year-old former gang leader from 
Gardena. "Now we got to clean it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as truce proponents in Watts tried to translate their efforts into 
economic development, the leaders of this cease-fire are forming a nonprofit 
corporation to stimulate legitimate business deals for former Bloods and Crips. 
They have dubbed themselves BEGIN TO, for Black Generations in Neutral Taking 
Off. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a preliminary business proposal, the gangs plan to raise $5,000 in at 
least 20 neighborhoods by holding dances and basketball games. Once they have 
amassed an investment pool of $100,000, they hope to spawn enough 
entrepreneurial ventures to fund recreational centers, arts-and-crafts fairs 
and drug-treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're basically saying is, 'Give a man a fish and you'll feed him for 
a day; teach him how to fish, and you'll feed him for a lifetime,' " said 
Chilton Alphonse, whose Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation has served 
as a neutral site for the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time people are willing to lay down their arms for a legitimate purpose, 
they should definitely be praised," said Anthony Thomas, Mayor Richard 
Riordan's liaison to South-Central, who has attended two of the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a native myself of South Los Angeles, I would like to assist anything that 
furthers the peace effort," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities tend to view such truces with skepticism, noting 
that the cycle of retaliation sometimes ends up replaced by more financially 
rewarding mayhem. But Lt. Dennis Shirey, head of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's anti-gang unit in South Los Angeles, said he welcomes any effort 
to save lives. Although he has yet to see evidence of gang-related crime 
dropping in truce neighborhoods, Shirey said, "If they're successful and they 
can pull it off, it's great."

COMPROMISING POSITIONS; TORRANCE STEAMED UP OVER TALES ABOUT STRIPPERS, 
BUSINESSMAN AND POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ken Jeter considers himself a friend of the Torrance police. The owner of a 
nude-entertainment business, Jeter has advertised in a police publication, 
donated to the baseball team, hired an off-duty patrolman to do painting, and 
sold cellular telephones to officers at rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Torrance police officers also think quite a lot of Jeter -- or at least 
they did until recently.  
</P>
<P>
 For the better part of a year, neighbors say, patrolmen made a habit of 
dropping by Jeter's home -- day and night -- to see the Louisiana native and 
his strippers, some of whom visit between jobs to play cards and dip in the 
Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Squad cars were so commonplace outside the tidy house on 242nd Street that the 
neighborhood postal carrier said she believed Torrance officers lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cops came by after duty, and only now and then," says Jeter, 36. "It is 
nothing illegal. It is good, clean fun."  
</P>
<P>
 Just how friendly relations were among Jeter, his visiting nude dancers and 
the police has become a steamy subject in Torrance. In this normally sedate 
South Bay city of 130,000, where one of the most eagerly anticipated events is 
the annual Armed Forces Day Parade, Jeter's Ten Plus Entertainment is a 
one-of-a-kind -- and not particularly welcome -- enterprise. Each month, Jeter 
says, he dispatches about 25 female and male strippers to several hundred 
bachelor and other private parties across Los Angeles -- including, over the 
years, several for Torrance police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The officers) would come, go into the house and laugh and carry on with the 
girls," said Ray Dracoules, a next-door neighbor who has reported several loud 
parties to police, only to see the responding officers join the fray. "What are 
you going to do, call the police on the police?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The parade of officers has trailed off over the past few weeks, neighbors say, 
thanks to the unusually public unraveling of relations between Jeter and two 
former business colleagues -- both of whom have had troubles with the law -- 
and the bandwagon effect it has had among Jeter's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The messy breakups have cast an unflattering light on Jeter's sometimes 
bizarre business dealings, and have exposed the comings and goings of the 
Torrance officers from his home. The revelations have so embarrassed the police 
that the department has launched investigations into the activities of its 
patrolmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter's two former associates -- a onetime partner now in jail awaiting trial 
on charges of kidnaping his ex-wife, and a stripper arrested in February on 
suspicion of prostitution -- have made a wide range of allegations to 
investigators. The local newspaper, the Daily Breeze, has splashed their 
allegations, along with those of several unidentified former Ten Plus 
employees, atop its front page on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 The stripper, Leanna Rasmussen, had a falling out with Jeter after she and 
another stripper were arrested on suspicion of prostitution during a Ten Plus 
job at the Los Angeles Airport Hilton. Undercover Los Angeles police broke up a 
bachelor party at the hotel when the two women allegedly began touching each 
other in a sexual manner, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasmussen was never charged in the case, but when Jeter refused to provide her 
with an attorney, the stripper sued him for breach of contract. She says she 
was never told the act, which involved the use of vibrators, was illegal. Jeter 
said she was an independent contractor responsible for her own actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The former business partner, Felix de la Cruz, parted with Jeter last year 
after going through an unfriendly divorce from his wife. Jeter sided with the 
wife, and De La Cruz blamed him for the breakup, Jeter said. De La Cruz was 
arrested last month in the kidnaping of his ex-wife after police found her 
being held by an armed guard in Mexicali, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months before the kidnaping, police say, De La Cruz called police to 
report that Torrance officers were acting as escorts for Jeter's strippers. 
Allegations by De La Cruz, Rasmussen and other former Ten Plus employees also 
included charges that two unidentified officers regularly had sex with a 
stripper at Jeter's home and that several on-duty officers monitored dispatch 
calls on portable radios from inside the Jeter home. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations, coupled with complaints by neighbors, have led to two 
internal affairs investigations by Torrance police and a raid of the Ten Plus 
Entertainment office on Hawthorne Boulevard, a two-room suite where parties are 
booked and customers peruse picture books of strippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd like to think police officers have more of a moral fiber than that," 
said Jeter's neighbor, Nancy Wolfram, who has watched squad cars pull up 
outside his home.  
</P>
<P>
 The first internal police investigation, conducted with the help of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, found no officer misconduct, according to department 
spokesman Sgt. Dave Smith. As part of the investigation, four people -- 
including Rasmussen -- were arrested in the undercover sting operation and 
office raid, but none was charged with a crime, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second inquiry, which focuses on the police visits to Jeter's home, will 
not be completed for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Ten Plus Entertainment remains open and has even enjoyed a 
boomlet in business because of the publicity. Smith said police are reviewing 
the company's business license application for possible irregularities, but 
neither Jeter nor Ten Plus is under criminal investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say life has not changed dramatically for Jeter, a former car 
salesman who moved to Los Angeles from an oil job in Texas seven years ago. His 
relations with the Torrance Police Department turned cool after the February 
undercover operation and then plunged into a deep-freeze when his former 
associates began talking publicly about his coziness with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police look the other way when they see me now," Jeter said from an 
overstuffed couch in the living room of his two-story home, which he shares 
with his 11-year-old son and longtime girlfriend, Debbie, a retired stripper 
who uses Jeter's last name. "I saw two of them the other night at the grocery 
store and they went in the other direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, Jeter says, his company has booked half a dozen 
parties for Torrance officers, and he gradually got to know a handful of 
patrolmen who worked his neighborhood or attended the parties. Jeter said even 
the officer who oversees the department's intelligence operations and 
participated in the February sting operation, Detective Steve Carr, has 
attended one of his bachelor parties. Carr denies it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything wrong in what they have done, but I guess it can be 
embarrassing for them," said Jeter in the thick accent of his native Louisiana, 
rattling off the names of his strippers who say they've seen Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Brannan, Jeter's attorney and partner in a Las Vegas nude-dancing 
business, said Torrance police seem bent on covering their tracks by coming 
down hard on Jeter and Ten Plus. He said officers who stopped by Jeter's home 
were visiting Ken and Debbie, or responding to neighbors' complaints about loud 
parties at Jeter's -- or simply handling routine crime calls.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Brannan added, even if police came to Jeter's home looking for 
strippers, there is no reason for outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were in the Torrance Police Department and you knew this guy who was 
in the nude-entertainment business had an open-door policy, you might be 
tempted to stop by and go sightseeing. I think that is a human male reaction, 
not a reaction that would be unique to the Torrance Police Department," Brannan 
said. "Being a vice cop in Torrance must be the law enforcement equivalent of 
being a Maytag repairman."  
</P>
<P>
 Jeter's notoriety has also soured relations with neighbors in his 242nd Street 
neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeter has rented a three-bedroom house with a small front yard for about two 
years, one of five nearly identical models near Walteria Park. He says he has 
gotten along with most of his neighbors, but since his woes became public, has 
listened in disbelief as some neighbors bad-mouth him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter's most vocal critics, next-door neighbors Ray and Susan Dracoules, 
relate a different version of events. They say Jeter became widely unpopular 
when he began holding loud parties with scantily clad girls shortly after 
arriving in the neighborhood. Some neighbors forbade their children to go to 
the Jeter house, they said, because they disapproved of Jeter's business and 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time we looked down and there were four women wearing nothing more than 
high heels and a patch doing everything imaginable to the (deck) pole," said 
Susan Dracoules, who has a bird's-eye view of Jeter's side-yard deck and 
Jacuzzi from a second-story window. "One morning I woke up when a woman in a 
pink Miata was screaming at a policeman outside. I think she got attached to 
him, and they were having a lovers' quarrel." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter acknowledges that police officers have dated strippers who work for him, 
and some may even have socialized at his home. But he said it was not his place 
to dictate the private lives of his employees or the police. He said the 
Dracouleses are nosy neighbors who should mind their own business. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, the Dracouleses have written to Jeter's landlord asking to have him 
evicted, and have reported him to Torrance building inspectors for installing 
the deck and Jacuzzi without a permit. Jeter in turn has asked the city's 
animal control board to revoke the Dracoules' special permit allowing three 
dogs on their property, one more than permitted under city code. 
</P>
<P>
 All this makes Jeter feel like he is trapped in a bad cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like one of those where Elmer Fudd is always chasing Bugs Bunny -- and 
I am Bugs Bunny," he said.

CLASS-ACTION SUIT ALLEGES GENDER BIAS IN LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women in the Los Angeles Police Department are subject to pervasive harassment 
and discrimination, a dozen Police Department employees claimed in a federal 
class-action suit filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by attorneys as the most ambitious gender-based lawsuit ever filed 
against a police department, the 47-page complaint alleges that women are 
unfairly treated throughout the department from the moment they are recruited 
until the day they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed on behalf of 11 women and one man -- all but one of whom still work for 
the department -- the suit seeks widespread changes in department practices, 
including hiring, promotions and the manner in which sexual harassment and 
discrimination complaints are handled. It also seeks unspecified compensatory 
and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourteen years ago, my career started with the Academy staff telling me to go 
back to teaching and be a good little girl," the lead plaintiff, Detective 
Terry Tipton-Whittingham, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 14 years," she continued, "I've suffered racial remarks, sexist 
comments, seen sexist posters on the walls. I've been a victim of pranks. I've 
had my butt grabbed by a fellow officer while other officers . . . watched and 
laughed. I've had false complaints filed against me. . . . It is clear to me 
that because I'm black and especially because I'm female, I will never be 
treated fairly (in) this department." 
</P>
<P>
 An LAPD spokesman said the department would have no comment on the suit, filed 
by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, and the law firm Litt & Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. James K. Hahn complained that it was part of an ACLU effort to 
run the Police Department by court order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city is already making significant progress," Hahn said. "I don't 
think this lawsuit was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Just one day before the suit was filed, Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
announced a number of proposed reforms, including the creation of a specialized 
unit to investigate harassment and discrimination complaints of all kinds, 
whether involving ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. He said he wants 
officers to receive harassment training and has ordered that every departing 
employee be questioned about bias and harassment problems.  
</P>
<P>
 The staffing of the West Los Angeles police station -- which has a 
longstanding reputation for hostility to women -- is also being reshuffled in 
the wake of a department review of the working conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions follow growing publicity about the filing of a number of 
individual lawsuits by female police officers who allege discrimination, 
harassment and even sexual assaults by fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although saying that they believe Williams is sincere in his efforts to reform 
the department, the plaintiffs' attorneys contended that nothing short of a 
federal court order will rid the force of hostile and discriminatory practices 
against women, whether they are patrol officers or stenographers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harassment in this department is ongoing," ACLU attorney Carol Sobel said. 
"Whatever the chief thinks is being done, the word is not getting out beyond 
his office." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's advocates urged city officials to settle the suit quickly by agreeing 
to specific reforms rather than engaging in a long court battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a single taxpayer dollar should be spent defending this," said Katherine 
Spillar, national coordinator of the Feminist Majority. "Instead the city 
should view this as an opportunity to reach a workable agreement on how they're 
going to get women closer to 50% (of the) force and put in place the process to 
eliminate discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said any settlement would have to be at the direction of the City 
Council, but that if it were up to him, he would go to trial. "I feel this is 
just full of outrageous claims they can't support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the plaintiffs at the news conference tearfully described a 
working atmosphere in which they said they were belittled, sexually harassed 
and retaliated against if they dared complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Gonzalez, a clerk-typist, said she was repeatedly touched in a sexual 
manner by someone who has since been promoted to sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenographer Eleanor Santos said male employees frequently made suggestive 
comments and one pinched her breasts so hard they "turned blue. Management does 
not take care of the problem," she said. "You are left alone by yourself and 
treated like a troublemaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Joseph M. Peyton, a plaintiff who has long worked in human resources, 
complained of "the swaggering arrogance" of some officers and Internal Affairs 
investigators, who he said violate the rights of female officers and attempt to 
discredit them.LOS ANGELES POLI

 Library cardholders may be justifiably confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had books checked out from a San Fernando Valley library when the 
earthquake closed the city system branches were told to keep them at home until 
the branches reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the ensuing weeks and months, notices were sent warning that fines were 
owed for overdue books. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who ignored those notices, a second warning was issued saying they 
were being billed for the cost of the book, now considered lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Now wait a minute. Who do you believe? The library? Or, uh, the library? 
</P>
<P>
 The library would like you to stop worrying. No one will be fined. And this 
will not go down on your permanent record. Books can be returned to any open 
branch, but, library officials say, people don't really have to. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine notices are being printed by a computer system that will be replaced 
in the next six months. The problem is, the old program can't be overridden. 
Library officials can't tell the computer not to issue fines from the branches 
damaged in the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the old system if a book isn't returned, it spits out an overdue notice," 
said Robert Reagan, libraries spokesman. "With the old system, you can't get in 
there and disregard these branches." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, at a cost of 50 cents each, two notices were sent out to each person with 
a book from any branch closed after the Jan. 17 earthquake. Nine branches in 
the San Fernando Valley remain closed, according to library officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who wants to can take their book and their overdue notice to an open 
branch and have their record cleared," Reagan said. But those who would rather 
just hold on to their books can wait until their local branch reopens, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go in and clean the records after the branches are opened," Reagan 
said. "Nobody is going to be done dirt. Their credit won't be ruined." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan said library officials have no idea how many unnecessary notices were 
sent out, and therefore, can't estimate how much printing and mailing the 
unnecessary notices cost the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to extract from overall notices that went out which ones were 
for closed branches," he said. "We can't even tell you how many books are out 
from any given branch because under this present system you would have to take 
the shelf list and take the inventory of the books." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley branch in Reseda, the busiest in the city and one of those 
closed after the earthquake, averaged 22,000 to 23,000 books in circulation on 
any given day, said Librarian Chris Parsons. Which would mean that for that 
branch alone, the city spent $22,000 or $23,000 to mail the notices. Officials 
in other closed branch libraries in the Valley couldn't be reached for 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And library workers couldn't just not mail notices to the affected areas, 
Reagan pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you happen to live in Woodland Hills does not mean you took the book 
out of Woodland Hills. What shows on the overdue notice is your name and 
address. You have to get to the rest of the form to find out the rest of the 
information," he said, adding that the rest of the form is in the computer and 
not accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the scope of the things that have happened in the wake of the 
earthquake, this probably isn't a huge expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about which branches remain closed, call (213) 228-7104 
for a recording in English and Spanish.

STATE TO MOVE SHERMAN OAKS PAROLE OFFICE; CORRECTIONS: FACILITY, WHICH WAS 
LOCATED ACROSS THE STREET FROM RECREATION CENTER, WILL BE RETURNED TO NORTH 
HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to pressure from an influential homeowners group and politicians, state 
officials announced Wednesday they will move a parole office they opened less 
than one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had argued that its location at 5121 Van Nuys Blvd. -- directly 
across the street from the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Recreation Center -- violates 
the state Corrections Department's own guidelines for placing parole offices 
away from parks and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The announced move was lauded by the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. but 
bitterly criticized by residents of Van Nuys and North Hollywood, who 
complained that parole offices in their less-glamorous neighborhoods never 
generated the same swift political response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it right to introduce the fox to the henhouse in some other area?" Van 
Nuys activist Candace Campbell asked politicians during a news conference at 
the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Other angry residents carried signs that said, "Stop Dumping in Van Nuys" and 
"Van Nuys Residents Also Vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, officials said, the parole office will not return to an old location 
in Van Nuys, near Hazeltine Street and Victory Boulevard, but to one in North 
Hollywood near the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Vanowen Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The move back to 6736 Laurel Canyon Blvd. will be complete within 90 days and 
only administrative work and training will remain at the Sherman Oaks location, 
pledged Corrections Director James Gomez. Parolees' visits there -- an 
estimated 35 to 40 a day -- will be phased out over the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys and North Hollywood facilities had become overcrowded and were 
closed in favor of a single, larger office in Sherman Oaks meant to monitor 
about 4,100 convicted felons who served time in state prison and now live in 
the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials settled on the Sherman Oaks building -- despite its 
location across from a park and senior citizens center -- because it was the 
only lease they could secure after a two-year search, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the former Watterson College Building was among 29 sites considered, 
and that the landlords of the 28 other properties withdrew from negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the choice began generating controversy soon after it opened on April 25 
when residents started phoning police and politicians to express fears that 
seasoned criminals would loiter around the office and prey upon the children 
and senior citizens using the park across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% to 20% of California's paroled felons are rearrested, prosecuted and 
returned to state prisons, and law enforcement authorities say there is a 
significant overlap between neighborhoods plagued by high crime rates and those 
where parolees congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the parole offices that operated in Van Nuys and North Hollywood 
for five and 10 years, respectively, did so virtually without notice by 
residents and left no record of complaints, said Regional Parole Administrator 
Jerry DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the new office in Sherman Oaks generated no known crimes or other 
problems during its brief, 3 1/2-week life, DiMaggio and other officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no foundation for the hysteria," DiMaggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Gomez said the move back to North Hollywood will be complicated because 
a new lease will have to be renegotiated and the staffs of two overcrowded 
offices will be crammed into one. Their plans also call for moving the 
administrative staff from an earthquake-damaged building downtown to the 
Sherman Oaks facility, leased to the department for about $2 million over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who led the effort to have the parole office moved -- homeowners 
association President Richard Close, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, state 
Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) and state Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman 
(D-North Hollywood) -- lavished praise on each other Wednesday for a response 
they described as unprecedented in terms of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 19 years of activism, I've never seen such fast work by government 
officials," Close said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry also prompted Friedman and Roberti to introduce legislation 
requiring the Corrections Department to be more specific when it notifies 
elected officials about plans for a new parole office. A notice about the 
Sherman Oaks office sent out last year, for example, stated its address but did 
not mention the potential use. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez promised Wednesday the department will change its notification form. 
"They are right," he said, "it is inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in exchange for franker notices and the agreement to move from Sherman 
Oaks, the state's policy of placing parole offices at least a quarter of a mile 
from schools and parks will remain a guideline only and not be codified into 
law, Friedman said. Originally, the bill would have made the quarter-mile 
buffer mandatory, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 One North Hollywood resident who opposes the parole office's return there 
charged Wednesday that the Laurel Canyon site also violates the state's 
quarter-mile guidelines. Marlene Aragon said it is two-tenths of a mile from 
the North Hollywood Park and Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish they'd consider the whole Valley," Aragon said. "They've been 
looking out for Sherman Oaks' interests. . . . What we need is some balance."

GANG MAKES SWEEPING CHANGE; VAN NUYS: MEMBERS OF BAD BOYS CLEAN UP AROUND AN 
APARTMENT COMPLEX THEY ONCE TAGGED AND TERRORIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bad Boys gang members used to run to this alley for safety when they spotted 
LAPD Officer Angel Munoz bearing down on them. 
</P>
<P>
 This time was different. This time gang members walked somberly to the middle 
of the alley, tossed aside their jackets, and grabbed the handles of something 
Munoz would respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Working under the watchful eyes of Munoz and several other officers, a dozen 
Bad Boys gang members Wednesday traded guns for brooms to sweep fear from the 
Van Nuys apartment building that they once tagged and terrorized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no running anymore," said Ralph, a soft-spoken, burly Latino who 
would not give his full name, fearing gang retaliation. "We want to make a 
positive impact on the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "A few weeks ago, they just showed up and said they wanted to clean," said 
former police officer Hector Rodriquez, manager of the Hayvenhurst Avenue 
complex. "This building used to be plagued by gangs. There were drug dealings, 
murders. This is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, who ranged in age from 12 to their mid-20s, sported sunglasses, 
tattoos and a few Raiders jackets as they swept beer bottles, food wrappers and 
dust into waiting trash bins. During breaks, they chatted with officers and 
snacked on coffee and doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The four hours of work helped wash away the memory of a decade of destruction, 
when members of the Bad Boys claimed the apartment complex as their turf, 
challenging anyone who tried to halt their activities in the 91-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Lives were threatened, children were told not to play outside and two bodies 
appeared on the front lawn. Police said six area homicides had been attributed 
to the 70-member gang in the last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, however, the animosity between police and gang members has 
begun to fade -- replaced by an unusual feeling of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the opening provided by last summer's gang truce, officers with 
the Van Nuys station's anti-gang CRASH unit opened a dialogue with the gang. 
And Rodriquez, an ex-police officer from North Hollywood, tried politely asking 
gang members to curb their activities -- instead of calling the police to run 
them off the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph, who had lived in the building for 10 years, made a deal to remove the 
gang from the premises, including the back-alley drug trade that had financed 
the gang's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we started talking to them, it's made a lot of difference," said Ralph, 
who said he has been in prison four times. "We've realized, 'What good is it 
going to do to keep fighting among ourselves?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Munoz promised to help find jobs for gang members, some of whom are 
undocumented and speak limited English. The first job, at a movie studio, 
begins for one of the members next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're starting to realize that gangbanging has no future," said Munoz. "We 
cannot solve all the problems, just guide them where to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thankful tenants of the building appreciate that guidance. One 
47-year-old woman, who asked not to be identified, said she no longer fears the 
gang that once threatened her because they believed she was a snitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when the gang boys see me walking home, they say 'hello' to me," said the 
woman. "This is a good example for the rest of the gangs."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RIORDAN 
HAILS CLINTON PLAN TO CUT RANKS OF HOMELESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Wednesday hailed a proposal that the 
Clinton Administration claims could reduce the number of homeless by a third in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Priority: Home!" would give local governments more responsibility for 
providing emergency housing and treatment for substance abuse, mental illness 
and other problems of the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros also wants to double funding for homelessness 
programs to $1.7 billion in 1995. Los Angeles could get an additional $39 
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman and a young girl were struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver 
Wednesday in the intersection of Montague Street and Laurel Canyon Boulevard in 
Pacoima, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victims were described as a Latina in her 30s and a girl 
about 12, said Frank Zdroy of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the car was a red Mustang. Red paint chips and pieces of 
a broken headlight were found at the scene, Zdroy said, and there was evidence 
that the car's left front section and a headlight were damaged in the 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for the motorist late Wednesday night, Zdroy said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PROSECUTORS SEEK ONLY 
ONE JURY IN MENENDEZ RETRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors have disclosed that they want to try both Lyle and Eric Menendez 
before one jury and do not intend to call their star witness from the first 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy legal brief filed Monday by the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office, they disclosed tidbits of new evidence and said they do not 
intend to call Beverly Hills psychologist L. Jerome Oziel as a witness in the 
retrial.  
</P>
<P>
 The only reason to call Oziel, prosecutors said, would be to explain how he 
made a Dec. 11, 1989, tape recording in which the brothers tell him what led 
them to kill their parents. The tape, prosecutors said, speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-page legal brief marked the opening round of strategic sparring as the 
prosecution and the defense gear up for the retrial of Lyle, 26, and Erik, 23, 
charged with murder in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial ended in January when separate juries deadlocked between 
murder and lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries heard the first trial because some evidence applied separately to 
either of the brothers. Prosecutors said in the legal papers that a single jury 
could sort it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers admit the slayings but contend that they killed in fear after 
years of abuse. Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and 
greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg has scheduled a June 27 
hearing to set a new trial date. Defense attorneys are scheduled to file their 
tactical plan in a legal brief June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors made no mention in their brief of what happened in the first 
trial. Oziel testified that the brothers had confessed to him on Oct. 31 and 
Nov. 2, 1989, but was then hammered on cross-examination for nearly a week, 
mostly about an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Dec. 11, 1989, tape the brothers maintain that they killed their mother 
because she was suicidal and their father because his infidelity had driven her 
to despair. The brothers never mention abuse or self-defense on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 That tape, however, did not become available until late in the trial. After 
months of legal wrangling, Weisberg ruled that it could be played for jurors. 
Then, defense attorneys played it first. 
</P>
<P>
 In the legal brief filed Monday, prosecutors said they intend to play the tape 
early in the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also said they plan to pursue new evidence, among it the testimony 
of a friend who asked Erik Menendez why his application to UCLA was on the 
coffee table when the brothers burst into the TV room of the family's Beverly 
Hills house and killed their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the prosecution, the friend asked Erik Menendez: "Why would 
(Kitty Menendez) be filling out a college application if she was planning on 
killing you? How are you going to get out of that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The younger brother replied: "That's a problem but we're working on that."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING JUROR 
REPRIMANDED FOR USE OF DICTIONARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A juror who brought a dictionary to the jury room Wednesday to look up the 
word reprehensible got a lecture from the judge in the Rodney G. King civil 
trial.  
</P>
<P>
 "The law is not to be found in Webster's dictionary," U.S. District Judge John 
G. Davies said."It's to be found in the (court's) instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies said the slip-up was harmless, and attorneys for both sides agreed. The 
judge confiscated the dictionary and told the jurors that they should turn to 
him for definitions during deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The word reprehensible appears in several places in Davies' written 
instructions on the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The interlude came as the panel began its first full day of deliberations in 
the punitive phase of the trial. It went home late in the afternoon without 
reaching a verdict and was scheduled to resume deliberations today. The same 
jury awarded King more than $3.8 million in compensatory damages from the city 
April 19. King is asking that six police officers, including two serving time 
in federal prison for their roles in his March 3, 1991, beating, pay punitive 
damages.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; STUDENTS GAIN CONFIDENCE, JOB SKILLS AT DWP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 14 special education students at John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, 
a unique program has meant the opportunity to learn firsthand the satisfaction 
of a job well-done. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the program are getting work experience through part-time jobs at 
the Department of Water and Power computer center across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 By sorting mail, stocking the warehouse and working with computers, they earn 
credit toward their diplomas and about $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The special education section of the Youth Service Academy -- a program 
sponsored by the DWP, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the mayor's 
office -- is completing its first academic year, and teachers are calling it a 
rousing success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the students felt their future was very bleak," said Arlene Dole 
Jaffee, a special education teacher at Polytechnic High in Sun Valley. "Now 
they feel they can be participants in life after school." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan L. Valdovinos, a junior, said he feels more confident about getting a job 
after graduation since he started working at the DWP facility. Valdovinos works 
as a mail room clerk, sorting mail and stuffing envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like my job," said Valdovinos, who has memory problems and difficulties 
understanding complicated instructions.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like what I'm doing. It's pretty nice having my own money and helping my 
parents with the bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Students work four days a week, and on Friday afternoons attend a class on 
workplace etiquette taught by program co-coordinator Jodee Mora. 
</P>
<P>
 Students got plenty of support when they began their jobs. For the first few 
weeks, teachers acting as job coaches helped students understand their job 
duties.  
</P>
<P>
 Students continue to work under supervisors called mentors, DWP employees who 
have volunteered to provide needed guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants were placed in a variety of departments and given jobs that match 
their abilities. Maria Castaneda, 17, who has visual learning problems and uses 
a wheelchair, works in the billing department, making sure that check amounts 
and bill amounts match. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Curtis Huffey cleans and restocks the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Sangita Sohal logs new service requests into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP employees said they are impressed with both the quality of the students' 
work as well as of their desire to do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first started, their confidence was low," said Fred Katevas, an 
alternate mentor who works in the warehouse. "Once they learned how to do it, 
their confidence just blossomed." KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; NEIGHBOR HELPS SAVE WOMAN FROM BLAZE 
</P>

 A 57-year-old woman was saved from a fire started by a cigarette in Burbank 
when a neighbor awoke to the sound of breaking glass early Wednesday morning, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Redington suffered second- and third-degree burns to a leg and an arm in 
the fire that started at 3 a.m. Wednesday, Burbank Fire Marshall Darryl Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was touched off by Redington's cigarette when she either fell asleep 
or dropped it on the couch, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Helmace, a neighbor across the street on North Evergreen Street, heard 
the living room window shatter as the fire spread and called 911. He ran across 
the street and although he could hear the woman in the house, he could not get 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Police Sgt. Eric Rosoff arrived and kicked in the front door, but 
could not get past the heat and flames. A few minutes later, Burbank 
firefighters were able to enter and found Redington in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes did not know if Redington was still conscious when she was rescued, but 
she was able to talk to paramedics on the way to the St. Joseph Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused $30,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes said Redington was saved because Helmace reported the fire so early and 
told rescuers that there was a woman trapped inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, her condition would have been much worse -- if not dead -- had 
he not responded as quickly," Forbes said. Redington was later transferred to 
UCLA Medical Center, but her condition was not available from a hospital 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire was put out, Forbes found a pet Chihuahua in the dining room 
apparently groggy from smoke inhalation. "It's being taken care of by 
neighbors," Forbes said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; SCHOOL WINS AWARD FOR RECYCLING EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students from La Verne Heights Elementary School looked high and low for a 
visual almanac for their computer software, and they found it in Burbank on 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants this," said Kenya Cox, a fifth-grader who headed the La Verne 
school's KidsCan campaign. Holding the software package the school won, Kenya 
said, "We couldn't find it anywhere, and now we got it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony for the winning school was held Wednesday at Theodore Roosevelt 
Elementary School in Burbank to show off the school's computer lab. Actors 
dressed as Fred and Wilma Flintstone were on the stage along with Walter 
Koenig, who played Chekov on the original "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne Heights Elementary was named top recycler by KidsCan, a joint-venture 
program, after students collected 5,800 cans and bottles in four weeks, earning 
$225 for their school. The money was used to buy a new laser printer for the 
school's computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 KidsCan is a joint venture of Los Angeles-based Technology for Results in 
Elementary Education (TREE) and Environmental Products Corp. of Fairfax, Va., 
which manufactures automatic recycling machines. Under the project, about 40 
Los Angeles-area schools recycle bottles and cans, using the proceeds to buy 
computer equipment. KidsCan started in October, and organizers are hoping to 
expand it statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to show that we want to go from the primitive kind of classroom to the 
classroom of the 21st Century," said Alice McHugh, president of TREE. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for whatever levels the playing field for students," Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The point for educators is that the KidsCan project -- which includes schools 
from affluent Yorba Linda as well as South-Central Los Angeles -- gives schools 
a chance to buy much-needed computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology is here to stay," said Bonnie Powell, principal of Roosevelt 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 "As educators, we owe it to our children to usher them into this age of 
technology with confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling had already been a big theme with La Verne Heights Elementary 
School, Kenya said. The school already had programs for recycling lunch trays 
and white paper. They also offer incentives such as small prizes to encourage 
kids to donate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced of the fact that we must have some of the most unhealthy kids 
from all the soda cans," Kenya said. "We had a lot of fun with this." ED BOND

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERMAN OAKS; BANK 
ROBBERY SUSPECT SLAIN BY POLICE LINKED TO 20 HEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An alleged bank robber shot and killed in Sherman Oaks by Los Angeles police 
was identified Wednesday as a Palmdale man suspected of robbing as many as 20 
banks in the last six months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Paul Guerrero, 34, was shot by two Los Angeles police officers Tuesday 
afternoon in a church parking lot after he fled a California Federal Bank 
branch he allegedly tried to rob.The police officers, who had staked out the 
bank, said Guerrero threatened them with a knife when they cornered him in the 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the LAPD's Metro Division operated an undercover surveillance 
operation at California Federal and at least one other bank for a week in an 
attempt to catch the robber, who they believe had robbed 10 other banks in the 
San Fernando Valley, one in Glendale and several others in Los Angeles, said 
Lt. John Dunkin, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said police have evidence that Guerrero robbed a bank in Woodland Hills 
only an hour before he was spotted by them in Sherman Oaks.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
USE TAX MONEY FOR SOME WORLD CUP COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City taxpayers will absorb some costs for a World Cup festival and the 
installation of thousands of street banners for the soccer tournament, the Los 
Angeles City Council decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council granted waivers that include $161,000 to $184,000 in permit fees 
for 3,500 to 4,000 light pole banners and discounted rent for a festival at the 
Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to host eight of the World Cup games, including the semifinals and the 
finals, is a boost to the city of Los Angeles," Council President John Ferraro 
said. "I think it would be a shame if we don't do everything we can to 
cooperate with the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect the arrival of soccer fans to be a boon for the city's 
flagging tourism industry. The local matches will be played at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena. The quadrennial event kicks off June 17.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 200,000 fans also are expected to attend the 10-day SoccerFest at 
the Convention Center.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
COURT CLERKS STAGE JOB SICKOUT FOR 2ND DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large number of union court clerks and judicial assistants in Los Angeles 
County failed to show up for work for a second straight day Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A court spokeswoman said the absentee rate was about the same as Wednesday's 
71% in state and county courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the impact to be even greater as the cumulative strain is 
aggravated in the court system," said J. Timothy Fives of Local 575 of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett said "we have a couple more out" 
Wednesday in the Downtown County Courthouse. She said 52 of 80 clerks and 
judicial assistants there called in sick. On Tuesday, 277 of 380 clerks and 
assistants took sick days.  
</P>
<P>
 Fives said 329 of the 380 are members of the association, and that his head 
count showed that 220 stayed home because of the job action. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers and administrators filled in for the absentees and some judges 
recorded their own proceedings, Hayslett said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; MORE AILING TURTLES EXPECTED TO DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several dozen more turtles rescued from the back of a van in a West Hills 
apartment complex are expected to die, although most of the 950 surviving 
reptiles are recovering nicely at an animal shelter in Los Angeles, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are not responding to medication and they are very sick," said Rose 
Channer, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals/Southern California Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried and suspicious neighbors last Friday asked two workmen on the premises 
to check out the foul smell coming from a parked white van. The workers opened 
the unlocked vehicle and discovered about 1,000 turtles packed in burlap sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 All the turtles are terrapin or fresh water pond turtles and none are 
endangered species, Channer said 
</P>
<P>
 The healthy turtles are being housed in 25 children's wading pools with heat 
lamps to keep them warm. There are cinder blocks placed in the 18-inch deep 
pools so they can get out of the water, Channer said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of about 400 calls the animal rights group has received since 
Monday were from people who wanted to donate money to buy food and medicine for 
the turtles, said Channer, who estimated the cost for caring for the reptiles 
at about $1,700 each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not prepared to feed 1,000 turtles and buy special medications," 
Channer said. "At this point, we don't need items because we purchased them. 
But we still need financial help." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who wish to adopt a turtle or two will have to wait because the reptiles 
are considered evidence in an ongoing SPCA investigation that is expected to 
last a few more weeks, Channer said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the society is taking names and phone numbers of people who want to 
adopt, and will call them later if turtles become available. CHAU LAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; SOUTH-CENTRAL PASTOR ADDRESSES CLERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he was asked to speak on "rebuilding Los Angeles" at the monthly Clergy 
Network lunch in the San Fernando Valley, the pastor and community leader from 
South-Central Los Angeles demurred Wednesday and said that he preferred to talk 
about "building" instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rebuilding is like remarrying," said the Rev. Cecil (Chip) Murray of First 
African Methodist Church of Los Angeles."If the same people come back together, 
they are going to have the same problems they had before." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, lauded two years ago during and after the rioting in Los Angeles for 
leading conciliation efforts, told nearly 50 clergy meeting at Woodland Care 
Center that new programs are needed to boost the economic productivity of the 
black community. 
</P>
<P>
 As indicators of what can be done, Murray cited nonprofit programs connected 
to his 9,000-member church that have made more than 60 loans to small 
businesses, received large corporate donations from Disney and Arco to help 
with jobs and the training of entrepreneurs, and employed former prisoners in a 
project making low-flush toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray praised revitalized relations in recent years between African American 
pastors and Jewish rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black-Jewish coalition must stand," Murray said, adding that only a 
minority of black churches deal in community action programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister said, in answering a question, that he holds Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan in high esteem although Murray said he wishes Riordan would do 
more things to directly aid poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a corporate person, he's hoping there will be a trickling down," Murray 
said. "(Riordan) agrees with me, but I don't know if the public will let him do 
much besides making the streets safe." JOHN DART

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; MAN TO FACE TRIAL IN ASSAULT, CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man has been ordered to stand trial on charges resulting from 
an alleged assault and two-hour car chase Sunday morning, during which he drove 
the speed limit and obeyed most traffic signals, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ion Rada, 31, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to three counts of battery and one 
count each of drunk driving, evading a police officer and resisting arrest.He 
is being held on $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rada's alleged crimes began shortly before 4 a.m. Sunday, when he kicked in 
the front door of a Canoga Park apartment where a former girlfriend once lived 
and attacked her parents and another man staying there, said Deputy City Atty. 
Kenneth Tso. 
</P>
<P>
 Rada left the apartment after the victims called police, Tso said. Police 
officers responded to the address, then left, and were still in the area when 
Rada returned to the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rada spotted police, Tso said, he got into his late-model gold Cadillac 
and led officers on a two-hour, slow-speed chase, with Rada hopping on and off 
the Ventura Freeway several times, and making numerous stops at traffic lights, 
but failing to pull over. 
</P>
<P>
 After attempting to ram police cars twice, Tso said, the suspect was finally 
blocked in at a CBS complex on Beverly Boulevard in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 Rada struggled with officers, police said, and was subdued with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims were hospitalized, Tso said, but were battered "enough so 
that officers saw injuries on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rada's trial is scheduled for June 7 in Van Nuys Municipal Court. ERIC SLATER

COUNCIL MEMBERS SAVE PROJECTS FROM BUDGET AX; SPENDING: AFTER IMPASSIONED PLEA 
FROM JACKIE GOLDBERG, FUNDING FOR NEXT YEAR WAS GUARANTEED FOR SOME COMMUNITY 
SERVICES. MENTOR PROGRAM FOR TROUBLED YOUTHS WAS AMONG THOSE SPARED. 
</P>

<P>
 A dozen public health clinics, youth sports leagues and job-training programs 
were guaranteed funding in next year's Los Angeles city budget, after an 
impassioned appeal Wednesday by Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg also led a successful campaign -- on the third day of City Council 
deliberations of Mayor Richard Riordan's proposed budget -- to demand 
continuation of a $1-million project that provides mentors for troubled young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Social services and community programs took center stage in the daylong 
session, with several other council members winning money for special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor-area Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. had $50,000 set aside to plan for 
decorative lighting on the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro -- as an official 
"gateway" to the city. Councilman Joel Wachs, an avid art collector, set aside 
$25,000 to subsidize a program that provides occasional free night-time 
admissions to the Museum of Contemporary Art. And South-Central Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas locked up $38,000 for the Central Recovery and Development 
Project, a night basketball league that takes hard-core gang members off the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 The council tabled or sent to committee dozens of items deemed to cut too 
deeply into a small $30-million reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers are expected to conclude deliberations today and to formally 
return the $4.3-billion budget package to the mayor next week. Riordan will 
then have five days to veto any additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions that had droned on for the entire day Wednesday reached a sudden 
emotional crescendo in late afternoon, when Goldberg pleaded for continuation 
of the mentoring program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood-area councilwoman argued that Riordan's proposal to increase the 
Department of Water and Power's contribution to the city treasury by $75 
million would not be as painless as the mayor's office had suggested. She said 
a $1-million DWP mentor program would have to be dropped to make the transfer, 
leaving troubled teen-agers without positive alternatives to gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 When several council members suggested that the budget could be thrown out of 
balance by such spending, Goldberg responded angrily: "These transfers have 
real-life consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The council then agreed to direct the DWP to maintain the mentor program. And 
a short time later, Goldberg got her colleagues to approve continued 
expenditures of $560,000 for a host of other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the organizations whose funding was guaranteed were: Chinatown Service 
Center ($25,800), Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center ($75,000), Venice 
Family Clinic ($50,000), Clinica Romero ($60,000), Los Angeles Free Clinic 
($100,000) and Los Angeles Federation of Senior Citizens ($10,000).

AS FREEWAY OPENS, MANY STICK TO MASS TRANSIT; COMMUTING: EXPERTS WARN THAT 
METROLINK, OTHER SERVICES NEED AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. REAL TEST IS EXPECTED IN 
JULY, WHEN ANTELOPE VALLEY INTERCHANGE OPENS.

<P>
 Despite the opening Wednesday of the entire Golden State Freeway in Santa 
Clarita for the first time in four months, hundreds of northern Los Angeles 
County commuters stuck to mass transit, following a routine they adopted after 
the Northridge earthquake cut off road access to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates of public transportation warned that commuting alternatives such 
as the Metrolink train service will need to aggressively market themselves both 
to attract new passengers and to retain those recent train recruits no longer 
faced with impossible driving conditions. And even then, experts said, drivers 
are likely to return to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep it in front of the public eye," said Santa Clarita City 
Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who is a Metrolink alternate board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy that the I-5 is open from the standpoint that less will be 
happening to our city," Heidt said, noting that heavy traffic has clogged and 
rutted area roads. "On the other hand, I'm ambivalent about it. After the quake 
we were telling people to get out of their cars and take alternate 
transportation. What message are we sending to people now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Southbound lanes on the Golden State were opened Tuesday, three weeks earlier 
than expected. Two lanes on the northbound Gavin Canyon overpass were opened 
before dawn Wednesday after work crews finished clearing away a detour on the 
neighboring Old Road. The remaining lanes were opened by 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the freeway was available for a seamless commute on Wednesday, about 
5,500 people still chose the white-and-periwinkle Metrolink trains for their 
journeys to and from Downtown Los Angeles, a number that was about average 
during the past two months, officials said. Deputy Executive Director David 
Solow said the rail service does not expect a sharp drop in train patronage 
from the renaissance of the I-5, which lies "substantially west of the Santa 
Clarita train station. It's not the right market." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials acknowledged that the real test will come in a few weeks when 
monthly passes expire and again at the end of July, when Caltrans expects to 
reopen the crucial interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the one that's a direct link" to Downtown for the vast majority of 
Metrolink riders from the north, Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Merci Shaw, whose husband currently shuttles between Lancaster and 
Downtown Los Angeles by train, said that when the Antelope Valley Freeway 
opens, "We'll be praising God. . . . For our family, the 5 means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 To persuade passengers like Shaw's husband to stay loyal, Metrolink is looking 
at ways to reward longtime riders with prizes or incentives similar to the 
frequent-flier programs used by airlines, said marketing manager Ray Shea. 
Plans also call for a high-profile promotional campaign aimed at drawing new 
riders to begin next month, including a free trial ride offer to be advertised 
in newspapers, over the airwaves and in direct mailings to about 400,000 
households along the Santa Clarita and Ventura County rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are scrambling to finish $50 million in track improvements by June 20, 
a few weeks ahead of schedule, to keep train use appealing by shaving 26 
minutes off the ride from Lancaster to Union Station. Currently, the journey 
takes more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor was a blessing in disguise for Metrolink, which swiftly added five 
new stations on the Santa Clarita line and then watched its ridership shoot to 
nearly 22,000 daily, up from about 1,000. However, the number has since dropped 
to 5,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mass transit under any circumstances is not prepared to compete at all with 
heavily subsidized automobiles," said Martin Wachs, who teaches urban planning 
at UCLA. "The commuter will choose the mode of travel that is most convenient, 
cheapest and most reliable. For most people in most locations in most 
circumstances, that's the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are trying to tell us a story -- that as soon as people could, 
they found alternatives to Metrolink," added Peter Gordon, professor of urban 
and regional planning and economics at USC.  
</P>
<P>
 But Solow said even a 25% to 30% increase over pre-quake levels -- or 1,300 
riders -- would match the retention rate of new riders by the Bay Area subway 
system after the Loma Prieta quake in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll do better than that," Solow said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE GETS GRANT FOR MATH LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College's proposed computerized mathematics laboratory will become a 
reality thanks to a $50,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials learned last week of the grant that the college will match. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will pay for 20 personal computers and monitors as well as printers 
in a laboratory classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The college had been doing some mathematics computer work in its computer 
laboratory but the grant creates a classroom just for math work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer lab is getting awful crowded," said Bill Norlund, vice president 
for academic affairs. "We have probably a dozen other departments using 
computer-based information and computer-based instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 Norlund said the college has been working on computer-based math instruction 
since receiving another grant three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The math lab should be functional by fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Yoshiwara, an instructor and chairman-elect of the math department, said 
that by the spring of 1995, instructors will have set up computerized math 
lessons for the pre-calculus class and then will begin preparing materials for 
other classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a computer-based document in which the student can write in his or 
her comments and do their own explorations," Yoshiwara said. "The underlying 
software has to have the capability to let the student make comments and do his 
or her scratch work." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer programs are far less limiting to the students than a textbook, 
Yoshiwara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are giving the student more personal control over what he or she will 
learn. They're not limited to what is in the question. They can ask 'what if' 
rather than wait for an instructor to give an explanation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The student can ask questions about any type of function or expression and he 
can explore that," Yoshiwara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a better chance that the retention will be better and the interest 
higher." REBECCA BRYANT

NEW PAROLE OFFICE TO BE MOVED; ACTIVISM: COMMUNITY AND POLITICAL PRESSURE 
FORCES STATE TO CLOSE SHERMAN OAKS FACILITY AFTER LESS THAN A MONTH. A NORTH 
HOLLYWOOD OFFICE WILL REOPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to pressure from an influential Sherman Oaks homeowners group and local 
politicians, state officials announced Wednesday that they will move a parole 
office they had opened there less than one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had argued that opening the parole office in a building at 5121 Van 
Nuys Blvd., directly across the street from a park, is a violation of the state 
Corrections Department's own guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. praised the announcement that the office 
will be moved, but residents of Van Nuys and North Hollywood bitterly 
criticized the decision. They complained that parole offices in their 
less-affluent neighborhoods never generated the same swift political response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it right to introduce the fox to the henhouse in some other area?" Van 
Nuys activist Candace Campbell asked elected officials during a news conference 
at the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Other angry residents carried signs that said: "Stop Dumping in Van Nuys" and 
"Van Nuys Residents Also Vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The Corrections Department had operated parole offices in Van Nuys and North 
Hollywood. The Van Nuys office will remain closed, officials said, but the 
North Hollywood office, near Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Vanowen Street, will 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Both older facilities had become overcrowded and were closed in favor of the 
larger, single office in Sherman Oaks, meant to monitor about 4,100 felons who 
served time in state prison and now live in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Corrections Department has a policy of not placing parole offices 
near schools and parks, the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Recreation Center is across 
the street from the new office. Officials settled on the three-story building 
because it was the only lease they could secure after a two-year search, 
Corrections Director James Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the choice generated controversy soon after the office opened April 25 
when residents started phoning police and politicians to express fears that 
seasoned criminals would loiter around the office and prey upon children and 
senior citizens using the park. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% to 20% of California's paroled felons are rearrested, prosecuted and 
returned to state prisons, and law enforcement authorities say there is a 
significant overlap between neighborhoods plagued by high crime rates and those 
where parolees congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the parole offices that had operated in Van Nuys and North 
Hollywood for five and 10 years, respectively, did so virtually without notice 
by residents and generated no complaints, said regional parole administrator 
Jerry DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, no known crimes or other problems were attributed to the new office 
in Sherman Oaks during its 3 1/2-week life, DiMaggio and other officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no foundation for the hysteria," DiMaggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who led the effort to have the parole office moved -- homeowners 
association President Richard Close, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, state 
Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) and Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North 
Hollywood) -- credited each other for a response they described as 
unprecedented in terms of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 19 years of activism, I've never seen such fast work by government 
officials," Close said.  
</P>
<P>
 The outcry prompted Friedman and Roberti to introduce legislation requiring 
the Corrections Department to be more specific when it notifies elected 
officials about plans for a new parole office.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; FILM COPTER CUTS INTO RESIDENTS' SLEEP

 The filming of an action movie at Warner Center has caused more than a stir 
among area residents; it's been keeping them awake nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount Pictures production has kept residents of the quiet middle class 
neighborhoods surrounding the business center awake until dawn Tuesday night 
with the whoosh-whoosh of a low-flying Huey helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we get helicopters around here when there is a big party or 
something, but this was more bothersome," said former Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who lives in the area. "I assumed it was a police 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know it was a movie," said Paula Brown, who lives near Warner 
Center with her husband, Mark. "I would have appreciated something in the mail 
that warned us." Notices were mailed to residents who live within a half-mile 
radius of Warner Center. Brown lives further south. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Roberts, director of the Motion Picture and Television Division of 
Los Angeles, which issues permits for filming in the city, said residents will 
only have to put up with the noise for a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, due to the low fog cover, there was a variation of where 
helicopters were hovering," Roberts said. "We will modify that tonight with a 
jet-powered helicopter, which is much quieter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount Pictures production, tentatively titled the "The Drop Zone," and 
starring Wesley Snipes as a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, obtained a 
permit to use helicopters within a half-mile radius around Warner Center, as 
well as to drop sky divers on a roof and on Oxnard Street. Shooting continued 
last night from 8:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. and again on Friday and Saturday, according 
to Dirk Beving, a permit officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the permit approval process requires signatures of homeowners in the 
impacted area, Beving said, and "no substantial opposition" was found. A notice 
was mailed out to residents within the half-mile radius. On Wednesday, Beving 
said his office received few complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors had plenty to say about the helicopter that hovered 1,000 feet 
in the air for 15 minutes every half-hour. One neighbor called LAPD's West 
Valley Division to see what was going on and police told him they had been 
inundated by complaints and had sent officers to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Beving said residents are actually lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going to have a car blow up in the street, but they scratched those 
scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 That wouldn't have bothered Tim Anderson, 23. He was so tired he didn't hear 
anything, but "dreamed a helicopter was flying over me." JEANNETTE REGALADO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA; EX-SCHOOL COACH GETS PROBATION IN THEFT

 A former Agoura High School girls softball coach was sentenced Wednesday in 
Malibu Municipal Court to three years probation after pleading no contest to a 
grand theft charge connected to the misuse of funds he collected for a summer 
softball league. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Earl Dyer, 36, entered his plea shortly before a preliminary hearing 
on the charges was scheduled to begin.Six counts of petty theft were dismissed 
in exchange for Dyer's plea, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip Stirling. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer also was fined $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer was charged in December after a monthlong investigation. Parents had 
complained that they had given Dyer about $1,000 for uniforms and equipment for 
a 14-years-old-and-under girls' summer softball league. Stirling said Dyer 
spent some of the money for equipment, but also used some for personal 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Stirling said the sentence was appropriate because Dyer was remorseful and 
none of the parents wanted Dyer to be jailed. JULIO MORAN

CESAREAN BIRTH RATE LEVELING OFF; HEALTH: EXPERTS, WHO SAY HALF THE PROCEDURES 
ARE UNNECESSARY, FEAR THE U.S. WILL NOT MEET ITS GOAL OF LOWERING SURGERIES TO 
15% OF ALL DELIVERIES. SOME OF THE HIGHEST FIGURES COME FROM SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years after a much-heralded drop in the skyrocketing number of American 
babies born by Cesarean section, the Cesarean rate has leveled off nationally 
and risen slightly in California -- news that some experts fear indicates that 
the nation will not meet its goal of reducing surgical deliveries to 15% by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released Wednesday, the Washington-based Public Citizen's Health 
Research Group estimated that nearly half of the 421,000 Cesarean sections in 
1992 should not have been done. The report further says that in 1991 
unnecessary C-sections added $1.3 billion to the nation's annual health care 
bill at a time when the government was clamoring for cost containment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its discouraging," said Nancy Theriault, president of the International 
Cesarean Awareness Network, a consumer activist group. "I think we have a long 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Citizen found that the national Cesarean rate remained essentially the 
same between 1990 -- when 22.7% of all babies were delivered surgically -- and 
1992, when the figure stood at 22.6%. In California, the rate went up slightly, 
from 21.4% in 1990 to 21.8% in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The national rate peaked at 24.7% in 1988 and the California rate hit a high 
of 24.5% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report said the numbers mark "a very slow reversal of the earlier 
dangerous trend," Dr. Sidney Wolfe, executive director of Public Citizen, said 
Cesareans are still performed nearly twice as often as they should be.  
</P>
<P>
 The Public Citizen study found that 106 U.S. hospitals delivered more than 37% 
of all infants surgically -- including four hospitals in Southern California. 
In California, Los Angeles Community Hospital had the highest Cesarean rate in 
the state, 43.8% 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that this is a very well-orchestrated form of violence against 
women," Wolfe said in a telephone interview. He said that even though patients 
consent to the surgery, they may do so on the basis of incomplete information 
"that is tilted toward the obstetrician doing a C-section."  
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe and his group maintain that the national rate should be 12% -- a figure 
that drew protest Wednesday from the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, which said there is "not adequate science upon which to 
recommend an ideal" rate. The U.S. Public Health Service has set a target rate 
of 15% by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the optimal rate, most experts agree that too many American infants 
are being delivered in the operating room. But they disagree as to why. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe, who for years has been crusading against unnecessary Cesareans, blames 
the phenomenon on greedy physicians and hospitals hungry to fill beds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most obstetricians, however, say factors beyond money are at work -- most 
important, doctors' fears of being sued for malpractice if something goes awry 
during vaginal birth.  
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly don't believe that money is the issue here," said Dr. Bruce Flamm, 
a nationally regarded expert on Cesareans who has been instrumental in lowering 
C-section rates at Kaiser Permanente hospitals in Southern California. "Day 
after day I talk to doctors around the country who are continuously burdened by 
this fear that they will be sued." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, Cesarean section is the most common major operation 
in the United States. During the surgery, the abdomen and uterus are cut open 
to deliver the baby. The operation can in some instances save the life of the 
mother and fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four main reasons to perform a Cesarean: previous Cesarean; the 
failure of a woman to progress into full labor; breech position (feet- or 
rump-first), and fetal distress, such as abnormal heartbeat. Repeats account 
for about a third of all C-sections, despite a growing trend toward what is 
known as VBAC -- vaginal birth after Cesarean. Many hospitals are trying to 
bring down their C-section rates by promoting subsequent vaginal births, which 
carry a small risk that the previous incision will rupture during birth. But 
these education efforts have not always been successful, particularly in 
affluent areas, where experts say patients and doctors are unwilling to accept 
even the most minimal risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason for the Cesarean rate has to do with the demands of private 
patients not to tolerate too long a labor, or even abnormalities that 
potentially suggest harm to the fetus," said Dr. Ezra Davidson, chief of 
obstetrics at at Los Angeles County's Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. At King/Drew, where most patients are poor, the Cesarean rate for 1992 
was just 13.9% -- 1,068 out of 7,700 births. Davidson attributes the low rate 
to the hospital's enforcement of very strict guidelines about when to perform 
Cesareans 
</P>
<P>
 Across the city, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the C-section rate for 1992 
was 29.4% -- 2,031 out of 6,907 births. About a third of those were repeat 
Cesareans, according to Dr. Kimberly Gregory of the obstetrics department. She 
said records showed that 45% of the repeat C-sections were elective. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a society of women that can go get their boobs done or their 
nose done, how can you tell them they can't have a surgery that will give them 
a good outcome for their baby?" she said. Birth Trends (Southland Edition, A24) 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of Cesarean-section births in California is increasing 
slightly, in contrast to a national downward trend. Following are the hospitals 
with the highest and lowest percentages of Cesareans in the state in 1992.

SLAIN SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS PALMDALE MAN; CRIME: POLICE SAY ALBERT PAUL 
GUERRERO, 34, MAY HAVE ROBBED AS MANY AS 20 BANKS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An alleged bank robber shot and killed in Sherman Oaks by police was 
identified Wednesday as a Palmdale man who is suspected of robbing as many as 
20 banks in the last six months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Paul Guerrero, 34, was shot by two Los Angeles police officers Tuesday 
afternoon in a church parking lot after he fled a California Federal Bank 
branch he allegedly tried to rob. The officers, who had staked out the bank, 
said Guerrero threatened them with a knife when they cornered him in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from LAPD's Metro Division had run an undercover surveillance 
operation at California Federal and at least one other bank for a week in an 
attempt to catch the robber, who they believe had hit 10 other banks in the San 
Fernando Valley, one in Glendale and several others in Los Angeles, said Los 
Angeles Police Lt. John Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin declined to name the other bank that was under surveillance Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they came close to catching Guerrero earlier this week, but he 
lost them in traffic during a brief chase. Dunkin declined to say whether 
Guerrero had robbed a bank prior to that chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said police have evidence that Guerrero robbed a bank in Woodland Hills 
an hour before officers spotted him in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 That Guerrero, who had also switched license plates on his dark green Jeep 
Grand Cherokee to confuse police, was finally caught, Dunkin said, was a 
combination of good police work and a little bit of luck. 
</P>

 "It was a combination of good old-fashioned detective work . . . and educated 
guesswork," Dunkin said. "And fortunately for us, and unfortunately for him, we 
picked the same bank."  
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said the undercover officers waited for Guerrero to rob the bank and 
flee out a back door so bank employees would not be endangered. Guerrero was 
shot, Dunkin said, after he came toward the officers with a 6-inch knife.  
</P>
<P>
 The officers who shot Guerrero, Jose Maldonado and Ronald Capra, were given 
desk assignments until police conclude their investigation, Dunkin said. All 
officer-involved shootings require such investigations, Dunkin said. The 
officers could be back on street duty as early as today.

ANTONOVICH SEEKS CURBSIDE BAN ON JOB-SEEKERS IN COUNTY AREAS; LABORERS: THE 
PROPOSAL IS MODELED AFTER AN AGOURA HILLS LAW. L.A. DIST. ATTY. GIL GARCETTI 
SAYS HE WILL NOT ENFORCE IT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buoyed by the success of an Agoura Hills law banning curbside job 
solicitation, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich wants to make it 
illegal for day laborers in unincorporated areas to seek work from passing 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law is modeled after the Agoura Hills ordinance, which survived a 
legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of 
immigrants-rights groups last month. It would make curbside job-seeking a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Antonovich has even taken his proposal to the Board of Supervisors, 
the county's top prosecutor said he will not enforce such a law -- for two 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have limited resources," Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said. "Not only that, 
but it would be difficult for me to prosecute someone for simply trying to get 
a job."  
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti added that his office will continue to prosecute day laborers who 
violate existing laws, such as urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's opposition to Antonovich's proposal may dissuade one key 
supervisor, Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, from supporting the measure 
when it comes before the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burke, who probably will be the swing vote, is also under strong pressure 
to adopt the law from homeowners in one part of her district: the Ladera 
Heights neighborhood north of Inglewood. Two years ago, those homeowners helped 
Burke win a narrow victory over state Sen. Diane Watson.  
</P>
<P>
 "She better not vote against it," said Ronnie Cooper, president of the Ladera 
Heights Civic Assn., "or she'll be sorry."  
</P>
<P>
 Burke said she has not made up her mind about Antonovich's proposal, but is 
leaning toward opposing it, partly because the ACLU has vowed to challenge it 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Gloria Molina and Ed Edelman probably would vote against it, while 
Supervisor Deane Dana may support the prohibition, their spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the concept, but I'd prefer to see it reach some sort of legal 
resolution first," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Antonovich said the April 28 appellate court ruling that 
upheld the Agoura Hills measure may help the supervisor's ordinance overcome 
any new legal hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things where there's never a perfect time," Lori Howard 
said. "So, why delay?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that Agoura Hills has the right to 
regulate the activity of day laborers as it relates to local traffic safety 
standards. The city blamed a day laborer's death on the traffic disruption 
caused by men rushing up to vehicles and contended that the law was necessary 
to prevent additional traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's motion lays out the same rationale for the county ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Ladera Heights and many other communities throughout the county 
regard the throngs of job seekers, many of whom are Latino immigrants, as 
dangerous and unsightly. In response to their concerns, Burke last year 
proposed a law similar to the Antonovich proposal and the Agoura Hills measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board ended up passing a much weaker measure in March, partly because 
the state appellate court had yet to rule in favor of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The county measure now in effect allows day laborers to continue soliciting 
work everywhere but commercial parking lots where owners have posted signs 
prohibiting the practice. The Ladera Heights homeowners had hoped that the 
parking lot owners would set aside specific areas of their property for the 
employment seekers, but so far none have even gone as far as posting signs 
prohibiting job solicitation anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance hasn't made any difference -- in fact, more day laborers have 
come and their behavior has deteriorated because they're not under the threat 
of a strong ordinance," said Cooper of the Ladera Heights Civic Assn. "I'm with 
Antonovich -- we need a stronger law." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the ACLU has vowed to challenge the law proposed by Antonovich in federal 
court if the supervisors adopt it, arguing that it would violate speech, 
assembly and travel rights guaranteed in the state and federal Constitutions. 
The group also is considering appealing the Agoura Hills case to the California 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "These laws completely ignore the rights of a group of people to express 
themselves in a way that's necessary to their survival," ACLU attorney Robin 
Toma said. "If we were talking about a group of white Americans who were 
recently laid off, things might have gone differently."  
</P>
<P>
 But Cooper denied that race is a factor, saying that Ladera Heights is a 
multiracial neighborhood. And she dismissed Garcetti's refusal to prosecute 
violators if the law passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need him to prosecute it," she said. "We need the clout of the law 
so the Sheriff's Department can harass them and get them to leave."

DRUG REHAB CENTER DENIES ADMISSION TO RICK JAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Funk singer Rick James, who was convicted of assaulting two women during drug 
binges, will not be admitted to a state-run drug rehabilitation facility, even 
though he has been undergoing evaluation there for five months, his attorney 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The warden of the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco sent a letter to 
defense attorney Mark J. Werksman that said James was not suitable for the 
nine-month treatment program that two judges said they thought would help the 
Grammy award-winning singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've convened some kind of star chamber out there, and for whatever reason 
they've determined Rick James does not meet the criteria," Werksman said. "It's 
a very subjective determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Werksman said the letter he received Tuesday from Warden Jean E. Anderson 
indicates that those who demonstrate "violence-prone tendencies or who have 
been convicted of violent crime" are not suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Werksman disagreed, saying James was perfectly suited to CRC because his 
crimes were the result of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran afoul of the law solely because of his drug abuse," Werksman said, 
acknowledging that drug use does not excuse James' conduct. "His victims were 
not chosen at random; they chose to be with him and to do drugs with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Anderson or a spokesperson at CRC were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 If James had been accepted into the program and successfully completed it, he 
would probably have been released this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 James, the self-proclaimed King of Funk, was sent to CRC in January after a 
judge said he was eligible for evaluation there instead of serving the 
five-year, four-month prison term he received in a plea-bargain agreement with 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors convicted James of imprisoning and assaulting a woman at a fashionable 
West Hollywood hotel. James later pleaded no contest to attacking a second 
woman in his Hollywood Hills home as part of the plea bargain that was 
fashioned after allegations surfaced of impropriety.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew R. Flier said the experts have made their 
determination and James should be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real issue has been lost -- two people were hurt by a rock star," Flier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 James will be returned to Van Nuys Superior Court within two months and Judge 
Michael R. Hoff will determine if he will serve more than five years in prison, 
or if he will receive a lesser sentence.

AROUND THE VALLEY: SUMMER WILL SHAPE UP, WITH OR WITHOUT YOU: DON'T SWEAT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is almost here again. And we all know what that means. It does not 
necessarily translate into No-Doze-inducing Dodger games at the stadium, 
eye-popping bike rides along the Venice Beach boardwalk or woozy, 
air-conditioned matinees at the Sherman Oaks Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it means trips to the gym, those all-too-long sweaty evening workouts, 
three and sometimes four times a week, pumping my tired butt on the Lifecycle 
for 30 minutes at a shot, lifting weights with all the incentive and 
determination of a hungover garbage man at work. 
</P>
<P>
 My gym is a spanking new Family Fitness facility in Panorama City. And after 
several months of doing hard time there, I have made a few notes about the 
Athletic Life there that I would like to share with all of you, my friends. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, if you don't already belong to my gym, please don't join. Stay away 
from there. It's already too crowded with perfectly-shaped people who have 
decided to arrive there just five minutes before I do, filling all the 
machines, bobbing up and down on the StairMasters and Lifecycles, leaving me 
little choice but to scarf down a few candy bars as I wait my turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to the gym are like visits to a kindergarten classroom: There's lots of 
activity but very little thought going on. People walk around as though in a 
trance. They pick up weights. They put them down again. They pick them up again 
-- like bad soldiers assigned to heavy duty, moving piles of rocks aimlessly 
back and forth at some sadistic sergeant's command. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we are, living in one of the most agreeable climates on the planet and 
people insist on getting their exercise in a sweaty, crowded little space with 
a great view of the nearby parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people riding bikes that don't go anywhere, climbing stairs that 
have no end -- all to the pounding bass of wordless music so lame that it makes 
you look up at the ceiling in search of the rotating disco ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And talk about mirrors. There are more mirrors in my gym than there were in 
Liberace's dressing room. Why do people have to eyeball themselves from every 
conceivable angle? I mean, it's O.K. to watch a mirror to examine your exercise 
style, but do you have to wink at yourself while you do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there's the aerobics floor, which sits behind some huge glass wall at 
the corner of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 From dawn to dusk, they have these classes where people move around as though 
they had to go to the bathroom. They move in this warped synchronicity, their 
hands flung high in the air, jumping up and down on mats thrown on the floor -- 
all of them following the frantic movements of a woman more full of energy than 
any person I have ever seen outside of those college co-eds who popped those 
little white-crossed pills to study for final exams. 
</P>
<P>
 I do a lot of people-watching at my gym. That's because few people will talk 
to me. You see, gyms are a lot like high schools -- there is a very critically 
observed caste system. Nobody pays attention to people who belong to lower 
castes than theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the top of the food chain belongs to the gym sharks, the men and 
women in such fantastic shape they don't need to go to any gym. They're 
followed by the teen-age girls in full-blown makeup, and angry, overweight 
people who look like they just want to slap you. 
</P>
<P>
 Myself, I am in one of the lower categories: the old and out-of-shape. If this 
were high school, I'd be a member of the audiovisual department. Ignored. The 
object of silent ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 After several months, I'm tired of getting dissed at my gym like some geek or 
cretin to be hidden away in some closet during fraternity rush. I want to join 
a gym for people like me. You know a gym for people with bad posture. Or one 
for pot-bellied beer drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I can tell, the last time somebody talked to me at my gym, it was a 
woman who told me to wipe my sweat off one of the machines. Sniffily, she told 
me she had never sweated like that. I told her she just hadn't met the right 
man yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the instructors talk to me. Once, I had the gall to interrupt one as 
he showed a new young gym member how to correctly spell her name. I know, I 
know, I shouldn't have done it. But I had this boneheaded question about how to 
use a machine without killing myself. He looked me over, motioned to the other 
side of the room, then handed me a map of how to find it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I haven't tried to talk to people at my gym. Once I asked a 
woman if she was "born here." She said "No, stupid," adding that she was born 
in a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The scariest part of my gym, however, is the free-weight section. Here, men 
who look like recent prison parolees lift barbells the size of Buicks, scanning 
the room with slitted eyes like they were back in The Yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, I walked up to one of these superhuman mountains of muscle and pushed 
him aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Lurch," I said. "Those are my weights you're using. Scram, before I get 
mad." 
</P>
<P>
 All the clanking and clonking of the free weights stopped. There was dead 
silence as all his cronies looked on as though he were some Hells Angel and I 
had just knocked over his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, sir," he said, finally breaking the silence, his voice trembling. 
"I'm sorry sir. It won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you believe that story, you probably go to my gym.

SICKOUT BY CLERKS HAMPERS CIVIL COURTS; LABOR: BUT THE JOB ACTION'S SECOND DAY 
FAILS TO SHUT DOWN THE JUDICIARY, AS THOSE TAKING PART IN THE STRIKE HAD HOPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sickout by court clerks continued across Los Angeles County for the second 
day Wednesday, seriously hampering operations in civil courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But with criminal courts operating almost normally, the job action failed to 
shut down the judiciary, as the clerks had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of the clerks and judicial assistants throughout Los 
Angeles County have participated in the strike, which is in response to 
lingering salary and job status disputes. Officials with the Los Angeles 
Superior Court Clerks Assn. said it is unclear when the clerks will return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take our salary and compare it to the bailiffs and the court 
reporters, you can see why they've taken the action," said David P. Bradford, 
president of the clerk's union. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford said some court reporters earn well into the six figures but clerks 
make a maximum of $43,713 annually and haven't had a raise since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouse supervisors have been preparing for a strike or sickout for nearly 
two months and implemented a plan to shift available clerks from civil 
courtrooms to those that handle criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the managers, some supervisors and even one staff assistant have been 
helping out" in courtrooms, said Timothy Adams, the administrator who oversees 
all San Fernando Valley court operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys Superior Court, only six of 30 clerks showed up for work 
Wednesday. But supervisors said six of the 24 who failed to show up had 
legitimate excuses, meaning 60% participated in the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando court operations, which were relocated to Van Nuys after the 
Northridge earthquake, also continued with six clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 A mediation conference between the clerks and the court is tentatively 
scheduled for Friday, said J. Timothy Fives, spokesman for the union, Local 575 
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fives said the clerks want an increase and want court officials to loosen a 
policy that calls for an automatic suspension if a clerk makes any mistake on 
official court orders.

HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER KILLS 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman and young girl were struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver 
Wednesday while in the intersection of Montague Street and Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victims were described as a Latina woman in her 30s and a 
young girl about 12 years old, said Frank Zdroy of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the car involved was a red Mustang. Red paint chips and 
pieces of a broken headlight were found at the scene, Zdroy said, and there was 
evidence that the car's left front section as well as a headlight were damaged 
in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The front windshield also may have been cracked or shattered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for the motorist late Wednesday night, Zdroy said.

MAN CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN FATAL CRASH; COURTS: LIONEL MCGINNIS 
FACES 15 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR COLLISION THAT KILLED TWO. HE WAS DRUNK AT 
THE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a rarely seen jury verdict, a Van Nuys man was convicted of second-degree 
murder Wednesday for killing two people when he ran a red light while driving 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel McGinnis, 39, faces a minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison 
for the July 27, 1992, collision that occurred after he had drinks at one bar 
and was driving to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence could be doubled because there were two victims. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinnis had at least two prior drunk-driving convictions and had attended a 
court-ordered, alcohol-awareness school that covered the dangers of driving 
after drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 After the crash, McGinnis' blood-alcohol level was 0.25%, more than three 
times the legal limit of 0.08%, police said. When police brought him in for 
questioning, McGinnis admitted he was too drunk to drive, according to evidence 
presented at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though McGinnis testified he had blacked out before the accident, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow was able to convince a Van Nuys Superior Court 
jury that McGinnis was guilty because he made a conscious decision to begin 
drinking, knowing he was going to drive afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors admitted that McGinnis had no intent to kill anyone, but contended 
he embarked on an intentional course of conduct that he knew was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice was served," Rabichow said of the murder convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants involved in fatal drunk-driving accidents are typically charged 
with gross vehicular manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of six years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal accident occurred at the intersection of Woodman Avenue and Valerio 
Street when McGinnis' Ford Ranger went through a red light at 52 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 His vehicle slammed into a Cadillac, killing Maria Henriquez Delcarmen, 16, 
and Eynar Contreras, 25, both passengers in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, Rocael Contreras, then 23, and Anna Patricia Suarez, 
then 20, were injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael J. Farrell will sentence McGinnis on June 15.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN'S BODY FOUND NEAR TRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A railroad engineer spotted the body of a woman alongside the tracks near the 
intersection of Avenue R-8 and 10th Street East on Wednesday morning as the 
freight train he was riding moved east through the city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department are investigating 
the suspicious death of the unidentified woman, described as a Latina or white 
woman between 20 and 35 years, said Sgt. Ron Spear, a Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting the body, the Southern Pacific railroad engineer notified a 
ground crew to check the area, which is near a residential section. The crew 
found the body and contacted the Sheriff's Department, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office will conduct an autopsy to determine 
the cause of death.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN KILLED WHEN VEHICLE HITS POLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canyon Country man died early Wednesday after he lost control of his vehicle 
and it slammed into a power pole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old motorist, whose name has not been released, was driving east 
on Vasquez Canyon Road about three miles east of Sierra Highway when the 
accident occurred, California Highway Patrol Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man had rounded a curve just before the 1:50 a.m. accident, Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 The motorist could have been saved by a seat belt, Moore said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTI-GANG SEMINAR TARGETS MIGRANT WORKERS' 
CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Migrant workers will be given advice on how to keep their children from 
getting involved in gang activities at a free conference Saturday at Castaic 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish-language seminar will focus on warning signs parents should watch 
for and how to reduce tensions among cultures, said Carol Ramnarine, a program 
specialist with the Los Angeles County Office of Education.  
</P>
<P>
 She said gang infiltration among children of migrant parents in the Santa 
Clarita Valley is not rampant, but many parents requested the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over a period of about three years, we've had at least nine students arrested 
for gang activities," she said. "They're not serious activities, but there's 
enough that we want to say, 'Let's not let this get out of hand.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ramnarine estimated there are about 185 children of migrant workers in the 
Santa Clarita Valley, down from about 400 several years ago. She said many of 
the area's produce fields were shut down in 1989 by their owner, Boskovich 
Farms, causing much of the decline in the migrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 A mural created by about 25 students in grades six through 12 also will be 
unveiled at the conference before it is displayed at educational conferences 
around the country, Ramnarine said. She said the mural, titled "Harvest of 
Hope," consists of three 36-by-48-inch panels with St. Guadalupe at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is kind of similar to the Virgin Mary," she added. "She bridges the Aztec 
culture to Catholicism." 
</P>
<P>
 The mural features other images such as an Aztec sun calendar, a man 
representing the Mexican revolution and the border between the United States 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is the second annual Migrant Parent Conference sponsored by the 
county Office of Education, the city of Santa Clarita and local community 
groups. Ramnarine said the conference is targeted at migrant parents, but all 
Latinos are welcome to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration begins at 9 a.m. and the discussions will run from 10 a.m. to 
noon. Castaic Elementary School is at 31700 Ridge Route Road.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LIBERAL GROUP JOINS FIGHT TO FORCE DISTRICT TO 
GIVE CLAS EXAMS; EDUCATION: JUDGE ALLOWS PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY TO FILE 
BRIEF ON BEHALF OF ANTELOPE VALLEY PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Education is getting support in its lawsuit against 
the Antelope Valley Union High School District seeking a court order mandating 
that the district administer the controversial CLAS exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne on Wednesday granted permission 
for People For the American Way, a liberal, nationwide, constitutional 
liberties organization, to file a brief on the state's suit on behalf of a trio 
of Antelope Valley parents who want their children to take the California 
Learning Assessment System test. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was well-received by the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to have them in the litigation," said Allan Keown, a department 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Robert M. Myers, appearing as local counsel on behalf of 
Washington-based People For the American Way, said he is unsure what impact the 
brief will have in the outcome of the case, but said there is a need for it to 
be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important in this case is for the court to know this is not just some 
academic power dispute between a state agency and some local school district," 
Myers said. "The rights of real people are being adversely affected by the 
school district's position." 
</P>
<P>
 The brief, which Myers said will be filed next week, is on behalf of Cheryl 
and Monte Eslick, parents of a 10th-grader, and Constance Weiss, mother of 
10th-grade twins. All three children attend Quartz Hill High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board is not looking out for the best interests of the students," Weiss 
said. "I think they're being pushed by other people for political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said she contacted People For the American Way because of her concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said that Weiss and the Eslicks "wanted to let the district know that 
it's not just the state of California that is alarmed by the defiance to not 
administer the test, that parents are alarmed that the district is failing to 
follow laws." 
</P>
<P>
 A conservative majority of the high school district voted last month not to 
administer CLAS, criticizing its secrecy and saying it violates parents' rights 
by asking personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Test opponents, as well as the Antelope Valley district board members who 
voted against giving it, admit the law requires a statewide assessment test be 
administered, but contend there is no mandate that CLAS is that test. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said that he will set the legal arguments as to why the Antelope Valley 
district's position violates the law in the brief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district asserts it has the right to control the tests that are given, 
raising the flag of local control," he said. "From a legal standpoint, that 
position is flawed because according to the California Constitution, control of 
the education system is vested in the state. Local school districts only have 
as much power as conferred upon them by the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 He continued: "In this case, it's real simple. The state says this test must 
be given, that CLAS is the test that must be given to comply with the 
legislative mandate. The district's position it will give some (other) test it 
chooses is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering the district to give the test, the Department of Education last 
week filed suit against the district. It is the first suit the state has filed 
over CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Wayne on Wednesday also scheduled a June 6 hearing on the department's 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Robert Girolamo said even if Wayne orders that CLAS be given, 
there may not be time. The school year ends June 15 and final exams are given 
June 13-15. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes us five days to give the test," he said. "Physically, it's almost 
going to be impossible to get that test done." 
</P>
<P>
 Keown said the department requested the earliest possible court date and that 
June 6 was the earliest date. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS has been praised by its supporters as a revolutionary method of testing 
the critical thinking skills of students. Opponents of the test, however, 
contend it is invasive, contains literature selections that degrade the family 
and is inappropriately shrouded in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just six of the more than 1,000 school districts in California have decided 
not to administer the test, according to the Department of Education.  
</P>
<P>
 The department will send notices today to those six districts ordering them to 
give CLAS and threatening them with legal action if they refuse to do so.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER BUDGET SEEKS MORE POLICE SPENDING; 
FINANCES: THE 1994-95 PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FOUR LAYOFFS. EXTRA FUNDS WOULD GO 
FOR CRACKDOWNS ON CERTAIN CRIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials unveiled a proposed 1994-95 budget Wednesday that calls for the 
layoff of four employees and a boost in law enforcement spending, but no 
significant change in other city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's general fund expenditures, covering day-to-day city operations, 
would total $28.7 million, up just $22,600 from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically calling it a budget to maintain the same service levels as 
we've had in the past," said Dennis Davenport, assistant city manager. "There's 
basically a reduction in most departments, with the exception of public safety. 
Most of the savings you see in other departments is going into that community 
safety budget. That's where the priority is." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members began reviewing the proposed budget at a meeting 
Wednesday morning at City Hall. The council will conduct a public hearing June 
6 on the spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written report to the council, City Manager James C. Gilley cautioned 
that the budget proposal is based on assumptions that a slight improvement will 
occur in the local economy. At the same time, he said, the plan could require 
revamping if state lawmakers withhold money from cities to balance the state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget allocates $10.5 million to community safety, up 6.4% from last 
year. Although some of this money will cover animal control and crossing guard 
expenses, the lion's share -- about $10.1 million -- will pay for Lancaster's 
contract for law enforcement services with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed budget, routine patrols by deputies will remain the same. 
The extra money will pay for special crackdowns on auto theft, juvenile crime 
(including curfew violations), graffiti, residential burglaries and traffic 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, deputies will spend more time monitoring the activities of 
high-profile parolees who are released in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall operations, including the planning and public works 
departments, face cutbacks under the proposed budget, partly because of the 
continuing slowdown in local building activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster, which has about 115,000 residents, has been reducing the size of 
the city's work force since it reached a high of 279 employees three years ago, 
Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed 1994-95 spending plan, the city would have about 200 
workers, about 10 fewer than last year. Some of these positions were left 
vacant after employees resigned or retired, but four current public works 
employees will lose their jobs under the plan, Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members also unveiled a separate spending plan calling for $41 
million in capital improvements, including street repairs, new parks, drainage 
projects and traffic signals. Among the largest projects would be a new 
Metrolink commuter train station and a bridge to carry traffic over the Sierra 
Highway and the railroad tracks at Avenue H.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; YEAR LATER, MAN'S FATE IS MYSTERY; 
INVESTIGATION: JAMES YOUNG, 73, DISAPPEARED AFTER LEAVING HIS QUARTZ HILL HOME 
FOR A TRIP TO VEGAS. SOME FEAR FOUL PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The one thing sheriff's homicide detectives know for sure is that James Young 
is still missing, 15 months after he left his spacious Quartz Hill home for 
what was to be a short trek to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 After working full time on the case for more than three months, Detective 
Michael Scott of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau 
said the 73-year-old man's disappearance remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really not sure what has happened at this point," said Scott, who is 
investigating the case with another detective. "There's a strong possibility 
he's met with foul play." 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives received the case from the department's missing persons 
unit in February of this year after Young's neighbors convinced authorities 
that he may not have disappeared voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Young did make it to Las Vegas, according to Scott. He was there in late 
February, 1993, with another man and the pair visited a friend. The two left 
Las Vegas, but where they went from there remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 One story was that Young met a Latino woman, married her and the newlyweds ran 
off to Mexico to start a new life together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found a lot of people that know Mr. Young," Scott said. "Their feelings 
are a lot like ours -- if he was going to pick up and go to Mexico, he would 
have told them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is totally out of character for Jim Young." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Scott said he is following up on leads in Mexico in hopes of 
tracking Young down. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors describe Young as a cantankerous man who was rude and 
self-centered, but still relatively likable. He was also cheap, they said, 
adding that Young was not someone who would run off and leave his fortune 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said Young's assets, which include four houses, numerous vehicles and 
cash, are worth about $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott hopes he will be contacted by people who know Young or may have seen him 
since he disappeared in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the public's help," he said. "If Mr. Young died or was murdered, 
we're still going to have to try and find out where he is. There's got to be 
somebody out there who knows where Mr. Young is." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives located Young's closest relatives in Chicago, but they have been of 
little help. Scott said Young's sister died several years ago and her children 
hadn't seen their uncle in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Chicago attorney representing Young's nieces and nephews was appointed 
conservator of the missing man's estate, pending a resolution to the case. 
Young's properties were in foreclosure when homicide was assigned the missing 
person's case earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Young's other possessions -- ranging from machinery equipment to 
several vehicles to a pair of Rottweilers -- also were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the homes are no longer in foreclosure and most of Young's 
possessions have been located. Like Young, however, the dogs, Fritz and Trixie, 
are nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Young's neighbors in Quartz Hill persuaded the Sheriff's Department 
to consider the case more than just a missing's persons matter. 
</P>
<P>
 They submitted a petition with 30 signatures in hopes of "resolving the 
whereabouts or demise of James Young." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Scott said he and his partner, Sgt. Tom Harris, hope to 
do.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SHORTCUT TO WORK; NEW TELECOMMUTING CENTER IN 
LANCASTER FULLY OCCUPIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 While telecommuting may not be enjoying the widespread popularity that was 
expected after the Jan. 17 quake, it is alive and well in the Antelope Valley 
where commutes were hellish even before the 6.8 temblor crippled Southland 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A telebusiness center that opened in Lancaster last month is already full, 
with all 40 of its workstations being used by employees of a pair of San 
Fernando Valley firms who live in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, in conjunction with donations from a host of private 
businesses and a $130,000 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
opened the center after the Northridge quake. It is the second county-run 
telecommuting center in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We nearly tripled the work space," said Supervisor Mike Antonovich at a 
ceremony Wednesday to mark last month's opening of the Antelope Valley 
Telebusiness Center. "Of course, Mother Nature has helped with this effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort also is helping Mother Nature. Officials estimate the 40 
telecommuters are driving 25,000 less miles a week, keeping about 700 tons of 
pollutants out of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's first telecommuting center in the Antelope Valley, which opened 
more than a year ago with 20 workstations, is only about half full, said 
Suzette Cecchini, on-site administrator for the two centers. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the high vacancy rate may be because a fee is being charged, 
something that had not been done during the first year the center was open. 
Users of the center are charged $20 per day, although she said any new user who 
signs a six-month lease will get three of those months for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the available space at the county center and the impending reopening 
of the Antelope Valley Freeway, local officials contend that a lot of interest 
in telecommuting remains in the Antelope Valley, a bedroom community that is 
home to as many as 60,000 commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing but advantages to it," said Bruce Latta, manager of the 
Antelope Valley Fair, which is nearing completion of its telecommuting center. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair decided after the Northridge quake to establish a center, which is 
expected to open in June with 20 workstations and room for as many as 52 more, 
Latta said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the federal government is interested in using the center and will 
probably have three or four people working from it by July 1. Private companies 
also have expressed interest in reserving space at the center, although Latta 
declined to release their names since no contracts have been signed. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been much time to promote the center, said Latta, adding that a 
lot of companies are still not sold on the concept of telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who do it, there's no better way to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelda Diamond said her quality of life has increased dramatically since she 
began working from the county's telebusiness center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy," said Diamond, a Lake Los Angeles resident who works for 
Woodland Hills-based Health Net. "Physically, I feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she began telecommuting, Diamond said she would spend three to fours a 
day getting to and from her job, a trip that increased to four to six hours 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling really weary, really drained," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Monast said he is a better worker since he started telecommuting, 
rather than driving each day from his Palmdale home to his Woodland Hills job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm better rested," he said. "I don't have to wake up at 4:30 in the morning 
anymore. I would get to work and head right for the coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Monast said now that his "office" is just 15 minutes from his home he can 
spend more time with his children and even gets home early enough to barbecue, 
something that was impossible before he began telecommuting.

WESTSIDE WATCH: NORMANDY IT ISN'T, BUT ANY PORT IS OK ON D-DAY B-DAY

 Surfers, take heed. The Lane Victory is ready to make the Santa Monica Bay 
safe for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have heard about the Lane Victory, the San Pedro-based cargo ship 
staffed by retired merchant marines. The ship set sail April 29 for D-day 
celebrations in France -- a 9,000-mile odyssey -- but was forced to return to 
Los Angeles Harbor just days later after developing a leak in its boilers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tale does not end on that sad note. The French consulate in Los 
Angeles has invited the ship and crew to take part in a commemorative D-day 
re-enactment June 1 in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, we're elated," said Joe Vernick, 81, president of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II, which organized the ill-fated voyage 
to France. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lane Victory's participation in the Santa Monica ceremonies would be more 
symbolic than nostalgic: Vernick said only a couple of the ship's 55 crew 
members participated in the June 6, 1944, invasion, when Allied troops stormed 
Nazi strongholds on the beaches of Normandy, turning the tide of the war in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 So can the ship make the 30-mile trek from the harbor to the shores of Santa 
Monica? 
</P>
<P>
 Vernick believes repairs should be done in time for the "invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of being greeted with shouts of "Bienvenue!" the crew just might 
hear, "Gnarly, dude."

 MIRACLE ON MARKET STREET: Yuletide cheer settled on the Venice boardwalk in 
recent weeks at least for those who happened to notice the Christmas 
decorations between Rose Avenue and Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice, where oddity is always in season, most folks didn't seem to notice 
anything out of the ordinary.  
</P>
<P>
 The decorations, it turns out, were props for an as-yet untitled Nora Ephron 
movie that began shooting along the oceanfront in mid-April. The comedy, which 
stars Steve Martin, Rob Reiner and Juliette Lewis, takes place on Christmas Eve 
at a suicide prevention hot line in Venice, publicist Betsy Sokolow said. 
</P>
<P>
 But extras, leave your Santa suits at home. The shooting wrapped last week and 
the garlands and wreaths have been removed. Watch for the movie to open around 
Thanksgiving.

 CAMPAIGN FOLLIES: Ever notice that there's an inverse relationship between the 
number of new initiatives a politician sponsors and the number of days till the 
next election? 
</P>
<P>
 We were reminded of this again this week, when West Hollywood Councilman Paul 
Koretz faxed a "media alert" concerning his latest proposal, a neighborhood 
patrol program for West Hollywood with citizen volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Koretz's fax machine seems to have been overheating ever since the Democrat 
found himself in a crowded race for a seat in the state Assembly representing 
the 42nd District. Among his proposals this year: new gun-control ordinances 
and a measure that would make West Hollywood the first city in the country to 
require all new buildings to be equipped with outlets for recharging electric 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the latest proposal is not quite original. Nancy Greenstein, West 
Hollywood public safety administrator, said a proposed community watch project 
fell into limbo earlier this year because of residents' apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Koretz said the program, if implemented, could help combat hate crimes against 
the gay and lesbian community and could be modeled on a successful program in 
San Diego.

BESIEGED UCLA POLICE FORCE GETS NEW CHIEF; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CLARENCE CHAPMAN, A 
VETERAN SHERIFF'S CAPTAIN, INHERITS A DEPARTMENT SUFFERING FROM LOW MORALE AND 
A RASH OF PERSONNEL COMPLAINTS.

<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Capt. Clarence Chapman, a veteran 
lawman who earned widespread praise as West Hollywood's top cop, will be the 
new chief of UCLA's embattled police department, university officials have 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, a 28-year sheriff's department veteran, is scheduled to be sworn in 
June 1. Among his most immediate concerns, he said, will be improving morale in 
a department that has become a breeding ground for civil rights and personnel 
complaints filed by disgruntled officers and civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really got to hit the ground running," Chapman said. "The problems in 
that department dictate immediate attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-member force, riven by backbiting and what many describe as a hostile 
working environment, has been buffeted by budget cuts and upheaval caused by 
last year's retirement of longtime Chief John Barber. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaffection, particularly among minority workers, runs high. No fewer than 
eight current or former Police Department employees have filed lawsuits in the 
past three years against the university alleging harassment, favoritism and 
discrimination by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The union for campus police officers, frustrated by the slow pace of 
departmental reform, directed a vote of no confidence earlier this year against 
the acting police chief, Karl Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally," Chapman said, "just a real unhappy work force is what you've got 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, an expert in risk management, said the swirl of litigation indicates 
poor communication between the rank-and-file and the university administration. 
He pledged to plunge into the task of improving the work climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to build teamwork and self-esteem -- to build a model of 
professional law enforcement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pepperdine University graduate, Chapman joined the Sheriff's Department in 
1966. He was promoted to captain in 1990 and was assigned to the Marina Del Rey 
station for a year and West Hollywood for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top sheriff's official in West Hollywood, he won kudos in many circles 
for expanding community-based policing programs that helped temper longstanding 
perceptions that the Sheriff's Department was insensitive to the city's large 
gay population. 
</P>
<P>
 A city referendum to replace Sheriff's Department service with a local police 
force was soundly defeated in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Hollywood experience really did matter," said Administrative Vice 
Chancellor John Curry, who led a seven-month, nationwide search for a new 
chief. "It was a complex job at a difficult time, and Clarence, by every 
indication, did a stellar job of working with that community." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's career has not been free of controversy. While serving in West 
Hollywood, he earned $70,000 providing expert testimony and other assistance in 
35 civil cases pivoting on excessive force. Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Turley 
conducted an inquiry into the matter, and concluded earlier this year that 
Chapman violated a 1990 ordinance that bans county employees from receiving any 
pay outside their regular salaries for such testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ordinance contained no provision for sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence suggests," Turley wrote, "that Capt. Chapman has engaged in a 
variation of double-dipping. . . . While such a practice may offend elementary 
principles of propriety, it does not support the filing of a criminal action." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman denied in interviews that he double-dipped, and was supported in his 
assertion by Sheriff Sherman Block. He was subsequently reassigned by the 
department to handle risk management matters -- such as preventing lawsuits -- 
full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an area of expertise that will likely come in handy as he turns his 
attention to the litigation-prone UCLA police. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been one of his specialties," Curry said. "I think it will serve us 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Optimism about Chapman's selection was apparent even among the most embittered 
members of the department. Charles Harold, an officer currently on leave who 
has led the legal charge against the university and its Department of Community 
Safety, said: "Everyone seems impressed with him. He says he's going to run 
this place like a police department, not like a grade school."

TRAFFIC COPS ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; COMPUTERS: 'FLAMERS' THREATENED 
TO SINK PART OF SANTA MONICA'S INNOVATIVE NETWORK, SO SOME E-MAIL MESSAGE AREAS 
ARE NOW BEING MONITORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica invited its residents to ride the information superhighway into 
City Hall. The resulting electronic traffic jam has officials scratching their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started five years ago when the city set up the pioneering Public 
Electronic Network, known as PEN, which allowed electronic communication 
between residents and their government. 
</P>
<P>
 From a home computer or 20 public terminals, residents could scan city staff 
reports, apply for business licenses or review electronic town hall postings. 
The system was so user-friendly that homeless residents tapped onto a public 
terminal and outlined their most pressing needs, leading to the establishment 
of a program that provides them with lockers, showers and a place to wash their 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that some overzealous users, known as "flamers," have 
monopolized debate on its most popular feature, conferences, a community 
bulletin board that invites users to vent on a range of topics such as 
homelessness, crime and development. Through vitriolic language and personal 
attacks on other users and city officials, the hard-core users have driven away 
many moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamers' messages can be rambling, incoherent missives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, nobody is suggesting that the city pull the switch. Some 
"flaming" subsided after the city instituted a moderator who edits messages on 
city government topics for length and can block users who send them too 
frequently on the same subject.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great success, but it sure ain't what the founders intended," 
said Joe Schmitz, an assistant professor at the USC School of Business and an 
early consultant on the project. "These systems are creatures of the people who 
use them and PEN represents the rowdy, participatory, enfranchised nature of 
the Santa Monica community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities are following Santa Monica's lead. Diamond Bar recently 
implemented a system modeled after it and Glendale will go on-line by mid-June. 
West Hollywood is also considering such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first two or three years of PEN's start-up, the system peaked at 
about 7,000 log-ons a month. Log-ons are recorded each time someone taps into 
the system using a password provided by the city. In the initial months, up to 
1,000 people a month plied the system. 
</P>
<P>
 But activity has dropped off since then, with many users disenchanted by the 
vitriol. City officials say the system averages 5,000 log-ons a month, with 
about 500 users. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many experts agree that the system has made local government more 
inclusive. Formerly passive residents from all classes and backgrounds have 
found it easy to participate in local government, and it has helped others keep 
better track of activities at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hill, a Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District board member, keeps 
abreast of city reports, public notices and the events calendar on his home 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's created a whole culture in the community that didn't exist before. You 
can contact people that you wouldn't ordinarily talk to," Hill said. "It's also 
made people more government literate. You can get facts and participate in the 
discussion in an informed way -- and that's empowering." 
</P>
<P>
 At Olympic High School, an alternative school, students use PEN to exchange 
electronic messages with city officials and with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Jack Casey says the system improves student's computer literacy skills 
while providing a motivation to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get most students to use a dictionary," Casey said. "But when 
they post a message electronically, it's out in public and then they look the 
word up." 
</P>
<P>
 When the city attorney received an electronic complaint about a misleading 
Radio Shack battery advertisement, a local retailer was forced to honor a 
customer commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 The system has helped streamline some sectors of government as people deal 
with City Hall from home: There have been shorter lines for applications at 
City Hall, fewer cars in the parking lot, and users say it seems city officials 
provide more thoughtful answers to E-mail queries than to letters. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the unruly juggernaut has expanded, so too have the project's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some think they can get on the system and say anything, any time, as often as 
they want -- that it's like a soapbox in Pershing Square or Hyde Park," said 
Ken Phillips, the originator of the program and former director of the city's 
Information Systems Department. "One or two people can log on, and by abusing 
free speech, can literally run the system into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips says his staff might have "missed the boat" in imposing control over 
the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is some control now. 
</P>
<P>
 By February, 1993, the city threatened to shut down some of PEN's conferencing 
bulletin board features. But the community uproar was so great that city staff 
members agreed to a compromise: Conference topic sections such as education, 
ideas and science were left free of control, but moderators were added to keep 
order on the electronic debate over more incendiary subjects, including 
homelessness, rent control, development and Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Messages on these topics go directly to the moderators, who scan for length 
and frequency limits before posting them. If a user repeatedly sends messages 
on the same item or refuses to trim it, the moderator simply returns the 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the compromise say the new rules are an imposition on free 
speech rights, a curb on Santa Monica's unique form of electronic expression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keith Kurtz, director of the information systems department, says messages 
are only edited for length -- about a 400-word limit. And people who have 
logged-on repeatedly on the same topic are asked to curb their input to two 
messages per item per day. "There's no real content censorship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the city's efforts have spawned an uneasy peace. City officials and 
residents who had been turned off by the wild commentary have been more 
encouraged to partake in the moderated forums. And some "flamers" have moved on 
to other areas of discourse, such as as youth, vegetarian restaurants, space, 
religion, recipes and science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Roslyn Wythe, a moderator, said she recently had to curb a group of students 
who were sending messages threatening to beat each other up. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, Kurtz said, are as far as a local government can go in 
constraining a public forum such as PEN. Analysts say private on-line services 
have more latitude in booting "flamers" and restricting message use and 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 With Santa Monica's system, Schmitz said, "the conflict between free speech 
and social responsibility is amplified. There's a paradox in that more 
participants are wanted, but if you give all these folks air time, you might 
not like what you see or hear."

ART; HAITIAN ART FINDS A HOME AT GALERIE LAKAYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Carine Fabius' most vivid childhood memories of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 
is of being whisked in a limousine with her mother to the palace of dictator 
Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was the hottest fashion designer in Haiti," said Fabius. Papa Doc 
often hired her mother to make clothes for Duvalier's wife and daughter, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabius also remembers being awakened one night as a dozen of Papa Doc's guards 
searched her family's house for one of her father's friends, an outspoken 
critic of the Haitian dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident, and the general climate of violence in Haiti at the time, 
prompted her father to get visas for the family and leave in 1964 for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabius has lived in this country ever since, but Haiti remains close to her 
heart. For the past three years, she and her husband, Pascal Giacomini, a 
French-born sculptor, have been co-owners of Galerie Lakaye, a gallery 
specializing in Haitian art. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the couple's Craftsman-style house in West Hollywood, the gallery 
has served as a home away from home for Haitian artists, while exposing 
Angelenos to the rich art of Haiti. Virtually all of the house's wall space is 
covered with Haitian paintings, their canvases alive with dazzling colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wire and tin sculptures abound throughout the house, resting on shelves and 
tables and hanging from walls. Several depict mermaids with wings and halos -- 
a Haitian fertility symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the artworks have political themes, but most depict visions of plenty 
-- such as bountiful harvests of brightly colored fruit or families living 
together in a happy, peaceful land -- a sharp contrast to the realities of 
present-day Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Haitian artists paint their hopes, their dreams," Fabius said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galerie Lakaye, Creole for "gallery from back home," is among a few galleries 
in Los Angeles specializing in Haitian art. Prices range from $700 to $2,000 
for oil paintings and sculptures. Fabius said the gallery also sells folk art, 
posters and the work of artists from African countries, Brazil and several 
Caribbean islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Edouard Duval Carrie, a Haitian artist who lives in Miami and has shown his 
work in Paris, Cologne and Washington, D.C., said Galerie Lakaye is "one of the 
more important galleries in the United States representing Haitian art." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie said that there are Haitian art galleries in New York and Miami, but he 
prefers to deal with Fabius because "Carine respects the artists and she wants 
to present the work in the best possible way. The others just try to peddle the 
art." 
</P>
<P>
 The artist is impressed with Fabius' efforts to educate the public about 
Haitian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll organize a book reading or invite a speaker, and host an event which 
draws a wider audience into the gallery who are then exposed to the art," he 
said. "That is not the case for other Haitian art dealers." 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Chaikin said he knew nothing about Haitian art until he met a Haitian 
artist named Duncan Roseme, who worked on the Venice boardwalk. The musician 
and his wife, Judy, bought some of Roseme's pieces. The artist later invited 
the pair to Galerie Lakaye for an exhibition of his work.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, Chaikin, who lives in Studio City, has purchased seven 
pieces from Galerie Lakaye. The ambience of the gallery, he said, sold him: 
"It's in a private home, as opposed to the ritzy galleries around here, which 
contributes to that homey feeling. And the art fits in so well in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaikin said he was also drawn to the art because of its "unpretentiousness. 
You get the feeling that creating art is just a natural thing to do, like 
taking care of children. The art is very open and unaffected." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chaikins have introduced their friends to Galerie Lakaye and Haitian art. 
At first, he said, some of them "were put off by it. They weren't used to the 
use of color and the primitive forms that are indigenous to Haiti. Its not 
typical of what you find in most galleries." 
</P>
<P>
 But as they became more acquainted with the art, "it grew on them, much to 
their surprise and amazement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Lathan, a television director who lives in Beverly Hills, has "spent a 
lot of money with (Galerie Lakaye) over the last three years." Lathan, who is 
married to a Haitian and often visits the Caribbean nation, said that although 
much of the art reflects Haiti's "abject poverty and pain," many well-known 
artists are from affluent families who could afford to send their children to 
art schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he appreciates Galerie Lakaye's eclectic collection and its attention 
to new Haitian artists as well as to the masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Fabius is an American citizen and was able to secure a license from 
the U.S. Treasury Department, she has managed to continue buying art in Haiti 
despite trade restrictions imposed on the country to force its military rulers 
from power. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent opening of an exhibit of sculptures and paintings by two 
well-known Haitian artists had to be held without the artists because the pair 
couldn't obtain visas to leave Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabius is concerned that stiffer sanctions will interrupt the flow of Haitian 
art to the rest of the world. But even if that happens, she says, Haitian 
artists will continue to create. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art, " Fabius said, "is Haiti's only natural resource."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; ART OWNERS SUE INSURERS OVER QUAKE DAMAGE CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Monica couple who thought they had insured their multimillion-dollar 
art collection have sued an Encino insurance agency and a giant insurer for 
failing to pay a $2.5-million claim for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Donna Freedman, whose collection includes a $2.3-million Roy 
Lichtenstein oil painting titled "Expressionist Head," filed the lawsuit in Los 
Angeles Superior Court last week. The suit alleges that American Business 
Insurance Brokers Los Angeles Inc. sold them an all-risk policy for their 
collection of paintings and ceramics through Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., 
which has refused their claim. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the policy excluded earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman's Fund and American Business officials have declined to comment on the 
lawsuit. Both companies are defendants in the suit, which alleges negligence, 
bad faith and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedmans said they were surprised when Fireman's Fund denied their claim 
to cover 15 pieces of their collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Freedman, a Santa Monica attorney, said the 5-by-6-foot Lichtenstein 
painting suffered several scrapes and irreparable damage to its canvas when the 
wire from which it was hanging broke during the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible for me to express the feeling I had on that Saturday when 
they told me I had no coverage," Freedman said. "It's outrageous to me what 
they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Freedman called his broker at American Business and 
was told that his policy did include earthquake damage. The agency sent a 
letter to Fireman's Fund stating as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, on March 1, Fireman's Fund denied the claim, the lawsuit states. 
Freedman said he was told by the company that an amendment had been added which 
excluded earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman said American Business apparently discovered a copy of the amendment 
to the 1992 policy in their files when the dispute erupted. Freedman contended 
that he had never been told it existed until after he sued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have such an exclusion in our copy of the policy, and even if we 
did, one was never issued with the 1994 policy," said Bruce A. Friedman, an 
attorney representing the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said the couple switched insurers in 1992 from Lloyd's of London 
after an agent from American Business told them they could acquire a better 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedmans describe the conduct by Fireman's Fund in their lawsuit as 
despicable, malicious, fraudulent, oppressive and outrageous for failing to 
pay. They accuse American Business of negligence for selling them a policy that 
was substantially different from their previous policy with Lloyd's of London, 
which covered quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedmans are also seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Freedman said he and his wife purchased the Lichtenstein painting from a 
New York art dealer for $75,000 in 1980, when it first came out.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the painting's value grew, as have many pieces by 
Lichtenstein, whose works have been auctioned for as much as $6 million.

 Freedman said he has had the painting, which he describes as the centerpiece 
of his $3.2-million art collection, insured for 13 years.

 "You're thinking, 'Thank goodness I have insurance for my valuable 
possession,' " Freedman said. "Then to be told that you don't. . . . It's a big 
loss."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; STUDY URGES PURCHASE OF EDISON SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Edison officials are criticizing a Sacramento consulting 
firm's study that says Culver City could boost its revenues if it takes over 
the utility's local franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study is long on unrealistic assumptions and short on identifying the 
very real risks to Culver City in attempting such a venture," said Edison 
spokesman Fred Trueblood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a $24,000 feasibility study commissioned by the city, R.W. Beck & 
Associates concludes that a municipal electric service could generate more 
revenue for the city than the nearly $600,000 in annual franchise fees and 
property taxes that the city collects from Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Albert Vera, who last September proposed that the city look into the 
utility purchase, says such additional revenue could be used to improve 
policing and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss the report's findings during a July meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Mike Balkman and Ed Wolkowitz have said they oppose the 
proposal. Vera and council members Steven Gourley and James D. Boulgarides 
voted last November to study the matter, but have not decided whether they 
support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the city would purchase the two Edison distribution 
stations in the city. In its report, Beck & Associates says this could be 
financed by issuing 25-year bonds. The initial cost of the buyout, including 
legal costs and engineering, would be $2.5 million, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Power supply costs, considered the single greatest expense, were not 
estimated, although the report "assume(s) that initially the city would 
purchase power from Edison." Initial staffing of the utility company could be 
provided by outside contractors, and later shifted to city employees, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials, who acknowledge that they have not reviewed the report in 
detail, say Beck & Associates made serious omissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They significantly undervalued the Edison facilities," said Trueblood, adding 
that the estimates of start-up costs were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Trueblood said the city will be forced to pass these and other costs on to 
residents in the form of higher utility rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Park, principal engineer with R.W. Beck & Associates, defended the 
report, saying it comprehensively addressed all aspects of starting up a 
municipal utility. Park said he invites Edison to submit questions and comments 
about the study.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES: Citing recent violence and the likelihood of large summer crowds, 
the City Council has authorized additional traffic control officers to be 
deployed at Venice Beach on Sundays to free up police for other duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-0 vote Friday means the city's Department of Transportation can 
dispatch whatever number of civilian officers it needs to handle the crush of 
traffic expected at the beach -- one of Southern California's biggest summer 
tourist attractions, with crowds of 200,000 people some Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The deployment will begin Sunday and will run through Sept. 25. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 WEST HOLLYWOOD: The City Council got its first look Monday at a proposed 
$39-million budget for next year that cuts spending in most departments but 
includes no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council took no action on the plan but scheduled the first public hearing 
on it for June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul Brotzman cautioned that the proposed budget includes no 
provisions for cutbacks in state funding expected to come late this year -- 
after the June 30 deadline for adoption of the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget includes $37.1 million in operating expenses and $1.9 million for 
capital projects, including repairs to streets and city-owned buildings, and 
several lighting and sewer projects. The city would dip into reserves to cover 
about $450,000 of expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although spending would be reduced in most departments, cost-of-living 
increases are proposed for city employees and as part of the patrol contract 
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to borrow about $28 million to pay for a flurry of public 
projects: renovations to a new City Hall, fire station and post office complex, 
and three parking structures. But payments do not start until after next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: They still are not bargain-basement prices, but Rodeo Drive 
merchants can now "buy" a parking space from the City of Beverly Hills for a 
mere $25,000 -- less than half of the cost of parking spaces in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday revised its "in-lieu" parking program, in which 
property owners may pay into a parking fund instead of providing on-site 
parking. The money is used by the city to build parking structures in other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to lower the price per space to $25,000 on Rodeo Drive, 
$20,000 on Beverly Drive and $15,000 on other streets in the city's business 
district. The city had calculated the fees based on the appraised value of the 
property, but with rising land prices, the in-lieu parking program became too 
expensive for many businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after he expanded his building by 700 square feet, one Rodeo Drive 
property owner paid about $106,000 to the fund for the two parking spaces 
required by the municipal code. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a $472,438 contract for the drilling and 
construction of a well to test ground water in the aquifer under the Burton Way 
median. Construction is expected to begin within the next 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The 600-foot-deep well will be the first step in the city's proposed 
$12-million project to build seven wells and a water treatment plant. The plan 
calls for the wells to provide about 25% of the city's water, thus decreasing 
dependence on the Metropolitan Water District, the city's sole water provider.

REGIONAL REPORT; EL MONTE; CULTURAL CENTER IS SYMBOL OF TAIWANESE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty when it comes to the Chinese Cultural Center in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say the $3-million facility built by the Taiwanese government is a haven 
where overseas Chinese can rekindle ties with their historic culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, who believe Taiwan should be independent of China, see the center 
as a slap in the face. They want it renamed the Taiwanese Cultural Center to 
reflect who funded the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 They also accuse center officials of discriminating against them because of 
their political views. As evidence, they claim that center officials have not 
made rooms available when they call to schedule meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They intentionally discourage (pro-independence) Taiwanese Americans from 
using the center; a lot of us don't want to do any activities under that flag," 
said Jack Liu of Palos Verdes, president of the Collegiate Alumni Assn. of 
Taiwan, referring to the Taiwanese flag that adorns the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 To draw attention to their concerns, Liu and other pro-independence Taiwanese 
Americans planned a press conference today at a San Gabriel restaurant. Some 
said they will boycott the center until the name is changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Liao, director of the center, denied Liu's claim and said the center 
welcomes all overseas Chinese organizations. He said thousands of Chinese 
Americans use the center each week to take out books, hold conferences or learn 
calligraphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to serve people, welcome people, regardless of their political 
associations, Liao said. "I have no grudge with them. I respect their opinions. 
But there is a current reality existing. What will happen in the future we 
can't tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate offers a peek at the political crosscurrents battering Taiwan 
today, pitting many of the 500,000 to 600,000 overseas Chinese in Southern 
California against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side stand pro-independence Taiwanese Americans such as Liu who think 
that Taiwan's 21 million people should forget about negotiating a reunification 
with the People's Republic of China and declare themselves a free and separate 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are Taiwanese Americans such as Marina Tse, president of the 
Chinese American Educator's Assn. Tse, whose father was a senator in Taiwan, 
supports the government, which seeks an eventual reunification with mainland 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China. Mainland China, under its communist 
government, is the People's Republic of China. The feud between the two dates 
back 50 years, to when Mao Tse Tung's communists fought Chiang Kai-shek's 
Kuomintang party for control of the most populous nation in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1949, Mao had won and the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan, where they established 
a government in exile with the aim of eventually returning to the mainland once 
communism had been vanquished. They are still waiting.

REGIONAL REPORT; SAN PEDRO; DRIVING FORCE BEHIND AID FOR BOSNIAN WAR VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Santa Monica tow truck driver Stewart Resmer put out a call last month 
for relief supplies for Bosnian war victims, hundreds of people throughout Los 
Angeles brought tons of food, clothing and medical supplies to Berth 53 in San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, the more than five tons of relief supplies are on a ship 
somewhere between Savannah, Ga., and the Adriatic Sea.They are not bound 
directly for Bosnia but for a church organization in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable with it," said Resmer, 43, who started the relief drive last 
month on an impulse. "I think (the supplies) are going to get to people who 
need them." 
</P>
<P>
 But given the conflicts and suspicions between Bosnian Muslims, largely Roman 
Catholic Croatians and largely Eastern Orthodox Christian Serbs, some question 
whether relief supplies sent to a Croatian church organization will go to 
Bosnian Muslim hands. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the Croatian community in Los Angeles, however, said the 
relief supplies will be distributed to needy people in the war-ravaged areas of 
Bosnia regardless of ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to send relief supplies began in April, when Resmer asked a Santa 
Monica public radio station to broadcast an appeal to bring food, clothing and 
medical supplies to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian American Club paid about $2,600 for a shipping container and 
freight charges. A spokeswoman for A. Hartrodt (USA), a San Pedro shipping 
company, said the relief shipment was sent by rail to Savannah and loaded 
aboard the Sarajevo Express, which left May 8. The supplies will be delivered 
to the Croatian port of Rijeka in about a month and then taken to the city of 
Split. GORDON DILLOW

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: SCHOOLS CAN PLAY KEY ROLE IN EASING RACIAL 
TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I suspect most Californians are aware that it won't be long before whites of 
European descent are the minority in our state population. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the shift toward cultural and racial diversity may be most visible in 
our public schools. At many area schools, drastic changes in cultural and 
racial demographics have occurred in the last 10 or 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With diversity, however, has come tension. I know of no school, city or nation 
where people of different cultures, religions or races live in absolute 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Since some people will never learn or even want to overcome their prejudices 
or hatred of others who are different, even the most multicultural schools, 
neighborhoods and workplaces can't completely prevent racial or cross-cultural 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect, however, that such relations can still be much better than they are 
now -- particularly in school. In fact, there's a lot that teachers, staff and 
students can do to reduce ethnic and cultural conflict on their campuses -- 
and, down the line, in society in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the best way to reduce prejudice and hate is by teaching people about 
other cultures when they are young. 
</P>
<P>
 My school, Santa Monica High School, for example, tried a new tack last week 
by hosting a multicultural soiree. About 200 students of different ethnicities 
gathered in the school cafeteria for a dinner donated by local restaurants. 
Guest speakers from the community, reggae music and a drawing for dozens of 
prizes were highlights of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a successful event and would work at probably any school -- especially 
with a few improvements such as a wider variety of musical acts, guest 
speakers, art, decorations and informational displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom workshops and activities can help too. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Conference, formerly the National Conference of Christians and 
Jews, has conducted race-relations workshops with students and teachers at area 
schools for years, and more schools should adopt the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshop participants engage in exercises and games designed to make them 
question stereotypes and the prejudices they practice -- often unaware they are 
doing so. They are taught techniques they can use in teacher-student teams to 
spur discussion when they return to their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 B'nai B'rith, another national organization that focuses on reducing 
prejudice, also offers help to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's curriculum guide, "A World of Difference," is easy to use 
in the classroom and contains hundreds of assignments explaining various races, 
cultures and religions. 
</P>
<P>
 Students seem to be especially affected by first-person accounts of the pain 
of racism and prejudice. The guide costs about $60 and you must attend a 
one-day workshop in order to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most common ways to dispel stereotypes is by getting to know people 
from other groups. There's nothing like communication to help increase 
understanding and appreciation of others. Accordingly, schools should create 
"rap groups" in which all participants talk freely about racism, and ask 
questions about other cultures. Such groups should be supervised 
inconspicuously by adults who have a well-rounded grasp of history and of the 
cultures present at the school, and should be moderated by students trained in 
peer counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Curriculum changes can also help reduce tensions linked to ethnic diversity. 
All subjects can be improved to include the contributions of different cultures 
and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a history course can cover more of what has happened in nations 
and cultures other than the United States and Europe. Students in music, art, 
literature and science courses should learn what various ethnic groups have 
contributed to those fields. Even physical education teachers can help by using 
sports and games from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, elective courses in the histories of specific ethnic groups can 
help inform students and reduce their prejudices and ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such multicultural approaches have been advocated by the State Board of 
Education, but not all schools and teachers comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Using ethnically diverse learning groups in the classroom can also help: it 
can breed conversation and even friendship between students who might not 
otherwise interact. 
</P>
<P>
 Open discussions about racism should occur in every classroom. Some teachers 
may feel uncomfortable tackling this topic in class but the alternative -- 
seeing children beat up on each other -- is far more uncomfortable. Besides, 
students seem eager to discuss the topic: I've found that I need only offer a 
simple introductory question and my students will keep the discussion alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, school staff can help foster racial tolerance by becoming role models 
for students. 
</P>
<P>
 At my school, for example, teachers and staff of all races mingle every day at 
lunch and at meetings. Unfortunately, we're too often in the teachers' lounge 
or meeting rooms where students can't see us. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it may prove fruitful if teachers and staff were to spend one lunch a 
week in the students' area, where the students can see adults of different 
backgrounds having a good time together.

OUT AND ABOUT / SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS: A RANGE OF OUTDOOR ENJOYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may not be Mt. Kilimanjaro or the Swiss Alps. But as Jost Rhodius has 
discovered, the Santa Monica Mountain range offers its own array of 
breathtaking vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he founded his business, "Hiking in L.A.," a year ago, Rhodius has been 
conducting tours in English, German, French and Italian through the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Three-hour trips take visitors along trails to provide an 
overview of the plant life, animals, geology and topography of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He also devotes a great deal of time to discussing the history of the 
mountains and the culture of native inhabitants such as the Chumash Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an ideal family excursion, Rhodius said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Enjoy Disneyland but also experience the wondrous beauty of God's 
nature,' " said Rhodius, 37, of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists and local residents alike have found these hikes to be a great way to 
learn about and enjoy the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't realize there is hiking in Los Angeles," said Lynn 
Lewenberg, 22, a senior at UC Santa Barbara. "I am very interested in (learning 
about) the geography, plants and animals in this pristine area." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodius, a native of Dueren, Germany, developed an interest in hiking as a 
child and attributes his love of nature to his parents, who encouraged him to 
explore the outdoors. He has hiked in countries such as Germany, Switzerland 
and Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the University of Zurich with a degree in economics, he 
went to work for the Swiss Bank Corp. A transfer five years ago brought Rhodius 
to the company's L.A. office. Instead of heading to the beach, the avid hiker 
looked up to the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Rhodius traded in his briefcase and three-piece suits to pursue 
a longtime dream: running his own business. In preparation, he studied the 
history of the Santa Monica Mountains, hiked terrain along the Pacific Ocean 
from Ventura County to Griffith Park, and visited libraries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (hiking) is a little bit in my blood," Rhodius said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours are Monday through Friday, and by appointment on weekends. Cost: $25 for 
adults, $15 for children 11 and younger. Information: (818) 501-1005. CHRISTINA

HOUSING: NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE, NEW SANTA MONICA RENT-CONTROL REGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica political scene continues to adopt many of the same 
restrictive standards that have hampered our industry long before the 
Northridge earthquake on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 A new regulation of the Santa Monica Rent Control Board took effect May 11. 
This new facet of the rent law attempts to allow pass-throughs on 
earthquake-related capital expenditures. Petitions must be filed no later than 
Jan. 17, 1995, for completed repairs or work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants can file petitions to oppose the owner's repairs for damage relating 
to the earthquake based on the owner's costs of repairs or if the rent increase 
imposes a financial hardship for the tenant. Tenants who voluntarily 
relinquished their tenancy after the earthquake have the right to reoccupy 
their units once rehabilitation has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply allowing "vacancy decontrol" without any strings attached could and 
would allow owners to control the future of their Santa Monica rentals 
unhampered by idiotic formulas and petition processes. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly bill authored by Jim Costa may, if passed in Sacramento, do just 
this: create vacancy decontrol in California's communities with radical rent 
control policies such as ours in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in May, a petition drive began to change the City Charter to require an 
owner to pay $10,000 for the privilege of decontrol upon vacancy. This sum 
would have to be paid directly to the vacating tenant, or paid directly to the 
city of Santa Monica if the tenant refuses to accept the money. These funds 
would be required to be paid within 21 days for each vacated unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in control of the rental industry in Santa Monica still think after 15 
years that the owners have huge, deep pockets lined with gold. Even after 
paying this ridiculous ransom, the vacated unit immediately falls back under 
rent control's full regulation once re-rented! 
</P>
<P>
 Rental housing development used to be a fun way to invest your money and 
energies up until April 10, 1979, when rent control moved into Santa Monica. 
Maybe the effects of the Northridge earthquake will alter our political 
landscape with the permanent loss of thousands of voters. Only time will tell 
-- maybe soon a vacancy in City Hall will occur as the political power base 
shifts away from the radical left. 
</P>
<P>
 A free-market economy built our city's rental units and a free-market economy 
will be required to rebuild our destroyed Santa Monica housing industry!

 Santa Monica High sprinter Tyson Murphy will be among 15 runners attempting to 
qualify for the Southern Section Division I championships during a special 
runoff today at Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
 The runoff is being held because the Southern Section office determined that 
15 runners were improperly prevented from qualifying because the preliminary 
meet's Accutrack automatic timing system had malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accutrack measures races in hundredths of a second but failed before the 
start of the girls' 100-meter low hurdles -- the day's fifth event -- and 
remained inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Raya, the Accutrack operator Saturday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, 
manually ran the timing system after it malfunctioned. The Southern Section 
office, however, determined it was not an inaccurate way to measure times of 
runners from different heats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been determined that due to the malfunction of the Accutrack system, 
the Southern Section has gone to hand times in tenths to determine the final 
qualifiers for the championships," Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley 
said. "A runoff will be held in cases where runners had the same hand times." 
</P>
<P>
 The races affected were the boys' 100, 200 and 400 meters, and the girls' 100 
meters and 100 high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy qualified in the 110 high hurdles after edging one the nation's top 
hurdlers, Ken Haslip of Muir. He had qualified in the 200 and was an alternate 
in the 100, but will rerun both races today. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Coach Patrick Cady believes his runner will do better the second 
time because he had the same time as runners from other heats who had 
wind-aided times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyson can beat them now," Cady said. "Those guys had faster times because 
they had gales at their backs. We're ready now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 100, Murphy will run against Troy Searcy of Quartz Hill, Jamal Carr of 
Muir and Anthony Rudolph of West Covina. The top two times advance to the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200, he will compete against Michael Granville of Bell Gardens and 
Akinyela Taylor of Dominguez, with the top two advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's finish in the 110 hurdles qualifies him for the finals, but his time 
of 14.04 -- considered at the time the second fastest in the nation -- will not 
count because of the timing system failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 110 hurdles is the biggest race for me," Murphy said. "After that, 
everything else is gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who has a B-plus grade-point average, recently chose to attend the 
University of Pennsylvania in the fall, where he will run track. NET VICTORY 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitters Raoul Williams of University and Mike DiSimone of Granada 
Hills put on a display of spiking the volleyball Friday during the City Section 
4-A Division championships at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, however, won their fifth championship with their blocking and 
back-row play. University defeated Granada Hills, 15-11, 15-2, 9-15, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could not stop our middle game," University Coach Neal Newman said. "I 
think we beat them to the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a sophomore, had 26 kills compared to 15 for DiSimone, who will 
attend San Diego State in the fall. Several of Williams' kills came from the 
back row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they put two blockers on him and he still got his kills," Newman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be overlooked was the play of middle blockers Nick Strouse (17 kills 
and four blocks) and Brian Lieb (seven kills, three blocks). Setter Jamie 
Strofs gave a workmanlike effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (15-1) also won 4-A titles in 1975, 1985, 1987 and 1992. 
BASKETBALL SIGNING 
</P>
<P>
 James Gray, a 6-foot-3 point guard from Santa Monica College, signed a letter 
of intent with Georgia Sunday, Bulldog assistant Mark Slonaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray averaged 16.7 points, 5.1 rebounds and 5.7 assists last season as a 
sophomore at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw us play last year, you know we really needed a point guard," 
Slonaker said. "Two years ago, we had one of the top two or three recruiting 
classes in the nation, but we didn't get a point guard. James Gray belongs in 
that class." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray is expected to start at point guard for Bulldog Coach Hugh Durham. 
</P>
<P>
 "What grabbed our attention was that he's 6-3, quick and has long arms," 
Slonaker said. "He has great instincts on defense. Coach Durham is known for 
his quick trapping defensive teams and James fits that mold. Offensively, he is 
so well-rounded: good shooter, penetrates well and he's unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray made 53.9% of his shots from the field, including 37.1% from three-point 
range. A two-year starter, he became the Corsairs all-time leading scorer with 
1,124 points. He was named to the Western State Conference first team and was 
an honorable mention all-state selection. 
</P>
<P>
 During his senior season at Westchester, Gray was selected the City Section 
and The Times' Westside player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray is the second California player to play for Georgia. Former St. Monica 
High forward Cleveland Jackson played the past two seasons for Georgia after 
attending Butler County Junior College in Kansas. JUST SAY NO 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads pitcher Jessica Schulman threw her second consecutive no-hitter and 
took part in another one last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman threw a no-hitter to lead the Roadrunners to a 1-0 win over St. Paul 
in the Thousand Oaks tournament. The Stanford-bound senior followed that effort 
with a no-hitter in a 7-0 nonleague win over Redondo May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching two innings Friday, Schulman combined with Erika Kolvula for a 
no-hitter in a 12-0 win over Brentwood. COACHING HURT 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Academy softball Coach Keith Cameron felt shooting pains in his 
arms May 9 and was taken to UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Cameron, 26, suffered four crushed disks and nerve damage in a 
car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suffered partial paralysis, but nothing like that before," Cameron said. 
"The disks started to move and blocked off some of the nerves in my back." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 11, Cameron was back in uniform coaching Notre Dame Academy's 11-1 
victory over Flintridge Sacred Heart. SEAN WATERS

DOOR OPENED TO CIRCUMVENT CAMPAIGN LAW; COURT: JUDGE INDICATES THAT $1,000 CAP 
ON CONTRIBUTIONS MIGHT BE EXCEEDED IF A SPOUSE GIVES MONEY THAT IS NOT 
COMMUNITY PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge Wednesday refused to allow a campaign donor to exceed Orange 
County's strict political contribution limit, but left open the possibility 
that the election reform law could be legally circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
 In spontaneous remarks from the bench, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies 
suggested that married couples might be able to make two $1,000 contributions 
instead of one, if one spouse simply gave the other a monetary "gift." That 
gift might be considered "separate property" and used as a contribution apart 
from the spouse's donation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a loophole, political reformers said Wednesday, would allow hundreds of 
thousands of additional dollars to be funneled into campaigns, violate the 
intent of the county's law and severely limit its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly that would undermine the intent of the law," said Ruth Holton, 
executive director of the Sacramento-based California Common Cause, a watchdog 
group. "Our attorneys do not believe that the case law supports the notion of a 
gift as separate property." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies' comments came during a hearing on a preliminary injunction sought by 
Debra L. Reed, wife of unsuccessful Republican state Senate candidate Dana 
Reed, who sued the county April 26, claiming that its campaign finance law was 
discriminatory to married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, listed on the June, 1992, ballot as Measure T, was overwhelmingly 
approved by Orange County voters. The ordinance is among the strictest in the 
state, prohibiting candidates from accepting more than $1,000 from any single 
source during an election cycle, generally four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Married couples are considered a single source and bound by the $1,000 limit. 
The only exception allows a spouse to contribute from funds that are not 
considered a couple's community property. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Reed's lawsuit is the first legal challenge to the county ordinance. 
According to court documents she filed, Debra Reed gave $100 to County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner on April 26, after her husband had already 
contributed $1,000 to the supervisor's reelection campaign for the June 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner's treasurer returned Debra Reed's donation because it exceeded the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies denied Debra Reed's request for an injunction, ruling that there was 
insufficient evidence to determine whether the $100 was from the couple's 
community property or her separate funds. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said it was unclear whether Dana Reed's contribution, drawn on a check 
from his law firm, was separate or community property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are missing," Davies said. "Whether it was separate property, 
community property, whatever, we don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies indicated that if Dana Reed gave money to his wife as a "gift," she 
might be able to consider it separate property and make an additional 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Without knowing the source of the contribution, Davies said he couldn't get to 
"the fascinating issues of the case . . . the discrimination (charge). That's a 
good issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Reed, however, considers the money she used for the contribution to 
Steiner as community property and will not try to circumvent the law by calling 
it a gift, her husband said. Instead she intends to fight the law in court as 
discriminatory no matter where the funds come from, Dana Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the case is scheduled for July 25, more than a month after the 
primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies comments on the gift issue were part of a legal debate with Debra 
Reed's attorney and did not constitute any official court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bradley W. Hertz, who represented Debra Reed, told the judge that he 
thought "these type of reform laws could be circumvented" if spouses used gifts 
to separate their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the issue of the moment," Davies replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Reed, who attended the court hearing, said he interpreted the judge's 
comments to mean that he could bypass the county's law by giving his wife a 
$100 gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "He basically instructed me to do that," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy County Counsel Donald H. Rubin, who represented the county, said he was 
concerned by Davies' comments because he seemed to be "saying the law could be 
circumvented." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin said a gift from one spouse to another for the sole purpose of exceeding 
the campaign contribution limit would "violate the intent" of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he needed to do research to determine whether gifts from one 
spouse to another would be classified legally as separate property. "I can't 
tell what the county's position will be until we look into it," Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley L. Grindle, a local political activist who pushed for the campaign 
finance reform law, said she doubted politicians would accept more than $1,000 
from married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would look very bad," she said. "It's a sneaky way (around the law). No 
candidate is going to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Reed said that Davies' argument might enable one wealthy individual to 
funnel unlimited amounts of money into a campaign by giving various people 
money and having them submit the cash to a designated candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would be all right for a single person to do that," Rubin 
said. "I think that an enforcement act could be brought."

SUIT TO CHALLENGE POLICE GANG-FILE PHOTOGRAPHY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: ACTION 
EXPECTED ON BEHALF OF TWO VIETNAMESE GIRLS WHO SAY THEY WERE SINGLED OUT ON 
BASIS OF DRESS, ETHNICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lawyers for two Vietnamese girls -- described as high school honor students -- 
announced they intend to file a class-action lawsuit Thursday to force the 
Garden Grove Police Department to stop taking photographs of teen-agers for its 
police files and gang mug books. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union, which is handling the case, charged that 
the local police had falsely accused the girls of being gang members because of 
their dress and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident involving Minhtran Tran and Queyn Pham, both 15, happened while 
the girls were waiting for a ride from a Garden Grove shopping strip one 
evening last year, according to ACLU officials. The girls, who were dressed in 
baggy pants and tight-fitting blouses, complained that they were ordered to 
stand against a wall while their photographs were taken with a Polaroid camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Through their lawyer, both girls declined to comment on the case until the 
lawsuit is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint one of several challenges to a popular police practice in Orange 
County of photographing suspected gang members for police files. Last fall, the 
4th District Court of Appeal criticized the strategy as unconstitutional, but 
most local police departments have continued the practice after tightening 
their procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Garden Grove police defended the practice, saying the 
photographs have helped track down criminals. According to department 
guidelines, Garden Grove officers have the discretion to take photographs if 
they have "a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an investigative tool that has been successful in resolving violent 
crimes," said Capt. Scott Jordan. "We tried to take into consideration all the 
interests of our citizens and we've made some changes in our policies. And we 
will continue to use this unless we are stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan declined to discuss the incident involving the girls, but observed that 
"just because a person is an honor student does not mean they're not a gang 
member. There is a general belief that honor students are not gang members and 
that is not the case. Many of them are in a gang."

COUPLE'S FATAL FALL OFF CLIFF SEEN AS AN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A divorced couple who fell to their deaths from a Corona del Mar cliff over 
the weekend had been "rekindling their relationship," the woman's first husband 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Taylor, 44, of Mission Viejo said he believes the deaths were accidental 
because of the reconciliation attempt, along with the police investigation and 
evidence provided by his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have said Robyn Liebman Taylor, 41, and her ex-husband, Robert Leslie 
Hammontree, 29, fell from the jagged cliff accidentally. Their bodies were 
found 100 feet below by beach strollers on Sunday just before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Robyn Taylor were married for seven years until 1980 and had two 
children together. Gary Taylor said that news reports suggesting that Robyn's 
relationship with Hammontree at the time of the deaths was in "less than 
amicable terms" differed from what he knew of the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been attempting to reconcile their relationship for several months 
prior to this incident," Gary Taylor said. "In fact, they had been dating each 
other as early as January." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court records show that at one time, Robyn Taylor 
received a restraining order against Hammontree, whom she accused of beating 
her while they were married. The couple were divorced in July, 1992, 14 months 
after they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Taylor said his ex-wife had been married and divorced four times. She had 
attempted to reconcile with each of her former husbands except him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes the deaths were accidental because his ex-wife had paid 
three months' rent in advance for her Santa Ana apartment and had made plans to 
visit her aunt on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no evidence or reason to suggest that their deaths were 
nothing more than accidental," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Taylor, who almost broke into tears while reading from a prepared 
statement at the Newport Beach Police Department, said he wanted to tell what 
he knew for the sake of his and Robyn's two teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and his sons tried to "stay out of her life as much as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 "All her moves were very traumatic" to the children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Taylor, who was born in Tustin and lived in Santa Ana, graduated from 
high school and held many jobs, the latest of them as a loan officer, Gary 
Taylor said. He would not say where she worked as a loan officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said investigators found several bottles 
and cans of beer and "a small amount of marijuana" in a plastic bag at the top 
of the cliff. He said the car that police found near the cliff was registered 
in Robyn Taylor's name. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed the couple died of injuries from the fall. A toxicology 
report will not be available for at least another week, according to police 
officials.

HOUSE OF HOPE RISES FROM LAGUNA ASHES; REBUILD: COMMUNITY CELEBRATES FIRST HOME 
TO BE COMPLETED SINCE THE FALL FIRESTORM, BUT THE EVENT IS BITTERSWEET. OUT OF 
400 DESTROYED HOMES, ONLY 7 PERMITS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 
</P>

<P>
 With a picture perfect day for a backdrop, dozens of well-wishers gathered at 
838 Manzanita Drive on Wednesday to celebrate the completion of the first house 
to be rebuilt since last fall's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by television crews and encouraged by old friends, owner Louise Benton 
and tenant Patricia Powers labored to describe their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're mixed," said Powers, who will move back into the house next weekend. 
"It's like I'm the only one. I'll really be happy when my other neighbors start 
building and get in as well." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the wood, brick and stucco house with the fire-retardant roof and a 
shiny plaque bragging, "First Rebuilt Home 1993 Firestorm" could be a symbol 
that this beleaguered city can rebuild itself someday. And around here, fresh 
hope has been in short supply in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 homes were destroyed in and around Laguna Beach -- 286 within 
the city limits. Seven months later, the city has issued seven rebuilding 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always slow to start and then things pick up," said Rick Bennett, a 
building inspector who signed off on Benton's house Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding process has been hampered by news that an ancient landslide 
lies under 13 burned lots in the Mystic Hills neighborhood just above Powers' 
house and that similar conditions might exist in the fire-scarred Temple Hills 
community visible from her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some displaced residents -- including several who munched stuffed grape 
leaves and sipped Snapple and Perrier during the party Wednesday -- are moving 
forward with building plans. City officials say that, as of Friday, 119 people 
have submitted rebuilding applications to the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick said one trend is becoming 
evident: Most property owners want new houses that are 10% to 50% larger than 
their previous houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger projects prompt closer scrutiny by the city and neighbors than did 
Benton's 2,400-square-foot house, which fell within 10% of the original 
building footprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, plans for homes 10% to 50% larger than the original structure 
require staff review. Projects involving houses more than 50% larger must be 
approved by the city's Design Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most stubborn wrinkle to surface in the rebuilding process revolves 
around the city's geological concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims -- like other residents in hillside areas -- must first get 
clearance from their own geologist and then approval from the city's reviewing 
geologist. So far, Butterwick said, of the 71 geology reports filed by 
residents, 23 have been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in a position to release any building permits until we have 
received clearance with respect to the site's geology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems, however, were shelved for the day on Manzanita Drive, where 
Benton, wearing a straw hat and, coincidentally, celebrating her 79th birthday, 
greeted friends as Powers began to consider how she will arrange her furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy with this house and it's very much like it was before," said 
Benton, who lived with her family in the Manzanita house for 30 years before 
renting it out five years ago. She now lives up the hill from her rental in a 
house that survived the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But like others at the noontime celebration, Benton's emotions teetered. What 
she really misses, she said, is her weaving studio and 35 years of artwork she 
kept at the old Manzanita house that burned in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Benton plans to design a new studio and start again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that gets built and I get back to weaving," she said, "then I'll be 
happy."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BAG WITH 35 SYRINGES FOUND AFLOAT IN SURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a surf shop found a plastic bag containing 35 used syringes 
floating in about two feet of water just off the beach Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 T.K. Brimer, 45, owner of the Frog House, said he was surfing just south of 
the Santa Ana River mouth when he spotted the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction was to get away from it," Brimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimer said he took the syringes to nearby Hoag Hospital. After determining 
that the instruments had not come from that hospital, officials there disposed 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens about three times a year," hospital spokeswoman Maureen 
Mazzatenta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the bag is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, county director of public health, said that even one used 
syringe can pose a potential public health problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since you don't know who used it, you have to worry about blood-borne 
diseases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach, however, remains open. 
</P>

 Police said they were not notified of the incident despite the fact that they 
investigate such finds to determine the source.

 "I've heard of it happening a couple of times in the past, but I would not

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; WEST SIDE POLICE SUBSTATION TO REOPEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's west side police substation will reopen next week, less than a year 
after budget cuts forced officials to close it. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will provide west side residents with a convenient location to 
report crime problems, get bicycle licenses and pick up information, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your local neighborhood station," said Officer Darrell Freeman, who 
supervised the substation, located across the street from Lions Park at 567 W. 
18th St.  
</P>
<P>
 The reopening was made possible by five senior citizens who agreed to 
volunteer their time to the department. The volunteers underwent several months 
of training and will staff the substation's front desk beginning Wednesday. 
They will wear civilian police employee uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The city closed the 9-year-old substation in July when budget cuts required 
officials to transfer the station's two civilian employees to police 
headquarters, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who need copies of police records still must go to the main police 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation also is sponsoring a cleanup on the 700 block of Shalimar 
Street on Saturday between 9 a.m. and noon. Residents can help remove graffiti 
and clear away mattresses, couches and chairs from a nearby alley. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; GROUP FIGHTS TO KEEP CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents are organizing to fight the city's planned dissolution of 
its Fire Department in order to contract with the county for fire and paramedic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 residents met this week at the First Southern Baptist Church of Buena 
Park to organize their effort. Terry Longacre, who attended, said they hope to 
seek a referendum or legal action. Meetings will be at 7 p.m. on Tuesdays at 
the church on Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to reverse that decision," Longacre said. "We are opposed to losing 
our city Fire Department and losing the local control that goes with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the move will decrease service and cost the city more money in 
the long run. But supporters say the city will save money and maintain the 
current level of service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department will take over fire protection services 
beginning Oct. 1. Buena Park becomes the 17th Orange County city to contract 
with the county for those services. The city agreed this week to a county 
contract that will save Buena Park about $1.2 million over the next four years. 
Under the agreement, one of the city's four engine companies will be 
eliminated, but the county will add a fourth firefighter to a truck company. 
The first year, the city will pay the county about $400,000 a month for fire 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 First Southern Baptist pastor Wiley S. Drake Sr., who has also been a vocal 
opponent of the move, said he believes most residents are too. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the City Council seems to think that the majority of the people are 
in favor of it," Drake said.  
</P>
<P>
 "What upset us most is (that the council) didn't listen to us and criticized 
us as being a small band of rabble-rousers that were speaking for a minority of 
the community rather than a majority." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Max Schulman said the city improperly hired a consultant to analyze 
the county fire proposal at a cost of $10,000 without notifying the public. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke said he hired the consultant at the council's 
direction. Under a city ordinance, O'Rourke said, he has the authority to spend 
money to hire consultants without council action in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the city has done anything inappropriate," O'Rourke said. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; PLAN ENVISIONS GOLF COURSE, 400 HOUSES

 Marking the beginning of a lengthy approval process, the Irvine Co. is seeking 
public comment on a plan to build 400 estate homes around an 18-hole golf 
course in the hills east of Turtle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have discussed the Shady Canyon project with several Turtle 
Rock homeowners associations over the last few weeks.The city is now in the 
process of selecting a consulting firm to prepare the environmental impact 
report on the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a consultant is hired, a public meeting involving city planning 
officials, the consultant and the Irvine Co. will be held, probably sometime in 
June, said Michael J. Le Blanc, vice president of Irvine Community Builders, a 
division of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the project is still in its earliest stages. The environmental 
impact report will not be completed for another six months, and the City 
Council is not expected to consider the matter until early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. wants to construct as many as 400 custom executive-style homes 
along a picturesque canyon at the end of Bonita Canyon Drive. Le Blanc said the 
community would have private streets, homes on expansive lots and acres of 
nearby open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes to create a rural atmosphere in Shady Canyon by planting 
greenery and limiting the number of street lights in the area, Le Blanc said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's approval could jeopardize plans to extend Sand Canyon Avenue 
from the San Diego Freeway to the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor. As 
currently designed, the Sand Canyon Avenue extension would cut directly though 
the golf course development. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; COLLEGE MAY OFFER ETHNIC STUDIES DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback College, where hate crimes targeting African American students have 
occurred in recent years, will soon start forming what may become the first 
ethnic studies department at a community college in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's recently appointed president, Ned Doffoney, said Wednesday that 
by summer the school will place a faculty member in charge of developing the 
new department. 
</P>
<P>
 That professor would also teach a modified version of an existing ethnic 
studies class this fall while beginning the long process of developing a new 
curriculum of multiethnic classes. It will probably take a year or more to set 
up the department and hire more professors to teach the new courses, Doffoney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to a string of racially motivated incidents, the Saddleback Community 
College District trustees voted in January to hire a consulting team to advise 
Saddleback College on the development of a multiethnic studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10,000 study, which was released at a forum at the school on Tuesday, 
recommends that the campus immediately begin developing the multiethnic studies 
department. The cost for that is not yet known, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for multiethnic studies on campus intensified last fall following two 
racially motivated incidents at the Mission Viejo campus. In one, an African 
American woman reported finding a threatening note on her car's windshield in 
November. A month later, two African American candidates for homecoming king 
and queen said flyers containing racial slurs had been left in their mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the candidates, Ricc Waddell, the president of the Black United 
Students, withdrew from the homecoming contest and said he had received a 
letter with similar threats earlier in the year. Waddell, who could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday, became the spokesman for students who demanded 
that the college address the hate issue by forming a multiethnic studies 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said that, even in the absence of the hate crimes, it's 
important for students to understand issues affecting an ethnically diverse 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback and other community colleges in the county list various 
cross-cultural courses -- including Chicano and Asian literature and 
introductory history courses on various cultures -- that fall under sociology, 
art and history departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Doffoney said the school's curriculum committee, academic senate, various 
student organizations and other campus groups will have a say in the types of 
classes to be offered by the department.ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; STUDENTS SHOW OFF THEIR MURAL VIRTUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a flourish, the Marco Forster Middle School students pulled away a cloth 
to reveal a colorful mural painted in defiance of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 students and teachers jammed into the school's "cafetorium" 
Wednesday for a special assembly and unveiling of the 35-foot-long, 8-foot-high 
mural. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven students spent much of the last two months creating the mural in 
response to racist flyers that were stuffed into 1,200 lockers on the campus in 
January. The flyers targeted Latino students, who make up about 30% of the 
student population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them that if they reacted in a negative way (to the flyers), that 
would be exactly the reaction desired," said Dale Carter, the art teacher who 
worked with the students on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 So the students decided to paint a mural to show pride in their culture and 
promote understanding and unity within the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't fight back -- they painted back," said Marc Lavine, director of 
in-school detention. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural depicts an eagle, a Mexican village and cornfields, Aztec symbols, 
the U.S. and Mexican flags and a portrait of Benito Juarez, the Mexican general 
who defeated the French army in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 It also depicts a traditional blue alcove where candles burn, and the smoke 
spells out the names of the artists. Next to a likeness of the Virgin of 
Guadalupe is the quote: "Between individuals as between nations, respect for 
another's rights is peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us feel proud to be who we are," said Yohana Sandoval, 14, one of 
the student artists. "It's a way to show that."  
</P>
<P>
 The assembly focused on Mexican culture, with traditional dances performed by 
students and a video of the making of the mural. The mural was previously 
unveiled at a Cinco de Mayo party for the artists and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, like Leonel Perez and Julio Peraza, were so inspired by the 
project that they plan to take art classes in Pasadena during the summer, 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the first assembly, which had to stop so that the ceremony could 
be repeated for the other half of the school, Sandoval concluded: "We hope 
Marco Forster can be united forever."AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MORE TEEN CURFEW SWEEPS ARE LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city probably will have more curfew sweeps in its downtown, but they won't 
be announced in advance, a police spokesman said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to tell anyone (in advance) because the (news) media caused 
us a lot of problems," Lt. Charles Poe said Tuesday . 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said police were particularly "disappointed" at the behavior of television 
crews who covered Saturday night's sweep of the downtown area. That sweep had 
been announced in advance by police. But Poe said the resulting coverage, 
especially by TV crews, caused young people to act rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The TV cameras became focal points for the kids to act up in front of," Poe 
said. "The TV people were going up and down the street, asking kids, 'What do 
you think about being kicked out?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said that scores of youths gathered about 10 
p.m. Saturday, when the curfew sweep began downtown. Lowenberg said police did 
not immediately move in and try to seize any of the taunting youths, but 
instead took a slow, low-key approach that he believes avoided a potential 
riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew was aimed at enforcing the city's law against loitering by 
juveniles after 10 p.m. in public places. Young people who are apprehended are 
held while their parents are notified to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said no definite decision has been made, but more sweeps are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 During the City Council's public comments period Monday night, many city 
residents praised the curfew sweep, and no one spoke against it. Most speakers 
praised the low-key reaction of police to the rowdy youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer also praised how police handled the sweep. "I know, 
because I was down there in the crowd, watching what happened," Bauer said. 
"Police got the crowd to move along orderly, and I moved along with everyone 
else. It was handled very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said that police, in addition to enforcing the curfew law, are also on the 
lookout for bars and other businesses downtown that may hold crowds bigger than 
the legal limits. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY, SANTA ANA; 2 MEN AT BUS STOPS KILLED IN 
ACCIDENTS

<P>
 Two men were struck and killed by vehicles while they waited at bus stops 
Tuesday in Santa Ana and Fountain Valley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims were hit by vehicles that were apparently out of control, 
officials said.The driver who struck the man in Santa Ana sped away from the 
scene, and police are investigating the incident as a hit-and-run.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana incident occurred about 8:40 p.m. at South Main Street and 
McFadden Avenue. According to police, 33-year-old Fernando Jose Zapata of Santa 
Ana and an acquaintance were standing at the bus stop at 1131 S. Main St. when 
a speeding northbound vehicle, described as a dark blue, full-size pickup, 
drifted to the right, struck the curb, and continued forward with part of the 
truck traveling on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup struck Zapata, throwing him against a brick wall, police said. The 
pickup driver sped away. Zapata died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours earlier, a 69-year-old man was fatally injured at a bus stop near 
Edinger Avenue and Ward Street in Fountain Valley. According to police, 
69-year-old Harry Stanley Studebaker, described as a transient, was sitting at 
a bus bench when he was struck by a car driven by Tuyet Mai Thi Nguyen, 27, of 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Nguyen was completing a left turn from southbound Ward Street to 
eastbound Edinger Avenue when his car hit the curb and crossed the sidewalk, 
striking Studebaker. He died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fountain Valley police Sgt. Dann Bean, Nguyen was not cited and 
the accident is under investigation. Police urge anyone who saw the accident to 
contact them at (714) 965-4481. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 3 BOARD CANDIDATES BACK EL TORO AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three of the candidates vying to succeed retiring Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder described the possible conversion of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to 
a commercial airport as Orange County's greatest opportunity to attract new 
business and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The base conversion issue -- addressed Wednesday by Huntington Beach 
Councilman Jim Silva, Raymond Thomas Littrell and Haydee V. Tillotson -- has 
been particularly controversial in Orange County during the past year. North 
County residents have favored a commercial airport, while some South County 
residents have opposed it because of concerns that a new airport would bring 
increased traffic and noise to their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer should Orange County be a little brother to Los Angeles County," 
Silva said, adding that local businesses now must truck much of their air cargo 
to and from Los Angles International Airport because of the limited capacity at 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, Littrell and Tillotson -- three of the five candidates vying for 
Wieder's seat -- appeared Wednesday at a Costa Mesa forum sponsored by the 
city's Rotary Club. All three agreed that such an airport, and the business 
development that would surround it, has the potential to create thousands of 
jobs when the 4,700-acre base closes by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, Silva said, Orange County has lost 190,000 jobs 
because of a sagging state economy and "over-regulation" by local and state 
government. Silva said he collected his statistics from state government.  
</P>
<P>
 Referring to permit requirements and fees for proposed development in area 
cities and in unincorporated areas of the county , Silva said: "We're 
regulating business right out of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Littrell, a former Garden Grove councilman, said he saw no logic in converting 
the military air station to anything but a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "El Toro has been planned for an airport for the past 50 years," Littrell 
said, referring to the base's military function. "Putting a commercial airport 
at El Toro would take the pressure off John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three candidates, Tillotson was the most reserved in her support, 
saying she would favor such a development provided that concerns about air 
safety, increased vehicle traffic and other issues were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest opportunity Orange County has to create jobs," 
Tillotson, a Huntington Beach businesswoman, said of future development at El 
Toro. "I do not know of all the problems yet, but there is a need in this 
county to use that land to bring economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 All five District 2 candidates -- including Huntington Beach Councilwoman 
Linda Moulton-Patterson and Huntington Beach businessman John Thomas, who were 
not present Wednesday -- are expected to square off at 7:30 tonight at the 
Costa Mesa City Council chamber.KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; A FAST WAY TO LEARN AT A SNAIL'S PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kentucky Derby may have been exciting to some folks, but for the 
sixth-graders at Stanley Elementary School nothing can beat the thrill of 
racing garden snails. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some may poke fun at the slow-moving mollusks. But students said that 
what their steeds lack in speed and majesty, they more than make up for in, 
well, slime. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 sixth-grade students participated in the school's seventh annual 
snail race Wednesday afternoon. The races were part of a science project 
intended to teach students about the crawly critters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool. I expected them to sit there, but they went really fast," said 
10-year-old Angela English after watching the first few races. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Barbara Ridgeway said that she uses the races to teach children some 
interesting facts about snails, which can pull 200 times their own weight, have 
25,600 teeth called radula, and can sleep for as long as four years without 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
 After being admonished to place no bets on their invertebrate pets, students 
put their snails at the center of two concentric circles drawn on laminated 
paper. The object was to coax snails to the outside of the outermost ring with 
bribes of potato chips, grass, celery and other inducements. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of each race moved on to compete in subsequent heats. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the races, children screamed, shouted and sometimes chanted, 
"Escargot! Escargot!" with deafening enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 The final heat included three snail speedsters: Little Fat Pat, Mister Fast, 
and Lucky. Little Fat Pat poured on the speed early on and never lost his lead. 
He finished the 10-inch course in just over 1:05, fully two lengths ahead of 
his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents finished in a tie, but Lucky was penalized for crawling onto the 
back of Mister Fast and being carried across the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Fat Pat's trainer, 12-year-old Patrick Nguyen, leaped and punched the 
air with his fist when the snail inched across the finish line. He later 
received a trophy for his efforts: a gold-painted snail shell mounted on a 
block of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were clearly entertained by the science project, and a crowd of 
about 200 children from other grades crowded around to watch the races unfold. 
Several youngsters offered their own theories and observations about 
handicapping the races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snails come in two speeds: slow and slower. The slow ones win," said 
12-year-old Garrett Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his own crawler lost early on, he said, studying snails at the 
racetrack was much more interesting than reading about them in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to have fun and learn about snails," he said. "I hate looking at 
books. This is fun."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CITY OKS 19-CENT HIKE IN TRASH RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council has approved a 19-cent increase in the monthly trash fee for 
city residents, and officials warned residents to expect future hikes as the 
cost of dumping trash at county landfills rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the county is not expected to increase landfill costs this year, City 
Administrator Robert D'Amato said he expects future fee hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is not going to lose money on landfill operations," D'Amato said. 
"The cost is going to go up and up." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.5% increase, to $12.79 a month, includes a 5-cent addition for trash 
collection, a 13-cent increase for recycling collection and a 1-cent increase 
in the bulky item pickup charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rate, which goes into effect July 1, is the sixth lowest of the 13 
cities in the county with comparable service, according to a city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial trash rates will also increase between 1.6% and 3.1% a month, 
depending on the type of trash container. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents said the price increase proves that Taormina Industries is 
an inefficient trash hauler and that the city should hire a new company. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have to have two raises in one year, maybe we're with the wrong 
contractor," said Sharon Burnside during a public hearing on the proposed 
increase. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

TRIAL OPENS FOR ATTORNEY ACCUSED OF DUPING CLIENTS; COURTS: LEISURE WORLD 
LAWYER JAMES D. GUNDERSON GOT MILLION-DOLLAR BEQUESTS FROM ESTATES OF VERY 
ELDERLY THAT OTHER HEIRS CHALLENGE AS ILL-GOTTEN GAINS. HE INSISTS HE NEVER 
ABUSED ANYONE'S TRUST FOR AN INHERITANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James D. Gunderson, the Orange County lawyer whose million-dollar inheritances 
from clients' estates sparked changes in state law, was accused in court 
Tuesday of engaging in a scheme to profit from his clients and misusing his 
position "to line his own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were leveled during opening statements of a civil trial in 
which heirs of a deceased Leisure World man are challenging a $3.5-million 
net-after-taxes bequest to Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives of Merrill A. Miller, who died in February, 1992, say Gunderson 
coerced or deceived the bedridden 98-year-old man into leaving him the largest 
single portion of an $18-million estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man did the most despicable (thing) . . . used his position of trust not 
for those who relied upon him, but for himself," said John Westover, a Phoenix 
attorney representing Miller's relatives, who have sued for the return of the 
more than $5 million that Gunderson took from the estate as his inheritance and 
to pay the federal taxes due on the bequest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson has insisted that there was nothing inappropriate about the bequest, 
saying that in serving as Miller's attorney for 20 years the two had become 
close friends, and that Miller intended to reward that friendship with the 
biggest share of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westover, in his opening arguments, said "James Gunderson was not a friend 
(of Miller). Gunderson was an exploiter." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's lawyer, Stuart Lesansky, vigorously denied that Gunderson had done 
anything wrong, and argued the lawyer and Miller were fishing buddies who took 
fishing trips together to Alaska and other destinations almost every year. 
</P>
<P>
 As supporting evidence, Lesansky brought to court a 65-pound stuffed Alaskan 
salmon that Miller caught on a fishing trip a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Gunderson, 69, was asked why the relatives had filed 
the court action. He paused, then said: "Greed." 
</P>
<P>
 The non-jury trial, before Superior Court Judge Byron K. McMillan, is the 
latest in a series of actions that have followed a November, 1992, Times report 
detailing how Gunderson had inherited millions of dollars in cash, stock, and 
real estate from clients whose wills and trusts were prepared by him and other 
members of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritances appeared to conflict with a longstanding California Supreme 
Court ruling that anything more than a "modest" gift to an attorney preparing a 
will raised questions of impropriety. The justices in that landmark case 
decided that a $20,000 bequest was excessive, and ordered that inheritance 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after The Times' articles appeared, the State Bar of California 
publicly disclosed that it was conducting an investigation of Gunderson's legal 
practice. In January, Gunderson surrendered his license to practice law in 
California after State Bar prosecutors announced that they were prepared to 
file conflict-of-interest charges that could have led to his possible 
disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritances described in The Times' story are still being investigated by 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper's disclosures also sparked changes in how attorneys in 
California are permitted to write wills and trusts. A law, pushed by 
Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), 
invalidates most bequests to attorneys preparing wills or trusts that bequeath 
them gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial opening Wednesday, Westover, the relatives' attorney, said he 
will try to show that Gunderson engaged "in repetitious conduct which resulted 
in his benefiting from his clients' estates." 
</P>
<P>
 Westover said he will prove that Gunderson took steps to conceal from probate 
court officials the assets he got from his clients' estates, misled clients as 
to the meaning of legal documents he prepared, and prepared wills and trusts 
making himself a beneficiary when clients were too senile or infirm to know 
what they were signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson won Miller's confidence and convinced the elderly man that he would 
never go into a retirement home and that he would "care for him forever," 
Westover said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesansky, however, disputed Westover's claim that there was any suspicious 
pattern of inheritances, saying that Gunderson inherited gifts "a mere handful 
of times," and each inheritance was a "unique circumstance." Lesansky said 
Gunderson ran a "model" practice in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesansky described Miller as a "very dear and longstanding" friend of 
Gunderson -- for 20 years -- and that it was Miller's idea to bequeath roughly 
one-fourth of his estate to Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Gunderson said, "I never thought in my wildest imagination that 
I would be" sued over this inheritance. "Miller was my friend. Merrill always 
said that a friend is God's only perfect gift. . . ." Gunderson was expected to 
testify today.

BALANCE OF SANTA ANA COURTHOUSE FUNDS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A House subcommittee Wednesday authorized the remaining $25 million necessary 
for construction of the Santa Ana Federal Courthouse, which is expected to 
provide much-needed space for 15 judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is the balance of $123 million approved by Congress last year for 
the courthouse, to be named after former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Original plans called for a $168-million building, but construction was 
delayed when the Clinton Administration, in an effort to streamline government, 
cut $45 million from the final authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reductions, the building is nearly the same size as originally 
planned. It will have one less floor and fewer parking spaces and will not be 
as opulent as other existing federal courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns have been expressed by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) that 
the cuts will mean a reduction in the seismic safety of the structure. In a 
statement Wednesday, Dornan praised the authorization, but said he still had 
not been assured that a proposed $4 million in cuts in seismic safety features 
would enable the courthouse to meet all local, state and federal safety 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If such requirements are not met, I will keep working until they are," Dornan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 348,000-square-foot building, begun with the help of Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach), will provide space for 14 courtrooms and 15 judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is expected to boost the local economy and relieve crowding at 
the existing buildings brought on by rising crime.

CSUF NAMES NEW VICE PRESIDENT OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton officials named Mary Kay Tetreault as the university's new 
vice president of academic affairs Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Tetreault has filled the position on an interim basis since July, after Don A. 
Schweitzer, former vice president of academic affairs, died at a conference in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 She will take office on July 1, Cal State Fullerton spokeswoman Paula Selleck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-four candidates were considered by a 10-member search committee, which 
recommended Tetreault, Selleck said. Tetreault, 55, also has served for six 
years as dean of Cal State Fullerton's School of Human Development and 
Community Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Tetreault said she looks forward to setting a new tone for academic affairs 
and improving the quality of education by working with deans, faculty and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to lead academic programs" during budget cuts, Tetreault said. 
"But it's ironic that sometimes the times of real budget constraints push 
people to rethink what they're doing and why they're doing it. We have to think 
about how to allocate resources so we'll continue to serve students." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her work at Cal State Fullerton has included bringing together focus 
groups of university students this spring to comment on their campus 
experiences.  
</P>
<P>
 Tetreault, who oversees the groups with Vice President of Student Affairs 
Robbie Nayman, said they will continue this fall and will let administrators 
know what students consider important at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Tetreault also is an author, and her most recent book, "The Feminist 
Classroom," will be released in August. The book, highlighting six college 
professors who try to improve education for women and underrepresented 
minorities, was co-written by Wheaton College Prof. Frances Maher. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from North Platte, Neb., Tetreault attended Benedictine College and 
the University of Chicago. She earned her doctorate in education at Boston 
University.

$400,000 GRANTED TO AID THREE AILING LAKES; ECOLOGY: MONEY FROM COASTAL 
CONSERVANCY WILL BE USED TO CLEAN THE COUNTY'S ONLY NATURAL FRESHWATER LAKES 
AND RESTORE NATIVE VEGETATION AT SITE IN LAGUNA CANYON. 
</P>

<P>
 A $400,000 grant from the state Coastal Conservancy will help rescue three 
ecologically ailing lakes in Laguna Canyon, the only natural freshwater lakes 
in Orange County, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county division of harbors, beaches and parks will oversee the restoration 
project, which will clean the dirty water, restore natural vegetation and, it 
is hoped, attract migrating waterfowl to the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really going to be wonderful," said Elisabeth Brown, a member of the 
Coastal Greenbelt Authority, a panel formed to manage the park at the edge of 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is about 2,500 acres but is likely to be enlarged to more than 10,000 
acres as neighboring parcels of open land are turned over to the county. In the 
end, it could become the county's largest wilderness park, with the restored 
lakes as its centerpiece, environmentalists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviving the freshwater ponds is part of a $2.5-million project to allow 
greater public access to the wilderness park, which is now open only one 
weekend a month for guided tours. The main goal is to clean the lake waters of 
harmful bacteria and vegetation and establish native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 A related, controversial proposal that has received the backing of many 
environmentalists would involve realigning Laguna Canyon Road, which runs near 
the lakes and is one of two two roadways into the Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short of moving the road, this is the best thing we could get," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The road realignment project will be the focus of a county-hosted public 
meeting at El Morro Elementary School in Laguna Beach at 6:30 p.m. today.  
</P>
<P>
 The lake restoration project made possible by the conservancy's grant will 
proceed regardless of whether the road is ever moved. The grant money only will 
be used to rescue the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the county must still create detailed plans for the project and 
find contractors and consultants to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not going to be immediate," she said. "It will be at least several 
months, up to a year, before they start work." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the county sought the grant from the conservancy, an environmental 
organization and arm of the state government. The project also was supported by 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the park's future design depends on the future of the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 An Environmental Impact Report released by the county last month outlines 
various ways the winding Laguna Canyon Road eventually might be altered between 
El Toro Road and the San Diego Freeway to make it safer, reduce the frequency 
of flooding in the area and allow traffic to flow more freely. 
</P>
<P>
 The "preferred alternative" calls for the state highway, which snakes through 
some of the most scenic landscape in Orange County, to be shifted to the west 
and widened to four lanes with a median separating north and southbound 
traffic. That option would allow the existing road to be uprooted so that two 
lakes that were once been connected could be joined again, and the general area 
could be more thoroughly restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan would widen the roadway to four lanes between El Toro Road and 
the proposed San Joaquin Hills toll road and six lanes between the tollway and 
the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 A final option would be to leave the road as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The lakes have taken a battering, in part because of their location at a low 
point in the canyon that catches runoff from the canyon's 600-acre watershed. 
Surrounding land eroded by cattle grazing leads to additional runoff of mud, 
sediment and fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake algae thrives on the runoff and inhales the oxygen needed by 
underwater plants and fish. As a result, several fish kills have been reported 
in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sediment, along with dead trees and other harmful plants, will be 
replaced with natural vegetation, including sycamores and willows, under the 
revitalization plan.

IN A LEAGUE ALL HIS OWN; JAZZ: EVERYONE KNOWS TROMBONIST BILL WATROUS CAN 
SWING, BUT HE CAN ALSO HIT (WE'RE TALKING BASEBALL). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Watrous has long been known for his ability to swing. But few people know 
that he once could swing a bat as well as he could the trombone. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouted by the New York Yankees as a youngster, Watrous said he almost 
switched careers 10 years ago after taking a few swings with the minor-league 
Cubs of Midland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their team was dreadful that year, and some of us were invited out to see 
them practice while we were out on tour," Watrous, 53, recalled in a recent 
phone conversation from his home in Shadow Hills. He plays tonight in Mission 
Viejo with the Saddleback College Big Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mentioned that I used to play, and so they hooked up the batting machine so 
I could take a couple cuts. After hitting 29 balls out of there and breaking 11 
bats in the process, I was asked by the the manager if I wanted to fill their 
designated-hitter spot. 'You could really help this team out,' he told me. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were serious, but it would have been $540 a month, riding the bus and 
playing in the middle of nowhere. But for a while there I felt like Robert 
Redford in 'The Natural.' I still feel the pangs." 
</P>
<P>
 That Watrous feels regrets about not playing baseball is hard to believe, 
considering that he's among the top trombonists of his generation. Valued for 
his smooth, technical mastery and intimate way with a ballad, Watrous has few 
peers among those who play the slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Berg, pianist and USC professor of music, who has worked closely with 
Watrous on his two most recent albums, says that Watrous' talent is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy so many trombonists have been emulating over the last several 
years," Berg said. "I play with him all the time, and he never ceases to amaze 
me. Playing beautifully -- that's what Bill excels at." 
</P>
<P>
 Watrous' latest recording, "A Time for Love," is a collection of tunes written 
by his old friend Johnny Mandel. Combining big-band charts arranged by Sammy 
Nestico and combo settings arranged by Berg, the disc finds Watrous working in 
his favorite medium: the beautiful melody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been wanting to do a Mandel project for some time. As a composer, I see 
him among the greatest that ever lived, up there with Hoagy Carmichael, Irving 
Berlin, Henry Mancini. His music is monumental." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection of Mandel songs and Watrous' previous recording, "Bone-fied," 
indicate he has resolved a dilemma facing him since he began recording: whether 
to concentrate on his own music or on standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, I refused to do standards," he said. "I was very elitist. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, that's all different. . . . I've been sort of a late bloomer as far as 
content goes, as far as learning what to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Watrous' career began in Connecticut, where, pushed along by his father, 
trombonist Ralph Watrous, he played in Dixieland bands while in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The young player created a splash when he first went to New York and was 
recruited by Kai Winding to play in the bandleader's multiple-trombone 
ensembles. He worked with the big bands of Quincy Jones, Maynard Ferguson and 
Woody Herman, as well as "The Merv Griffin Show" orchestra in the '60s. In 
1971, he spent a brief period with rock band Ten Wheel Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his own big band, the Manhattan Wildlife Refuge, that propelled 
Watrous into the public eye. The Columbia album of the same name, now out of 
print, has become something of a cult classic with its blend of jazz and rock 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Watrous moved to Los Angeles, where he was active in the studio scene 
while playing the local clubs and traveling to New York and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major facets of his career over the past few years has been giving 
clinics and seminars, as he'll do at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Doing clinics) is important to perpetuating the music. There are a lot of 
young people out there today who don't even know what an acoustic bass sounds 
like, let alone a trombone," Watrous said. "I not only try to get kids 
interested in the trombone and what it can do, but show them the value of a 
skill that has to be practiced and worked on. Discipline is the key to a lot of 
things, not just music." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his educational work, Watrous still gets calls for specialized 
studio jobs. His big band, a unit he's held together for some 12 years, plays 
Tuesday at Moonlight Tango in Sherman Oaks. And he continues to compose, though 
he now prefers doing standards in the combo setting. 
</P>

 "I'm working more on orchestral music," said Watrous, who also worked with 
Leopold Stokowski and the American Symphony Orchestra in the '60s. "I've just 
written a piece for trombone and symphonic wind ensemble and am now finishing a 
romantic fantasy for trombone and orchestra that will be a real sobriety test."

 Occasionally, to see if he still has the knack, he accompanies son Jason to 
the batting cages: "I'm beginning to get my stroke back," he said. "Every once 
in a while, when it starts to crank, I wonder if there's still a chance to play 
ball. That's one thing I love -- to hit."

LOVES MOVIES, HATES THE BIZ; CANNES REPORT: DARNELL MARTIN'S FIRST FILM 
ANNOUNCES THE ARRIVAL OF A POWERFUL VOICE. JUST DON'T TELL HER WHAT TO DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started with a box of Tide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was a kid, watching Tide commercials on my grandmother's TV 
because we didn't have one of our own," Darnell Martin says, New York and 
memory mixing in her voice. "It was the perfect kitchen, very clean, everyone 
was dressed up, like nothing I'd ever seen, and I wondered why my house, my 
family wasn't on TV too." 
</P>
<P>
 With "I Like It Like That," her debut film, writer-director Martin has changed 
all that. A hard-eyed comic romance set in the vivid and volatile Puerto Rican 
neighborhoods of the Bronx where she grew up, "Like" has been one of the treats 
of this year's Cannes Film Festival. It also announces the arrival of Martin as 
a lively and passionate new film voice, a voice that definitely does not want 
to be pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I love directing, but I hate the business end; hate's not even a strong 
enough word," she says with an engaging feistiness. "Studios are very 
important, they buy and sell films, but they're not filmmakers. If they were, 
they wouldn't need directors and they sure wouldn't hire them. I don't like it 
when executives tell me, 'I've made a number of successful films.' If they 
haven't made your film, they can't help you. And if I don't want to listen, no 
one can make me listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin doesn't just talk determined; she is determined. She vetoed an early 
script suggestion that changing the characters from Latino to black would make 
her film more commercial, and decided against a deal with New Line because she 
considered its $2-million budget insufficient. "And that was when I was totally 
broke, absolutely no money, not even food in the house, but it didn't seem 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 With her impatience with can't and evasion, Martin, who lives in New York's 
East Village, has had a hard time taking the kind of movie business meetings 
that have become necessary since "Like" was set up at Columbia with a 
$5-million-plus budget and a projected fall release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have to learn how to be more polite," she says as if she means it. 
"But people in L.A. are always telling you, 'I hear what you're saying.' As if 
that's enough! I'd ask friends of mine, 'What is that, some kind of est thing?' 
Just say, '(expletive) no' or tell me I can have what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20ish director, who won't give her age because "I don't want to hear 
'Entertainment Tonight' saying it," channeled all that conviction into her 
script about Lisette (Lauren Velez) and Chino (Jon Seda), married with 
children, whose lives and love take unexpected turns when he is arrested for 
looting during a blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that Tide commercial, "I was so specific about the way I wanted 
Lisette and Chino's apartment to be, it was so important to me to show my 
house. I wanted the moldings chipped and the same amount of grease on the walls 
because the kitchen hadn't been painted in six years. And when I shot the 
scenes of Lisette going crazy in the bathroom because there's no privacy, 
nowhere else for her to go, I felt so emotional I had to watch myself so I 
didn't cry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A lively woman who is as attractive as any of her stars, Martin also wanted 
"Like" to reflect the humor she saw around her. "I really hate characters who 
feel sorry for themselves," she says. "A lot of terrible things happened when I 
was growing up, but my mother's motto was always, 'Don't cry in your beer.' 
Once we were being evicted because we couldn't pay the rent, but my mother had 
a few dollars in her purse and said, 'Eh, what the hell, let's go to the 
movies.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The child of an interracial marriage whose father, one of the celebrated 
Tuskegee airmen, left the family early, Martin is especially passionate about 
her mother, who managed to get her daughter accepted as a scholarship student 
at a New York private school although she was often deep in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom would've loved to give me everything in the world," Martin says 
quietly. "When she saw my movie, it hurt her that I ever had to suffer. When we 
were homeless, with nothing to eat, I was in private schools. That was her joy. 
When people would say, 'Get your priorities straight,' she would say, 'I am.' 
How do you have a better mother than that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martin decided to be a filmmaker after reading William Faulkner's "Light in 
August" in school. "First I wanted to be a writer, but then I said, 'I can 
never do this, the only way I can do it is visually.' I still don't understand 
how people can not read and still be filmmakers. The first place you make films 
is in your head from what you're reading." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After college at Sarah Lawrence, Martin worked at film labs and camera rental 
establishments, where she met Ernest Dickerson, who was then Spike Lee's 
director of photography. She worked for him as an assistant cameraman on "Do 
the Right Thing" and several commercials, and she credits Lee, who at one time 
was involved with "Like" as executive producer, with getting her into New York 
University Film School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rejected three times, and the third was while I was working on 'Do the 
Right Thing,' " Martin says. "When Spike found out, he couldn't believe it. And 
the next day I got a call from the school saying, 'Oh, we made a mistake, 
you're in.' " She entered NYU as a cinematographer, "but I talked too much, I 
was too opinionated. People said, 'You really want to direct.' So I switched." 
</P>
<P>
 The money she has made as a director has changed Martin's life only in small 
ways. "It was very important for me to do this film because I got to pay my 
student loans and I had a tooth pulled that had been destroying my mouth for 
years," she says impishly, pulling down her lip to point out the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 With that out of the way, and with a recent legal victory over her Manhattan 
landlord that she feels will ensure her "free rent for the rest of my life," 
Martin feels especially impervious to the movie business's crasser lures. "I'm 
very happy now," she says, "and I'll take my name off my films before I let 
people change them." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet on it.

ALL THE BACKLOT'S A STAGE; 'SHADOWS' LEAVES THEATER AND TAKES OVER CBS STUDIO 
CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loping across the soundstage with his long, curly black hair bouncing with 
each step, Michael Arabian looks distinctly out of place. He might be one of 
Eddie Vedder's sidemen, not the fellow in charge of an ambitious Los Angeles 
theater experiment. Certainly not the man directing such sitcom hall-of-famers 
as Bernie Kopell ("The Love Boat"), Robert Mandan ("Soap") and William 
Christopher ("MASH"). 
</P>
<P>
 But even Arabian's current project, directing Ronald Lachman's new drama, "A 
History of Shadows," doesn't seem to belong where it is. Which, he says, is 
precisely the point. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show opens Friday it will have been a year since Arabian took over 
the television turf of the CBS Studio Center in Studio City -- home to 
"Seinfeld," "Roseanne," "Hearts Afire" and "Evening Shade," among other shows 
-- to present an environmental, site-specific staging of "Romeo and Juliet." 
Although he was not the only director in '93 to try the 
theater-meets-soundstage formula -- writer-director Nicholas Meyer set his play 
about Leo Tolstoy, "Loco Motives," on a Culver Studio soundstage -- Arabian's 
version of the star-crossed lovers' tragedy played all over the studio's back 
streets and alleyways as well as the "Seinfeld" stage. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with what he terms the traditional theater's unfriendliness to work 
that blends spoken word with complex visual design, and dissatisfied with the 
built-in technical limitations of L.A.'s smaller theaters, Arabian is no longer 
a free-lance director, but the founder (with co-producer Suzanne Battaglia) of 
InSITE. The theater company (now including Lachman and co-producer Richard 
Hart) is setting long-term plans for more theater-on-the-backlots, where 
site-specific and mixed-media are the watchwords. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do is paint with light and the set and the actors," Arabian says in a 
quietly pointed tone, watching his cast prepare for a scene in the soundstage 
home of "Hearts Afire." 
</P>
<P>
 "The story is always paramount, and tells me how to paint. But because I do at 
most one show a year, each one means a great deal to me, and I really want to 
get into an audience's subconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Arabian's strategy for a bigger, visual theater may provide a vivid marriage 
of theater and the film and television industry, "but I'm not sure that it's a 
trend, and it wasn't as if I had a bidding war among studios for 'Romeo and 
Juliet,' " he says. In fact, most of the studios Arabian approached showed only 
mild interest; the CBS Studio Center management, though, liked Arabian's ideas, 
and have approved his project for summer 1995, with a 1996 show in the talking 
phase. (Arabian will say nothing about the '95 project, except that it will be 
site-specific, and not with the multimedia elements of "History of Shadows.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A CBS Studio Center spokesperson who would not be identified explains that 
"during the summer, there is less activity on the lot because of the hiatus in 
network production schedules. It's in the studio's interest to have as much 
activity on the lot as possible, and Michael was persistent enough to convince 
us that his ideas would fit in with our needs. The studio isn't a partner in 
his productions. On the other hand, we're happy to assist film students, who've 
used our facilities, and artists like Michael, because they're the future of 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachman's play, adapted from Robert C. Reinhart's novel, appears to be 
strikingly conventional compared to past work Arabian has chosen to stage, 
ranging from Franz Xaver Kroetz's wordless tragedy "Request Concert" to Charles 
Borkhuis' apocalyptic "Phantom Limbs." Lachman's memory drama observes a young 
gay man (played by Larry Cox) doing a research project on the lives of four gay 
men (Christopher, Kopell, Mandan and Jack Beckerman) during the Depression and 
World War II eras, when carrying on double lives in and out of the bedroom was 
simply assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play's really not conventional at all," Arabian insists. "I usually pick 
out a play I want to do, but Ron gave me this with me in mind. I was attracted 
to it because it doesn't have a traditional play structure. It's full of 
fragmented monologues, like the play 'Kennedy's Children,' but on a first 
reading, I couldn't figure out how it could be done. That's it, though: Because 
I couldn't figure it out, I was intrigued to see if it was possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Arabian's solution includes devising a rear-projection slide system that will 
cause sudden scene changes and instantly place characters in the past or 
present, as the constantly time-shifting drama requires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to do this here than in a standard theater, which already has 
most of the equipment in place," says the director, in his late 30s and a 
graduate of London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. "But you can produce 
bigger, more dramatic images here. I like the supposed impossibility of it. My 
friends think I'm a little crazy that way. A 90-minute silent play about a 
woman killing herself ("Request Concert") shouldn't work, any more than adults 
playing young kids ("Found a Peanut") should work. I'm tempted by fate, I 
suppose." 
</P>
<P>
 * "A History of Shadows" runs Friday through June 12 at CBS Studio Center, 
4024 Radford Ave., Studio City, (213) 466-1767. Shows are Tues.-Sun. at 8 p.m. 
$20-$25.

HOLLYWOOD HABITS; SONY'S LATEST INVENTION: THE $15.25 BURGER; THE OLD MGM 
COMMISSARY IN CULVER CITY IS NOW THE RITA HAYWORTH DINING ROOM, WITH TIFFANY 
CHINA NO LESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's one of the priciest, most upscale new lunch spots on the Hollywood block. 
Its classic Art Deco style dining room is appointed with customized Tiffany 
china and flatware, expensive fresh flowers and a baby grand in the corner. 
Framed black-and-white photographs of stars from Hollywood's Golden Era adorn 
the walls. Waiters in black-and-gold striped vests and crisp white shirts serve 
you with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no ordinary West Hollywood trendy cafe -- not Emporio Armani 
Express, Jackson's or even the new Morton's. Rather, it's the commissary for 
Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures on the Sony Pictures studio lot in the 
heart of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rita Hayworth Dining Room, named for one of Columbia's biggest stars in 
the '40s and '50s, is Sony's renovated '90s version of the former historic MGM 
commissary, which first opened its doors in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And this commissary, unlike any other of the Hollywood studios' on-site 
eateries, has been the buzz of the Sony lot since opening March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Crudites are not your usual garden variety; they include sumptuous grapes, 
walnuts and focaccia breadsticks; appetizers, $7.25 apiece, include asparagus 
soup with a black olive crouton and pepper-crusted, seared rare ahi tuna with 
buckwheat vegetable vermicelli and ginger peanut sauce. A hamburger will set 
you back $15.25 -- the set price for the half-dozen main courses, among which 
you'll also find such dishes as grilled salmon with fennel polenta, green beans 
and blood oranges, or baby monkfish tails with mashed potatoes, escarole and 
savory essence.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sides and Tid Bits, at the more palatable price of $3 each, include crispy 
buttermilk-fried onion rings or a green lentil salad. Desserts, $5 apiece, 
range from tangelo blood orange granita with strawberries, apricots and almond 
biscotti to Valhrona chocolate creme brulee with cat's tongues cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a prix-fixe menu, for $22.50 a person (including a first course, 
main course and coffee or tea, but no dessert), as well as the option of 
ordering any item a la carte. 
</P>
<P>
 For traditionalists, there is always matzo ball soup ($7.25), honoring MGM 
founder Louis B. Mayer and his Columbia Pictures counterpart Harry Cohn, who 
served it in their respective commissaries. 
</P>
<P>
 And by the way, regardless of whether or not you like the service, a service 
charge of at least 16% (last week it was 20%) is automatically added to the 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the studio's own insiders as well as rivals are scoffing at this 
latest upscale addition to Sony's multimillion-dollar face-lift of the entire 
lot, which has been shepherded by Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman and CEO 
Peter Guber since Columbia and TriStar relocated there from Burbank in June, 
1990. Others can't praise the new dining room enough, saying it's high time 
there was a classy place to dine with business associates in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior executive on the lot, who claims to have eaten in the dining room 
just once "only because I had to," gripes: "It epitomizes Sony. It's 
pretentious, overdone and expensive." Several said they found the customized 
Tiffany place settings, which feature an abstract graphic of the Sony studio 
gates, a bit much for everyday commissary dishware. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, one Columbia-based producer enthuses, "The dining room is 
great. It serves everyone's needs. And you don't have to drive a half-hour each 
way to get to a fancy restaurant. Now we can get agents and filmmakers to come 
here, whereas before it was hard to lure them to the lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wiatt, president of the International Creative Management agency, said 
that he was so impressed with the room he suggested to his recent lunch host, 
Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Co. Chairman Mark Canton, "You ought to open 
this as a dinner place." 
</P>
<P>
 William Morris Agency President Jerry Katzman thought "it was kind of fun" and 
that compared to other "indistinguishable" studio commissaries, "this one 
really stands out." But Katzman admitted he'd still prefer going to an 
off-the-lot restaurant, since at a studio commissary "you spend most of your 
time standing and saying hello to everyone -- it could be a scene in 'The 
Player.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Sony officials say they're proud of their on-campus Morton's, 
which seats between 125 and 130 diners. The yearlong restoration, they say, was 
undertaken with great reverence for the past and is an homage to the old MGM 
commissary's regular patrons like Hayworth, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Sony's top brass, including Canton and Guber, frequent the dining room 
three or four times a week, according to a studio official. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective was to make this a full-service facility for filmmakers, talent 
and (some 2,000) employees," says a Sony spokesman, who's quick to point out 
the commissary is just one of four food services offered on the lot, which also 
include the new Gower Cafe (serving inexpensive pizzas); the Grill, a year-old, 
'50s-style diner (soups, salads, sandwiches), and the Sony Pictures Pantry 
(fresh prepackaged salads and sandwiches), which is across the street in the 
Sony Pictures Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 Tighter dollars in the last year or two have caused studio insiders to "do 
lunch" more frequently at their own studio commissaries, which generally 
operate at a deficit. (Executives simply charge their lunches back to the 
studio.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though historically they have not been known for good food, commissaries have 
typically been much cheaper than trendy restaurants, while still providing 
schmoozing opportunities in a somewhat more private setting. In the last couple 
of years, most Hollywood studios have updated their commissaries, adding 
healthier California cuisine-type dishes to their menus and importing hot young 
chefs. The chef at the Rita Hayworth is Jules Paulk, most recently the 
sous-chef at San Francisco's One Market Plaza.

L.A. MUSIC CENTER OPERA HAS A CHANGE IN PROGRAM; MUSIC: SOPRANO ELISE ROSS AND 
HER HUSBAND, CONDUCTOR SIMON RATTLE, WITHDRAW FROM 'PELLEAS ET MELISANDE.' 
ESA-PEKKA SALONEN WILL MAKE LOCAL OPERATIC DEBUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soprano Elise Ross and her husband, conductor Simon Rattle, have withdrawn 
from L.A. Music Center Opera's new production of Debussy's "Pelleas et 
Melisande," due in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing Rattle on the podium will be Esa-Pekka Salonen, music director of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, in his local operatic debut. The role of 
Melisande will be performed by mezzo-soprano Monica Groop, also a Finnish 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
 The opera company's announcement said that Ross and Rattle are giving up "all 
future joint operatic projects for family reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in London, their manager, Martin Campbell-White, clarified: "Elise and 
Simon are acutely embarrassed at the late timing of this withdrawal, but they 
have found that they cannot both be gone from home at the same time for reasons 
of family continuity and equilibrium." The Rattles have two sons, ages 11 and 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Campbell-White, the couple has also canceled their participation 
in "Pelleas" in Amsterdam in 1996 and Berg's "Wozzeck" at Covent Garden, next 
year. The manager said Ross and Rattle have "made a pact (with each other) not 
to be away from the children for more than two weeks at a time, since that 
would be unfair to the parent left at home." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Los Angeles visit, Campbell-White said, would have involved "six or 
seven weeks, total," since Rattle will be rehearsing and conducting the L.A. 
Philharmonic here, Jan. 2-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell-White said the couple's individual engagements will not be affected. 
Both Ross and Rattle have separate operatic assignments this summer; she will 
perform in Florence and he will conduct at the Glyndebourne Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the L.A. Philharmonic has announced that in order to 
accommodate Salonen's rescheduling of his previous February commitment with the 
Swedish Radio Orchestra at the time of the "Pelleas" performances, he will be 
replaced at Philharmonic concerts in the first week of April by British 
conductor Andrew Davis, when Salonen goes belatedly to Sweden.

PETER HIMMELMAN MIXES LAUGHS, LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Get Peter Himmelman in front of an audience and he can be the consummate 
cutup, a wit who excels at off-the-cuff humor, composes comic songs on the 
spot, and typically goes the extra mile to get close to his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe just the extra half-mile. That, Himmelman said, is how far he had 
to walk on a recent night in Kansas City, Mo., before he found a spot where he 
felt comfortable performing. Some 250 fans followed him out of a club and down 
several city blocks to an empty parking lot after some obnoxious regulars and a 
bad PA system convinced Himmelman that only an impromptu exodus could save the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful when you do that," Himmelman, who plays with his band tonight 
at the Roxy and Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, said last 
week in a phone conversation from backstage before an Ames, Iowa concert. "(It 
creates) a certain sense of unity. I only do it when I get angry. I want to 
sing these songs they want to hear, and when people are talking, I don't just 
want to throw it away. I take what I do seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 That much is clear from the six albums Himmelman, 34, has issued since 1986. 
As funny as he can be in his comical moments on stage, the songs this 
Minnesota-raised, Santa Monica-based rocker records are marked by an 
unrelenting fervency and a serious, spiritually informed cast that parallels 
early U2. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman's new album, "Skin," is different only in that it is his first 
"concept" album. In it, he traces the progress of a reincarnated soul that 
failed miserably in its previous existence but struggles to live a moral, 
loving and meaningful life in its next go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman's songs explore dualities: good versus evil, the joy of 
comprehending the divine versus the anguish of feeling fallen, isolated and 
without purpose. He can't explain that other duality that informs his career: 
the songwriter consumed with trying to fathom ultimate questions, versus the 
on-stage jester. But he sees the humor in his performances as a way to set the 
audience at ease, so it will be more receptive to his fervent stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're going to do anything sort of confessional, you want to make sure 
you're friends first," he said. "You don't want to say something and be 
rebuffed." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Himmelman, who has a small but loyal cult following, puts limits on what he 
will do in search of a wider fan base. An observant Jew, he won't play on 
Friday nights, the start of the Sabbath. And he safeguards his family's privacy 
-- not surprising, given that he is the son-in-law of the always-private Bob 
Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 "People magazine wanted to do a big spread on the last album," Himmelman 
recalled. He says the magazine lost interest when he refused to pose for one of 
People's trademark celebrities-at-home photo spreads with his wife and children 
(the couple now has three kids, ages 9 months to 4 1/2 years). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a necessary safeguard against obscuring the line between your 
real self and a cartoon persona," Himmelman said of his insistence on keeping 
his family life private. "You need to have these walls of separation. 
Everyone's trying to tear down walls, but walls are also good. They help to 
preserve what you think is sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very mercantile about (my career)," he said. "But I feel successful 
in my own way. In every city we draw people, they have all my records, they 
call out songs." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as his recent Kansas City gig shows, they prize him enough to follow him 
that extra half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Himmelman is scheduled for Southern California shows including a free show 
today at Music Center Plaza, 135 N. Grand Ave., (213) 972-7272, noon ; tonight 
at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., (213) 276-2222, 8 p.m., $17.50 , and Saturday 
at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, (714) 
496-8927, 8:30 p.m., $10. Kevin Montgomery is the opening act at the club

FAMILY; SERIOUS THEMES BY 'YOUNG PLAYWRIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Child's play? No way. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist mourning the loss of a patient, a teen-ager struggling with his 
emerging homosexuality, sexually abused sisters: These serious themes can be 
found in "Young Playwrights L.A.," theatrical works by playwrights ages 14 to 
18, which opened Wednesday at the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented by theater professionals, the event features "December Pairs," a 
fully staged play by 17-year-old Jim Knable of Sacramento about an introverted 
young man who practices for marriage with an imaginary wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Knable's play, previously produced at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, was 
a winner of this year's California Young Playwrights Contest, part of the 
national, nonprofit Playwrights Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the bill are rehearsed readings of nine plays, including "The First 
Note," a drama by 14-year-old Sepulveda Junior High student Lissa Levy, 
exploring a confused teen-ager's efforts to suppress his homosexuality after an 
encounter with an older gay man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know how it all got started in my head," Levy said. "It just 
seemed like a logical progression for a teen-age boy to go through this type of 
confusion because he's worried about being normal sexually. The outside 
pressures, his own fears, his own envisionment of the world in a way, cripple 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing the play has "opened my eyes to a whole new world," she said. "I watch 
people much more carefully now -- their body language, what they say, their 
choice in words . . . . I was a people-watcher before this, now I feel I'm a 
people analyzer." Levy is currently at work on a play she might enter in the 
Project's statewide contest next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's work and the other readings on the program came out of the Project's 
Dream Lab, headed by writer-director-actor Doug Kaback, the Music Center 
Education Division artist-in-residence who coordinates the Project's Los 
Angeles events. Dream Lab participants were chosen from area public schools and 
developed their plays during Saturday sessions at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was first to create a safe place, a laboratory feeling where we 
could experiment and fail," Kaback said. "A place where we could take writing, 
just a piece, a scene or a monologue and put it on its feet . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't surprise him that the budding playwrights chose to explore some 
pretty serious issues. "Some plays we're producing are very lighthearted and 
fantastical, but the majority were based on serious issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with young people is "enormously affirming," he added. "A good part of 
what I do as an artist is to . . . let them find their voice and express the 
hilarity and the difficulty of their existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Past participants in the Young Playwrights Project include Fulbright winner 
Karen Hartman and stage, TV and film writer Josefina Lopez, whose comedy "Real 
Women Have Curves" just finished a run at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Young Playwrights L.A.," Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., 
West L.A., today-Friday, 10:30 a.m. and 8 p.m.; Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and

D-DAY ANNIVERSARY ALL OVER THE TUBE; TELEVISION: SHOWS ABOUT THE ALLIED LANDING 
IN FRANCE WILL RUN ON THE NETWORKS AS WELL AS CABLE -- AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY 
TO PICK AMONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Programs about D-day will be exploding like a full-scale aerial attack in the 
coming weeks as television pays tribute to the 50th anniversary of the invasion 
that decisively changed the momentum of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be extensive coverage of events on the actual anniversary, June 6, 
but that will be the culmination of media focus. Here's a guide to some of 
what's on tap before then: 
</P>
<P>
 * PBS' "The American Experience" series devotes an hour on May 25 to "D-Day," 
a documentary by Charles Guggenheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Dan Rather will host a two-hour "CBS 
Reports" on May 26, visiting the Normandy beaches where the Allied invasion of 
Europe began and talking with many of the Americans who fought there and with 
the sons of the commanding generals that day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles Durning, a participant in the assault on Omaha Beach, narrates 
"Normandy: The Great Crusade," a two-hour documentary on the Discovery Channel 
May 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * George Stevens Jr. has put together footage shot by his father's military 
film unit for "George Stevens: D-Day to Berlin," airing May 31 on the Disney 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peter Jennings will anchor a 90-minute edition of "Turning Point" on ABC 
June 1 that will interview veterans on both sides of the battle to reconstruct 
the planning and strategies that went into the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles Osgood will anchor "CBS News Sunday Morning" from Normandy on June 
5, devoting the entire program to D-day. David Brinkley will do the same that 
day for his ABC show, "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Eye on History: D-Day," produced by Lou Reda Productions with the 
cooperation of the U.S. Naval Institute, had its first A&E outing May 18 and 
repeats June 5 at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * CNN has scheduled an hourlong documentary, "D-Day: The Great Crusade," for 
June 5, with Judy Woodruff anchoring and Lou Waters reporting. It features 
interviews with men on the front lines and the women working at home in the 
United States.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: NORWALK; GARCIA WILL REPLACE POWERS AS CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Powers, the beleaguered Norwalk city manager who was often vilified in 
last month's City Council election, agreed to resign Monday evening after six 
hours of closed-session negotiations with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The council then promoted Ernie Garcia, a deputy city manager who has been 
with the city since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers, who joined the city in July, 1988, will receive a severance payment of 
$165,000 and will remain director of the city's redevelopment agency, a 
part-time position, for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent council race, Powers' performance was a key campaign issue, and 
all three winning candidates had vowed to fire him or reduce his authority. 
Powers, 53, was portrayed as an out-of-touch administrator whose financial 
management had resulted in a controversial 8% utility-users tax two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters told me they wanted a change at the city manager's level," one of 
the winners, Councilman Gordon F. Stefenhagen, said Tuesday. "That was pretty 
much a mandate." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited by Norwalk from the redevelopment agency in Paramount, Powers 
quickly gained a pro-development reputation. But his aggressive development 
agenda was often criticized as too radical a departure from the quiet 
neighborhood atmosphere still considered the ideal by many longtime city 
residents. Critics were quick to point out that Powers lives in Hacienda 
Heights and often depicted him as an outsider.  
</P>
<P>
 His successor, Garcia, has lived in or near Norwalk since he was 7 and has 
pledged to pursue a more restrained development policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My emphasis will be pro-development, but in the sense of maintaining the 
integrity of the community," said Garcia, 47. "There's a direction from this 
present council to go back to some of the basics -- our streets and our trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's annual salary will be $110,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The severance package awarded to Powers -- the equivalent of a full year's 
salary of $113,000 and benefits -- was twice the amount stipulated in his city 
contract, which was scheduled to expire in July, 1995. In return, city 
officials said, Powers waived his right to sue the city. He was given a 
six-month contract to manage the redevelopment agency so he could continue to 
oversee several development projects, including a 24-screen theater complex to 
be built near City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers, in a prepared statement issued Wednesday, said the redevelopment 
projects "will improve the city's fiscal stability in the coming years." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jesse M. Luera, a former city employee who was fired by Powers last 
year after other employees accused Luera of sexual harassment, voted against 
the severance package, saying he thought it was too costly. He also opposed the 
appointment of Garcia and the decision to retain Powers to serve as part-time 
director of the city's redevelopment agency. GREG MILLER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: DOWNEY; ROAD TO INELIGIBILITY PAVED WITH ASPHALT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Living on the wrong side of a Downey street cost a former city councilman a 
place on the ballot in the city's June 7 City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyell Swearingen, a 76-year-old retired businessman, saw his aspirations for a 
return to the council's District 2 seat dashed when he attempted to file 
nomination papers at the city clerk's office.To his surprise, Swearingen 
learned he is ineligible because he lives across the street from the district's 
boundary line. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen represented District 2, which encompasses the southwest portion of 
the city, from 1978 to 1982 and was mayor during his last year in office. He 
moved out of the city four years ago, then returned last year. The boundary 
lines were redrawn in 1992. He now lives in District 3, which is north of his 
old district. He said he might run for that seat when it comes up for election 
in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the five council seats are on the June 7 ballot. In District 2, 
incumbent Barbara J. Riley, 62, a substitute schoolteacher, faces Patrick 
McDermott, 68, a retired elementary school custodian. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 4, incumbent Robert S. Brazelton, 64, an attorney and current 
mayor, seeks a second term against challenger Robert Feliciano, 53, a law 
enforcement consultant. PHILLIP GARCIA

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; GUNS OUTNUMBER FOOD COUPONS ON SWAP DAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 people who showed up last weekend to turn their firearms into bread 
were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had only 50 food certificates, each worth $100, to exchange for guns 
Saturday morning in its first groceries-for-guns exchange, and the supply was 
quickly exhausted.The guns were taken by police and will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Mayor Ernie Kell, who organized the exchange, gave $100 from his 
own wallet to a woman who wanted to turn in her gun at the Gospel Memorial 
Church of God in Christ.  
</P>
<P>
 The exchange attracted just one sponsor, Ralphs Grocery Co., which donated 50 
food certificates.  
</P>
<P>
 Kell has promised to start lobbying for new donors and another food-for-guns 
swap. Originally, he had hoped every major grocery store in the city would 
participate, giving a total of $40,000 in grocery certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some supermarket officials said they were concerned about appearing to favor 
one program over another, said Tom Poe, spokesman for the mayor. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SOUTH GATE; CITY MANAGER'S ROLE IN ELECTION CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager Todd W. Argow implemented unusual, and potentially unethical, 
procedures that may have favored incumbents during the recent City Council 
election, said Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 2 memo, Argow instructed all department heads to "remember that our 
loyalties lie with the existing" City Council members and ordered them to 
inform him when council candidates requested information or documents on city 
policies and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 If the incumbents benefited from Argow's efforts, the results of the election 
did not seem to reflect it -- two of the three on the ballot were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Argow's order potentially muddied what should be an atmosphere of 
neutrality at City Hall during an election, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does raise the specter of impropriety to the extent that it implies that 
the city employees should be other than neutral," Miller said. "In the election 
business, the appearance (of impropriety) is very important in undermining the 
integrity of the process to the public. I'm not aware of anything criminal, but 
it does raise one's eyebrows." 
</P>
<P>
 Argow said he regrets using the word loyalties, but he defended his memo as a 
reminder to his staff to continue serving the council with gusto despite the 
additional pressures of an election. MARY HELEN BERG

NEW GANG WARS FUEL CANDIDATES' POSITIONS; POLITICS: TWO SHOOTING INCIDENTS THIS 
WEEK PROMPT CANDIDATES TO CALL FOR BEEFING UP OF THE POLICE FORCE AND OTHER 
ANTI-GANG MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Violent crime, the issue that is driving campaigns of political hopefuls 
across Long Beach, took on added significance this week in the wake of two 
gang-related shootings that claimed three lives and left four others injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Several mayoral and City Council candidates in the June 7 election said the 
incidents underscore spiraling gang crime in a city that needs to take a 
tougher stand to protect innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a crisis stage," mayoral candidate Beverly O'Neill said Tuesday 
night at a candidates' forum. "These are big-city problems that we need to 
start paying attention to." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and her opponent, City Councilman Ray Grabinski, want to beef up the 
police force in an effort to clear gangs from neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've allowed the streets to get so mean that we're afraid to get out on 
them," Grabinski said at the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Dianne McNinch echoed Grabinski's sentiments. "Crime is the 
No. 1 problem, and the city hasn't done enough about it," McNinch said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, three Latinos were gunned down as they left a party in central 
Long Beach, where they had gone to advertise a dance club. The victims, all 
from Los Angeles, apparently were not gang members but were caught in the 
middle of a war between Latino and Cambodian gangs in Long Beach that has 
lasted five years, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate incident nearby Tuesday, a Latino youth was shot in the foot 
when two Asian men drove up and opened fire. The youth was treated and released 
from a local hospital. Police believe the attacks may have been in retaliation 
for the shooting deaths of Cambodian gang members earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings appear to be part of a cycle of gang violence. There were a 
record 137 homicides in the city last year -- of which more than half were 
gang-related, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, candidates are proposing a host of get-tough measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski wants the city to combine forces with federal prosecutors and use 
racketeering laws against gang members who sell drugs. He also proposes a 
television show on the local cable station that would air the names and 
pictures of gang members who are wanted by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to start making it uncomfortable for bad guys to come to Long Beach," 
Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill wants the police force to be more visible in high-crime areas. She 
proposes adding 150 police officers over three years and transferring others 
from desk jobs into the field. The department has 792 sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and Grabinski have called for an increase in the Police Department's 
26-member gang unit. O'Neill recently unveiled a six-page plan she termed a 
"counterattack." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more gang busts," she said. "We need to make sure the pressure is 
always there by police." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a beefed-up police force and a tough stand against violent gang members 
are only parts of the solution, the candidates said. Both called for more 
community involvement and after-school programs to give young people 
alternatives to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski has promoted the idea of a community congress that would bring 
together all neighborhood associations to air their problems, meet with city 
officials and share tips on combatting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, formerly a Long Beach City College president, has called for 
stepped-up community-based policing with officers assigned to specific 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in three City Council races have said in recent forums that 
additional police have to be combined with other plans to help communities 
fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donelon, a candidate in the 7th District, said any increase in the police 
force should be coupled with programs that encourage youngsters to reject 
gangs. He said youth programs, local churches and county probation officers 
should coordinate their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon's opponent, Tonia Reyes Uranga, said she plans to make a police 
substation on the city's west side a top priority. She also criticized the 
Police Department for not deploying enough officers to patrol gang-ridden areas 
of central Long Beach. The district covers central and western Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Oropeza, who is seeking a seat in the 1st Council District, also 
emphasized the need for early intervention in the areas of academics, jobs and 
recreation to combat gangs. The district includes downtown and parts of western 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of desperation in the community that incites criminal 
activity," Oropeza said, referring to the recent killing and other incidents. 
"We have to try and create an economic environment where people aren't 
desperate and preying on each other." 
</P>
<P>
 All the council candidates, however, said the city must put more police on the 
streets as a front-line deterrent to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza said she would add 100 officers, cutting spending in other areas to 
provide the funding. Her opponent, McNinch, proposes boosting the force by more 
than 250 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 9th District, which covers North Long Beach, first-time candidate Jerry 
Shultz, a sheriff's deputy, would add 100 to 150 officers to the force, which 
he would also like to see supplemented with reserve officers and volunteers who 
would patrol the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz's opponent, City Councilman Warren Harwood, said he would propose 
spending cuts in areas such as funding for the arts to bring the police force 
to 1,000 officers by 1996, an increase of 208 officers.

 The California Coastal Commission has settled a dispute with Long Beach that 
will allow the city to close its beaches at 10 p.m. in most areas in an effort 
to cut down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the accord, city officials said they will drop a lawsuit that 
sought court approval for the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said Long Beach officials 
demonstrated enough evidence -- about 250 arrests in beach areas during 1993 -- 
to determine that an earlier curfew was in the best interest of public safety. 
Beaches in the city previously were closed from midnight to 5 a.m. Most of the 
arrests involved disorderly conduct and curfew violations, according to 
commission staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote May 12 by the commission, which has authority over coastal 
lands in the state, marks the second time in its 23-year history that members 
have allowed a city to set a beach curfew. The city's midnight curfew was 
imposed before the commission was created. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the compromise, however, the public will have access to 
"wet sand" strips of beach near the water until midnight. Also, one beach area 
near the Belmont Pier will remain open until midnight. Tourists and residents 
often stroll in the area -- between the pier and the Belmont Pool -- after 
meals at nearby restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach also must hold public hearings every three years to determine if 
the curfew is still warranted, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will come before the City Council next week for formal approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced when the council voted for an earlier curfew last June, 
shortly after William Shadden, 26, a student at Cal State Long Beach, was shot 
and killed in Belmont Shore near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Douglas S. Drummond pushed for tighter restrictions on beaches and 
parking lots, saying that undesirables were loitering there and contributing to 
the city's crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coastal Commission members learned of the council's action, they told 
city officials that the new curfew -- and the decades-old midnight to 5 a.m. 
curfew -- violated the state Coastal Act, which guarantees public access to the 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staff members said the city could keep the midnight-to-5 a.m. 
curfew because it was enacted before the passage of Coastal Act in the 1950s. 
But the new curfew was too broad, they said, and the city did not demonstrate 
specific evidence of a crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials filed a lawsuit in Long Beach Superior Court, challenging the 
Coastal Commission's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Although signs listing the new 10 p.m. curfew were posted along the beaches, 
police did not enforce the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said the new curfew does not violate the Coastal Act because the 
ordinance does not prohibit access to public waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 "This protects both public access and public safety," he said. "It was 
precisely the type of balancing we feel is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the agreement, most beaches will be closed from 10 p.m. to 
5 a.m., but people will not be cited for walking across the sand to get to the 
water line. People will be permitted to stand on the "wet" sand -- defined as 
the sand wet as a result of waves or tide -- to jog, walk, or fish. Swimming 
will also be allowed until midnight, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said he supports keeping the wet sand accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone's out jogging on the wet sand it doesn't bother me at all," he 
said. "We have grunion runs and people who fish, and those activities should 
not be discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said the congregation of troublemakers on dry sand was his main 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the loitering and partying and all the problems that come with it," he 
said. "But we also wanted to make sure there were sections open for people who 
want to enjoy dry sand (until midnight), and regulate it so we can provide 
security."  
</P>
<P>
 Access to the city's 11 parking lots near beaches varies under the plan, and 
signs will be posted to alert residents, said Ralph Cryder, the city's parks 
and recreation director. Some lots will be closed as early as one hour after 
sunset, while others will remain open until midnight. One boat launch ramp in 
Marine Stadium and a ramp near Golden Shore Drive will remain open 24 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said he hopes the agreement with Long Beach could set a precedent for 
other Southern California cities in similar situations. Seal Beach, Huntington 
Beach, Newport Beach and other Orange County cities are negotiating curfew 
plans with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the commission allowed Coronado to set curfews on some of its 
beaches, Douglas said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HUNTINGTON PARK: STRIKERS FILE 2 LAWSUITS AGAINST GARMENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Striking workers at UniHosiery Inc. have filed two class-action lawsuits 
against the company and its managers, alleging that male Korean supervisors 
practiced pervasive sex and race discrimination and sexual harassment, and 
assaulted male Latino employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court are the latest 
charges against the company, where workers walked out two months ago to protest 
what they called unfair labor practices. The sock manufacturer at 6724 S. 
Alameda St. also has a warehouse at 321 32nd St. and distributes wares to 
swap-meet vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the first complaint, UniHosiery Manager James Paik and other male 
company officials subjected at least 14 male workers to sexual harassment over 
several years. Paik said he did not know about the lawsuits and could not 
comment on the allegations. The complaint alleges that managers frequently 
grabbed, poked and pinched workers in the buttocks and crotch with their hands 
or with tools. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a manager driving a forklift allegedly cornered a worker against 
a wall. Once trapped, a second supervisor began to remove the employee's pants, 
the document states, and the managers left after the worker screamed for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In several instances, managers allegedly followed the workers into the 
bathroom to ogle or assault them. When workers complained about the harassment, 
supervisors said they were "just playing," according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs are seeking $25,000 each in addition to punitive damages and 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also discriminated against Latino employees on the basis of race, 
denying them promotions and pay raises allotted to Korean employees, according 
to the second complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 All positions of responsibility -- managers, office staff and mechanics -- are 
held by Koreans, while all production workers are Latino, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino employees who filled in as mechanics were reportedly told that they 
could not be permanently promoted to the position because "the company rules 
were that no race or nationality other than Koreans can hold any of the higher 
positions at the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Another worker said managers told him Latinos were "too stupid" to be 
mechanics, the complaint stated. The workers are seeking back pay, punitive and 
compensatory damages, and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 workers have been on strike since March 14. Organizers with the 
International Ladies Garment Workers Union said workers asked the union for 
help in February after the company passed new rules that they felt were unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, the company suspended about 50 workers, telling them their 
Social Security numbers were questionable. The garment-workers union advised 
the workers to strike. Nearly all production employees walked out in support.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH: BOARD UNANIMOUSLY OKS CHARTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An independent public charter school, the first in Long Beach, won the 
unanimous approval of the Long Beach school board this week after organizers 
met with critics of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constellation Community Middle School could open as early as this fall if 
organizers can reach an agreement for using space at St. Luke's Episcopal 
Church in downtown Long Beach.Negotiations with the church are under way. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials also must approve the charter proposal, but the 
education department typically offers no challenge once the local school board 
gives its OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers plan to run a small school with four teachers, two bilingual aides 
and about 120 students, all of whom would enter as sixth-graders and remain in 
the school through eighth grade. The charter school was proposed by two 
teachers from Franklin Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Ed Eveland and Jenny Oropeza had expressed concerns about the 
charter school before meeting with district administrators and backers of the 
plan. Charter school supporters also met with leaders of the union for 
non-teaching employees, who said they were worried that the charter school 
setup could cost jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 The school would operate with virtual independence under its own board of 
directors under charter-school laws passed by the state Legislature to 
encourage innovative education programs to improve student achievement. It will 
be funded through Long Beach Unified based on the number of students who 
enroll.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH: FLORIDA AIRLINE LANDS ROUTE TO BE ABANDONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Florida-based airline will begin twice-daily flights between Long Beach and 
Dallas, taking over a route that American Airlines has decided to abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Jet International will begin operations on June 17, company President 
Scott Bacon said last week.The one-way fare will be $99, or $129 to continue on 
to Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-month-old airline was given the go-ahead by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation and the city, which allocates flight slots for commercial 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines announced last month that it would halt its two remaining 
flights out of Long Beach on June 16 because of low passenger volume. It was 
the fifth airline in four years to pull out of Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Jet is one of four new airlines seeking to initiate new routes into and 
out of Long Beach.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH: GTE TO MOVE 520 JOBS TO CONSOLIDATED FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE California has announced plans to move 520 telephone operator jobs to Long 
Beach and spend $20 million on its facilities in the city, adding new services 
for callers seeking directory assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the jobs will be filled by GTE employees from five operator stations 
that are being shut down in other cities, said Mike Murray, a company 
spokesman.The closures, which will affect 226 operators at stations in Lakewood 
and Downey, are scheduled to begin in November and are part of a GTE plan to 
consolidate the company's directory assistance service, Murray said. The 
company employs 292 directory assistance operators at its offices at 200 W. 
Ocean Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the consolidation project, the company also plans to expand its 
menu of directory assistance services, Murray said. One new function will allow 
callers to be connected to the numbers they request without hanging up and 
dialing. Another feature will enable callers to search directories by category 
-- car dealerships, for example. These services will cost extra, Murray said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION: CHURCH GROUP TO LEAD ANTI-VIOLENCE CRUSADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of church leaders has announced plans to distribute 500,000 flyers 
and put up dozens of billboard messages in a three-month anti-violence campaign 
urging residents to "Keep it Good in the Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want everyone to realize that violence is destroying our communities," 
said the Rev. Romie Lilly of the Southern Area Clergy Council, a group of about 
75 pastors and ministers.Details of the campaign were unveiled last week at a 
press conference at the New Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers will be distributed to homes and schools, and placed on car 
windshields throughout Long Beach, Compton, Lynwood and South Los Angeles, 
Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising is donating billboard space and paying for 
the production of five anti-violence ads.  
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is aimed at discouraging domestic violence as well as gang 
crimes, Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of gang violence results from junior seeing how mamma handles problems 
in the home and the kids then do the same things in the streets," Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clergy council led an anti-violence campaign early last year during the 
federal trial of four Los Angeles police officers accused of violating Rodney 
G. King's civil rights. The council and others passed out flyers, conducted 
marches and held press conferences urging residents to remain calm.

COVER STORY; MORMONS REACH OUT AND GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER and MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Henderson and Mikael Black, 20-year-old Mormons from Utah, remember 
trembling with excitement as they held their sealed letters from Salt Lake City 
summoning them to serve missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had taken three years of German in high school and thought the odds were 
pretty good they'd get to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they opened the letters. Destination: Long Beach. Language: Khmer (the 
predominant language of Cambodia). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of shocked because I didn't know there were Cambodians in the 
United States," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the middle of their two-year missions for the church, they spend six 
days a week combing Long Beach apartment neighborhoods is search of Cambodians 
willing to learn about the Mormon faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing white short-sleeve shirts with plain-print ties, Henderson and Black 
look for tell-tale signs of Cambodian households: rice embedded in lawns, 
tassels hanging from rear-view mirrors of cars, sandals stacked outside 
doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Their objective, Henderson said, "is to help bring souls to Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a homogeneous church best known outside its ranks for the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir, Brigham Young University and the Osmond family, the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is expanding and diversifying at a rapid pace 
in Southern California and around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon church membership grew by 22% in the United States between 1982 and 
1991, while some mainstream Protestant denominations reported declines of up to 
40%, according to the National Council of Churches. Mormon church membership 
worldwide has climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million currently, according 
to church figures. And for the first time in the church's 164-year history, 
half of the world's Mormons now live outside the United States, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the trends have been mixed. The church has seen some 
of its white membership age and retire to other regions of the country. But in 
Long Beach and other local areas, the church has reached out to replace its 
departing white members with Latinos, Samoans, Tongans, Cambodians and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the 4,000-member Long Beach East Stake, a Cambodian branch that didn't 
exist 13 years ago has nearly 800 baptized members and picks up 50 converts a 
year, Mormon leaders say. (Stakes are regional units of the church comprising 
congregations called wards, which typically have 400 to 600 members, and 
branches, which range in size from a dozen members to several hundred.)  
</P>
<P>
 A neighboring unit that covers the western section of the city, the 
3,600-member Long Beach Stake, includes two Samoan wards, one Tongan ward, a 
Spanish-speaking ward and a Spanish-speaking branch. Only four of the stake's 
nine congregations are English-speaking. Robert Ward, president of the stake, 
said its membership was 95% white 40 years ago when he was a Polytechnic High 
teen-ager entering the church's priesthood. "We really are multicultural, and 
it's great," Ward said.  
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the growth, the church has poured millions of dollars into its 
Southern California facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the church opened a $4-million, 50,000-square-foot worship 
center at 228th and Main streets in Carson. The Huntington Park West Stake 
center is expected to open this summer, and the church is planning to spend $4 
million renovating the Hollywood Ward and the Wilshire Ward in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The church also is purchasing an eight-acre parcel at 3000 E. South St. in 
Lakewood. Church officials say plans for the site may include a building that 
could house as many as eight congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently renovated stake center at 3701 Elm Ave. in Long Beach is equipped 
to translate services and meetings into several languages. While leaders speak 
from the pulpit in the main chapel, Samoans, Tongans and Latinos in the 
audience wear headphones and listen to translators who sit in nearby rooms and 
watch the proceedings on television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographic changes are in striking contrast to a common perception that 
the Mormon church is a predominantly white church that has sought to stay that 
way. After all, the church denied its priesthood to blacks for more than a 
century until a "divine revelation" in 1978 ended such discrimination and 
opened the door to "every faithful, worthy man in the church." 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers say the common perception of the Mormon church is increasingly 
outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from its inception, the church began sending missionaries to Europe and 
to Mexico. Since then, the church has ventured into 149 countries, "every 
country that allows it to come in," said J. Gordon Melton, director of the 
Santa Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion. "Today, 
Mormons would be among the five most ethnically and culturally diverse churches 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Book of Mormon, the pillar of the church's faith, tells the story of 
immigrants from the Middle East who founded elaborate civilizations in the 
Americas. Visited by Christ after the Resurrection, they prospered for 
centuries, only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and fighting 
among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story, inscribed on golden tablets, was said to have been found by 
Joseph Smith in 1823, guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni. It is an 
image of Moroni, covered in gold leaf, that can be seen holding a trumpet atop 
the church's temples around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith established for the church a strict code of conduct that has been 
modified over the years but continues to place a large number of demands on its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons are expected to donate a tenth of their income to the church, wear 
special undergarments decorated with markings that symbolize a covenant with 
God and follow dietary rules known as the Word of Wisdom, which bans alcohol, 
coffee, tea and tobacco, and urges that meat be consumed only sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Families gather one night each week for a "home evening" devoted to prayer, 
study and other activities that can range from board games to night skiing. The 
church teaches that it is important for families to get along because they will 
spend eternity together in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Devout Mormons pray, study and socialize every Sunday at chapels, or meeting 
houses. Classes, worship and meetings can fill up to 10 hours a week, with 
volunteer pastors, known as bishops, and higher-ranking church officials 
putting in much more time. 
</P>
<P>
 With no professional clergy, church services are led by members of the 
congregation. Church members can baptize their own children or spouses, they 
can practice healing rites and all male members of the church are eligible for 
its priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Vasquez, president of a Latino branch in Long Beach, says such 
opportunities for participation didn't exist in the Catholic faith he abandoned 
20 years ago.

 "In this church the priesthood is for every man; there, it's only for one," 
said Vasquez, 64. "I can bless my sons and I can bless other people. This is 
the true church." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith J. Atkinson, a church spokesman who served a mission in Mexico, said the 
church's hands-on  
</P>
<P>
 approach has attracted many Latinos who have found the Catholic faith too 
distant. Other Mormon converts are attracted by the church's commitment to 
traditional family values and stringent moral guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Chheng, who was a member of a Cambodian branch in Long Beach until he 
moved to South Carolina recently, said his parents joined the church when he 
was a child because they wanted him to have a strict upbringing. Chheng, 24, 
said he was skeptical at first but came to appreciate the sense of purpose and 
direction instilled by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know where I'm going," he said. "I know I'm not supposed to do drugs, drink 
a beer -- that kind of thing. I know what's right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Chheng taught those values to a new generation of Cambodians joining the 
church in Long Beach. He was the branch's first nonwhite to be appointed Young 
Men's President, who oversees the branch's youth activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chheng, an insurance salesman, said his colleagues at work often were 
surprised to learn he is a Mormon. Some wondered how a Cambodian can relate to 
a church in which the vast majority of leaders, including the president of the 
Cambodian branch, are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all His children; we just happened to have come from a different part 
of the world," Chheng said. Joseph Smith could just as easily have been 
Cambodian, Chheng said, "if it was supposed to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The church depends on members such as Vasquez and Chheng to be examples of 
Mormonism's virtues. Church leaders say many converts are introduced to the 
church by Mormon neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But casual contacts alone do not account for the church's rapid expansion. 
Clues to understanding that phenomenon lie in the church's structure and 
tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was a fledgling religious movement in the early 19th Century, the 
church espoused polygamy. Though justification was said to be found in the Old 
Testament, the practice had the pragmatic impact of expanding the ranks of the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Polygamy was officially discarded in 1890, but the church continues to promote 
a high birth rate even today. Temple statues and church literature depict large 
families as the ideal, and women's roles as mothers and homemakers are 
emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage marriage, the Long Beach East Stake has established a ward for 
single members. Stake President S. Lynn Richards proudly points out that since 
its inception 4 1/2 years ago, there have been 35 marriages in the 130-member 
ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Worship centers equipped with everything from kitchens to indoor basketball 
courts are used for numerous social gatherings and are loaned out to local 
organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America. Through these activities, 
potential converts are continually introduced to the church and its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most effective mechanism is the church's missionary operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon children are groomed for missionary work from the moment they're old 
enough to learn the words to "I Hope They Call Me on a Mission" in the Mormon 
hymnal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they are 19, the age at which they are eligible to serve, few 
Mormon men consider doing anything else. They send letters to Salt Lake City 
stating their willingness to serve and wait for marching orders. Women are 
eligible at 21 to serve 18-month missions and now constitute 22% of the 
missionary roster, church officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 If a foreign language is required, missionaries are trained at the Missionary 
Training Center in Provo, Utah. The center offers courses in 44 languages and 
trains about 3,300 missionaries each month, church officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all missionaries are expected to cover their own expenses, and the 
church instructs families to prepare for this obligation.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Henderson and Black, the missionaries working in Long Beach's 
Cambodian community, rely on the $8,400 each of their families was advised to 
set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 While serving their missions, Henderson and Black are expected to abide by 
rules of conduct that make everyday Mormon standards seem relaxed: no dating, 
no television, no radio, no movies, no family visits and no more than two phone 
calls home per year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 They rise at 6 a.m., study religion for a few hours, hit the sidewalk by 9:30 
a.m. and are not permitted to return to their apartment until 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 They travel by foot and bicycle through dangerous sections of the city. A 
shooting took place behind their Washington Place apartment just weeks ago, and 
they say a police officer once sized them up and asked sarcastically, "Is it 
your job to be victimized?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the young men say that their dress code, the same as for their numerous 
predecessors, makes them instantly recognizable and apparently unappealing 
targets to neighborhood hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know why we're there," Black said. "Two white guys in white shirts and 
ties -- you stick out like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson and Black are among 50,000 missionaries stationed around the globe, 
church officials say. There are 212 missionaries in the Los Angeles Mission, 
which includes Long Beach and most Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of other local religious leaders to Mormonism's tenacious 
campaign ranges from grudging admiration to restrained irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon missionary activity is "far more aggressive than anything we're 
doing," said Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles. "I don't want to say being aggressive is bad. Maybe we should be 
saying we're not aggressive enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church has begun strengthening its ties to the ethnic communities 
of Southern California, he said. The St. Thomas Aquinas parish in Monterey 
Park, for example, was recently designated a Chinese-speaking evangelical 
center. The move was intended to offer a home parish to the region's Chinese 
population, although the decision also angered a large segment of the parish's 
predominantly Latino membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coiro said he does not believe the Catholic church's Latino stronghold is 
being eroded by the Mormon church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon church is "one of the many religions, sects and cults that are out 
there trying to attract people," he said. "The best way for a Catholic to 
remain a Catholic is to remain well versed in what it is that makes us 
Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said: "Mormons ask people to believe in some very fantastic things, 
like they can become the gods of their own planets. Someone who's well grounded 
in Christianity is not going to join a religion that says you can become God." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Cambodians joining the Mormon church have converted from Buddhism. But 
Kong Chhean, a monk at a temple at 2100 W. Willow St. in Long Beach, said 
Mormonism is not seen as an enemy or a rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddhism is an open-minded, passive faith that does not forbid its followers 
to explore other philosophies, Chhean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sunday they are going to church, and on Cambodian New Year they come to 
temple," Chhean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chhean's only complaint about Mormon missionaries is one of the most common. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't go from house to house," Chhean said, "because we are busy 
doing our housework." 
</P>

TOBACCO FIRM PAID $950,000 TO PLACE CIGARETTES IN FILMS; MOVIES: COMPANY PAID

</P>
<P>
 Internal memos say that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. spent more than 
$950,000 in a span of four years to feature its cigarette brands in more than 
20 movies--including payments of at least $300,000 to action film star 
Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 The payments took the form of checks, cash and merchandise -- including 
jewelry and automobiles for such stars as Paul Newman, Sean Connery and 
Stallone -- over the years 1979 to 1983, the documents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Product placement, which involves payments for display of brand-name 
merchandise in films, is a legal and potentially large source of revenue for 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But use of the practice by tobacco companies drew harsh criticism in Congress 
and from health activists in the late 1980s. Critics charged that the tobacco 
companies were making an end-run around federal laws that require warning 
labels on cigarette ads and banish tobacco ads from television, where many 
feature films eventually appear. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brown & Williamson spokesman Tom Fitzgerald, the nation's No. 3 
cigarette manufacturer--which makes Kool, Barclay and other brands--halted the 
use of product placement agreements several years ago. Tobacco foes believe 
that the practice continues in the industry, citing what they consider an 
otherwise inexplicable rise in smoking scenes in films and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the papers, recently leaked to anti-smoking leaders in Congress and 
several news organizations, is an April 28, 1983, letter signed by Stallone in 
which he agrees for a fee of $500,000 to "use Brown & Williamson tobacco 
products in no less than five feature films.' 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said Stallone had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bergman, executive director of the anti-smoking group STAT--which has 
accused tobacco firms of using movies to hook young smokers--said Wednesday 
that the revelations are dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's purposely putting advertising in the movies but pretending that it's not 
advertising, knowing that the movies that Sylvester Stallone is in appeal to 
children and youth more than anyone else," Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, then-Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio) conducted hearings on the use of 
product placement deals by tobacco firms. In the biggest expenditure disclosed 
during Luken's inquiries, Philip Morris said its Tokyo-based advertising agency 
had paid $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in a James Bond film that was to 
run in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the placement effort described in the Brown & Williamson documents is the 
most extensive and costly ever to come to light. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers include a 1983 audit of the tobacco company's agreement with 
Associated Film Promotions, a now-defunct Los Angeles product placement firm. 
According to the audit, Associated Film's records showed that "they have 
attempted to make placements for B & W in over 150 movies or television shows 
and have succeeded in making placements in 22 movies and one television show.' 
</P>
<P>
 The report said B & W was paying Associated Film a $30,000 quarterly retainer 
in 1983 and had paid a total of $278,000 in retainer fees since their 
relationship began in mid-1979. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, B & W spent an additional $687,000 for 'special 
placements" arranged by Associated Film in a variety of movies--including 
$100,000 apiece for "Where the Boys Are" and "Harry & Son," both 1984 releases, 
and $50,000 for the Clint Eastwood picture 'Killing Ground," released in 1983 
as "Sudden Impact.' 
</P>
<P>
 About $300,000 of the special placement monies went to Stallone as part of the 
five-picture deal worth $500,000, the documents said. Among the Stallone films 
in the deal, according to the documents, were 'Rhinestone Cowboy," 'Rocky IV" 
and "Rambo," which was released as 'Rambo: First Blood Part II.' 
</P>
<P>
 The documents suggest that B & W officials were not sure they were getting 
their money's worth, after sitting down to view seven films in which their 
brands were to be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Body Heat," the blurred image of a Kool poster appeared three times, but 
two lead characters were "observed . . . smoking Marlboro--industry leader 
Philip Morris' flagship brand--throughout the film, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same story with "Only When I Laugh." That film included "a blurred 
pack of Kool," but "the lead character . . . smoked Marlboro throughout the 
movie.' 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco executives also discovered that in some cases, Associated Film was not 
paying with "checks to individuals" because movie producers 'prefer cash, 
jewelry, cars, etc.' 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the report said, Associated Film's records showed that of $20,000 
paid for placement in the James Bond film, "Never Say Never Again," $12,715 was 
spent on "jewelry for Sean Connery.' 
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000 purportedly paid for placement in "Harry & Son" included $42,307 
for a "car for Paul Newman," the documents said. And of $50,000 listed for the 
film that became "Sudden Impact," $22,047 was said to have been spent on a "car 
for Clint Eastwood," according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Connery and Newman did not return phone calls seeking comment. A 
spokesman for Eastwood said the audit entry had to be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't receive a car," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kovoloff, a public relations man and former president of Associated 
Film, declined to discuss the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with this right now. My answer is I have nothing to 
say.' 
</P>
<P>
 Several tobacco companies told Luken in 1989 they no longer paid filmmakers to 
feature their brands, but had done so in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, cigarette firms wrote a prohibition on placements into the 
industry's voluntary advertising code, according to an official with the 
Tobacco Institute. The code states that tobacco companies will "not . . . 
engage in paid movie product or cigarette advertising placements.' 
</P>
<P>
 The practice remains common among other makers of consumer goods. One current 
release, "Major League II," includes prominent displays of at least eight 
recognizable brand names.

 Tobacco Pitchman Agrees Stars Did Not Receive Gifts 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarettes: Brown & Williamson documents outlined payments. Middleman says 
information is bogus.

<P>
 Paul Newman did not get a Mercedes. Bob Kovoloff did. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovoloff, of Encino, ran a nearly $1-million campaign in the early 1980s to 
place Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. brands in feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 His Associated Film Promotions, then among Hollywood's most prominent 
product-placement firms, often eschewed written deals with studios, claiming to 
rely instead on lavish gifts to members of movie casts and crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on internal documents leaked from B & W to members of Congress and 
news organizations, The Times reported last month that Newman, Clint Eastwood, 
Sean Connery and Sylvester Stallone, among others, supposedly got expensive 
jewelry, cars and other items, purchased by Associated with B & W's money. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reports prompted indignant denials by some of the celebrities. And 
now, challenged on the details, Kovoloff--a pioneer product pitchman who has 
faced dozens of lawsuits over his business dealings--says that many of the 
goods never reached the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Connery "never got any jewelry," he said in a telephone interview last 
week. "Paul Newman never got a car. Sylvester Stallone never got a car. Clint 
Eastwood never got a car. They never got a thing from me.' 
</P>
<P>
 Although a B & W audit in 1983 listing the gifts said it relied exclusively on 
records provided by Kovoloff's firm, Kovoloff last week called the listing 
bogus, denied furnishing the information and said he did not know where it came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion over how the money was spent was not his doing, Kovoloff insisted. 
"A lot of (stuff) could have been made up," he said. Kovoloff declined further 
comment, and did not return additional phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that Brown & Williamson set out--years after Congress barred 
tobacco firms from advertising on television and radio--to buy display for its 
products in motion pictures. But in selecting Kovoloff as its Hollywood 
pitchman, B & W got fewer results than it hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 The product-placement effort "in our view was a failure," acknowledged B & W 
spokesman Tom Fitzgerald. "It was not an effective use of our marketing 
dollars." Fitzgerald declined to comment on the audit--conducted by B & W to 
ascertain how its money was being spent by Kovoloff's firm--or on Associated's 
use of the tobacco firm's money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kovoloff, 57, is no stranger to disputes over property and money. During the 
1980s and early '90s, he and his companies faced a torrent of lawsuits from 
angry clients, landlords and employees--a legal onslaught checked only by his 
bankruptcy filing in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Former clients Nikon and Panasonic won court judgments of $70,000 and 
$349,000, respectively, over expensive photographic and electronic equipment 
loaned to Associated as movie props but never returned. In its defense, 
Associated claimed it was understood "that many of the products would not in 
fact be returned as that is the custom and practice in the motion picture 
industry.' 
</P>
<P>
 * After Pizza Inn Inc., paid a promotional fee of $100,000, the firm 
'instantly began to be unable to ever locate" Kovoloff, said Jeff Rogers, 
president of the Dallas-based chain, which was listed as a creditor in 
Kovoloff's bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Florida Smoked Fish Co. filed suit against an ad agency over what it termed 
an unfulfilled promise of a movie scene in which famished patrons held hostage 
in a supermarket were to eat bagels and the company's fish products. The ad 
agency contracted for the placement with a Kovoloff firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Trumbull County Convention and Visitors Bureau in northeastern Ohio won 
a lawsuit over $35,000 it paid Associated to promote the area as a film 
location. "Nothing ever came of it. . . . We would write letters to him, place 
telephone calls, and there was no response," said Darlene Russo, administrative 
assistant for the visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kovoloff and his companies also were sued repeatedly by landlords for unpaid 
rent on office space and luxury homes. "He's a deadbeat extraordinaire," said 
Ryan Martin, a leasing agent for a Van Nuys commercial landlord who repeatedly 
sued a Kovoloff firm for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the odd tale of Brown & Williamson's campaign to promote its brands 
in films that has brought Kovoloff's bumpy career into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1983 audit, B & W said canceled checks and other records showed that 
Associated had used the tobacco company's funds to buy, among other things, a 
$42,307 automobile for Newman, a $22,047 car for Clint Eastwood and $12,715 in 
jewelry for Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 To support the claimed gift to Newman, Associated apparently showed B & W's 
auditors a canceled check for $42,307 written to Auto Stiegler Inc., an Encino 
car dealership. But John Stiegler Jr., a spokesman for the dealership, said 
last week that a Mercedes convertible at that price was delivered to Kovoloff, 
not Newman. Kovoloff subsequently acknowledged he got the car. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kovoloff also acknowledged, Associated did not buy Clint Eastwood a car 
from Auto Stiegler, either, despite the audit record. Selling "a car to a 
celebrity . . . is a big thing to us," Stiegler said. "I would have known if 
there was any car going to Clint Eastwood.' 
</P>
<P>
 As for Connery, his attorney stated that the actor did not receive any kind of 
payment for the placement of tobacco products in movies in which he performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another audit entry listed a payment of $13,000 to David Levy, described as 
"assistant producer" of the movie "Tank." But according to the filmmakers and 
credits, "Tank" did not have an assistant producer--nor any involvement by a 
David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the purported payment, however, Associated did pay $13,000 to a 
David L. Levy--a real estate man who had nothing to do with the film. The money 
was for a security deposit and two months rent of a West Los Angeles office and 
warehouse building owned by Levy. The payment was cited in court papers in a 
lawsuit against Associated--one of several Levy wound up filing for unpaid 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lW documents also included an April 28, 1983, letter to Kovoloff from 
Sylvester Stallone, in which Stallone agreed for a fee of $500,000 to "use 
Brown & Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films.' 
</P>
<P>
 The B & W audit, prepared several months later, said Associated had received 
$300,000 of the funds for disbursement to Stallone. Stallone's representatives 
have declined to discuss the matter, and it is unclear where the money wound 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 B & W canceled its contract with Associated Film in 1984. Internal memos show 
the firm was disturbed by Associated's record-keeping practices and didn't 
think it was getting its money's worth. Moreover, the cigarette maker had just 
been hammered by bad publicity over the showing of a Kool cigarette commercial 
in a Massachusetts theater featuring the G-rated movie "Snow White.' 
</P>
<P>
 A memo said Kovoloff and Associated Film Senior Vice President James F. 
Ripslinger were told the deal "was being terminated because of a corporate 
policy decision.' 
</P>
<P>
 B & W's parting was more amicable than that of some Kovoloff clients, who sued 
but were unable to collect their judgments. Collection was stymied by 
Kovoloff's 1992 bankruptcy, which wiped out debts of more than than $1.5 
million to nearly 100 creditors.

<P>
 Despite his seemingly dire financial straits, though, Kovoloff maintained some 
trappings of the high life. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing in November, 1990, involving an unpaid legal judgment, 
Kovoloff said he and his wife "have nothing. . . . We are as broke as two 
people can be.' 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that his wife was driving a Range Rover. His car? A 
Jaguar.
