 FOSTER CARE: Ventura County leaders have designated May as Foster Parent 
Awareness Month to honor those who open their homes to abused or neglected 
children. . . . Social service workers hope that the designation inspires 
others to fill gaps in the program. The greatest need: parents to take in two 
or more siblings, teen-agers or kids who speak only Spanish. "It's bad enough 
to be separated from your family and siblings," coordinator Diana Caskey said. 
"But to be put in a home that doesn't speak your language can be traumatic."

 SMOG DOG: It's a high-tech gadget that uses an infrared beam to measure the 
exhaust from a passing car and then snaps a picture of the license plate. . . . 
Folks in Sacramento will soon unleash these puppies along roadsides throughout 
the state capital. Depending on how well they sniff out car pollution, Smog 
Dogs could then be tethered to freeway on-ramps across Ventura County. Their 
mission: to nab cars in need of a smog check. On Thursday, Smog Dog's marketing 
manager will trot out the device for locals to see.

 TRAILBLAZER: California voters tend to shy away from adding to their tax 
burden. But if voters approve a massive bond measure in June, Ventura County 
could end up with miles of extra hiking and biking trails and hundreds of acres 
of protected wilderness (B1). . . . Officially, it's Proposition 180, the Parks 
and Wildlife Initiative. But among environmentalists, it's called CALPAW, 
promising $50 million for ecological projects in the county.

 MS. FEMINIST: Gloria Steinem's words have helped shape gender politics for 
decades. Tonight, they'll fill the old Oddfellows lodge in downtown Ventura as 
she discusses her new book, "Moving Beyond Words." Ventura Bookstore owners, 
who are sponsoring her talk and selling her book, expect to pack the lodge 
above the store. National Organization for Women members will be there, former 
local president Jamie Cox said. "Everyone is looking forward to getting the 
latest in feminist news," she said. Foster Homes

IT'S BACK TO NORMAL IN CHICAGO; NBA PLAYOFFS: PIPPEN IS FORGIVEN AFTER HIS 25 
POINTS LEAD 95-83 VICTORY OVER KNICKS THAT TIES EASTERN CONFERENCE SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scottie, come home. 
</P>
<P>
 See if this sounds familiar: Knicks win two games, come here, stand idly 
around while Bulls' star extracts himself from latest controversy, lose two 
games, go home unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened a year ago around Michael Jordan's jaunt to Atlantic City and it 
happened again Sunday when Pippen, pilloried after pulling himself out of 
Friday's game, returned to score 25 points with eight rebounds and six assists, 
leading Chicago to a 95-83 victory, tying the series, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen got a few boos upon introduction but was cheered wildly thereafter. As 
long as he helps beat New York, Bull fans will forgive him mutiny, getting 
caught with a gun in his car or even kicking the lantern over in Mrs. O'Leary's 
shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has many lives," Bull Coach Phil Jackson said. "Sometimes you grow 
closer out of the things that happen to ball clubs and individuals, to bring 
them together even closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tension brings weird experiences to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knick Coach Pat Riley: "The perception of other people was it was hectic. 
For them, it could be normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of things happen to this team over the years and they've 
continued to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen left the locker room before reporters were admitted, yet another return 
to normalcy for the Bulls. A year ago, Jordan began a boycott of the media 
after reports of his gambling junket. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen's buddy, Horace Grant also left. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Bulls, still working on their togetherness, said it had been a game 
like any other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you all were the only ones worried," guard Pete Myers told reporters. 
"You all did all the writing. This is a team. We have responsibilities like a 
family. I had no doubt Scottie was going to come out and play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Said guard Steve Kerr: "He got introduced, the crowd goes nuts. All of a 
sudden, it's Game 4. . . . I don't think anybody on the bench mentioned it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they were tired of the subject. As late as Saturday afternoon, Jackson 
told ESPN, "Scottie was muddled. He thought he was the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Bulls had more to worry about than their embattled star, such as the 
fast-approaching end of their season. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 2-1, in the series, they saw the Knicks take a 12-0 lead with Riley's 
new lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of playing catch-up, he took punchless Anthony Bonner and slumping 
Hubert Davis out of the starting lineup and put John Starks and Charles Smith 
back in. With Greg Anthony replacing the suspended Derek Harper, the Knicks 
were back to their lineup before Riley's March shakeup, when he ended a slump 
by taking them on an impromptu gambling excursion to Reno. Desperate for 
scoring all season, Riley is running out of ideas and recycling old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks scored on a driving layup off the opening tip. Smith made a 17-footer 
on the second possession. Pippen's first shot, from 18 feet, missed badly. The 
Knicks scored 12 points; the Bulls missed six shots. 
</P>
<P>
 They had come back to trail, 16-8, when Pippen picked up his second foul and 
was replaced by his former arch-rival, Toni Kukoc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls kept surging. Kukoc, running with the offense as deftly as Pippen, 
had five assists by halftime. The Bulls had the lead by the end of the first 
quarter and led, 53-41, by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 66-47 early in the third quarter and 79-65 going into the fourth. For 
the first time in the series, the Knicks couldn't mount a closing rally and 
Riley went home to re-draft the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to gather our forces and take a good, hard look at our defense and 
what they're doing to our offense," Riley said. "They totally flattened us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Patrick Ewing: "We lost. We went south. . . . I'm disappointed we lost 
this game. This series should be over by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Who should have won by now is a matter of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series in which the Bulls are supposed to be underdogs, they have led 
going into every fourth quarter -- by an average of 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 They have had leads of 15, eight, 22 and 19 points in the third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks' only successful technique for stopping them has been to wear them 
down physically and try to get them to wilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks still have their home-court advantage, but they will play one more 
game without Harper. Sunday, Anthony played 42 minutes, shot two for 13 and 
committed four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was late in last spring's Game 5 that New York's Smith saw four of his 
layups blocked, turning the series in Chicago's favor. History can't keep 
repeating itself, but he had better be ready.

AGAIN, ANGEL PITCHERS HAVE THE WRONG STUFF; BASEBALL: MAGRANE LETS EARLY LEADS 
GET AWAY AND BULLPEN DOESN'T HELP OUT MUCH IN 9-5 LOSS TO MARINERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Maybe it will happen this morning, or later this afternoon, or perhaps even as 
late as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But at some point, the Angels' management will meet to discuss the future of 
their struggling pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shoddy start -- this one by Joe Magrane in a 9-5 loss to the Seattle 
Mariners on Sunday -- makes it imperative the Angels act soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are simply too great to ignore, Manager Buck Rodgers said after 
Magrane lasted only 4 1/3 innings. Of particular concern are starters Magrane 
and Mark Leiter and reliever John Dopson. Only Chuck Finley and Mark Langston 
would appear to be safe from potential moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize John Dopson has been released (actually, he wasn't 
re-signed by Boston)," Rodgers said. "Mark Leiter has been released (by 
Detroit). Joe Magrane has been released (by St. Louis). And we're trying to 
find spots for them on our club. We have to find a way to stay out of the 
situations we got into (Sunday). You've got to look at what we've got to start 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like, in a day or two, to make some decisions, depending on how our 
talks come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, pitching coach Chuck Hernandez, General Manager Bill Bavasi and 
Assistant GM Tim Mead will meet to hash out remedies for their ailing staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's loss provided further evidence that the club's most glaring weakness 
is its pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane was lousy and he didn't deny it after giving up five runs and eight 
hits, including home runs by Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Blowers. He struck out 
two and walked five. He also threw 125 pitches, far too many as far as he and 
Rodgers were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had a 3-1 lead after the second inning, but Magrane couldn't hold 
it. They led, 4-3, after the top of the fifth but that slipped away, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to make any excuses," said Magrane, 0-2 with a 7.04 earned-run 
average in three starts. "I was just embarrassed today. I can't remember the 
last time I let two leads get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just really disappointed, embarrassed. I feel I let the guys down today, 
especially from the perspective that our bullpen has been worked hard the last 
few games." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the bullpen? 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Joe Grahe and Bob Patterson couldn't hold a 7-4 lead to start the 
seventh inning, and the Mariners rallied from a seven-run deficit in their 10-7 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Dopson gave up four runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings. Seattle got a 
run-scoring double from Dan Wilson in the seventh, taking a 6-4 lead. Then, 
after retiring the first two batters in the eighth, Dopson gave up three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what that's all about," Rodgers said. "He keeps the ball down, 
then all of a sudden he's in trouble. You figure one good pitch and we're out 
of it, then three runs later we still don't have the third out. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't know why we get the first two outs bang, bang and we can't get 
the third out." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's four-run eighth off Grahe on Saturday also came with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think it's contagious," said reliever Scott Lewis, who pitched 
a hitless 1 2/3 innings Sunday. "If you look back from day one, all we've been 
doing is this: Pitch well one time, struggle one time. It's a matter of getting 
it rolling. We've all had our good and bad moments." 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching woes overshadowed another homer by Tim Salmon. The solo shot off 
Bobby Ayala in the ninth inning was Salmon's fifth in four games and his 
team-leading 10th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite all their troubles on the mound, the Angels still might have been 
in the game if not for stranding nine runners in scoring position and having 
two others picked off, infuriating Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be aggressive," he said. "But you have to get back to the base."

VETERANS MEET THE CHALLENGE, DODGERS WIN; BASEBALL: BUTLER, WALLACH, CANDIOTTI 
SHOW THE KIDS HOW IT'S DONE IN 7-1 VICTORY OVER PADRES THAT FINISHES 6-0 HOME 
STAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The kids are all right, but three 36-year-olds galloped around the bases, set 
milestones and generally provided the punch and the pitching for the Dodgers on 
Sunday afternoon in a 7-1 victory over the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 On an overcast, muggy day before 45,917 at Dodger Stadium, Tom Candiotti 
controlled the Padres over nine innings, Tim Wallach legged out a stand-up 
triple and drove in two runs and Brett Butler led everything off with a bunt 
single, the 2,000th hit of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the young guys did their part: Raul Mondesi, Eric Karros, Mike Piazza 
and Delino DeShields scored and had multiple-hit games. 
</P>
<P>
 And sure, the Padres showed the combination of bad pitching and hitting that 
has led them to the worst record in baseball, 10-26, half a game poorer than 
the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Dodgers rolled to a sweep of this six-game home stand and packed 
their bags for Colorado tied with the Giants in first place in the NL West, it 
was clearly theage-challenged who led the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean the old guys, right?" Butler said. "Well, it just shows we're 
getting good play out of everybody. It's a collective effort to win games." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler agreed it made sense that his milestone came by his signature talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to be a bunt, didn't it?" Butler said. "That's what I'm known for. 
What a way to get 2,000, with a bunt. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the hit, when Butler glanced to the dugout for recognition after 
dragging an 0-and-1 sinker down the first-base line and beating the throw to 
first, he got a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda got everybody to run down the hallway and clear the 
dugout, so when Butler looked over all he saw was an empty bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dogged me," Butler said. "That was their way of getting on me, the old 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Candiotti: "I've been with Brett probably longer than anybody, back when 
we were in Cleveland, and it's a special feat. He hasn't changed a thing since 
I've known him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of his hits. I've benefited from a lot of his hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler recovered from the prank in time to steal second and score on Piazza's 
double down the left field line, giving Candiotti a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti (4-1) showed immediately that Sunday would be different from his 
last outing -- 2 1/3 innings of non-knuckling knuckleballs last Saturday 
against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 He said pitching coach Ron Perranoski noticed he was releasing the ball too 
high, causing his knuckler to dart from side-to-side instead of the more 
effective up-and-down action. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving his release point lower and concentrating on keeping his fingers on 
top of the ball -- and also getting the bonus of the thick air Sunday -- 
Candiotti's knuckler was dancing wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was really exploding downward today," said Candiotti, who gave up 
five hits, walked one and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it starts off in the strike zone, it's really tough for right-handed 
hitters to lay off of it when it dives down." 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti gave up a run in the fourth inning, but by then the Dodgers had 
pounded A.J. Sager (1-3) for three more runs, triggered by Wallach's two-run 
triple to the right-center field gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on a medium-deep fly by Henry Rodriguez, the not-exactly-speedy Wallach 
tagged up and beat Phil Plantier's throw, making the score 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers got three more runs in the seventh inning against reliever Jose 
Martinez, two scoring on a Mondesi double and one on a suicide squeeze bunt by 
Candiotti. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing eight consecutive one-run games and enduring a slew of 
come-from-behind situations, Sunday was a nice break from the tension for the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was the first time we've had a little breathing room," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-0 home stand is second-best in team history, behind only the 9-0 home 
stand last May, part of last year's 13-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing it the right way," Piazza said. "We're not relying on one guy to 
carry the club, because when you do that, and that one guy starts to cool off, 
the whole team starts to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's a contagious sort of thing on this ballclub. With our 
pitchers, Orel (Hershiser) throws a good game, so Tommy wants to throw a better 
one. If Eli (Tim Wallach) gets a big knock, then Eric or I want to get the next 
one."

 Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette would like to get rid of all team 
nicknames and start over: 
</P>
<P>
 "When is the last time you saw a panther, except in a zoo? What is a Buckeye? 
A Hawkeye? A Nittany Lion? A Hoya? Why should we care? With a modicum of effort 
we could replace the whole tired lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me nicknames with relevance now. I yearn to see the New York Muggers 
take on the Washington Tax and Spenders, no matter what the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Add nicknames: Toronto's new NBA team will be called the Raptors, a shortened 
version of the name for the velociraptor dinosaur in the movie "Jurassic Park." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The team's logo will be a snarling dinosaur dribbling a basketball.

Rockets were called the Twin Towers?

 Well, Sammie and Simeon Haley, 7-foot identical twins, have announced they

 Tee tied: Pro golfer Billy Mayfair and his longtime girlfriend Tammy McIntire 
were recently married near the 18th green of the Four Seasons/Tournament 
Players Course in Las Colinas, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be spending the rest of our lives on a golf course," Mayfair 
said. "We thought we might as well be married on one." 
</P>
<P>
 Eloquent: In replacing "Raider" with "Skyhawk" as the school's new nickname, 
President Joel M. Jones of Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., said:  
</P>
<P>
 "The skyhawk is a powerful image in flight -- the symbol of our efforts to 
conduct our daily lives from the higher plane of vision and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Ageless ace: At 81 and with failing eyesight, Philip Lopiano no longer can see 
the pins. It didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopiano recently got the third hole in one of his 66-year golfing career. All 
three aces have come on the par-three 17th at Glen Brook Country Club in 
Stroudsburg, Pa.

 Naughty, naughty: When the Chicago Blackhawks played their final game in 
Chicago Stadium, a woman tried to steal the door off the women's rest room in 
the second balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 She was caught and stadium officials made her put it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy sell: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News: "Headline: 'George 
Foreman Talked Out of Retirement.' Whoo boy. Bet that took some talking. Like 
two words, one of which was four and the other, million."

 If the Clippers had picked Del Harris to succeed Larry Brown last year, they 
would have been ripped for hiring a retread who has a losing NBA coaching 
record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When the Lakers picked Harris to succeed Magic Johnson last week, they were 
cited for hiring a good X's and O's guy who has NBA experience. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it is little wonder why Jerry West long has been impressed by 
Harris. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Harris' Houston Rockets upset the Lakers in the first round of 
the 1981 playoffs, his Milwaukee Bucks were 7-3 against the Lakers in five 
seasons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Harris' last game as a coach was a 126-94 beating of the Lakers at Milwaukee 
on Dec. 3, 1991. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That Scottie Pippen sure is a gamer, still going all out in the last 1.8 
seconds of the Chicago Bulls' 95-83 rout of the New York Knicks Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Go figure the Suns, who stage the greatest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA 
history at Houston to take a 2-0 series lead over the Rockets and then stink 
out the joint twice in a row at Phoenix. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Atlanta Hawks' fans can't blame Danny Manning, whose 35 points were 
more than even Dominique Wilkins would have scored against the Indiana Pacers.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; SAMPRAS EASILY DEFEATS BECKER FOR ITALIAN TITLE

 Pete Sampras defeated Boris Becker in straight sets Sunday to win the Italian 
Open in Rome and establish himself as the favorite in the French Open, the only 
Grand Slam tournament played on clay. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's No. 1 player routed the three-time Wimbledon champion, 6-1, 6-2, 
6-2, in 1 hour 52 minutes and looked completely at ease on the red clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras has won 27 consecutive matches and seven titles this year. He heads 
into the French Open seeking his fourth consecutive Grand Slam event title and 
the only one that has eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Laver was the last man to win four Grand Slam tournaments in a row, in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a combination of Boris not being on top of his game and me playing my 
best match of the week," Sampras said. "I never let Boris get into any sort of 
rhythm. After I broke him in the second game, I felt pretty much like I was in 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Becker: "I think he's invincible right now."  
</P>
<P>
 Can Sampras finally win the French Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sampras: "I would just like to win in Paris once, whether it's this year, 
next year or in five years."

PACERS MAKE 11 THREE-POINTERS, LEAD HAWKS, 3-1

<P>
 The Indiana Pacers, who had never won an NBA playoff series before this year, 
are one victory from their first trip to the Eastern Conference finals after 
defeating top-seeded Atlanta again Sunday at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers took a 3-1 lead in the series with a 102-86 victory, the Pacers' 
second easy victory in two days over the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana made a franchise playoff-record 11 three-pointers in 17 attempts. 
Reggie Miller made four and finished with a team-high 25 points. The Pacers 
shot 52.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning scored a career playoff-high 35 points for the Hawks, who shot 
only 42%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rumors of trouble between Larry Brown and Manning in the past, the 
Indiana coach said, "As a coach, this is probably the way I would have written 
the script, to have Danny have a great game on national TV and us winning the 
game. He was phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown coached Manning at Kansas and with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Laker Byron Scott scored 13 points for the Pacers to bring his career 
playoff total to 2,236. He needs five more to surpass Bob Pettit for 17th place 
on the NBA's career list. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's Kevin Willis, who was limited to only 23 minutes after suffering a 
knee injury when he collided with Manning, missed all five of his shots from 
the field and made only two free throws. Willis said he expects to play in Game 
5 Tuesday.

NBA PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE; ROCKETS BREATHING EASIER AFTER 107-96 
VICTORY 
</P>

 The Houston Rockets were being called chokers when they left home after 
blowing two big leads. But two games later, no one is calling them that. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not chokers, they are men, and what they have done is just amazing," 
Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said Sunday after the Rockets won their second 
consecutive game at Phoenix, 107-96. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe dominated inside, and the Suns' Charles 
Barkley was held to 19 points, more than 11 under his playoff average of 30.8. 
</P>
<P>
 With Houston leading only 91-85 late in the game, Olajuwon blocked Barkley's 
attempted dunk, and the Rockets pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 By leaving Phoenix with the series tied 2-2, the Rockets regained the 
home-court edge in this best-of-seven set. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 5 is Tuesday night at The Summit, where Houston lost the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media jumps to conclusions and screams 'Choke City,' but we lost two 
games before that we felt we should have won, and we came into these games 
knowing we could beat these guys," said Olajuwon, who had 28 points, 12 
rebounds and five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets have outscored the Suns for seven quarters in a row, starting with 
the last three of a 118-102 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 4 Sunday, Houston was ahead 25-20 after one quarter, 52-46 after two 
and 73-66 after three. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Smith scored 21 points for the Rockets, and Mario Elie got 11 of his 14 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson had his second consecutive 38-point, 12-assist game for the 
Suns, but Barkley was the only other Phoenix player in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business, you go from the penthouse to the outhouse pretty quickly, 
and I guess you could say I'm definitely in the outhouse," said Barkley, who 
made only seven of 21 shots but had 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 83, Utah 82 -- Reggie Williams made a 22-footer with 1.9 seconds left 
at Denver, rallying the Nuggets and keeping the Jazz from advancing to the 
Western Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah will take a 3-1 lead into Game 5 on Tuesday night at Salt Lake City. Game 
6, if necessary, would be Thursday at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets, avoiding the first four-game sweep in their playoff history and 
preventing Utah from recording its first four-game sweep, got a strong 
fourth-quarter effort from LaPhonso Ellis, who scored 10 of his 17 points in 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who finished with 21 points, had two three-pointers in the final 
quarter, the last with 2:47 left to give Denver a 78-75 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver center Dikembe Mutombo blocked three shots in the first three minutes 
of the game and finished with six blocks. As a team, the Nuggets had 14 blocks.

 This was the way it was supposed to be: Todd Van Poppel starting and winning, 
with Dennis Eckersley getting a save. This is the way it has been: Van Poppel 
starting and losing since Sept. 20, 1993, with Eckersley not getting many 
opportunities to save anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Poppel inspired no confidence at first, then settled in to pitch 5 1/3 
innings in the Oakland Athletics' 6-2 victory at Kansas City. Eckersley got the 
final three outs for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland earned back-to-back victories for the first time in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Poppel had spent extra time with pitching coach Dave Duncan after his 
earned-run average soared to 9.59, but you could hardly tell it when the first 
three Royals went triple, double and double for a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling a little erratic," Van Poppel said. "The first three batters hit 
the ball right where we weren't. After that, they popped it up, they put the 
bat on it and hit it at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Poppel (1-4) gave up only two more hits and left with a 4-2 lead. He beat 
Royal rookie Jeff Granger, who also pitched 5 1/3 innings and left trailing, 
3-2, in his first major league start. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 12, Milwaukee 1 -- Don Mattingly, Wade Boggs and Bernie Williams 
homered at Milwaukee as the Yankees won their 10th game in a row, their longest 
winning streak since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-game sweep in Milwaukee was New York's first since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill went two for three, increasing his major league-leading average 
to .467, as the Yankees won for the 20th time in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly had four of the Yankees' 17 hits -- the sixth game in a row in which 
they have had 10 or more -- and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kamieniecki (3-0) gave up one run and five hits in eight innings for New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Baltimore 2 -- Kevin Tapani pitched a five-hitter in Minneapolis 
and the Twins completed a three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapani (3-2), who came in with a 7.78 ERA, struck out four and retired 16 of 
the last 17 in his first complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro doubled in the fourth inning to extend his hitting 
streak to a major league-best 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 9, Texas 6 -- Wilson Alvarez won his 14th consecutive regular-season 
decision, one shy of the team record, and the White Sox won at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (7-0) gave up four runs, only one of them earned, and nine hits in 
seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 11, Detroit 6 -- Kenny Lofton singled, doubled and homered, scoring 
four times, and Albert Belle homered and drove in four runs for the Indians in 
a rainy victory at Cleveland that completed a three-game sweep.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MITCHELL'S SHOT DROPS THE GIANTS 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Mitchell felt right at home sending one over the Candlestick Park fence 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who spent four-plus seasons with the San Francisco Giants, hit a 
solo home run in the 10th inning and the Cincinnati Reds went on to record a 
9-6 victory over the Giants, who dropped back into a first-place tie with the 
Dodgers in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell hit his 11th home run of the season with one out off Rod Beck (1-1) 
to break a 6-6 tie and give another former Giant, reliever Jeff Brantley, the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mitchell's homer, Reggie Sanders followed with a double to left, then 
Bret Boone hit a ball to the right field corner that first base umpire Mark 
Hirschbeck ruled a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants argued and replays showed the ball did go foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds' victory was their first against the Giants after losing 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Brantley (2-1), dropped by the Giants after last season, was booed by 
Candlestick Park fans when he came on to pitch. But he went the final two 
innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 1, Pittsburgh 0 -- The Phillies' Shawn Boskie, formerly of the 
Chicago Cubs, snapped an eight-game losing streak against the Pirates by 
limiting them to four hits, all singles, in six innings at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Lieber, making his major league debut, held the Phillies to five hits in 
six innings. But the Pirates stranded 13 baserunners as Philadelphia completed 
a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 6, New York 1 -- The Braves, coming off an 11-4 loss on Saturday, got 
eight solid innings from Steve Avery and two homers from Javier Lopez to beat 
the Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery (4-1) struck out a season-high nine and gave up five hits in winning his 
third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 9, St. Louis 8 -- Lenny Webster drove in the winning run as the Expos 
rallied for four in the ninth to beat the Cardinals at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquis Grissom and Mike Lansing had two-run homers and drove in three runs 
each for the Expos, who had 13 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pagnozzi had one of four St. Louis homers -- his first this season -- and 
drove in three runs as the Cardinals had a season-high 16 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, Chicago 0 -- Chris Hammond extended his scoreless streak to a 
club-record 22 innings and helped himself with a double and a suicide squeeze 
to lead the Marlins at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 4, Houston 0 -- Andres Galarraga hit his 13th home run and Armando 
Reynoso and two relievers combined for the shutout at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies, after winning two of the three games in this series, are now 13-2 
against the Astros.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS FEELS READY TO BREAK LOOSE 
</P>

<P>
 For most of this recent Dodger upswing, second baseman Delino DeShields has 
watched his batting average remain stuck near .200 and seen most of his swings 
result in ground ball outs. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this in addition to the broken cheekbone, hamstring problems and severe 
concussion he has suffered since he was traded from the Expos for Pedro 
Martinez last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he went three for five -- increasing his average to .228 -- and scored 
a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, we're still winning," DeShields said. "I figure once I get into 
it, we'll take off for real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know who's throwing the ball out there, and I've busted them before in the 
past. They're getting me now. But I'll be hitting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel snake bit? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a little bit. But I'm not going to get down about it," DeShields said. 
"It'd be different if I was someone who had never accomplished anything in this 
league. But I've put up the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of getting through this rough period." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New call-up Garey Ingram arrived in time to play Sunday as a ninth-inning 
defensive replacement for DeShields at second base. The first Padre batter, 
Tony Gwynn, immediately rapped a hard grounder to Ingram, who fielded it 
cleanly and threw to first for the out. . . . Cory Snyder got his second start 
of the season at shortstop and handled his only fielding chance, a 
seventh-inning ground ball by Ricky Gutierrez.TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ'S ARGUMENT CAN'T BE DENIED

 First baseman Eduardo Perez awoke feeling no pain in his injured left wrist, 
so he persuaded Manager Buck Rodgers to start him on Sunday. It didn't take 
much of a speech for Perez to get his point across. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, he said he felt good," Rodgers said after Perez went three for five in 
his first game since May 4. "No. 2, he didn't have any pain at all. No. 3, 
Chili (Davis) went down (with a cut below the kneecap). No. 4, we're facing 
Randy Johnson, and I didn't want another left-handed hitter up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez singled in the second and third innings and doubled in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers rates reliever Craig Lefferts, who leads the team with a 1.95 
earned-run average, as one of the biggest surprises of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to evaluate veteran pitchers in spring training," Rodgers said. 
"Veterans like Lefferts work on adrenaline and they just can't get their 
adrenaline up in spring training. If they don't get that adrenaline rush, their 
stuff isn't so good. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you put Lefferts into a game situation where he's got a chance to help 
the ballclub and help himself, and he can come through. He can still, on 
occasion, blow his fastball by people." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina couldn't wait to get on the field Sunday, hoping to erase 
memories of Saturday's 10-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer you sit around the worse it can be," said DiSarcina, who hit 
safely in his seventh consecutive game Sunday. "After a game like that, the 
first thing you want to do is get back out there." 
</P>
<P>

 Here's more on Jerry Willard, whose three-run homer capped Seattle's 
come-from-behind victory Saturday night. Willard, 34, played in 340 major 
league games before this season, spending the better part of his 14-year pro 
career in the minors. He batted .319 with eight homers in 107 games at 
Richmond, Va., the Atlanta Braves' triple-A affiliate. The Mariners signed him 
as a minor league free agent in February. . . . Goose Gossage's 3 1/3 innings 
of shutout relief Saturday was his longest appearance since Sept. 2, 1984, when 
he was a member of the San Diego Padres. . . . Tim Salmon went into Sunday's 
game batting .333, going 14 for 19 in the past four games. Two weeks ago, he 
was batting .232. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

HOLLYWOOD PARK; GONZALEZ CAPS RICH WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than two weeks into his career as a journeyman rider, Sal Gonzalez Jr. 
got the boost he needs this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours after riding Blues Traveller to an 11-1 upset in the Rolling 
Green Handicap at Golden Gate Fields, Gonzalez, 19, rode favored Del Mar Dennis 
in the $160,800 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap at Hollywood Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking like The Wicked North's main threat in the upcoming Californian and 
Hollywood Gold Cup, Del Mar Dennis battled with Thunder Rumble through some 
swift fractions, put the 1992 Travers winner away, surrendered the lead to 
Tinners Way in the stretch, then came back on to win by a half-length in 1:40 
2/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive victory and fifth in seven starts for the 
4-year-old Dixieland Band gelding. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way, last after a half-mile, got through inside Del Mar Dennis 
entering the stretch, took the lead but couldn't last while finishing three 
lengths ahead of 5-2 second choice Hill Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery Winner was fourth, followed by Thunder Rumble and Excavate, who hasn't 
won since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, this horse is going to be really good," said Gonzalez, 
who last rode as an apprentice on May 1. "He missed one workout (May 6) and he 
still ran great. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse was so fresh he just wanted to go and I couldn't relax him. 
Finally, at the three-eighths pole he relaxed, but it was too late for him to 
get any kind of real breather. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw (Tinners Way) down inside of me, I thought, 'Oops.' But this horse 
of mine, he just never gave up. Every time he runs, he keeps improving." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, Tinners Way's rider, thought his colt was on his way to his 
first victory in six American starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unlucky horse," he said. "He runs his eyeballs out every time and 
hooks horses like Megan's Interco and Del Mar Dennis who run the race of their 
lives."

 Michael Schumacher, the heir-apparent to Ayrton Senna as the dominant Formula 
One driver, capped a turbulent week with a victory in the Monaco Grand Prix at 
Monte Carlo on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from the pole, Schumacher led throughout to finish more than 35 
seconds ahead of Martin Brundle of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, who holds a big lead in the world championship standings with four 
victories in four races, said he competed only after overcoming self doubts 
brought on by the deaths of Senna and Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger two 
weeks ago at the Grand Prix of San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was sure what we should think about all this and how we should feel," 
he said. "For me, it was even to the point that I wasn't sure myself that I 
could continue racing like normal."

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; JAPAN'S MATSUDA DISCOVERS SUCCESS ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF PIT ROW CAMERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Can you imagine TV's Paul Page or Jack Arute behind the wheel of a car in next 
year's Indianapolis 500? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there is a precedent for it now. 
</P>
<P>
 Hideshi Matsuda's only experience at Indianapolis Motor Speedway before he 
became this year's first qualifier was as a pit reporter for a Japanese 
television station. He was here in 1992 and 1993 to follow the career of 
countryman Hiro Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew when I saw Indianapolis, it was what I wanted," Matsuda said through 
an interpreter. "In Japan, before Hiro, all everyone talked about was going to 
Europe and Formula One. I am happy I discovered Indy. This is the biggest 
thrill of my life." 
</P>

 Before rookie driver Scott Sharp could get out of his car after his successful 
qualifying attempt, he was asked for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 When he looked at the paper, it was a three-year contract to drive for 
PacWest. The autograph seekers were Bruce McCaw, PacWest Group president, and 
Tom Armstrong, general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be the most positive statement we could make of our 
confidence and pride in Scott," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's father, Bob Sharp, is a six-time Sports Car Club of America champion 
and was the car owner for actor Paul Newman's successful Trans-Am effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Villeneuve is so tired of hearing his French-Canadian name 
mispronounced that he issued a news release on how to say it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "VILL-nuv," not the "Vill-a-nuv" he hears so often. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there were an award for the best qualifying effort with the least 
preparation time, it would go to the versatile Stan Fox, who put Ron 
Hemelgarn's Reynard in the race at 222.867. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, a two-time winner of the Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix at Ascot Park, 
had only 10 laps in the car before taking the green flag for qualifying. The 
car was the last one off the assembly line at Reynard's racing shop in England 
and did not arrive at the Speedway until the day before qualifications began. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is it worth during the race to win the pole? Roberto Guerrero earned 
$286,378 by starting from the pole in 1992, even with a crash on the parade lap 
that gave him a 33rd-place finish. Last year, 33rd place paid $137,203 to Danny 
Sullivan. SHAV GLICK

GOLF ROUNDUP; DAVIES ROLLS IN LPGA WITH A BIG BACK NINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As she walked toward the first tee Sunday before the final round of the LPGA 
Championship, Laura Davies anticipated disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had been a great year, and I was just waiting for something to go wrong," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies won her second tournament in a row and the second major of her career, 
pulling away on the back nine en route to a three-under-par 68 and a 
three-stroke victory at Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies distanced herself from the field with birdies on Nos. 11, 12, 14 and 15 
at the DuPont Country Club. The Englishwoman finished at five-under 279. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dead nervous when I went out there today," she said. "I was pretty calm 
in the middle of the round, and after I made the birdie on 15, the last three 
holes seemed to take forever." 
</P>
<P>
 It was much worse for the rest of the field. After Davies' torrid stretch, the 
only remaining question was who would finish second. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Ritzman, bidding for her first victory in 402 events, bogeyed two of the 
first three holes but recovered to shoot a 70 for a 282. It was the eighth time 
she has finished second during her 17-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Crosby, Pat Bradley, Liselotte Neumann and Hiromi Kobayashi were at 
283. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neal Lancaster won the largest sudden-death playoff in the history of the PGA 
Tour, beating five others for the title in the storm-shortened GTE Byron Nelson 
Classic at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster won for the first time in his five years on the tour when he sank a 
four-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole at the TPC at Las Colinas. 
</P>
<P>
 He beat David Ogrin, Dave Edwards, rookie Yoshi Mizumaki, Tom Byrum and Mark 
Carnevale, all of whom completed one round on each of two rain-soaked courses 
in nine-under-par 132. The tournament was reduced to a 36-hole format after a 
series of rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-man field for the playoff was the largest in PGA Tour history -- 
five-man playoffs have been held seven times, the most recently last year -- 
and capped one of the tour's shortest tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first since the 1986 Pensacola Open to be cut by weather to 36 
holes, the minimum to be recognized as an official event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino birdied the final hole to complete a four-under-par 68 and a 
one-shot victory over Jim Colbert and Jimmy Powell in the PaineWebber 
Invitational at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 For two days, Trevino had labored over the final nine holes at the TPC at 
Piper Glen and managed even par. But he had two birdies there Sunday and 
finished with a three-day total of 13-under-par 203. 
</P>
<P>
 On the par-five 18th hole, Trevino hit a driver and a five-wood to reach the 
fringe, and he made a three-foot birdie putt for his third victory of the year.

 * Today's schedule: The section's 15 best teams will tee off at 8 a.m. at 
Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defending champion: Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Although Palm Desert's 56-dual match winning streak was broken by 
Santa Barbara San Marcos this season, the two-time defending champion Aztecs 
are again the favorites. They won the Eastern Regional by two strokes over Palm 
Springs, despite playing poorly, according to Coach Tim Kabeary. The Aztecs won 
their first title in 1992 on this course. Westlake, which finished fourth last 
season and returns with largely the same team, won the Northern Regional by two 
shots over San Marcos. Loyola and Newhall Hart tied for first in the Western 
Regional. La Verne Damien won the Central Regional by two shots over Long Beach 
Millikan, and Dana Hills won the Southern Regional by three over Huntington 
Beach. MARTIN BECK

GEORGE RAMOS: UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR 'HOMIES' IS G-DOG'S GOSPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I wrote last week about the gang-related trouble at a Downtown Cinco de 
Mayo celebration, a quote caught G-Dog's eye. It was from Armando Garza, who 
was so upset about gang rowdiness at such gatherings that he launched an 
emotional diatribe against Chicano gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate them," Garza told me. 
</P>
<P>
 G-Dog shook his head at that, because he thinks love and understanding, not 
hatred, are the ways to deal with gang members. They're human, too, he reasons. 
"That quote cut me like a knife," he recalls. "What is that all about? . . . 
Because what's happening to us when we can so distance ourselves from our 
darkness? When we're so distant in terms of being able to compassionately 
respond? 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gang members) hearing stuff like, 'You are an idiot,' 'I hate you,' is all 
they know. And to think that more of that will work with them is just insane." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the gospel of G-Dog, whose real name is never called out on the streets 
east of the L.A. River by the homies who know him. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the way G-Dog -- the Rev. Gregory J. Boyle -- likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Father Greg was in the back of my mind as I wrote of Garza's reactions to 
"punk cholos" because I knew what he would say. Unconditional love and an 
attempt to remedy the hopelessness and despair of street life are his solutions 
to the street gang disease. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, I was glad he is back, tending to his gang flock, and 
speaking out for them. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, the parishioners and neighbors of Dolores Mission Roman Catholic 
Church in Boyle Heights pleaded with Boyle's superiors to let the popular 
priest remain as pastor. As a Jesuit, he was completing six years at the 
parish, and it was time for a year's renewal -- something every member of his 
order must do before taking his final vows. 
</P>
<P>
 Many didn't want to contemplate life on the streets without him. "G-Dog 
understands us," the homies said, referring to the street moniker they gave the 
priest back in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But ever obedient, Father Greg left to pray, study and renew his commitment to 
God. He studied in Michigan. For a time, he was a chaplain at Folsom State 
Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, ready for his next assignment, he was prepared to go anywhere 
to do the Lord's bidding, but in January, his superiors sent him back to 
Dolores Mission. He had persuaded them that he could run a full-time gang 
ministry with the homies he knew so well around the Pico Gardens and Aliso 
Village public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 It is as if G-Dog never left. The homies still flock to him. The cops still 
mistrust him. And still, he never gives up hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a day that goes by where somebody is in my office or on the phone 
where I say this kid has taken a huge leap forward in terms of discovering a 
reason for staying alive," he says. "That's worth everything." 
</P>
<P>
 His message is the same one he embraced back in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that government officials have a healthy respect for the 
complexity of the gang problem," he sighs. "They should never lose sight of the 
fact that there are human beings involved. There is no single solution." 
</P>
<P>
 In a small storefront office on 1st Street, in neutral gang territory, Boyle 
works the phone to find jobs for his gang members through a church-affiliated 
program, Jobs for a Future. He also scrambles to find a wealthy donor who will 
put Homeboy Bakery on its feet. It's part of an ambitious plan to flood L.A. 
with pan dulce made by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't deterred by the financial bust a few years ago of a similar church 
venture to make and distribute Homeboy Tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 When he isn't talking bread, he is talking with his homies. 
</P>
<P>
 He affectionately calls them "mijo" and "mija" even if, as the kids say, they 
mess up, which means anything from doing drugs to carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives encouragement and love in between the telephone calls that 
continually interrupt him. He figures he racks up $700 a month in telephone 
bills, mainly because homies call him collect from wherever they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops understandably don't think much of Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
 They loudly voice the same suspicions they did during the time he was pastor 
of Dolores Mission, when they accused him of withholding information from 
Hollenbeck station officers about crimes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 His retort is typical G-Dog: "I didn't take my vows to the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Father Greg is so caught up in his work that he may not take the time to note 
that he turns 40 this week. "This gives me life," he says, looking over his 
storefront operation. "It keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 At work, he's just G-Dog. "Nobody calls me father," he tells me sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 I do. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's back, I can call him that to his face.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON WHY GUNS 
MUST GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK H. BORSCH, Frederick H. Borsch is bishop of the six-county 
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 21, David John Falconer, a 40-year-old choirmaster at St. James 
Episcopal Church and School in Hancock Park, was held up and shot to death at a 
convenience store on his way home from work -- just after this piece appeared 
in the diocesan newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old boy kills mom. I heard that news on the radio and could see 
tomorrow's headline. Or will it even make the headlines? The tragedies are now 
so frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the boy was waving around a handgun he was told was unloaded 
because the magazine had been removed. But there was still a bullet in the 
chamber. The gun went off. A mother is dead. A boy's life is ruined. A family 
is devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens over and over again: handgun crimes, accident, the angry grabbing 
of a gun in a family dispute, suicides. Three young boys are killed in Pasadena 
on Halloween when they were mistaken for gang members. Six are killed in an 
unemployment office, 13 in a post office, others in a law office, on a train, 
in a fast-food restaurant, in a school yard. More and more people are afraid to 
go out at night.  
</P>
<P>
 Guns give a sense of power. They can kill at a distance. One can kill people 
anonymously -- without even touching them. There can't be drive-by knifings or 
strangulations yet there are hundreds of drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 We still weep over the tragedy and loss of life in Vietnam. Yet in less than 
18 months there are more gun deaths in this country -- in our towns and streets 
and homes -- than all the deaths of U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War.  
</P>
<P>
 The economic costs to society are enormous. It is estimated that each gun 
death or injury costs us more than $300,000. Total costs are at least $20 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only part of it. If one adds up all the police, private security 
and other costs, the costs are surely more than $100 billion to protect 
ourselves from people with guns. So let's put more of these people into prison 
for much longer periods. Fine. But reckon that this costs more than $25,000 per 
person per year. (It would be cheaper to send them to a top-rated college!)  
</P>
<P>
 Many of us have heard the arguments against gun control over and again. It is 
said by some to be a matter of principle. The Second Amendment guarantees the 
right to bear arms, they claim. Yet it has been shown over and over again that 
the Second Amendment was only concerned with the right of the states to be free 
from federal interference.  
</P>
<P>
 What of the constitutional rights of the rest of us not to be afraid when we 
pull our car up to a stop sign or withdraw money from ATMs or knock on a 
neighbor's door?  
</P>
<P>
 The Bible tells us "Thou shalt not kill." The commandment especially means not 
to murder and certainly can be interpreted to mean not to allow murders that 
could be prevented. While some murders may be deterred by the widespread 
ownership of guns, many more result from the fact that there are now more than 
200 million firearms in the United States. And that's not counting weapons 
bought in the last few months by people reacting to changes in handgun laws. As 
a society, we are responsible and accountable to God for so many tragic deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Some voices of despair will say it is too late, that there are already too 
many guns. But we've got to start somewhere, and even beginning efforts would 
go a long way toward getting handguns and assault weapons out of the hands of 
teen-agers and out of our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be cheap at the price to buy up a lot of guns. No doubt there would 
be some kind of black market. But let's make it a black market. Let's make such 
guns much more expensive. And let's see if we cannot at least approach the 
success of other civilized countries where there are fewer guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has passed a ban on combat-style assault weapons to be included in a 
comprehensive crime bill. But we need to continue to write our political 
representatives. People of faith are the largest grass-roots organization in 
the world.

 In recent years, tough economic times have translated into a bleak job market 
for those graduating from college. But gains in the economy are expected to 
improve prospects for the class of '94. Below, some Southern California 
students share their views.  
</P>
<P>
 KAREN LINDELL 
</P>
<P>
 English major, 22, Mount St. Mary's 
</P>
<P>
 In today's job market, the initiative is more important rather than the 
degree, because so many people have degrees now. The volunteer work, and other 
experiences that you have are really more important; any kind of practical 
experience is what is going to help a graduate more than just having a degree. 
A diploma is definitely important, but I don't think that alone is a ticket to 
a job anymore. ASHLEY YI 
</P>
<P>
 Political science major, 30, USC 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for me, nothing is affected as a result of the economy. I have an 
ability to speak three different languages, a specialty in Southeast Asian 
languages. But if I did not have a language ability, I probably would be 
affected by the job market and I'd probably have to further my education 
through some professional school. AARON WILKES 
</P>
<P>
 Political science major, 25, USC 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of room for improvement in the economy. In the next few years, 
job opportunities are going to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I'm inclined to go to law school -- to allow for those 
opportunities to arise. SONIA DEL RIO 
</P>
<P>
 Political science and Chicano studies major, 22, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 For the career I want to get into, getting a job will be easy. I want to 
teach. For anyone else that's bilingual, things would be easier because it's in 
demand. In other careers, I don't think so. I have so many friends that already 
graduated and struggled and are still trying to find jobs. I don't think my 
degree is going to make a difference. If you asked me that question five years 
ago, I probably would have answered differently. But nowadays, you need to get 
a higher degree like a master's or you have to be be extremely lucky. You have 
to be in the right place at the right time to find a job. SUSIE CRABTREE 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast journalism major, 22, USC 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a little different because I'll have a journalism degree, so I might be a 
different type of student in entering the work force than someone who is 
getting a theory-based degree. I'm somewhat fortunate because I could find a 
job in journalism -- it just depends how low I want to be on the totem pole, if 
I want to accept a low salary or part-time work. I feel like I may be 
sacrificing because as a journalism major, you can't go out and get a 
high-paying job at first. I feel like the jobs are out there, but the problem 
is the reality of the jobs and the things you have to do at first. STEVE CORVI 
</P>
<P>
 Finance major, 23, Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 The economic situation is looking better, but still I think that now is a 
better time than any to further your degree with something like a master's. I'm 
in a situation where I will have my bachelor's (this spring), but I'm taking 
over a family business, so I'm not going to have to go out and get an advanced 
degree. If I did, I'd stay in school. JON REYES 
</P>
<P>
 Finance/real estate major, 22, Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't seem like too much is going on in Southern California. I'm getting 
a finance/real estate degree so I'm broadening my appeal -- by trying to take 
out a little extra insurance making sure that I'm as marketable as possible. 
Instead of going out and trying to get a job right out of school, I'll probably 
go back and get a master's in business administration.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has come a long way since Alice Stebbins 
Wells became the first woman to join its force in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if Wells was looking for guns and glory by signing on with the 
department, she got none. Instead, she was assigned to enforce the laws at 
dance halls, skating rinks, penny arcades and picture shows, according to the 
Los Angeles Police Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 It took generations, and a historic lawsuit filed in the mid-'70s by Sgt. 
Fanchon Blake, to finally give women in the LAPD equal opportunities. Even now, 
however, some women on the force say they are still fighting the battle for 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 But, there are 11,070 women in the LAPD, about 15% of the department, and the 
numbers keep growing. In today's Platform, some women who aspire to be officers 
talk about why they are attracted to police work and why it is important to 
have more women on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 According to applicant Rochelle Quinn of Rancho Cucamonga, women have to be a 
little more personable than men when doing police work. Women "bring different 
ideas to the police force on how to handle things," she asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees. "I have had the opportunity throughout my career to work 
with male officers every bit as sensitive as I was," says Capt. Margaret York, 
the highest ranking woman in the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 York believes that being a police officer is an ideal career for a woman and 
says "the opportunities have never been better for women."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite those opportunities, women still have barriers to knock down. "There 
certainly is a hostility to their presence and it is positively shocking to see 
this taking place," says Toni Carabillo, chapter adviser for the National 
Organization for Women. "Men seem to regard women as an intrusion into their 
turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman, disagrees. "I think that's not accurate. 
There is a place for women in policing and there's a place for men. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community has the right to expect that the Police Department is going to 
reflect the community at large," he says. "That's not just whites or blacks or 
Hispanics or Asians. It's women as well." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not, however, always easy to attain parity, as Nina Damianakes found out 
when she tried to join the elite SWAT unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The men in SWAT believe they're special, that not everyone can do what they 
do," she says. "So, if you have a woman as a SWAT officer that would just be 
horrible for them, because that would mean a woman could do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Damianakes won her fight last month to join the SWAT team but has not decided 
whether she will. Since forcing the issue, Damianakes says both she and her 
husband, Mike, a 25-year LAPD veteran, have been ostracized by their peers. But 
she loves police work and offers women officers some advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to have the respect of your peers and not to depend on men," 
Damianakes says. "If you want to be treated like an equal, you have to act like 
an equal. It's easy for men to treat you like a sister or daughter. Don't let 
them do your work for you."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
HOSPITAL WITHOUT WALLS: MOVING HEALTH CARE INTO THE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preventative care is critical to keeping health care costs down. But 
financial, cultural and language barriers often discourage the very people who 
need such services from getting attention before they end up in costly 
emergency rooms. To remedy this situation, Queen of Angels-Hollywood 
Presbyterian Medical Center in February, 1993, formed and financed a coalition 
with nearby churches and organizations. The result is the Greater Hollywood 
Health Partnership, which brings medical services to people at churches, senior 
centers and day-care operations. Volunteers from each organization form a 
"Health Cabinet" to assess what services are needed and plan events to reach 
their group's membership. Today the network has 21 congregational and agency 
members and serves more than 30,000 adults, children and seniors in Hollywood. 
The partnership has been so successful that the Los Angeles County Department 
of Health Services Public Health Programs this spring declared it a model for 
delivering health education and preventive services. In addition, the 
partnership is working with county officials and churches in other parts of Los 
Angeles including South-Central to create a similar program.

HEROES

<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in response to "Let's Bring Superman Back" (April 25). 
</P>
<P>
 As a child of the mid-1950s, I grew up with what most children today might 
consider "corny" heroes in my life.The memories of TV's Superman and Lone 
Ranger will always be a part of the foundation of my values of what is right 
and wrong. The picture of George Reeves as "Superman" brings back thoughts of a 
simpler time when my heroes stood for "truth, justice and the American way" in 
their purest forms. In a nostalgic way, I still hold him up as a champion of 
justice and good deeds, although I know he was a mere man playing a part in a 
television show. I've tried to instill the values of these old television 
heroes to my three children (ages 7 to 10) but their generation has its own set 
of "heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 I am comforted to see that my "corny" values aren't lost totally to a younger 
generation. The heroes of our youth will always be a part of our lives. I just 
hope they inspire us toward what is noble and positive, worthy of being 
remembered as a "hero."

 "Finding the dog park was a godsend. Gaia loves it here. She's hyper and needs 
a big place to run.I can sit here and enjoy the sun. You see different dogs 
that you've never seen before. Also, if you like animals but can't have one 
it's a great place to come because you can play with the dogs." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The dog park was created after Clyde Cicotte received a $267 ticket for having 
his dog off-leash. He founded the Long Beach Dog Park Committee and the park 
opened last year. Cicotte says there have been some pet-owner romances as well 
as several marriages. "Pretty soon their dogs are in love and so are they," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog park is located off 7th Street at Federation Drive in Recreation Park 
near the fly fishing casting pond. It is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.

 The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars appreciates the 
opportunity to respond to the Youth Opinion ("Affirmative Action Isn't 
Affirmative," May 2) by Michael D. Lewis, a political science major at Cal 
State L.A. We regret any confusion that may have occurred concerning a 
particular program initiative. Lewis was interested in an internship on Capitol 
Hill. The Washington Center welcomes the opportunity to assist him in applying 
for and possibly securing an internship in a congressional office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Center was established in 1975 to serve college students who 
seek internships in the nation's capital. Since its inception, more than 20,000 
students from various ethnic, cultural, religious, racial and economic 
backgrounds, from more than 750 colleges and universities, have participated in 
its programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific program initiative he mentioned is "Minorities in Congress." 
These internships provide minorities with a comprehensive training and 
educational experience that will serve as a steppingstone for careers in public 
service. With the California Department of Education, two respected foundations 
have provided scholarships for minority college students. Cal State schools are 
among those involved in this and other Washington Center programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies indicate that only 6.3% of high-level staff positions in 
Congress are occupied by minorities. Placing students on Capitol Hill will help 
increase the number of minority staff members and result in a work force that 
is a true reflection of society. Each semester, however, 30 to 50 non-minority 
and minority students are interning on Capitol Hill through the Washington 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of scholarships exist that are by no means limited to minorities. 
These include general scholarships awarded on the basis of financial need and 
merit.  
</P>
<P>
 The center is known for providing internships tailored to each student's area 
of interest. A congressional internship is just one placement area. Students 
seek internships through the center because of the academic quality and close 
supervision. Our programs enable students to receive academic credit for their 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 For students who cannot be away for a semester, we offer one- and two-week 
academic seminars designed to study specific issues in depth.  
</P>
<P>
 We encourage Mr. Lewis to apply for an internship with The Washington Center. 
He can be assured his application will be considered according to the standards 
applied to all applicants.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; A 
DAY IN THE LIFE OF ONE SUBSTITUTE TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE SMITH EWING, Anne Smith Ewing has been a substitute teacher in Los 
Angeles, Long Beach, Whittier and Bakersfield. She retired a few years ago from 
a full-time teaching job at Eastlake Juvenile Hall in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SCENE I: Classroom in any Southern California public high school, any morning. 
Substitute enters, trying to appear poised, casual and very together. The 
school secretary has given her an instruction sheet that informs her the 
classes she is to teach are titled "Greater Ed." Before the first class bell 
rings, substitute checks her face, hair, hose. She cannot find roll book, 
seating chart, lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell rings. Students enter, melt, drag, float into room. A few jump in through 
the windows. On seeing the "sub," there is much exchanging of seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Students: "Where is our teacher Mr. Johnson?" 
</P>
<P>
 Substitute: "Mr. Johnson is desperately ill. I will help you with your 
studying today." 
</P>
<P>
 Students: Moans. Groans. Then each gathers supplies for "Greater Ed." -- 
spitballs, paper airplanes, Fritos, nail polish, rubber bands, combs, sunflower 
seeds, etc. Then they all chant in chorus: 
</P>
<P>
 "Rooty, toot, toot! Rooty, toot, toot! 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get rid of this substitute. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Substitute: Silently prays to Madonna, patron saint of teen-agers. Continues 
to search desk for roll and study plans. In lower drawer, she finds half-empty 
bottle of Chivas Regal, a file of comic books, and a dismantled Uzi. She closes 
drawer, then smiles confidently at class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today there is dawning another blue day, 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, say, shall we let it slip uselessly away?" 
</P>
<P>
 Students: "Let's! Right On!" 
</P>
<P>
 Substitute: "I cannot locate the roll book. Will you please sign in on this 
paper that I will have passed around?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the paper is returned, she is amazed to discover that Mickey Mouse, 
Tiffany, Magic Johnson, the Easter Bunny and Hilary Clinton are in class. The 
sheet is also spattered with local gang signs. Having no assignment to give 
this group of groupies, the sub takes an educated guess and invents one. 
"Today, you will write an essay on 'Greater Ed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Time Fortunately Marches On  
</P>
<P>
 SCENE II: The substitute is writing her "end-of-day" report to be turned in to 
the school secretary. She is now frizzled, frazzled, frenzied. "Who or what is 
'Greater Ed.' " No one there has been able to inform her; in fact, this is 
their day to be uninformative to strange substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluation of Substitute's Day by Evaluators in Ascending Order of Importance: 
 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators: They are not on school campus. They are at the local Education 
Center in conference. Brows are furrowed. Discussion involves curriculum, 
behavior. "Is Red Riding Hood too red for formative minds?" . . . "When I was 
in school, rapping was . . ." They finally begin chanting, "Meaningful 
dialogue, Meaningful dialogue, Meaningful dialogue, $$$$$ . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Principal: "Old Bag that took Ed Johnson's classes did ( ) or did not () keep 
apes from climbing walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning Teacher Johnson: "Well, kids, we've lost time, a lot of time . . . " 
To himself, " I wonder how much more sick leave I can fake?"

THE BEST INVESTMENT OF THEM ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the next five years, state officials predict that California's K-12 
public school population will grow by nearly 1 million students. At that rate, 
according to the governor's Office of Child Development and Education, "19 new 
classrooms (almost an average elementary school) need to be built in California 
each day, including weekends and holidays, for the next six years to 
accommodate the increased enrollment." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an astonishing statistic. But it's all the more stunning when one 
considers the state of disrepair of the state's existing schools -- more than 
half of which were constructed more than 30 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 To help address these pressing needs, voters should approve the Safe Schools 
Act, Proposition 1B, on the June 7 ballot. A "yes" vote on 1B would make 
available $1 billion in bond monies to pay for construction, reconstruction and 
modernization projects at elementary and secondary schools across California.  
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 1B is approved it will benefit Southern California counties 
like Riverside and San Bernardino, which have the highest per-pupil growth 
rates in the state. In addition, the money would help ease overcrowding in 
urban school districts like Los Angeles Unified and Orange County's Santa Ana 
School District. Renovation monies would be a big boost for smaller districts 
too, like Pleasant Valley in Ventura County, which is in dire need of such 
funds. Funds from 1B would also be used to make schools safer in earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 California's children deserve the best. Wise investments in their education 
today will mean a work force better able to meet the challenges of a high-tech 
economy in 21st-Century California. We urge a "yes" vote for Proposition 1B.

NATIONAL LABS: SUN HAS SET ON THE DAY OF COMPETITION; COORDINATION OF EFFORTS 
MUST MARK THESE VITAL FACILITIES IN THE 1990S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have argued that the federal government's huge investment in scientific 
talent and equipment at the national laboratories should be preserved, even 
though the end of the Cold War means the labs must shrink and must shift in 
mission. However, that leaves the question of how best to maintain a latent 
ability to design thermonuclear weapons in case of some future threat. Clearly, 
no more such weapons are needed now, and that is cause for celebration -- but 
we cannot entirely relax the nuclear guard. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost half a century, the U.S. nuclear weapons program benefited from 
intense rivalry between the two labs that did the main design work -- Los 
Alamos in New Mexico's desert and Lawrence Livermore, a mile-square patch in 
California's Livermore Valley east of Oakland. Both are managed for the 
Department of Energy by the University of California. Both dearly want to keep 
a strong hand in weapons work. Both know that the flush days of Cold War and 
Star Wars are over. Their 10,000 scientists and engineers are desperately 
seeking to shift into non-defense work that trades on their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to the remaining weapons work, the time for competition, 
redundancy and overlap is past. The labs should put aside past rivalries -- 
which were based on bitter animosities between two famous physicists, J. Robert 
Oppenheimer at Los Alamos and Edward Teller at Livermore -- and seek to 
complement each other. Some have argued that this rivalry helped fuel the Cold 
War. True or not, today they should stress their own strengths and share 
facilities where possible. Los Alamos is strong in high-performance computing 
and metallurgy, for example; Livermore in laser technology. Such cooperation is 
all the more important now that nuclear weapons cannot be tested, meaning that 
the labs must rely on computer and laboratory simulations. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been suggestions that the weapons work be consolidated at one lab 
or the other. For political and practical reasons, this would probably mean 
giving all weapons work to Los Alamos, near the Sandia National Laboratory, 
which does the engineering for the weapons. This would leave Livermore free to 
work on environmental cleanup and other non-military projects. One backer of 
consolidation, Rep. George E. Brown (D-Colton), chairman of the House Science, 
Space and Technology Committee, has shifted. His committee recently reported 
out a bill to redefine the labs' missions and to eliminate duplication of 
weapons efforts. Los Alamos director Siegfried S. Hecker also wants redundancy 
eliminated and says that there is plenty of work for the three labs in 
safeguarding existing nuclear weapons and preventing nuclear terrorism and 
proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidation is appealing on the surface but presents many complications. One 
top Livermore official argues this would be like pulling out the heart and 
expecting the animal to live, that weapons work has been the driving force 
behind Livermore's excellence. Beyond that, weapons design without testing puts 
a premium on Livermore's Nova Laser Facility, the world's largest laser. It 
simulates the fusion energy released in a thermonuclear explosion. Livermore 
has made a strong pitch for a proposed new $800-million super laser, to serve 
the dual purpose of weapons simulation and research on fusion energy -- the 
ultimate source of peacetime power, unlimited and nearly pollution-free. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision by the Department of Energy is not expected until late next 
year. But Secretary Hazel O'Leary clearly favors Livermore over Sandia and the 
Nevada test site. "If we go forward, it has to be Livermore," she said in an 
interview, adding: "Some of our best nuclear physicists are at Livermore. I do 
not believe we should break up a core team, nor throw away equipment. . . . 
These are not military bases." 
</P>
<P>
 A special outside commission appointed by O'Leary is examining the future of 
the labs. Congress and the White House are also likely to have their say, and 
politics will certainly intervene. The decision on restructuring the labs is 
fraught with implications both for national defense and American industrial 
prowess. We oppose keeping these scientists and technicians working just to 
maintain their jobs and labs. But policy-makers must use care to balance 
continuing military needs with new civilian missions.

THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD; WORKPLACE NO-SMOKING BILL KEEPS MOVING UP A STEEP 
GRADE IN LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 99, the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act, is at risk of 
becoming a victim of its own tremendous success in getting Californians to stub 
out their cigarettes. It is threatened by the state's grinding budget squeeze, 
particularly by shortfalls in programs that deliver medical care to children 
and the poor. But the Legislature can keep alive the anti-smoking momentum that 
Proposition 99 generated; to do so it must enact strong new laws to protect 
nonsmokers from smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99 hiked the sales tax on a pack of cigarettes by 25 cents and 
dedicated this revenue to several chronically underfunded services, including 
medical and hospital care for the poor, tobacco-related disease research and 
prevention and fire prevention. The most controversial of these have been 
smoking cessation and prevention programs. The proposition earmarked 20% of 
total tax revenue for the Health Education Account (HEA), the initiative's 
heart. The HEA has bankrolled the state's highly effective media campaign, 
which includes pointed ads on television and radio to persuade smokers to quit 
and nonsmokers not to start. So successful have these programs been that the 
number of California smokers has dropped 27% since 1988, three times the 
national rate of decline.  
</P>
<P>
 But that success has cost the state. Lower cigarette sales mean less 
Proposition 99 revenue and, in turn, less for maternal and child health care, 
for example. As a result, legislators and Gov. Pete Wilson have raided the HEA 
to support these services. At first they diverted a small share of the 20% 
funding earmarked for anti-smoking education, and did so reluctantly. But 
recently many lawmakers of good conscience have resigned themselves to 
supporting diversion of a larger share of HEA funds. From which other state 
account, they plaintively ask, can we fund care for the poor or disease 
prevention?  
</P>
<P>
 The continuing diversion of HEA funds is regrettable, if seemingly 
unavoidable, but the gains against cigarette smoking, a proven cause of cancer, 
need not be lost. The best strategy, in our opinion, is passage of AB 13, which 
would make smoking illegal in most workplaces throughout the state. The "No 
Smoking Permitted" signs that would appear on the walls of offices, factories 
and shops would do much to unhook California smokers and keep others from 
lighting up. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 13 is this legislative session's Little Engine That Could; to the amazement 
of many, it is now close to final approval despite opposition from the powerful 
tobacco industry lobby. Senators who nearly killed it in March may now back 
off, and the bill, tougher than a similar measure now before Congress, faces 
its last committee test in Sacramento this week. This legislation must pass.

CONTROVERSY OVER 'ZOOT SUIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am disturbed by the policy that the Grossmont Union High School District has 
for teachers who want to show R-rated films in the classroom ("Teacher Is 
Ousted Over Movie Plan," May 4). While a policy is necessary, Grossmont 
requires too many steps that discourage teachers from using innovative films to 
augment lessons. Ironically, the parents of those students directly involved 
are not part of the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiko Obata obtained parental approval from each student when she planned to 
show "Zoot Suit" to her English classes. To demand that she have the principal, 
English department head, and a district council review the film and approve her 
decision has negative implications. The policy implies: 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers are not professionals. They cannot determine how to augment the 
curriculum for their students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only a district committee can determine what materials are appropriate for 
all students at all schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents don't have the right to approve what takes place in their children's 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a shame that the Grossman Union High School District bows to the threat 
of a few outspoken zealots and limits the creativity of teachers who develop 
innovative lessons for their students. 
</P>

 I too am a teacher and have been a long-term substitute as well. I take 
offense to the myopic remarks made by the suspended substitute teacher Reiko 
Obata of Santana High in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ignorant racial remarks were inappropriate and unprofessional. "I think 
this is discrimination," said Obata. "I don't think they would do this to a 
white teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 You're mistaken, Ms. Obata. An order is a direct order. Quit whining about 
your feelings of discrimination. Grow up and accept the meaning of "no" from a 
superior who felt that the showing of "Zoot Suit," an inflammatory, violent 
film, rated R, was not good enough for the Grossmont School District.

GENETIC BASIS FOR GENOCIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your editorial, "Genocide and Genes" (May 8), you argue that genocide is a 
" 'natural' action" and that humans, like lower primates, "have a collective 
capacity for genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 If this tendency is indeed a part of our genetic endowment, then its 
universality as a behavior should be present in all cultures. Clearly it is 
not. Granted, 17 genocides between 1950 and 1990 is horrific, but this ugly 
statistic does not prove that genes played any role in the course of these 
events. What is needed is a close examination of the crucial historical, 
social, and psychological dimensions driving a society toward genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all genocides, like most wars, are group decisions, made by usually 
rational, though totally immoral men. (Incidentally, do females also carry this 
genetic tendency? If so, where is their representation?) The social, economic 
and political upheavals, the values and goals of superiority and power, the 
acceptance of violence, the fears and insecurities, the historical prejudices 
and racism, and the culture's strong obedience to authority are key factors 
common to most genocides. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, scientists and philosophers have used the "human nature" 
argument to provide explanations and/or justifications for every human ill, 
from slavery and conquest to the inequality of women. Until your research 
biologist, Jared Diamond, isolates the "genocide gene," I'll continue to 
believe that mass murder, like war, is a planned group behavior that can one 
day be eradicated by humanity. Our destiny is in our hands, not in our genes. 
</P>
<P>
 EDWARD MARKARIAN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Your editorial underlines the difficulties of drawing inferences concerning 
human nature from the behavior of other animal species. First, you do an 
injustice to the chimpanzee. While it is true that bands of chimpanzees have 
been observed to exterminate rival bands, this is far from a common occurrence. 
The challenge for the student of primate behavior is to determine and specify 
the conditions under which this extreme, relatively unusual behavior occurs. 
While chimpanzee bands may not welcome strangers and may pursue them, the 
conflicts are usually resolved without resort to "genocidal" acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that humans engage in far more destruction of their 
own species than do chimpanzees or other mammals. Humans, of course, also 
manifest much loving and cooperative behavior in interacting with different 
groups. While we can learn much about the human species from the evolution and 
behavior of other animal species, we need to look to those attributes 
(language, self-awareness, culture) that are peculiar to Homo sapiens for the 
source and mitigation of acts of genocide. 
</P>

<P>
 As long as we continue to tell our children "you are black" or "you are 
white," "you are Christian" or "you are Jewish," "you are American" or "you are 
Russian," there will continue to be attempted genocides. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when all the world's children are raised as humans, disregarding color, 
culture, country and creed, will Homo sapiens be able to overcome this tragic 
quirk of evolutionary adaptation.

CAL-MORTGAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been involved with the Cal-Mortgage program since its inception and I 
have read all the articles Irene Wielawski has written about it over the past 
few months (most recently, May 1 and 4). The articles were factual and well 
researched based on my experiences with Cal-Mortgage.The Triad Healthcare and 
Community Adult Care Centers of America financings, in my opinion, never should 
have taken place and it is difficult to believe they did receive Cal-Mortgage 
approval and insurance. I am concerned the reaction to the articles might 
adversely affect the program as a whole. I sincerely believe the program has 
benefited both the institutions that were financed and the people they serve. 
Without the program some of the services now available would not be there. The 
program has not outlived its usefulness as some people claim.  
</P>
<P>
 I am acquainted with many of the Cal-Mortgage staff and they are, in my 
opinion, dedicated, knowledgeable and conscientious. I hope they, and the 
program, will continue to function and serve the people of California for many 
years.

COMING HOME TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We're home again and glad to be back. In 1990 my husband and I made a decision 
to leave Los Angeles.I must admit I talked him into it. I had enough, it got 
bad enough. Smog, crime, crowds, traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll go to the real land of sunshine, blue skies, lush greenery, warm climate 
and a peaceful way of life. Off to south Florida -- Miami, of course. There, I 
told him, we won't see any more brown trees, no more itchy eyes and throats, 
we'll be free of the San Diego and Santa Monica freeways, and best of all, free 
from the "it's who you know restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, when we experienced evacuation during Hurricane Andrew in August, 1992, 
we began to wonder; when our toenails began to curl from the 90% humidity most 
of the year, we wondered more; and when the choice of restaurants came down to 
who had the best bagels, and finally we were afraid to buy gas anywhere after 6 
p.m., for fear of being shot, we went from wondering to pondering. How could we 
have jumped ship? What I wouldn't give to have the traffic jams, smog, crowds 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is so special, with its earthquakes, floods, wonderful creative 
restaurants, spectacular mountains, beautiful people, creative energy and the 
shared caring of our dear and loving friends. Let's go home, I said, and so we 
did. And he didn't even say "I told you so."

ON THE SMOKY SIDE OF THE STREET; SMOKING: LAWS WON'T CURE THE CRAVING. HOW 
ABOUT GOVERNMENT-FUNDED QUIT CLINICS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORETTA SCHERZ KELLER, Loretta Scherz Keller is a writer in Altadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a smoker-quitter-smoker-again, I'd say it's time to throw some cold facts 
on the smoldering issue and try to keep emotion out of it for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact One: Smoking releases endorphins -- those mind-boggling kinetic chemicals 
that most of us seek in our daily lives to get through this absurd world. 
That's even in the quit-smoke literature. It's what makes cigarettes 
pleasurable and addictive -- excuse me, "habit-forming," as the industry moguls 
prefer to say. Those fortunate enough can get their small doses of daily 
doldrum-relief through healthful substitutes such as hard exercise. But what 
about the rest of us? 
</P>
<P>
 Fact Two: Those least likely to succeed in quitting smoking are women over 50 
who live alone. Women smokers outnumber men smokers. Women over 50 are 
particularly prone to such physically limiting diseases as arthritis -- 10 
times more, in fact, than men over 50. Few women over 50 who live alone and 
aren't well are content enough to quit. Ask the "quit pros." It could justly be 
said, therefore, that a national anti-smoking law would place inordinate stress 
on that group. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact Three: No law can make a smoker just stop. There has to be desire and it 
has to come from a deep-down subconscious place. Not even the surgeon general's 
warning, not even a doctor's personal advice, is enough without that decisive 
subliminal will. I know. I've quit twice for extended periods. So all a law 
will do is pronounce me and most of the 46 million people like me outlaws.  
</P>
<P>
 Fact Four: Yes, there is overwhelming evidence that smoking is a health 
hazard, and it's probable that second-hand smoke is too. Do the anti-smoking 
forces think we smokers don't care? 
</P>
<P>
 I'd urge government to gather some statistics before issuing commands that 
can't always be obeyed and punishments that may be unjust. How much second-hand 
smoke in how small an enclosed space over how long a time is likely to be how 
much of a health hazard? Picasso lived into his 90s on three packs a day. 
George Burns is rarely photographed without a cigar in his mouth. What about 
the people who lived with them -- all people who live with smokers? Are there 
studies? What do they show? To rant and rave without such knowledge is what 
makes the stop-smoking campaign seem like a witch hunt.  
</P>
<P>
 The government should fund ongoing stop-smoking clinics -- all across the 
country -- with all taxpayers' dollars, not just smokers' dollars. Without such 
clinics, the proposal to finance sweeping health-care reform with smokers' 
taxes is unjust. Aren't smokers entitled to health care, too? 
</P>
<P>
 And there's Fact Five: More than half the smokers who quit in any clinic will 
revert to smoking in a short time. There needs to be ongoing help for a couple 
of years at least before passing sweeping legislation that may even be 
unconstitutional. That should be a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 To prefer a smoke-free environment is understandable. But if the majority 
demands it, they should be willing to contribute to its cost. Smokers are 
already victims.

PERSPECTIVE ON RUSSIAN POLITICS; CAN SOLZHENITSYN BREAK A DEADLOCK?; HE WILL NO 
DOUBT BE A POWERBROKER, AND HIS MODERATE NATIONALISM CAN TAKE CARE OF THE 
NEO-FASCISTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn is about to end his 20-year exile and return to his 
native Russia. "I hope I can be at least of some help to my tormented nation," 
he recently told a town meeting in Cavendish, Vt. Many in his homeland harbor 
similar hopes. The desperate conditions Russia faces today make his entry into 
politics not only feasible but also desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 The political process in today's Russia is hopelessly deadlocked. It is 
immaterial who is heading the government, for the state currently has no power 
to carry out a coherent policy or enforce its decrees. A recent proof is Boris 
Yeltsin's embarrassing failure to block the release from prison of his 
political foes. But the ultra-patriots have failed to capitalize on Yeltsin's 
weakness. As Yeltsin's ratings slip, so do Vladimir Zhirinovsky's. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic situation in the country remains gloomy. Political pressure 
compels government to step up subsidies to money-losing enterprises. 
Cross-breeding between state bureaucracies and organized crime is proceeding 
apace. Private companies add little to the nation's manufacturing capabilities 
and are tied primarily to service, inflation-driven financial speculation and 
dumping raw materials on world markets. Those entrepreneurs who are willing to 
invest in production are saddled with taxes on profit exceeding 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's patience is strained to the limit. Workers in state enterprises 
go for months without pay and see their salaries devoured by inflation. 
Although retirees have their pensions indexed to inflation, they are doomed to 
subsist close to the poverty line. All vital indicators -- crime, ecological 
calamities, increasing suicide rates, negative population growth -- point to a 
country in distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearning for a bold leader and a powerful state has never been stronger in 
Russia. Calls for law and order are heard not only from the red-brown 
(communists/ultranationalists) alliance but also from labor, business and the 
clergy. Even some liberal politicians wonder if market mechanisms alone would 
suffice to bring a viable market economy and functioning democracy to Russia. 
Once firmly opposed to authoritarian rule, Russian liberals now mull over the 
"Chilean model" and remind themselves that Augusto Pinochet brought in American 
economists to restore his country's market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the backdrop against which we must view Solzhenitsyn's possible entry 
into Russia's politics. Can he assume the strongman's mantle? Should the West 
fear him as a new Ayatollah Khomeini or welcome his as a bulwark against 
Russian fundamentalism? While he is unlikely to run for a public office, 
Solzhenitsyn is certain to use his authority to break the country's stalemate. 
Hence, the need to take a closer look at his statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn's critics charge that he disdains the West, overstates Russia's 
uniqueness and espouses veiled anti-Semitism. He has strenuously denied such 
charges. Moreover, he pointedly refused to endorse pseudo-patriotic factions 
that fan hatred in Russia. Solzhenitsyn criticized the West for its litigious 
ways and pursuit of unlimited economic growth, but he has never favored 
autocracy over democracy or renounced Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 In domestic politics, Solzhenitsyn comes across as a regionalist. An admirer 
of Switzerland's canton system, he wants to see Moscow delegate as much power 
as possible to local administrations. Solzhenitsyn's foreign policy would block 
efforts to restore the Russian empire and encourage a loose federation of 
Slavic states emerging from the gradually renewed ties between Russia and its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the economic sphere, Solzhenitsyn urges a shift from unsustainable economic 
expansion to the post-industrial agenda combining a controlled growth, 
environmentally sound development and concern for the economically 
disadvantaged. Since his days in the gulag, Solzhenitsyn has harbored contempt 
for professional criminals and is certain to clamp down on organized crime, 
which intimidates local producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn's social policies are more problematic. His moral rigorism, 
contempt for mass culture and orthodox religious convictions make Western-style 
liberals wonder if he will tolerate alternative lifestyles and show sensitivity 
toward religious minorities. He may be uneasy about feminism and have little 
taste for rock music, but that does not mean he will use state power to impose 
his personal preferences on others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wishful thinking to paint Solzhenitsyn as Russia's would-be savior. 
Still, we need to lay out scenarios for the future that could alleviate human 
suffering. Given the current deadlock in Russia, Solzhenitsyn is bound to 
emerge as a power-broker, and his impact on his nation's politics could be 
positive. His moderate nationalism is sure to cut the neo-fascists down to 
size. His foreign policy would be welcomed by the West. Even his puritanism 
might be what Russia's nascent capitalism needs to legitimize itself in the 
public mind. At 75, Solzhenitsyn has no time to waste.

CAMPAIGN '94 / L.A. COUNTY; CRIME IS DOWN, FEAR IS UP: WHAT SHOULD A SHERIFF 
DO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Rip Rense for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times posed the following question to six candidates for Los Angeles 
County sheriff: 
</P>
<P>
 Crime statistics are down, but people seem to be more fearful for their safety 
than ever. What is it you would like us to know or understand better about law 
enforcement?  
</P>
<P>
 GIL CARRILLO has 22 years as an L.A. County deputy sheriff; he started the 
first plainclothes gang unit in East L.A. and co-led the 'Night Stalker' 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 When you watch the TV news at 4 p.m., the first 10 to 15 minutes are simply 
violence -- not only locally, but all over the United States. So people see 
this and tend to believe that it's happening everywhere. Certainly a man going 
nuts on a train in New York is not going to have one bit of impact on the 
citizens here, on their safety. People have to know that we're concerned with 
what is happening here in Los Angeles County; we have to alleviate their fears 
and go on a marketing blitz or a positive campaign to show them what the 
Sheriff's Department is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a teen-ager, on the corner with the rest of the young boys in my 
neighborhood, there was a deputy sheriff who helped me. He helped me graduate 
from high school, talked me into going in the service at 17. That wasn't 
called, back then, "community policing." That was just good old-fashioned 
police work. Now we just want to get back to that. I want to give back what was 
given to me a long time ago. TAB RHODES has been an L.A. County sheriff's 
deputy for five years, and has worked as a radio talk-show host on KIEV. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's department personnel, as well as law-enforcement personnel 
throughout the county, have become handcuffed by either political overreaction 
or overreaction of management and through a general feeling of low morale. 
</P>
<P>
 If we feel we are being left out there alone to hang for whatever may occur, 
you're going to find that police are going to stop being preventive, stop being 
proactive and they're just going to respond to calls. 
</P>
<P>
 An awful lot of people have told me straight out, "We've become firemen." It 
used to be that we drove down a dark alley looking for drug sales. It used to 
be we'd drive up to a group of gang members and try to disperse them. Now we 
get a call, we go and respond to the call. We react rather than prevent. 
</P>
<P>
 The community has to really get behind their law enforcement. And we in law 
enforcement have to improve and come back from an image that has been tarnished 
in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 My biggest opponent is not Sheriff Sherman Block. It's apathy. People are not 
concerned -- they say they are, but they're not genuinely concerned about crime 
until it affects them directly.  
</P>
<P>
 I would like to bring a whole new positive image into law enforcement. In a 
candidate forum the other day, someone brought up the 21 deputies that were 
indicted in a drug scandal. Well, we need to get people to stop thinking about 
those 21 people and focus on the 6,000 that were out there protecting them last 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now we need an awful lot of support. There are not enough 
law-enforcement officers out there. We're going to need the support of the 
community more than ever. JOHN STITES has been an L.A. County sheriff's deputy 
for 13 years and currently holds the rank of sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime issue is not as serious as people think. Any crime is a problem, but 
crime is down. Some people are using it as a basis to further their political 
careers.  
</P>
<P>
 The major issue is the budget. In our department, we're looking at a 
$300-million to $400-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of crime depends on how much the public is willing to get involved 
in assisting law enforcement.  
</P>
<P>
 First, you have to go to each community. The law-enforcement needs of the 
public are decided by the public. They know what crime problem angers them the 
most. And we educate them by letting them know how we can address that within 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contract cities (where deputies patrol in lieu of a local police 
department), it's a little bit more difficult, because they have their own 
governing bodies that are supposed to address that issue. In the unincorporated 
areas, the areas that we pretty much cast aside, they get the least police 
services, and when the cuts come, they are always the first to be affected. 
They just don't have an opportunity to get involved. They have very little 
representation, because they're represented by the Board of Supervisors, and 
you know as well as I do that it's very difficult to get any supervisor rowing 
in your direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Department morale is the other thing I would like to address. Because of some 
management policy decisions, we've got people out there who are basically 
punching the clock. They're wearing the tan and green, they're getting in their 
cars, but they've lost their desire. Morale is so low. 
</P>
<P>
 People are unaware they can vote in a sheriff's election. If they live in 
Montebello, or Burbank, for instance, they have their own law-enforcement 
agency. They say,"Hey, we don't vote for the sheriff." They don't recognize the 
authority and the power that the sheriff has, or that he should be using, to 
better the county's law-enforcement services. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had just three sheriffs since 1932. They homestead and pass it along. 
There has to be a term limitation on that office. ROBERT IRMAS was an L.A. 
County sheriff's deputy from 1972 to 1980; he is currently a judgepro tem for 
the L.A. Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department, although one of the major social institutions in the 
community by way of its employees and its budget, is virtually an unknown in 
the county community. It is, in fact, an extremely closed shop. In the 1960s 
and '70s, the LAPD was the bad boy on the block, and they were taking their 
licks; the Sheriff's Department, for the most part, avoided that type of public 
scrutiny. Now, in the '80s and '90s, things have changed. We've had a series of 
extremely bad shootings in the last several years, we've had the Kolts 
Commission (a July, 1992, report on Sheriff's Department policies), and the 
fact is that the relationship between law-enforcement agencies and the public 
has changed dramatically in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the second-year report of the Kolts Commission states that there have 
not been some very needed, significant changes in the department. The morale of 
the line law-enforcement officers is as low as it's ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that the feeling between the public and law enforcement has gotten a 
lot better, vis-a-vis the LAPD. Sherman Block is part of the Daryl Gates-Ira 
Reiner generation, and I think people will be happier if they can elect new 
leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 I think the crime statistics are skewed. The incidents per 100,000 population 
may be down, but the crimes that are being committed are more ruthless, more 
violent, more mindless. You go home and your front door is open and your TV is 
gone and your stereo is gone and your silver is gone -- that's the story 10 
years ago. Now you come home and your TV and your stereo and your silver is 
gone, but they're waiting for you to come home so they can take your car keys, 
beat the snot out of you, assault your wife and kidnap your kid. So the fact is 
that the numbers may be down, but the brutality and violence connected with 
crime are going up. ROBERT H. LEWIS JR. has been with the Metropolitan Transit 
Police for more than 12 years; he's currently a sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that crime is down. What they don't show is the change in 
lifestyle that citizens in our community are making. People are a little more 
cautious. They're staying home more because of our crime problem and fear of 
crime. Over a period of many years, we've created a situation where instead of 
us feeling that the police or Sheriff's Department is there to serve and 
protect the community, we treat a lot of the community as if they need to serve 
us. And we need to change that attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the people see that we're trying to become better, I think they'll accept 
us more. Right now, instead of looking at us as the savior, a lot of our 
citizens fear the Sheriff's Department as much as they fear the criminals on 
the street. It shouldn't be like that. I'm a cop. I have a badge in my pocket. 
If I didn't, I would have a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I was stopped by a sheriff's deputy about a year ago. I was in my car, a nice 
car, and as soon as he stopped me, I showed my badge and he was respectful and 
nice and we talked about law enforcement. I had just pulled out of a store, and 
he swooped on me maybe a half-block away. He said the store has been robbed a 
lot, and I fit the description, so that's why he pulled me over. Fit the 
description of a robbery suspect!  
</P>
<P>
 Being a black American, I shouldn't have to carry a badge in my pocket to not 
be messed with by law enforcement. What if I didn't have a badge? Do I have to 
sit on a curb? Do I have to have my car searched? And you have to understand 
that in South-Central L.A., in certain areas, that's a way of life. You go try 
that in Devonshire, and you're not going to get away with it. Simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
 So yes, there is a problem, and I would like to address this problem and make 
a change for the better. SHERMAN BLOCK has been Los Angeles County Sheriff 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The single most debilitating affliction in our community today is the fear of 
crime. It has caused individuals to make changes in their daily routines. It 
has caused businesses to reorder their priorities, and it has even caused 
government to reorder its priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that statistics indicate that crime is down slightly over the past 
year I don't think is any indication that the threat has been reduced. I think 
that the reduction is due primarily to citizens avoiding situations where they 
might otherwise become victims. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are going to deal with the kind of crime that is generating this level 
of fear -- primarily the fear of violence, particularly street violence and 
random violence -- the only way to repress that kind of crime is with adequate 
resources on the streets of the community. And of course, over the last several 
years, this community has suffered greatly from a lack of adequate 
law-enforcement resources. When we have been forced to mobilize to deal with 
specific situations, be it an earthquake, Rodney King trial or anything else, 
the result has been a repression of random violence in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 If people want to measure the impact of crime on our community, looking at 
statistics is not going to give you the true picture. The accurate measure is 
the presence or absence of fear. And even with the reduction in crime 
represented by a couple of percentage points, I don't think the presence of 
fear has been reduced one iota over the last several years.

UNSER JR. GETS WISH, SUN SMILES; INDY 500: HIS COOL-WEATHER SPEED OF 228.011 
M.P.H. ON SATURDAY HOLDS UP TO WIN POLE AS WARM TEMPERATURES SLOW FITTIPALDI, 
SEVEN OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr. survived the challenges Sunday of former Indy 500 and Formula One 
world champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Mario Andretti to secure the pole 
position for the 78th Indianapolis 500 on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser drove four laps at 228.011 m.p.h. Saturday in one of Roger Penske's 
Mercedes-Benz-powered cars, but had to sweat out qualifying runs by eight 
drivers who were unable to drive on opening day because of rain delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi, the defending champion and Unser's Mercedes teammate, had been 
running better than 230 m.p.h. in practice and was expected to take the pole, 
only to the have the weather change abruptly in Unser's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right before I went out to run," Fittipaldi said, "Junior tells me, 'It is 
beautiful today, lot of sunshine, real nice and warm for you, Emerson.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Warm sunshine was the last thing Fittipaldi and the others wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Fittipaldi could squeeze out of what had been the fastest car most of 
the month was 227.303 m.p.h. This put him on the outside of the front row, 
alongside fellow Brazilian Raul Boesel, who had a 227.618 in one of Dick 
Simon's Lola-Ford Cosworths on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Penske team's 10th Indy pole. But it not only is Unser's first Indy 
pole, it is the first oval race pole of his 12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this will put to rest the stories that I can't qualify well on an 
oval," the 1992 winner said. "Of course, I had to go out there and do my sun 
dance to keep Emmo (Fittipaldi) off the pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pole is something special here. It's worth a lot of money ($100,000 and a 
$30,000 van), a lot of exposure time for the sponsors and it means an awful lot 
to Mercedes. It's the first time they've been here since 1915 and they're 
starting out in front." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser's father, four-time winner Al Sr., was on the sidelines watching as 
Fittipaldi fell short of his son's speed. "Dad gave me a nod and a wink of his 
eye," Al Jr. said. "He said it was really neat. You know Dad, that's about all 
you're ever going to get from him." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Unser failed in one attempt to qualify for his 28th 500, but 
expects to try again next weekend when the 33-car field will be filled in two 
more days of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti, in his 29th and final Indy appearance, was also frustrated by the 
warm conditions and took a disappointing 223.503 that put him on the third row 
in ninth position. Only four times in 26 races has Andretti started farther 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, when we just missed getting our chance, conditions were absolutely 
perfect," Andretti said. "Then, today, it was totally different. You can put 
the order in, but sometimes no one listens." 
</P>
<P>
 With Andretti ninth and PPG Cup Indy car champion Nigel Mansell seventh, it 
put the powerful Newman-Haas team with its factory Lola and Ford Cosworth 
backing behind Simon's independent team, which has Boesel on the front row and 
Lyn St. James on the outside of the second row. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, who drove for 17 years without a victory before retiring in 1989, has 
five drivers in the starting field for the second year in a row. In addition to 
Boesel, who finished fourth last year, and St. James, he placed Hiro Matsushita 
and rookies Hideshi Matsuda and Dennis Vitolo among the 30 who qualified during 
the first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tracy, who skipped pole qualifying Saturday while recuperating from head 
injuries suffered in a crash Friday, returned to the track and qualified the 
third Penske Mercedes at a rather slow 222.710 -- considering he had a 229.961 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to Paul and me today should prove that Penske was not 
sandbagging," Fittipaldi said of the rumors that the Mercedes drivers might go 
in the 235-m.p.h. range. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy was not the fastest second-day qualifier. That honor, and the $25,000 
prize, went to Scott Brayton, who had a 223.652 in a year-old Lola-Menard with 
an engine built in his father's shop in Coldwater, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Goodyear, who was runner-up to Unser Jr. in 1992 in the closest finish 
in Indy 500 history, crashed his Lola-Ford against the inside wall during 
practice for a qualifying effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian driver was taken to Methodist Hospital for treatment of back pain 
and a bruised left thigh and was released Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 With 30 cars qualified, the average speed of the field, 223.039 m.p.h., was 
3.671 faster than last year's top 30 cars. Tentative Indy 500 Lineup

COMEBACK RELIEF; RADINSKY HELPS SIMI VALLEY, PERSEVERES DURING HODGKIN'S 
DISEASE TREATMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since learning he has Hodgkin's disease three months ago, Scott Radinsky has 
become accustomed to people fearing the worst. That's why this date has been 
marked on his calendar for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago White Sox open a three-game series tonight against the Angels at 
Anaheim Stadium, and the relief pitcher is looking forward to seeing his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Or rather, having them see him. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky will be in uniform, appearing very much the same muscular 6-foot-3, 
204-pound left-hander who won eight games and saved four last season. If club 
officials let him, he would like to pitch batting practice and shag balls in 
the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 A mainstay in the White Sox bullpen the past four seasons, Radinsky, 26, is 
halfway through a scheduled series of 12 chemotherapy treatments and still 
looks fit enough to pitch out of a late-inning jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I could go in tomorrow and get somebody out," he said late last 
week. "I want people to know I haven't had to stop doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky's illness forced him from Chicago's active roster, but it failed to 
take him away from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the White Sox sent him home to Simi Valley in February, Radinsky 
approached his old high school coach, Mike Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Looks like I'm going to be here for a while. Better get me a 
uniform,' " Radinsky said. "If I was going to be here, I wanted to be part of 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
 He is, much to the delight of the Simi Valley High players, who refer to him 
as "Rad Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I felt sorry for the guy," said Kary Kozlowski, one of the Pioneers' 
pitchers. "Now look at him. Everybody I'm sure pictures him being skinny and 
bald and sick. That's not the case at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an inspiration, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, he also is a knowledgeable pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley opens the playoffs on Friday after finishing the regular season 
with a record of 18-6 and having placed second in the Marmonte League. This, 
despite the suspension of Scyphers, pending an investigation into alleged 
financial and disciplinary improprieties; a pitching staff depleted by injuries 
and the absence of the staff ace, who was suspended from school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's helped us a ton," pitcher Jeff Weaver said. "He teaches us that the game 
is more mental than physical. He's always been there to help us out." 
</P>
<P>
 On most days, Radinsky can be found at the high school field in long, baggy 
shorts, a T-shirt and a baseball cap pulled backward over his closely cropped 
dark hair. 
</P>
<P>
 At times he offers instruction. At other times he plays groundskeeper, 
painstakingly raking and meticulously packing dirt. He appears content. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like this is what I'm supposed to be doing this time of year," he 
said. "What I'm doing and where I'm doing it doesn't really matter as long as 
it's baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky finds time to work on his pitching. He also plays in an adult league 
on most Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I managed to find a spot on our team for him as a closer," said Russ 
Stephans, the high school team's interim coach and Radinsky's manager on 
Sundays. "He's out there having a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky also plays first base and claims one of the most prodigious home runs 
at the high school field; a drive over the right-field fence that cleared a 
greenbelt and track, and landed on the adjacent football field.  
</P>
<P>
 "They picked it up around the 50-yard line," Radinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bomb," Stephans said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a pitcher, Radinsky occasionally helps make a washed-up ballplayer's day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day a guy looped the ball just over Rad's glove and just between 
the infielders," Stephans said. "The ball was barely hit hard enough to make in 
onto the outfield grass, but the guy's over there on first base (yelling), 'I 
got a hit off him! I got a hit off him!' " 
</P>
<P>
 To that gentleman and the few others who have managed hits comes this 
potentially ego-busting news: "I don't really let it go," Radinsky said. "I'm 
working mostly on changeups." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky says his condition is similar to what it might be a week into spring 
training. If all goes according to plan, he will receive final chemotherapy 
treatments on Aug. 1. A month of radiation treatment is scheduled to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told Radinsky that if he handled the chemotherapy well, the radiation 
should not be a problem. "And I've jogged through chemo," he said, "so I expect 
to sprint through the radiation." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky feels weak and nauseous during the 48 hours after his biweekly 
chemotherapy sessions, but other side effects have not materialized. Radinsky 
hides a full head of hair under his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "My doctors are blown away," Radinsky said. "I haven't lost anything. I think 
by my last radiation treatment I can have myself at about 90% and within about 
a week be ready to pitch again in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky probably would still be pitching for the White Sox had he not had a 
small lump under his neck checked by his personal physician in February, a few 
days before reporting to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Chest X-rays revealed what the doctor thought might be Hodgkin's, but Radinsky 
wasn't experiencing any other symptoms: chills, coughing, shortness of breath.  
</P>
<P>
 Only after he reported to the White Sox training base in Sarasota, Fla., was 
the diagnosis confirmed by a team of specialists. "I was there three days and 
they sent me home," Radinsky said. "Never even made it out to the park." 
</P>
<P>
 The seriousness of his illness never fazed him, despite family history. 
Radinsky's father, Marshall, died of lung cancer in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as worrying about it, I probably didn't because the word cancer was 
never put in there," Radinsky said. "My dad had lung cancer. I had Hodgkin's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched my dad smoke all my life. That was something he inflicted upon 
himself and something anybody who smokes inflicts on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky was a junior at Simi Valley High when his father died. He was a 
baseball player, but not much of a pitcher at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, as now, the game became his salvation. "My 11th-grade season pretty 
much saved my life," Radinsky said. "Through all the hell and bad times I went 
through, I put every single bit of energy I had into this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball kept me in school. It kept me from doing something stupid. You're 
16, 17 years old and your father passes away and you're at the most important 
time in your life. Baseball gave me an outlet, gave me a release. It meant more 
then than it ever did." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky recalls feeling closest to his father on the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird or corny to say, but there were lots of times when I was 
still missing my dad heavy that being out there was like being with him," 
Radinsky said. "It was like I was there with him and for him. Doing it for 
myself, but also knowing that it was what he would want me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky's dedication paid big dividends. As a senior, he was 14-1 with 180 
strikeouts in 100 innings. The White Sox made him a third-round pick in the 
1986 draft, and despite missing almost the entire 1988 season because of 
shoulder surgery, he was a full-time member of the club's bullpen by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Radinsky was 8-2 with four saves as a setup man for closer 
Roberto Hernandez. He has 31 saves in his career, including a high of 15 in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky expected even better numbers this year for a team that figures to 
contend. Now, he would settle for a late-season call-up and a chance to retire 
a batter or two.  
</P>
<P>
 "That would be my only goal," Radinsky said. "If I could get into a game that 
would be cool, even if it's just to face a couple of hitters."

ANGRY JOCKEYS GO TO THE WHIP AT EACH OTHER

 On a day when former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe was on hand, jockeys 
Brian Long and Antonio Castanon got into a scrap in front of the winner's 
circle after the 10th race at Hollywood Park on Sunday, continuing a battle 
that had begun during the stretch run. They were separated quickly with the 
help of trainer Sandy Shulman. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, riding longshot Vibrato Star, became upset after Castanon's mount, 
Someluckything, veered out sharply while tiring in midstretch. Someluckything 
interfered with Vibrato Star and others in the race, including eventual winner 
It's Settled. 
</P>
<P>
 A replacement for Eddie Delahoussaye, who didn't ride Sunday, Long appeared to 
start yelling at Castanon and swung at him with his whip after the incident and 
the two riders then started dueling with their whips on their way to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Both jockeys probably will be fined. BOB MIESZERSKI

NORTHRIDGE'S FIRST LOSING SEASON SINCE '88 ENDS IN CLOUD OF DUST

<P>
 Nobody had to put the words in Josh Smaler's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 All he had to do was look at Jason Shanahan, laying face-down at home plate in 
a cloud of dust, and it came to him in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan was thrown out at the plate for the final out of the season in the 
ninth inning as Fresno State hung on for an 8-7 victory over Cal State 
Northridge in a Western Athletic Conference regular-season finale at Beiden 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-game series sweep by the Bulldogs (36-23, 15-9 in conference play) 
pulled them into a first-place tie in the WAC West Division standings and 
forced a makeup doubleheader at 3 p.m. today between host San Diego State and 
Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (25-30, 12-12) lost its fourth game in a row and for the sixth time 
in seven games. The Matadors finished below .500 for the first time since 1988.

 Harbor 6, Pierce 1 -- Heath McElwee was up for the challenge against Harbor 
College.The Pierce College left fielder could not say the same about his 
teammates after they were eliminated by the second-seeded Seahawks (31-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's loss came on the heels of a 9-7 defeat Saturday to the Seahawks. The 
15th-seeded Brahmas, eliminated by Harbor for the second time in four years, 
finished 25-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't hit the ball any harder, but our bats weren't swinging real well," 
said McElwee, who had two of his team's five hits. "Our pitching just hasn't 
been great in the playoffs and our defense just killed us." KIRBY LEE

SHOP TALK: 'SHORT' SHIFTS DRAW ONLY REGULAR PAY UP TO 8 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 D o you have a question about a workplace issue, challenge or problem? If so, 
please mail it to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, 
Calif. 92626. Or call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions 
of general interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: At what point does a short shift become a full day's work? Say a 
person works part time: eight-hour days twice a week and five-hour shifts twice 
a week. If she works six straight hours on one of those "short" days, is she 
entitled to a full day's pay? Is there a law on this or can companies set their 
own policies? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.B., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Generally, the California Wage Orders do not require overtime pay 
unless an employee works beyond eight hours in any given workday. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer this specific question, let's assume that this is a part-time, 
non-exempt employee covered under California Wage Order 4: Prof./Technical and 
Clerical worker. Indeed, there would be an obligation to pay only for hours 
worked at a regular rate of pay until the employee worked over eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the employer has a contract or a policy greater than the 
California Wage Regulations, then that policy would become a requirement. 
</P>

Employers Group

</P>
<P>
 Question: I started work two months ago at a small software company that 
offered me a higher salary than I had been making. Last week the company's 
president called a meeting and said layoffs are imminent unless we all agree to 
a 20% pay cut. This would bring my salary well below what I had been making 
previously. Given my circumstances, shouldn't I be an exception?

 Answer: You could talk to your boss to see if you might be considered an 
exception to the impending pay cuts. However, I wouldn't be too optimistic. 
Often, when companies implement pay cuts to stave off layoffs, the pay cuts are 
"across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 This is done because equity is an important issue with most workers. If some 
workers are spared pay cuts, workers who are cut will feel that they are 
treated unfairly. There is good evidence that workers who feel they are being 
treated unfairly can become dissatisfied, and motivation can be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, cohesiveness within work teams can diminish if workers perceive that 
certain members are getting preferential treatment. In addition, management may 
perceive that if they make an exception in your case, they will have to make 
other exceptions.

 COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the response to J.M. of Huntington Beach with respect to 
pregnancy disability leave and family leave needs to be clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, though the California Pregnancy Disability Act applies to all 
employers of five or more employees, the Federal Family Leave Act and the 
California Family Rights Act, which are now substantially similar, only apply 
to employers who employ 50 or more persons. 
</P>
<P>
 If J.M. works for an employer who has fewer than 50 employees, she would be 
entitled only to disability leave under the California Pregnancy Disability 
Act.

 Now available is the price list on the much-touted catalogue of Barbra 
Streisand merchandise being sold to coincide with her current concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
 If the prices on the items are any indication, marketer Sony Signatures must 
hope its coffers will be kept evergreen as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Included is a Barbra silver key chain for $100, a Barbra coffee mug for $15 
(set of four is $50), a kid's T-shirt and watch combination for $50, a 
commemorative Barbra scarf for $75 and a tour jacket for $400.

 Also available is an Italian silk tie for $60. According to the catalogue,

 The recent scathing analysis of the healthiness of movie popcorn from the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest prompted us to ask if the center 
would also be willing to analyze the healthiness of the famous chocolate chip 
cookie recipe of First Lady and health care reformer Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The center declined but referred us to Dine Systems Inc., an Amherst, N.Y., 
company whose "Dine Health" computer program is sold by the center. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the computer analysis, Clinton's cookies -- which got a batch of 
attention during the last election in the debate over whether they were better 
than Barbara Bush's -- are slightly lower in calories and fat than major 
store-bought brands. They are about the same in cholesterol but don't fare well 
against newer reduced-fat cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the analysis, one small (14-gram) Clinton cookie contains 67 
calories and 3 grams of fat, 1 of which is the dreaded saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dine Systems executives said 14 grams of a Chips Ahoy cookie would have 100 
calories and 6 grams of fat, 1.5 of them saturated. A Chips Deluxe of that size 
would have 70 calories, with about 4 grams of fat, slightly less than 2 of them 
saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduced-fat Snackwells chocolate chip cookies have fewer calories for the same 
size and only about one-third the fat of the Clinton cookies. All Pre-American

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: THOUGH SMALL AND QUIET, FOUNDERS GETS RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might be a fluke, a coincidence or just plain luck, but the Founders funds 
group at the moment can boast of an unrivaled record of consistently good 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver company manages 11 mutual funds with a combined $2 billion in 
assets. Of these, seven have been evaluated for risk-adjusted performance by 
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago monitoring service, and each of the seven enjoys 
an "above average" grading. 
</P>
<P>
 No other group with at least that many funds has "above average" or better 
scores on all its portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Value Line, which operates a rival rating service, doesn't give 
such consistently good marks to Founders' funds. But overall, it grades them 
nearly as well, using somewhat different measures of risk and return. 
</P>
<P>
 What's important isn't the exact ratings on Founders' funds but the fact that 
the company has been able to achieve respectable results without much fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Founders' $2 billion in combined mutual fund assets doesn't even place it 
among the 100 largest fund groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't put a lot of emphasis on marketing and public relations," says 
Bjorn K. Borgen, Founders' president and majority owner. 
</P>
<P>
 While asset growth can help a fund group operate more efficiently and attract 
better talent, too much growth can prove to be a hindrance if it affects the 
firm's ability to deliver good results, Borgen says, adding that the company 
currently has no plans to add new funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Borgen probably introduced more change to the sleepy company than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined Founders as chief investment officer in 1969, three years out of 
Harvard Business School, and he bought a controlling interest in the mid-1970s. 
Since then, the group has introduced seven of its 11 funds and switched from a 
load to a no-load format. Founders' tenure in the mutual fund business dates to 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Borgen argues that his firm's good marks are not a result of luck or 
coincidence, but rather an investment approach that stresses teamwork and 
collective incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The company follows what it calls a "team and lead manager" system, where each 
fund manager and analyst cover a different set of industries. Founders' 
investment pros share ideas, but each lead manager has the final say on his 
portfolio's buy and sell decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 When a fund outperforms its peer group, an incentive bonus is paid to the 
entire investment department, which also includes traders, statisticians and 
support personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lead manager will get the biggest slices, but the others will also get a 
piece of the pie," Borgen says. "So there's an incentive for everyone to assist 
everyone else to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Founders managers follow a "bottom-up" investment philosophy, which means they 
spend their time searching for promising stocks rather than trying to predict 
market swings. Founders likes to buy growth companies with superior earnings 
potential, solid management and dominant products. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored themes today include technology companies that sell 
productivity-enhancing goods and services, telecommunications firms and 
selected retailing stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a market timing emphasis, the Founders funds will start to fill 
up with cash when their portfolio managers can't find good buys. Currently, the 
funds have higher-than-normal cash positions, Borgen says. 
</P>
<P>
 If Founders has a glaring weakness, it's a lack of good fixed-income 
investments from which to choose. The company offers nothing in the tax-free 
bond area and has just two products in the taxable arena: a new and unproven 
global bond fund and a lackluster government bond portfolio. Morningstar hasn't 
yet rated the latter, but Value Line gives it a "lowest" rating for 
risk-adjusted performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, pure no-load enthusiasts might not like the fact that Founders charges a 
0.25% annual 12b-1 fee, for marketing-related expenses, on its funds. The 
company's products tend to have slightly higher expenses than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 As another modest negative, investors should realize that Founders' stock 
funds tend to be fairly volatile, says Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load 
Fund Investor newsletter in Irvington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jacobs agrees that the company's reputation is a good one, and he gives 
high marks to its Balanced, Blue Chip, Frontier, Growth and Worldwide Growth 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen L. McKee, editor of the No-Load Mutual Fund Selections & Timing 
Newsletter in Dallas, says Founders Growth has been an outstanding performer 
over the last couple of years. He also likes the company's Balanced and Blue 
Chip funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to make its products more popular among investors, Founders 
recently dropped its $10 annual fee on individual retirement accounts for fund 
holdings of at least $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has also made its funds available through the no-transaction-fee 
programs offered by discount brokerages Fidelity Investments and Charles 
Schwab. These programs are a low-cost way for investors to consolidate their 
many different fund holdings in a single account, McKee says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The war continues to heat up among discount brokerages that allow investors to 
buy or sell no-load mutual funds without a transaction fee. Boston-based 
Fidelity Investments in early May added 130 funds from 23 groups to 
FundsNetwork, its no-transaction-fee program. Federated, IAI, Montgomery, 
United Services and Warburg Pincus are among the families now participating. 
</P>
<P>
 With the change, a total of 328 funds from 33 families are available through 
Fidelity without a sales charge or other trading expense. Rival Charles Schwab, 
based in San Francisco, has 251 funds from 27 families available through 
OneSource, its no-transaction-fee program. 
</P>
<P>
 Such programs allow investors to consolidate their holdings under one roof for 
no additional charges. The fund companies pay a 0.25% annual fee to compensate 
the brokerages for trading and administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, San Diego-based Jack White & Co., which offers a 
no-transaction-fee program of its own, is lowering its minimum investment on 
some funds in the program to $250 from $5,000. Model of Consistency 
</P>
<P>
 The Founders mutual funds group of Denver has achieved unusually consistent 
investment returns. Of the seven Founders funds rated by Morningstar for 
risk-adjusted performance, all enjoy "above average" marks. 05,18,19,13,07,12

JACK SMITH: LET A SMILE BE YOUR RANDOM KIND ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My mailbox is full of letters about the popular maxim "Practice random acts of 
senseless kindness" (sometimes "and beauty" is added). Most of them chastise me 
for suggesting that such acts carry a risk, that they may backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge those readers who have 
themselves committed random acts of kindness, or have been their beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many simply suggest that smiling at strangers is kindness enough. It often 
makes people feel good, both the smiler and the smiled at. In a city teeming 
with strangers, like Los Angeles, one would have to wear a permanent smile. 
Wouldn't that look silly? 
</P>
<P>
 Some note that it is a physiological fact that frowning requires more muscles 
than smiling. Actually, most of us, especially we older folks, need all the 
exercise we can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not be an act of kindness," writes Judi Detrich, "but I've proved 
that a smile usually results in a smile back, and gives one a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 "If people could and would only smile at others in a friendly way," writes 
Maria T. Campbell of Rosemead, "what a happier world this might be. When out 
around strangers, if our glances coincide, I have always smiled. Very seldom 
has my smile not been returned and I believe we both feel uplifted." 
</P>
<P>
 Smile and the world smiles with you. Isn't that the saying? 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Wagner of Van Nuys says he has always tried to be kind and amiable. 
As a college student, he worked in the Farmers' Market, where he often waited 
on movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I greeted them courteously by name, served them with grace and wished them a 
good day. Glenn Ford was the most memorable. He was every bit the kind, 
gracious, self-effacing gentleman when requesting a bottle of sauerkraut juice 
as when he portrayed kind, honest, humble people in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Now I wonder why Glenn Ford wanted sauerkraut juice. Does he have a recipe he 
would be kind enough to share with us?  
</P>
<P>
 Surely the most bizarre act of kindness I've heard of is one practiced by my 
friend Patti Garrity of Manhattan Beach. Garrity, a former flight attendant, 
has the hardy habit of rising at 5:30 a.m. to take a five-mile, 1 1/2-hour walk 
along the beach and the strand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along the way are many lovely gardens and borders with succulent plants and 
flowers, and ravenous snails crossing the walks to the feast," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 I will let her tell what she does: 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I'm not French or a duck, snails serve no useful purpose except to make 
a nice pop or crunch when stepped on, and I have decimated the town's snail 
population by the hundreds this spring, unbeknownst to any but God and a few 
bug-eyed joggers, dog-walkers and poets. (There's a whole subculture sharing 
the strand with me before 7 o'clock.) The garden owners maybe never knew they 
had snails and now never will, unless they identify the splats on their portion 
of sidewalk. I can't get more random and senseless than this, can I? 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize my snail patrol isn't very kind to the snails, but wouldn't you 
appreciate a random phantom in your garden?" 
</P>
<P>
 Garrity has gone right to the heart of her adventures by admitting that the 
snails probably don't like it and suggesting that I would be grateful if she 
practiced her devastating patrol in my garden. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first place, I don't have a garden. My wife has a garden, and I happen 
to know she doesn't like snails in it. However, if she squashes them, she 
doesn't tell me. My hands are clean. 
</P>
<P>
 I know Garrity to be a woman of faith, and I am surprised that she can 
massacre God's little creatures in such a merciless way. I am reminded of what 
Mrs. Gomez said when her husband dropped a live lobster into a pot of boiling 
water: "They don't like it, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, my neighbor Ralph Leighton applauds my suggestion that it would be 
better simply to do no harm than to risk uninvited acts of kindness. "I heard 
the same from the Dalai Lama," he writes. "He said Buddhism amounts to this: 
First, do no harm; second, help if you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Also I am reminded that the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates said that a 
physician should make a habit of two things -- either to help, or at least to 
do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course there's no harm in smiling, unless the person smiled at gets the 
wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Garrity smiles when she crunches a snail. Alas, though, the snail 
can't smile back. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrity is welcome in my wife's garden any time she likes, but perhaps it 
would be best if she went barefooted. 
</P>
<P>
 That popping sound might ruin my day.

LAUGH LINES; TWO PICTURES WORTH 1,000 PUNCH LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So you think it's easy to write picture captions? 
</P>
<P>
 Laugh Lines' second reader-participation contest is writing captions for 
either or both of these two pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture No. 1 is Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, caught by cameras after a 
tennis tournament. No. 2 is Yasser Arafat talking to other dignitaries at the 
recent signing of a Middle East peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Below each picture is our sample of the kind of captions we are looking for in 
your entries. 
</P>
<P>
 So, put on your thinking caps and come up with something clever or creative. 
(We are not looking for a Top 10 list here, folks; just one or two funny gag 
lines for either or both photos.) 
</P>
<P>
 The top five captions for each picture will win a Laugh Lines Humor Master 
T-Shirt. The first-place winner for each picture -- as judged by the sometimes 
maligned LL Supreme Court -- will also receive an additional special prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Have some fun, and please make sure that we receive your entries by mail or 
fax no later than 9 a.m. Friday, May 20, 1994.

LOOKING TO THE FUTURE FOR ADVICE ABOUT TODAY; UNCONQUERED COUNTRIES BY GEOFF 
RYMAN ; ST. MARTIN'S PRESS $20.95, 275 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In these four novellas, English science-fiction writer Geoff Ryman wears his 
heart on his sleeve. The sleeve is of some shimmering space-age fabric, 
threaded with electronic sensors, but the heart is the old-fashioned, bleeding 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, to switch metaphors, science fiction serves Ryman in the same way that the 
"Charlie Slide" serves the space explorers in the first and most radically 
speculative of the stories, "A Fall of Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 The Charlie Slide cancels out the vastness of space and enables people and 
goods to be transported instantly anywhere in the universe. Ryman's fresh 
imagining of old problems helps him bridge the emotional distance we like to 
keep between ourselves and the world's horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 It's simply a good way to get from A to B. (Yes, Kurt Vonnegut, despite his 
wearier, wittier, more cynical tone, did much the same thing.) 
</P>
<P>
 The horror in "A Fall of Angels" is a political religion called the Regimen of 
Tanner Cahsway, which subjects future humans to rigid controls and a joyless 
conception of duty in order to save the universe from losing heat, running 
down, dying of entropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryman ("Was," "The Child Garden") conjures up ingenious, imaginary physics to 
explain how this works, and he outlines it with a brevity and clarity one 
wishes real physicists would imitate. 
</P>
<P>
 While colonists struggle to farm inhospitable planets, humans transformed into 
bodiless space probes -- "angels" -- dive into the hearts of waning suns to 
begin rejuvenating them with fresh fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Two angels "fall" when they meet a flame-bodied alien who, despite the satanic 
symbolism, is really a spirit of love and spontaneity. They begin to suspect 
that the vaunted Regimen is just another example of rational overkill, of 
humans assuming godlike powers at the expense of what in the universe is truly 
divine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Fan," in contrast, adds very little to existing technology. A London 
teen-ager named Billie is smitten by the songs of Eamon Strafe, supposedly an 
Irish monk, and clings to his music as she grows up, endures dull jobs, loses 
her husband (whose chief attraction was an Irish accent) and raises an 
emotionally disturbed son. 
</P>
<P>
 Billie buys a computer program "imprinted" with Strafe's personality and finds 
more intimacy with this than with any real person. Her discovery that the 
software is user-sensitive -- that each fan creates her own Eamon Strafe -- 
leads her to crash security at a concert to meet the actual rock star, if there 
is one. 
</P>
<P>
 The noteworthy thing about this story is that Ryman doesn't condescend to 
Billie. She is loving, brave and determined; she deserves better than to be 
addicted to spurious experience by the media conglomerates that profit from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "O Happy Day!" is a fable about a feminist future in which heterosexual men, 
because of their history of violence and oppression, are being exterminated. 
Ryman neatly sidesteps the question of how women could seize power; he focuses 
on a group of young gay men who, like capos in Nazi camps, survive by unloading 
corpses from death trains. 
</P>
<P>
 This story is powerful both in its details -- the divided loyalties, the 
prison psychology -- and in its message: that violence, like love, is a 
contagion that can't be killed off or fenced away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Unconquered Country" is the most moving of the stories. Here Ryman finds 
an optimum balance between magic and realism. Houses, like great hollow 
elephants, are alive; machines and weapons are biologically "farmed" in the 
wombs of poor women, who are called "Desperate Flies"; the dead can speak to 
the living. On another level, this is a perfectly clear and straightforward 
account of the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroine, Third Child, is even more vulnerable and admirable than Billie. 
The overkill that distant, incomprehensible powers unleash on her is literal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did not starve, or wither," Ryman has a sister's ghost tell Third Child 
after she has been led to the edge of the killing fields and we realize that 
the fantasy has tricked us into getting too close not to suffer along with her. 
"You were loved, but you never became a soldier's wife . . ., so you can lose 
no one else. You have lived the best life possible in the Land of the 
Faithful."

RSVP; A DECADE OF WOMEN SPEAKING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The program began with Holly Robinson's rendition of "Amazing Grace" and 
concluded with a chorus of Hollywood Women's Political Committee members, led 
by Melissa Manchester and Patti Austin, singing "America the Beautiful" against 
the backdrop of a giant Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, a multitude of voices spoke out loud and clear for all they 
believed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Decade of Voices" was the title of the dinner at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel to celebrate the HWPC's 10th anniversary. Since 1984 the 
organization has contributed more than $5 million to support progressive 
candidates for state and federal office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the pre-dinner cocktail reception, such Hollywood leading ladies as Jill 
Eikenberry, Christine Lahti and Donna Mills mingled with their current favorite 
politicians, including Kathleen Brown, Democratic candidate for California 
governor; Las Vegas Mayor Jan Laverty Jones, who is running for Nevada 
governor, and Zoe Lofgren, Democratic candidate for California's 16th 
congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thelma and Louise" screenwriter Callie Khouri said she joined the HWPC three 
years ago because "it's a great umbrella under which I can learn more about 
many issues I care about. It's so well-organized and it's fun, fun, fun!" 
</P>
<P>
 The plethora of handshaking, social kissing and smile-wide greetings, at which 
politicians are even more skilled than movie stars, delayed dinner. Once 
started, the onstage program quickly turned minds away from whether the chicken 
entree was cooked with too much fat and cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't this a time!" beamed Alfre Woodard, vibrant with the "joy and 
privilege" of having just returned from South African President Nelson 
Mandela's inauguration. The rest of the evening lived up to her eloquent, 
feisty words of welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Woman's Voice," a new song by Allen and Marilyn Bergman and Marvin 
Hamlisch, was sung by the choir, whose choice of all white or cream clothing 
ranged from Mills' tailored pantsuit to Dana Delany's mini-dress, worn with 
fishnet tights and a glitter sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 A video, produced by Susan B. Landau, Anthea Sylbert and Catherin Wyler, 
reflected on the accomplishments of the HWPC and pulled no punches in its 
ridicule of the conservative opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsed politicians spoke with passion and conviction. "It's so important 
that we do not separate the lives we live from the words we speak," said 
Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the 5-foot-5 1/2 Wellstone rushed back onstage to confirm the punch 
line of fellow Minnesota candidate Ann Wynia's statement, "I know Paul 
Wellstone. Paul Wellstone is my friend. But I'm no Paul Wellstone. I'm taller!" 
 
</P>
<P>
 However, the evening's best jokes came from M.C. Lily Tomlin, strikingly 
dressed in a green frock coat and trousers like a Regency highway woman. Her 
obliquely wicked attacks on the opposition, including a definition of "GOP" 
that Edith Ann would have found very naughty, were intercut with the constant 
aside " . . . except for you, Mayor Riordan." Genuinely amused, the mayor, 
present in the audience with best friend Nancy Daly, rushed up to hug Tomlin at 
the evening's conclusion.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we just didn't care about being happy, none of this would matter," Tomlin 
said at one point, her voice speaking for all those HWPC members who have no 
attention of shutting up -- over the next 10 years, either -- on the issues 
that matter to them.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: YACHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Woodyard 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 YACHT BOOM: With the boating season now underway, yacht brokers report that 
the healthier economy and this year's repeal of the luxury tax has meant 
increased sales. . . . "I think people got tired of acting poor," says Newport 
Beach broker George Steinemann, who has sold more big boats so far this year 
than all of last year. The best clients used to be developers, he says, but now 
they are doctors and high-tech executives. Doctors "traditionally have money 
(despite) the recession," says Sheila Wood of Newport Beach's H&S Yacht Sales. 
</P>
<P>
 SAIL CHANGE: While naval architects fret about hull design, sail designers are 
using computers and space-age materials in search of the perfect sail. The 
latest twist: creating seamless sails using molded Mylar and Kevlar, the 
material used in bulletproof jackets. "It makes them work better," says Jaime 
Malm of North Sails Newport Beach. . . . These new sails weigh less, allowing 
the boat to stand up straighter and go faster. But they're not cheap. Cost of a 
single main sail on the hottest West Coast racing yachts: $12,500, and most 
skippers will replace them after only 40 hours of use. 
</P>
<P>
 IN 80 DAYS?: An Orange County team has begun to organize for yachting's most 
grueling competitive event, the 33,000-mile Whitbread Round the World Race in 
1997. The team is led by Dr. Neil Barth, above, an Orange County yachtsman who 
recently won the Transpac race to Hawaii. With offices in Newport Beach, the 
syndicate hopes to build a specially designed 60-foot yacht at a Costa Mesa 
boatyard. Fund-raising goal: $5 million, mostly through corporate sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
 OCEAN CHALLENGE: Last month's race from Orange County to Ensenada gave some 
valuable seagoing experience to a group of sailors with physical disabilities. 
. . . "We had five disabled guys, including myself," said Duncan Milne, a 
paraplegic who skippered the 29-foot sailboat "Out Patient." The crew "did not 
have a lot of experience," says Milne. "I picked these guys because they were 
really enthusiastic." Milne's Access to Sailing program for the disabled has 
drawn dozens of participants since its founding in 1990.

TIMOTHY CAREY; ACTOR PLAYED FILM VILLAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy Carey, a film actor best known for his portrayals of menacing villains 
in early Stanley Kubrick pictures and later as star of the cult favorite "The 
World's Greatest Sinner," which he also produced, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Romeo Carey, said his father -- the assassin in Kubrick's "The 
Killing" and one of the scapegoat soldiers in "Paths of Glory" -- was 65 when 
he died of a massive stroke Wednesday in a Beverly Hills hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy-lidded actor, who began in movies in the early 1950s, played 
loathsome characters in "The Wild One," "East of Eden," "Bayou," "One-Eyed 
Jacks," "Minnie and Moskowitz," "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie" and many 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 he starred in what Los Angeles Times critic Kevin Thomas called a 
"primitive art" film whose rambling lead character sees himself as God. He 
gives up a predator's life as a salesman for one of religious faith, promising 
eternal life to his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said the role in "The World's Greatest Sinner" involved "an Elvis 
Presley who becomes a Billy Graham who becomes a Father Divine." 
</P>
<P>
 The film was made for only $100,000 and showed at a few select art houses. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral service has been scheduled for Wednesday at Rose Hills Memorial Park 
in Whittier.

HAZEL SMITH; WON PULITZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hazel Brannon Smith, Pulitzer Prize-winning editor who was known for her 
strong stand against racism during Mississippi's turbulent civil rights era, 
has died. She was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Smith, who in 1964 became the first woman to receive the Pulitzer for 
editorial writing, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 42-year career as editor and publisher of the Lexington (Miss.) Advertiser 
was chronicled in the ABC television movie "A Passion for Justice: The Life 
Story of Hazel Brannon Smith" on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Jane Seymour portrayed Smith, who was one of the few white Southern 
editors to speak out against white extremists during the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Smith's newspaper became the target of an economic boycott, and the 
segregationist White Citizens Council launched an opposition paper. The boycott 
lasted 10 years and drained Mrs. Smith financially. Nevertheless, she continued 
to speak out against racism and bigotry.

MIKE PENNER: WINNING MAKES SOCCER A BIT EASIER TO SWALLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One month to go before the World Cup takes to slumming on U.S. soil and the 
home team is building up one righteous head of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia was defeated Sunday at Cal State Fullerton, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia fell the week before, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 We have been kicking some serious former Soviet Socialist Republic butt, just 
wiping the soccer field with these tiny recently independent states. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan -- keep on lining them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA isn't afraid of anyone it can't locate on a map. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Colombia and Romania, well, the young Americans are trying to convince 
themselves that time is on their side. A lot can happen in a month, right? Our 
top players return from Europe in a week or two, Coach Bora Milutinovic can 
fiddle with the mix in a couple final warm-ups against Greece and Mexico and, 
with any amount of luck, we make our stand before the world against Switzerland 
-- June 18 at the Silverdome -- without inflaming any panic in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get it going right now," U.S. defender Alexi Lalas said. 
"Realistically, we could still use the next month to fine-tune things, but I'm 
optimistic. Come June 18, I'm totally confident we'll be ready, individually 
and collectively, to have a successful World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 A successful World Cup -- talk about your relative terms. In Germany and 
Brazil, a successful World Cup is defined as flying home with the lumpy gold 
trophy in the overhead bin. The American slang is completely different. After 
sitting out the World Cup for 40 years and being slapped around in 1990, a 
great run for the United States in 1994 would be playing well enough in its 
first three matches to earn a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second round, yeah," Lalas said, trying to imagine the day. "That's our 
initial goal. We can no longer be happy just to be there. We have to do 
something once we're there." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially now that the World Cup is our stage, for the first time ever -- and 
who knows about the last? 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't hurt, man," Lalas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup didn't come to the States without a fight. At first, the purists 
were so peeved, they had to remove their monocles to wipe the fog from them. 
The United States was a baseball-loving, hot dog-inhaling, soccer-illiterate 
land of heathens -- totally unworthy of hosting such a sacred event. Americans 
have no appreciation, no respect for the game. I mean, just look at the way 
they play it. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA hadn't done much recently to shatter the stereotype, either. Before 
Sunday's victory over Armenia, the United States' international record in 1994 
was a pitiful 3-4-7. Included were losses to non-Cup participants Iceland (2-1) 
and Chile (2-0), lethargic ties with Denmark, Bolivia and Moldova and a 3-1 
defeat in the Joe Robbie Cup to a Swedish national team playing without most of 
its World Cup starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The victories came against Norway, Moldova and Estonia -- a veritable American 
League West of international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a month-long period dealing with cuts and outside problems 
and it really affected our play," midfielder Claudio Reyna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside problems? 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't playing well and the excuses were flying," Reyna said. "When 
you're losing, all you hear is the criticism. 'They're not fit.' 'They're not 
ready.' 'The wrong guys are on the field.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're out of that rut now. We have two wins in a row, even if they 
are against lesser teams. We just have to get a winning attitude and take that 
into our (final tuneups) against Greece, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. Those will be 
three great preparations for us." 
</P>
<P>
 When you're a U.S. national soccer team member, you take your silver linings 
wherever you can find them. Sunday, for instance, Lalas saw one in the stands. 
Titan Stadium was packed -- official attendance was listed at 9,753 -- which 
was a sizable improvement over the 2,158 scattered souls who witnessed last 
week's rout of Estonia, which apparently doesn't travel well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, yeah," Lalas said. "It's so much better to play in front of a big 
crowd. Even if a lot of the fans here were for Armenia." 
</P>
<P>
 And in three weeks, Team USA will play Mexico at the Rose Bowl, and a crowd of 
60,000 is expected, and most of them will be cheering the team in green, red 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reality for U.S. soccer players," Lalas said with a shrug. "A lot of 
our games are played at home, yet in front of hostile, anti-U.S. crowds. We're 
used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas chalks it up as part of "all the crap you have to go through as an 
American soccer player. All that stuff -- battling other sports for attention, 
trying to find (a club) team that will have you, trying to play a game the rest 
of the world has an undying passion for, yet in your country, you have to toil 
in anonymity." 
</P>
<P>
 What will it take to change that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Money, maybe," Lalas suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. People are either going to dig it, or they're not. This country 
is very ripe for it to happen, but not everybody is gonna love it. We're not 
asking everybody to love it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who do, they have a great summer ahead of them. For those who 
don't, at least they'll have a chance to see and maybe gain a respect for the 
best level of play in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And a U.S. victory/minor miracle or two? 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't hurt, man. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. TEAM WINS

SLATER RIDES AWAY WITH SURFING VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Slater flew home to Cocoa Beach, Fla., Sunday night with his Southern 
California surfing resume nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater won his third title in seven days with a victory at the Bud Pro Surfing 
tour stop Sunday at Huntington State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with a four-wave total of 31.03 (out of 40) to edge Cardiff's Rob 
Machado (28.63), whom he had beaten in the finals of the Katin Team Challenge 
last Sunday at the Huntington Beach Pier. He and Machado also were part of the 
winning Team Focus at the Katin. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater's victory Sunday was his sixth in Orange County in the past five years. 
He won the Op Junior amateur title in 1989, the 1990 Body Glove Surfbout at 
Lower Trestles and led Team USA to a tag-team title at the 1992 Op and then 
added the three championships last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Katin and Bud Pro contests served as a tuneup for the Op Pro and U.S. Open 
of Surfing, scheduled for late July and early August at Huntington Beach. 
Slater, the 1992 world champion, has never won a world-tour contest at 
Huntington Beach, a streak he's aiming to break this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I think about it," Slater said, "I feel pretty good about what I've 
done here in the past week. I hadn't won in Huntington Beach since I was an 
amateur, and I've had a chance to compete here in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'm surfing in the Op Pro (July 27-31) yet. But I'm there for 
the U.S. Open. It looks to be the biggest surfing contest in the world this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater dominated Huntington Beach the past week. He scored a perfect 10 in 
small surf at the Katin a week ago, and scored consistently Sunday with some 
aerial moves in three- to five-foot conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed a 6.71 to pass Machado, and took the lead midway through the final 
when he scored a 7.7 on his fifth wave -- a big move off the lip, followed by 
an aerial. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater earned $4,000 for the victory, Machado $2,000. Hawaii's Ross Williams 
won $1,350 for finishing third and Seal Beach native Marty Thomas placed fourth 
and took home $1,250. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was as good a week as I've had for contests," Slater said. "But 
money-wise, it wasn't. I thought I won $1,500 at the Katin, but I got only 
$1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater finished second to Machado in a tough semifinal heat that included 
reigning world champion Derek Ho of Hawaii and 1992 U.S. champion Shane Beschen 
of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho had defeated Slater in the third round and quarterfinals, although both 
advanced to the next round. But Ho struggled in the final minutes of the 
semifinal as two five-foot waves closed out on him. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 World-tour officials are considering a format in which the top three finishers 
at the Op Pro would automatically advance to the U.S. Open. A fourth qualifying 
spot would be determined in a one-on-one heat between former Op champion Mark 
Occhilupo of Australia and three-time Op champion Tommy Curren of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Op and U.S. Open officials also plan to charge admission for bleacher and pier 
seating for the final days of each contest. Seating on the beach is still free, 
but there will be a $5 per day charge for the last two days of the Op. There 
also will be a charge for seating on each of the final three days of the U.S. 
Open, with a price yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty of the world's top 44 surfers have committed to compete in the Op.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD: KATZAROFF CANNOT GET GAME OUT OF HIS 
SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lure of the game keeps tugging at Rob Katzaroff. He has been an Expo, a 
Met, a Giant and now an Angel in five minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But like many who have bounced around the minors, Katzaroff wonders when, and 
sometimes if, he'll get the call from the big club. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, something like: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Katzaroff, pack your bags, we need you up here pronto."  
</P>
<P>
 The call hasn't come, but Katzaroff hasn't quit, hasn't stopped chasing down 
line drives to the left-center field gap, hasn't backed off when the count is 0 
and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Giants released him with two weeks left in spring training, Katzaroff 
knew it wasn't the end of the line. He knew the Giants had their reasons, but 
he didn't agree with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzaroff, a standout at Los Alamitos and UCLA, also knew another team would 
call, a team in need of a sure-handed center fielder, a speedy, solid leadoff 
hitter. The Angels, who desperately needed help at their new Class A affiliate 
at Lake Elsinore, eventually phoned. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Katzaroff is still plugging away, hoping to turn his dream of playing 
in the majors into reality. He knows it's a long shot. He knows the Angels 
already have a talented, young center fielder named Chad Curtis. Katzaroff 
simply wants to keep playing, hoping he'll keep climbing within the 
organization. And if it doesn't happen here, maybe it will elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much how I do (on the field)," said Katzaroff, who advanced to 
triple A for the Giants last season. "It's got to do with somebody in the 
organization liking me enough to move me up. Somebody who knows how I play, 
scouts every game I play, sees me all the time and gets back to the 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the grim reality facing a 25-year-old starting over again in Class A 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to play hard every day and play my game," Katzaroff said. "I enjoy the 
game of baseball and I enjoy playing well. The politics of moving up is out of 
my control." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he concentrates on smacking the ball around California League ballparks. 
He tries to get on base any way he can, tries to steal a base when he can. 
</P>
<P>
 He's batting .299 with five runs batted in and seven stolen bases in 17 games 
for Lake Elsinore. Those aren't bad numbers, but they're also probably not good 
enough to rate a promotion to double-A Midland just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzaroff isn't dwelling on such things, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love of the game is why I'm still playing this year," he said. "It's been 
frustrating after being turned down when you know you should have been moved 
up. But the politics of baseball gets you moved up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I get on the field and the first pitch is thrown, I forget about all 
that. When I go home that's when it gets hard for me. When I'm home that's when 
I think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Katzaroff played well enough to earn a promotion to triple-A 
Phoenix and it was difficult for him not to think about making the majors. When 
it didn't happen, when the Giants released him this spring, he chalked it up to 
bad management. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the Giants) made a lot of mistakes," he said. "I felt I could have 
helped them in the big leagues. I'm here and they've got what they have. I 
wasn't their player. I wasn't one of their guys. I was expendable in their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal drafted Katzaroff after he graduated from UCLA in 1990. The Expos 
then traded him to the New York Mets, who later sent him to San Francisco for 
Kevin Bass in October, 1992. He spent part of last season at double-A 
Shreveport, then was moved to triple-A Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 His release came as a shock. But the Angels, hoping to bolster their 
foundering Class-A team, called and now he's a member of the Lake Elsinore 
Storm. The club's 5-28 record is not something to cherish, but Katzaroff is 
happy to be playing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like playing here," he said. "The fans have been real supportive. They keep 
coming out to see us even though we've been losing. Hopefully, we'll reward 
their patience by winning some games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this as a chance to continue playing. I go into each game thinking I'm 
going to be a big league player." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katzaroff and J.T. Snow, a first baseman for the Angels' triple-A affiliate at 
Vancouver, were better known as football players as high school teammates at 
Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzaroff was a wide receiver and Snow a quarterback. In 1985, Katzaroff 
caught 93 passes from Snow, an Orange County record. Katzaroff maintains ties 
with Snow and said better days are ahead for his boyhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was stuck in the minors (in the Yankees' organization), then he got traded 
to the right team and had a big start in the majors with the Angels," Katzaroff 
said. "He'll eventually get another opportunity. He'll be back up there. J.T. 
is a tough character. He'll land on his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, batting .322 with a team-leading six home runs and 27 RBIs, could be 
recalled to the Angels if Eduardo Perez's injured wrist forces him to be placed 
on the disabled list.

CS NORTHRIDGE TO PLAY HOST TO NCAA SOFTBALL REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge softball team cheered the news Sunday -- and breathed 
a collective sigh of relief -- when it was announced that the third-ranked 
Matadors would play host to one of eight NCAA regional tournaments this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Each regional consists of four teams, which will play a double-elimination 
tournament Friday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (46-7), making its third consecutive appearance in the playoffs, 
will play host to Washington (43-19), Cal State Fullerton (32-27) and Maine 
(32-15). Washington will play Fullerton at 12:30 p.m. Friday, followed by the 
Matadors against Maine at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be happier," Coach Gary Torgeson said. "It's gonna be a great 
tournament. I think these are good teams and they deserve to be here, but it's 
in our favor. They've got to come down to earthquake country to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors and supporters crowded into a local sports bar early Sunday 
evening to witness the announcement of the pairings via closed-circuit 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 All were holding their breath, fearing that Northridge, two-time defending 
Western Athletic champions, would be snubbed as a host because of the damage 
sustained by the campus in the January earthquake. Parking was the main 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the use of the tri-level parking structure, which collapsed in the 
earthquake, plans are being made to offer parking on the north end of campus 
and have fans shuttled to Matador Diamond.

THE WORLD OF HIGH (SCHOOL) FINANCE; THE CLASS RING. THE PROM. THE LIMO. HOW'S A 
SENIOR TO PAY? THEY ASK THE FOLKS, GET A JOB -- OR DO WITHOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A teen-ager with $1,000 once might have been considered wealthy. A car, a 
summer trip or a semester in college were all within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the money barely covers expenses many seniors encounter, as expensive 
keepsakes and flashy prom appearances slowly become traditional staples of the 
last high school hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell (students) that being a senior is almost like going through a semester 
in college," said Dino Stirpe, an English teacher at Verdugo Hills High School. 
"I tell them to get a summer job. They are going to need almost $1,000. Lots of 
kids feel pressure to do all of it. They don't want to be left out. . . . 
Unless their parents help them out, it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 For many students, even from schools in disadvantaged areas, senior year can 
mean an expensive prom night -- complete with the limo ride to a ritzy hotel -- 
class rings, yearbooks, announcements, pictures, key chains and other mementos. 
It all adds up. 
</P>
<P>
 Such luxuries have become tradition at many schools, and administrators say 
12th-graders feel they are entitled to such rites of passage. The result is 
that many seniors are finding it tough to cope with the high cost of high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned about the rising cost of everything related to school," 
said Mike Sullivan, principal at Fairfax High School. "But we don't have too 
much control. It's very hard to do anything, particularly when tradition has 
built up. Imagine changing something when you are talking to a senior who has 
been to three proms already and has loved every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many administrators say they have tried to cut back the amount of money it 
takes to participate in senior events. In many cases, they say, it is the 
students who keep costs high by refusing, in the name of tradition, to scale 
back. Still, for students who lack financial support, balancing the required 
with the desired can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "You end up not getting a lot of things," said Mendy DeMoss, a senior at 
Verdugo Hills. "I either have to save, ask my parents or go without." 
</P>
<P>
 The list of "traditional" senior expenses is long and includes some old and 
new temptations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Senior portraits -- the pictures that appear in yearbooks -- have always 
been a big deal for both parents and students. Packages range from $15.95 to 
$500 or more, according to Minneapolis-based Lifetouch Inc., the nation's 
leading school portrait firm. The average student spends about $150. 
</P>
<P>
 * Graduation announcements cost $50 or more, according to Jostens, a 
Minneapolis-based supplier of high school graduation materials. The price 
varies depending on the type and number ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cap-and-gown rental varies school to school, but tends to cost around $20, 
according to local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * A yearbook costs between $10 and $40. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though sometimes purchased earlier, a class ring can also be a big 
senior-year expense. Rings run from $70 to $250 or more, according to Jostens. 
Some seniors choose to buy an expensive ring and make payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Castellanos, a senior at Manual Arts High School, said his ring cost 
$480, which he pays off at $50 a month. "I'm proud of myself," he said. "I 
insisted. Now I have it -- no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Class of 1994" trinkets such as T-shirts, key chains, glasses and other 
items are popular and range from $3 to $15. In addition, seniors at all schools 
are bombarded with bake sales and fund-raisers for various events. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some schools charge "dues" as high as $50 to seniors to help pay for 
graduation and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many seniors plan a vacation either before or after graduation. Prices vary 
widely according to destination. A senior trip to Hawaii might cost between 
$500 and $700 and a two-week trip to Europe runs more than $1,700, according to 
travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Graduation-night festivities vary a great deal school to school, but most 
include both dinner and party components. Disneyland is a popular destination. 
Most schools charge about $50 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The prom is often the single largest expense a senior incurs. Dave Weinstein, 
activities coordinator at Palisades High School, said prom costs "can easily 
get up to $600 or $700. One kid orders the stretch (limo), the next kid gets 
the double stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets average $50 each. Local stores say tuxedo rentals range from $29 to 
$200. Women's formal wear costs between $45 and $200 to rent for an evening -- 
without accessories. And flowers range from $3 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Limousine costs are tallied by the hour and depend on the number of people 
traveling. Prices range from $35 to $45 an hour for six passengers to $105 an 
hour for 14 passengers. A six- to-seven-hour minimum is standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many think expensive traditions take hold only in wealthy areas, the 
trend seems to be universal. Hollywood High School, where 70% of the students 
are on the federal lunch program, is having its prom at the Miramar Sheraton in 
Santa Monica this year. Manual Arts High, in South-Central Los Angeles, held 
its prom at the Westin Bonaventure in Downtown Los Angeles last year. This 
year, it will be at the airport-area West Inn, formerly Stouffer's Concourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie Channel, a science teacher who coordinates the Manual Arts prom, said 
the school does its best to help students offset the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a traditional thing," he said. "Our approach is to get seniors who 
may not be able to go, to go. We do as many fund-raisers as we can throughout 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school saves money by opting for a less expensive menu and using 
facilities that provide free parking and security. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports can also cost seniors a great deal. Letterman's jackets run between 
$135 and $250 or more, according to Jostens. Though schools provide basic 
equipment, such as jerseys, pads, helmets, bats and balls, some athletes say 
there is a lot more to it. Almost all sports require special shoes or cleats, 
paid for by the student. Other expenses include braces, pads, jackets, 
T-shirts, special training camps or coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Amonie Akens, a senior at Palisades High School, said football season cost him 
$100 this year. "(School) pads are good, but they aren't good enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Cayson, a senior at Verdugo Hills, knows firsthand how expensive it is 
to be active. Christy, 17, was a cheerleader and a member of the drill team. 
She was also the football team manager, the school mascot and a member of 
student government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is an extreme case, but the price tag on her activities was more than 
$1,600 this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our senior year," she said. "It's the most important thing to us. It's 
only here once and it's not coming back. A lot of people really pay into it. . 
. . A lot of people are too embarrassed to say, 'I don't have the money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Christy's family helps her pay her way -- no small task. Graduation 
announcements cost $180. Her cap-and-gown rental ran $22. Then there was the 
class ring for $280, the letterman's jacket for $184, the $32 yearbook and the 
$70 homecoming dress. Friday night's prom will be $100, assuming she leaves 
tickets and transportation to her date. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the costs of drill team and cheerleading. Between the two 
uniforms, two sets of shoes, pompons, training camp (add a third uniform), 
competition fees, coaching fees and snacks for the football players, Christy 
said she spent an additional $780. All of this comes in addition to standard 
adolescent expenses such as gasoline, car insurance, lunches and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth it, as long as she minds her P's and Q's and stays active," said 
Tina Cervantez, Christy's mother, who has four more children to put through 
high school. "They have to earn it. But as long as their grades are up and they 
go to school and want to be involved, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Students cope with the expenses in different ways, but many have to work part 
time. Now that the cheerleading season is over, Christy has a job. Mendy DeMoss 
also works to help fund her senior year, logging 10 hours a week as a secretary 
for $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to work for everything I get," she said. "But when I really need 
something, something always comes along." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students baby-sit or work for their parents. But like the rest of the 
country, teens are also having trouble finding work.  
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate for 16-to-19-year-olds nationwide was 19.9% in April, 
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure for the entire labor 
force was 6.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not that much movement (compared to years past), but when you compare 
it to the general population, it's extremely high," said Abraham Mosisa, a 
bureau economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Amonie Akens, the Palisades High senior, said he has to trim costs because 
sports prohibit him from working. Instead of renting a limo for the prom, he 
will borrow his grandfather's car. On dates, he favors cooking at home and a 
walk on the beach over expensive restaurants and movies. And he often shares 
clothes with friends to stretch his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to sacrifice some things," he said. "But I got a class ring and I'm 
going to the prom. I try to ration as much money as I can because I don't have 
a job but I do have a lot of things that I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Though costs are high for seniors across Southern California, how high can 
depend on the area the school is in. At Manual Arts High School, for example, 
officials say standards are different than schools in more affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this area, the issues are more like, 'Do you have bus fare?' not a ring or 
a jacket," said Arlene Andrews, activities coordinator. "The students who can 
afford it do it. Some get extra jobs and the parents sacrifice. But if they are 
not so inclined, then they don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators do their best to offset costs. Dick Rippey, assistant principal 
at Hollywood High, said the school holds an annual candy sale to help cut 
costs. Students who sell can earn prom tickets and other expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the school district had to pick up the tab, none of these things would go 
on," said Sullivan, the Fairfax High principal. "If the school district had to 
do graduation, we would mail them their diplomas and say, 'Go with God.'

 He was cleaning out his closet. Poor choice of words. He was moving things 
around in his closet. Nothing ever actually made its way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, my husband was moving things around in his closet, making space for 
more things that he was not throwing away, when he said: "You know, I have 
stuff made by companies that don't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused and considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I have stuff made in countries that don't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 What a revelation! Would this be the moment that he realized he was carrying 
way too much baggage in life? That he needed to lighten his load? Doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 They say women are sentimental collectors. That their attics are crammed with 
baby clothes and handmade Mother's Day cards and letters from dear friends. 
That bulk trash pickup day is not scheduled with women in mind. That it is men 
who carry old boat engines and boxes of plywood to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in my house. Not my husband. It is I, and just about any woman I know, who 
sorts and sorts and throws out. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the day when they are all gone, I go through the house and collect 
their junk," my sister says. "I throw it out or take it to Goodwill. Then I 
deny it at the dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband works on barges on the river and he buys his work clothes from 
Goodwill. She's so afraid he is going to go shopping one day and actually buy 
his old clothes back. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor fellow was a charter subscriber to National Review in 1963 and he 
has kept every single copy for more than 30 years. Why? I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 30 years, I don't need a reason," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," he adds, "if I were to discontinue doing it, my wife might have reason 
to worry about the security of her position. I know she was tiptoeing around 
when I got rid of the car I'd had for 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Well she might. They've only been married 16 years. The magazines and the car 
had more seniority than she. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend's husband seems quite incapable of parting with his old running 
shoes. Instead, he just assigns them a new job description. All 12 pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are the racing running shoes and the daily workout running shoes," she 
says, "and the ceremonial running shoes and the coaching-baseball running 
shoes, the grass-cutting running shoes and the patio-party running shoes." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A Sunfish sailboat had been sitting under our deck since we moved in. Ten 
years. The mast had rotted and the sails had disintegrated, but the fiberglass 
hull was in great shape and a neighbor offered us $600 for it. No sale. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband had never sailed the single-handed boat on the raging Chesapeake 
Bay. It was a relic from his bachelor life in western Pennsylvania and a 
man-made lake so shallow that you could stand on its concrete-covered bottom if 
you capsized.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rosebud," was all he said when I asked why he would not sell. When you ask 
them why, they always have good reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 "I might make something out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to wear it when I lose weight." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be worth something someday," is the reason a friend heard when 
she told her husband that it was time he threw out the sports magazines he's 
been saving since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the free world knows the value except me, I guess," she says. "I 
told him that since we were moving and could use the extra money, it would be a 
perfect time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like an animal caught in my headlights, absolutely haunted. He 
mumbled something about how it wasn't the right time to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Such separation anxieties. My husband was so morose the day before bulk trash 
pickup, as he wheeled the old lawn mower ("I was going to fix it") to the curb 
at my command. But when he returned to add the gas-tank cap, the mower was 
gone. Bulk trash scavengers had taken the mower. 
</P>
<P>
 He realized that other men were throwing out their perfectly good junk, too. 
That night, late, he came to me wearing an old jacket ("It's still in good 
shape") and a ball cap pulled down over his eyes. "I'm going out there," he 
announced, setting his jaw. "There is great stuff out there."

 When Phillip met Diane, he found her attractive, easy to talk to -- different 
from the other girls in high school. After dating on and off for years, they 
married in their early 30s. Now, seven years later, their relationship is 
wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get married to have someone nag me about when I can go out," said 
Phillip, who spoke on the condition that his and his wife's real names not be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost a lot of my own identity. She wants to change me," added Phillip, 
who lives in the Los Angeles area with his wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seven-year itch" -- a phrase made popular by the 1953 play and subsequent 
movie with Marilyn Monroe -- is the struggle to maintain intimacy despite 
dissatisfaction or boredom that often arises during the seventh year of a 
marriage. For those who get mired in it, it's no joking matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After seven years, people can feel disappointed, hurt, depressed, lonely, 
miserable. The symptoms are right on," said Homa Mahmoudi, clinical 
psychologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After a courtship filled with romantic strolls and candle-lit dinners, couples 
marry in the glow of love, but the passion can get lost between the jobs, the 
dishes and the diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the seventh year, things have become routine," said Mahmoudi, who 
specializes in marriage and family therapy. "A lot of time has been focused on 
the career, the education of the children, the development of themselves. And 
not so much on their love, their sexuality, their passion. After seven years, 
they feel abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Phillip, turn to a lover instead of addressing these issues in the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoudi said affairs are common during this period. "I see it as a cry for 
help: 'I'm not satisfied in this relationship. I need your help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This period of marital re-evaluation and perhaps wandering isn't as 
predictable as the turning of the calendar, however. 
</P>
<P>
 One therapist estimated that it hits somewhere between six and nine years. It 
comes earlier to those who married in their early 20s and later for those who 
delayed marriage until their late 20s or early 30s, said Daryl Rowe, a 
therapist who practices in the Nubian Psychological Group of Los Angeles with 
his wife of nine years, Sandra Lyons Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of children figures into it, too. Couples who might have reached a 
crisis at four years -- a common point -- without the distraction of children 
instead find themselves as parents even more at odds at seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are individual biological clocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ages 30 and 40 are transitions that bring out the pressures of marriage. . . 
. You re-evaluate whether that is the person you want to get old with," said 
Rowe, who teaches psychotherapy and cross-cultural counseling at the Pepperdine 
University Graduate School of Education and Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting through this time can be a struggle for some couples, but when 
disaster strikes, it can be particularly tough, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It exacerbates it, underscores all the negatives," Mahmoudi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette and her husband were struggling in their marriage when a crisis hit in 
their seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant with their second child, Yvette found out at her five-month 
appointment that the fetus was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband "was not real understanding when the child was lost. We had a very 
tough time," said Yvette, who asked that her real name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Their constant arguments got worse and increasingly violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It escalated to the point that I said, 'This is sick.' Sick on my part, sick 
on his part. One of us is going to kill the other," said Yvette, who lives in 
the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple went to counseling, and have learned to communicate more 
effectively. Although they still struggle with some issues, they have 
celebrated 13 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-year period can be an opportunity for growth as it was in Yvette's 
marriage. And while some couples need counseling to get their relationships 
back on track, others simply need to do some negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the seven-year itch as a time that housecleaning needs to be done," 
Mahmoudi said. "Look at what garbage needs to be thrown out. And ask how can I 
make life more exciting and enjoy it more." 
</P>
<P>
 Housecleaning can be taken literally. A frequent bone of contention during 
this time is household duties, said Katherine Rieder, who works with divorcing 
couples as a mediator with All Valleys Mediation Center in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette said she and her husband have clashed on this issue and worked through 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we married, he didn't do anything," she said. "Not mop a floor, not wash 
a dish. That has changed drastically. He didn't change because he wanted to -- 
he had to. I'm not a slave, and I'm not trying to be superwoman." 
</P>
<P>
 Supportive people can also be a saving grace. Friends and family who encourage 
a couple to stay committed and connected can be as good as a therapist, Rowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Michelle Ventimiglia of Van Nuys, who have been married 16 years, are 
part of a community of six couples who have family barbecues, lend one another 
money and hold hospital vigils in time of sickness. 
</P>
<P>
 The support system for their marriage has been invaluable, said Gary 
Ventimiglia, a father of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples who have gotten caught up in the career and the kids also need to 
spend time with each other away from the children to revive their relationship, 
said Rieder, also a marriage and family therapist with Valley Counseling Clinic 
in Tarzana. "You'd be surprised how many couples don't do that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil and Jo Borboa of Northridge, who have been married almost 12 years, have 
made a point of spending time alone since their first child was born 7 1/2 
years ago. Between sitters, family and trading duties with friends, they go out 
to dinner twice a month and get away overnight every four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a difference with us. We can handle the crazy times and not go after 
each other when things get stressful," said Jo Borboa, who now has three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uninterrupted time to get reacquainted can get a relationship back on track. 
Do that for a while and it gets better than before," Mahmoudi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe has an acronym for how couples can come through this period stronger: 
L.A.U.G.H., which stands for Listen, Articulate, Understand, Generate 
Solutions, and Hug.

<P>
 "Wade is so selfish," sobs Lindsay, 34, who recently quit her job as director 
of placement for a university to stay home full time with their twin 2-year-old 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six years I've put up with him, but I refuse to do it any longer. Maybe 
if I take the girls and move to my mother's, it will shock him out of his awful 
passivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wade never pays attention to her, Lindsay claims: "He always tunes out when I 
start a conversation." Not that she expects him to cater to her every need, but 
"Is a little consideration, a little thoughtfulness once in a while, too much 
to ask?" 
</P>
<P>
 When they met, Lindsay found Wade's somewhat detached attitude refreshing. He 
didn't fawn all over her, the way her first husband had, and she was 
immediately attracted to this sexy man who was determined to leave his mark on 
the world. But now, only what Wade wants and needs is important. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay's chief complaint is that her husband never helps with chores or child 
care. He always works late at his marketing job, she says -- sometimes until 11 
p.m. Lindsay is exhausted and desperate for a break, but Wade gets angry and 
resentful when she tries to talk about it. "He loves to play with the girls, 
but makes it clear that runny noses are my job, my problem," Lindsay explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is another constant trigger for fights: "Wade always complains that I 
throw money around if I buy myself a new sweater. If he ever sat down and 
worked up a budget he'd see we don't have to pinch pennies. But God forbid I 
suggest we go out for dinner alone; he always claims it's too expensive and not 
as good as my cooking."  
</P>
<P>
 Wade, 34, admits he doesn't help much around the house, but as far as he's 
concerned, his wife never sees his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sounds like a broken record. I'm working hard to prove myself and make 
enough money to support this family, and she buys a cashmere sweater and wants 
to go out to dinner!" he exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay's constant criticism is not only undeserved, he insists, it's 
destroying their closeness. "How would you like it if every time you walked in 
the door, you were bombarded with a laundry list of things you should do and 
complaints about what you never got around to doing?" he asks. "Sure, I tune 
her out. What else can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, neither knows how to break the cycle of arguing that is making them 
feel like adversaries in a never-ending war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Lindsay and Wade are at a relationship impasse, so primed for a fight that 
just about any issue will trigger all-out warfare," says Neil Schiff, a 
psychologist in Washington. Like many couples, they don't realize that the 
words they use to present their feelings and needs can exacerbate problems. 
Before they can resolve their differences, they both need a vocabulary lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: Lindsay communicates with insults, blame and nagging. Wade plays 
ostrich to defend himself against his wife's carping. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the following vocabulary rules in mind can help them, and you, stave 
off arguments and zero in on long-lasting solutions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that certain words are time bombs. "Always" and "never" are signals 
that you are mounting a character assassination rather than initiating a 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't resort to threats. Announcing "I want a divorce," "This marriage is 
over," or, as Lindsay did, that she will take the kids away, is like pouring 
oil on a fire. You can't possibly have an intimate conversation if one of you 
feels the trust and basic foundation of your marriage is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refrain from making global statements such as: "Talking to you is 
pointless," "You're just like your father" and so on. Though you may be 
frustrated, this only hastens the end of the conversation without yielding a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Though all couples fight, once they learn to present feelings in a 
non-threatening way, they will end the power struggles and put the conversation 
on another, more focused level.

STREET SMART: ARROWS LEADING TO AIRPORT POINT DRIVERS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have gotten used to the confusing signs leading to the airport from the 
MacArthur Boulevard off-ramp coming from the north. I bet a lot of people not 
used to the signs continue to get in the wrong lane.  
</P>
<P>
 As you exit to MacArthur, there are three lanes. Immediately, there is a sign 
indicating that the left lane is for left turns onto MacArthur, the middle is 
to go straight into the airport, and the right is for a right turn onto 
MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing those signs, an airport-bound driver would get in the middle lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the curve, large white arrows are painted on the road. Again, the 
left-turn lane has a large arrow pointing left, the middle lane has a large 
white arrow pointing straight and the right-turn lane has a large white arrow 
pointing right. The driver heading to the airport once again is told to stay in 
the middle lane.  
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, maybe 50 feet ahead at the stop light, a fourth turning lane appears 
to the right. The middle lane of the off-ramp is now the second lane from the 
left and at the stop light it has a large white left-turn arrow painted instead 
of a straight-ahead arrow.  
</P>
<P>
 People either have to make a sudden cut into the right lane to go into the 
airport or ignore the left arrow on the road and go straight into the airport. 
Can anything be done to fix this?  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Simon, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Yours was among many letters Street Smart received on this subject. The trick, 
it would seem, is to ignore those painted arrows on the ground, which are 
misleading. And don't cling too tightly to the notion that those overhead signs 
are going to show you the way, either. They're not aligned correctly.  
</P>
<P>
 As you say, when the ramp becomes three lanes, the left lane has a left-turn 
arrow, the middle lane has a straight arrow and the right lane has a right-turn 
arrow. Don't believe it. Just ahead, at the traffic signal, that middle lane 
does indeed become a left-turn lane, and the right lane becomes a right-turn or 
straight-ahead lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem said drivers should pay attention not to the 
first arrows but to the signs overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem there is that the overhead signs are not properly aligned with 
the road. Caltrans' maintenance department is working to position those 
overhead signs so their arrows will align exactly over the designated lanes, 
Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart:  
</P>
<P>
 Please ask Caltrans if they are ever going to improve the interchange of the 
Riverside and Pomona freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bullock 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Coyazo, a Caltrans spokeswoman in Riverside, said improvements are 
planned for the interchange, but not until fiscal 1998-99, when funding becomes 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Readers: 
</P>
<P>
 A common theme among Street Smart letters is the condition of railroad tracks 
in Orange County. Reports are not glowing. Drivers often complain that rough 
rail crossings wreak havoc on their cars and that trying to report the problem 
crossings is an exercise in futility. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has more than 150 miles of railroad track that are divvied up 
among three main owners. Railroad crossing problems should be reported to track 
owners or managers. 
</P>
<P>
 When you call, provide complete information including the nearest cross 
streets and direction the tracks run.  
</P>
<P>
 * Metrolink: 76 miles of track; (800) 371-LINK. OCTA maintains and repairs the 
track it owns. Address written concerns to Metrolink, Customer Service, P.O. 
Box 194, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Fe Railroad: 20 miles of track; (800) 333-2383. This 24-hour number 
taps into Santa Fe's communication center in Topeka, Kan., which relays the 
information to local crews. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southern Pacific Railroad: 55 miles of track; (800) 767-3884 for a 
crossing-arm problem; (415) 541-1000 for exposed rails or other problems.

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 They can't expect people to car-pool unless we are encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't Caltrans put car-pool lanes on the Ventura and San Diego freeways? 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic could not be much worse with one fewer lane for the single passenger, 
and we car-poolers would become more numerous because we would be rewarded with 
our own lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Naness, Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 We have some good news and some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the good news: Construction is expected to start this summer on 
car-pool lanes for a 10-mile stretch of the San Diego Freeway between the 
Ventura and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder said the $18-million project will take just 
more than two years to complete. No existing traffic lanes will be consumed by 
the project, which will entail re-striping lanes and using parts of the freeway 
shoulder and median. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said work will be done at night to avoid traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, studies are under way to determine the feasibility of 
re-striping parts of the Antelope Valley Freeway to create car-pool lanes for 
the long-haul commuters of Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the bad news (or the good news for those who hate car-pool lanes): It is 
unlikely that the Ventura Freeway will ever play host to car-pool lanes. You 
can thank a handful of community members for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder explained that when Caltrans was preparing to widen the freeway a few 
years ago, local residents resisted the idea of car-pool lanes because they 
feared it would not do enough to speed traffic. So Caltrans added a fifth 
so-called "mixed-flow" lane to the freeway and abandoned the car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a student at Cal State Northridge, and I have a problem with the parking. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, green "Temporary Parking" signs were posted on 
surrounding city streets. Some of them were posted under existing red signs 
that said "No Parking" or that listed limited parking hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I parked on Vincennes Street, where there were both red and green 
signs, and was cited. When I called to contest the citation, they said that the 
"No Parking" sign took precedence over any other sign. How am I supposed to 
know that? I think it very confusing and extremely unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Michael Cohen, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, there should be no more complaints and confusion like yours 
anymore from the CSUN area: Last week all temporary parking on city streets 
surrounding CSUN was rescinded, because the university has recovered the number 
of spaces it had before the quake. In fact, there are several hundred more 
spaces than before, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But your question is still germane in light of the temporary parking signs 
that remain posted on a few side streets off Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks 
and around Warner Center in Woodland Hills. Both areas lost parking spaces 
because of damaged parking structures after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jack Reynolds of the city Department of Transportation, a green 
temporary parking sign should overrule red signs that declare no parking or 
limit parking hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's the rub: You are not exempted from other rules, such as those that 
forbid parking by a red curb, next to a fire hydrant or during weekly 
street-cleaning periods. Reynolds says many motorists who challenged citations 
discovered that the violation wasn't for parking in a previously off-limits 
zone but for breaking other regulations that still apply.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: IN NEWHALL, ANOTHER BATTLEFIELD SCENE BROUGHT TO YOU IN 
LIVING COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring is here and it's time to romp around in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 If one opts to head to Newhall, one may romp with a weapon in one's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Old Road in Newhall are several places where wars are fought on a 
regular basis -- using paint balls, not live ammo, we're happy to report. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the camps are for clubs whose members have all the equipment for this 
sort of leisure-time activity, but at Close Encounters, anyone from 10 to 100 
years of age with enough aggression, money and energy can drop by, pay up, gear 
up and go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 For $35, Close Encounters owner Mike Schwartz provides beginners with 
camouflage clothing, a helmet and paint balls, which cost $5 for 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon of choice to fire the paint may be anything from a pistol to a 
semiautomatic machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Saturday and Sunday, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., a new war game is 
started for participants every half hour. The $35 entry fee, according to 
Schwartz, is good all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, who was in the Navy during the Vietnam era but saw no combat, got 
good enough at paint ball that he played on a professional exhibition team 
called Sudden Death in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned in 1990 to the San Fernando Valley area, where he'd grown up, and 
opened his first field in Malibu, later moving it to Agoura Hills. It was 
burned in the Malibu-Calabasas fire, and he opened the Newhall facility shortly 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives instructions and explains game rules to the newcomers, who are 
divided into teams, with each team trying to capture the opposing team's flag. 
Three games are played simultaneously on Close Encounters' three 40-acre 
fields. Schwartz says the game attracts people of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "My game players are mostly professional people and their youngsters. We get 
lots of doctors, accountants, lawyers, people in high-pressure jobs. About 90% 
male. Women will come once and have fun, but the men will come back again and 
again," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also attracts locally stationed Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel who 
never get to see combat. "They like to come out and organize their own 
battles," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, he also books bar mitzvahs, including one where the guest of 
honor was the target, and everyone in the party got to hunt him, and bachelor 
parties, including one where a combat-ready woman soldier stripped down to less 
than her BVDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says that in addition to the fun and games, some corporations have a 
different reason for sending their people to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently the vice president of human resources from a Silicon Valley company 
brought down 60 people to play the game while he watched. He was interested in 
seeing them interact, seeing who would take leadership roles and do the 
organizing, and how people behaved under pressure," Schwartz says. Park Service 
Veteran Leaving for His Old Kentucky Home 
</P>
<P>
 William Webb, 60, is retiring after 30 years in the National Park Service. He 
was the first parks employee on the scene when the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area was dedicated in November, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Park Service, he had been a biology teacher and basketball and 
track coach at a school in Jenkins, Ky., and he's heading back to that area 
with his wife, Caroleen, this August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service sounds like a nice place to spend a professional lifetime 
smelling the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Webb, it wasn't quite as idyllic as all that. 
</P>
<P>
 After being hired by the service as a recreation specialist in Kentucky, he 
became the superintendent of Booker T. Washington National Monument, where he 
says he spent a great deal of time in daily negotiations with a local group 
that wanted to burn the visitor's center down. 
</P>
<P>
 His next assignment was as general superintendent for the Virgin Islands 
National Park and Christiansted National Historic Site, which must have been a 
good place to chill out. Webb then headed to the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area, where he was assistant and then deputy 
superintendent. He says there was some stormy weather during those days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were growing pains," says Webb. "Change often brings conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 At times he might have felt as if he were a referee, as various organizations 
fought to shape the way the area would be put to use. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is definitely looking forward to returning to his Kentucky home, 
although he says he will miss his friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't say anything about missing the fires, quakes and floods. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "The dress I want for the prom costs about $50 more, and has about two yards 
less material on top, than this one my mom wants me to wear."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; ON PINS AND NEEDLES; AFTER 70 YEARS, FAMILY 
TEXTILE BUSINESS SEES FUTURE UNRAVELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, Allan Franklin and Sidney Penchansky say, they really mean it. If 
they can't turn their North Hollywood textile business around in the next few 
months, the brothers-in-law vow to sell out, ending three generations of family 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go on at this rate," said Franklin, who with Penchansky is vice 
president of Levine Bros. Inc. Battered by burglaries, a fire, the Los Angeles 
riots, the recession and the Northridge earthquake, the company's sales of 
tailoring supplies and wool fabric have dropped 50% since 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin and Penchansky, who are married to the great-nieces of the brothers 
who founded the company, are making their last stand in North Hollywood, having 
ended the company's half-century in Downtown Los Angeles' garment district a 
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Levine Bros. has come close to closing. Franklin's 
father-in-law, who died in 1990, planned for years to wind it down, convinced 
that the market for custom tailoring supplies was receding before a tide of 
ready-made suits. He never quite got around to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, fire gutted the company's South Los Angeles Street building, 
causing $1.5 million in damage to the company. Family members again resolved to 
sell the assets and close the business. But there seemed to be no end to 
payments to collect and inventory to liquidate. And there was the problem of 
selling the damaged store, Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the brothers got a $500,000 mortgage for a new store on Lankershim 
Boulevard, hoping the market for custom-made suits would make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin, 56, who gave up his printing business to try to salvage Levine 
Bros., still can't talk about the decision without pressing his hands to his 
face. "I guess of the two of us, I'm the optimist," he said wanly. "I think we 
can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Since moving to the new location, sales have gained steadily, Franklin said, 
but the operation is still in the red. He's hopeful things will turn around 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine Bros. sells woolen cloth and sewing equipment to custom tailors, 
alteration shops, dry cleaners, department stores and Hollywood costume houses. 
Though 70% of sales are by mail order, the company's highest profit margins and 
what Franklin calls "the beauty of the business" is in its sales of fine cloth 
-- tweeds, crepes, gabardines and wool cashmeres -- to local tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of sales are related to the entertainment industry; fabric from 
Levine Bros. has been made into costumes for such movies as "Indecent Proposal" 
and "Bugsy."  
</P>
<P>
 Franklin is clearly at home selling cloth. He is a man who says he "goes 
bananas" if there isn't exactly half an inch of shirt cuff protruding from his 
sleeve. He used to do window displays for department stores, and although he's 
polite about it, he can't disguise his dismay at what most people consider 
comfortable attire these days. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Penchansky, 48, who gave up his taxi business to run Levine Bros., are 
hoping that an updated mail-order catalogue, a change in the region's economy 
and, if they're lucky, a revival in custom-tailored clothing will help the 
company survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on the next couple of months," Franklin said, adding that the 
company needs a 50% increase in its in-store sales this year to put it in the 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 The company they are trying to keep alive was founded in New York in 1923 by 
six brothers of a Russian immigrant family, said Elaine Franklin, Allan's wife. 
The Levine brothers moved in the early 1930s to Los Angeles' garment district, 
where the company thrived, even opening branches in San Diego and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers weren't fabulously rich, but they lived well. They passed the 
business on to their nephews while still living. The last of the original six 
was in his 90s when he died just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the store's success always hinged on demand for close-fitting, tailored 
clothes, a demand that has waned in the decades since stars such as Cary Grant 
wore suits that made their torsos appear as if they were chiseled from stone. 
"Everyone has decided to wear tennis shoes and jeans," Franklin said wearily, 
himself immaculate in a nailhead jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the company once had a score of competitors, today there are only about 
half a dozen companies in the country that cater to custom tailors, Franklin 
said. Levine Bros. now has 15 employees, down from 25 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, Franklin and Penchansky made healthy gains when they took over 
the business in 1990. They computerized the company, settled old debts, 
switched to cheaper insurance, doubled the inventory to $800,000 and 
concentrated on customer service. They were rewarded by a sales increase of 
about 15% in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Downtown Los Angeles neighborhood was getting increasingly rough. One 
burglary per month was the norm. Customers were afraid to come to the store 
because of crime. Those who did often found their cars had been burglarized 
while they shopped. Employees never dared stay past 5:30 p.m., Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on April 19, 1992, two weeks before the riots, the store caught fire. 
Franklin believes the fire was set by burglars, although fire officials said 
there was too much damage to determine a cause. The building was unusable, and 
tens of thousands of dollars' worth of inventory was damaged by water. Franklin 
braved the smoke to carry out a few yards of his finest cashmere blend cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 The business took up temporary residence in a leased warehouse near the 
boarded-up store, surviving on its mail-order business until it moved to its 
new quarters. "I didn't want to go Downtown anymore; my heart wasn't in it," 
Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several manufacturers and suppliers have left the Downtown district for some 
of the same reasons cited by Levine Bros., and that's a problem, said Barry 
Sedlik, manager of business retention for Southern California Edison Co., which 
is looking at ways to keep the garment industry in Los Angeles. He thinks the 
city must learn better ways to address the problems of small firms such as 
Levine Bros. or risk losing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much an industry where you need kind of a critical mass of 
companies together in one spot," Sedlik said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone told us where the garment district is moving, we'd go there," 
Franklin said, adding that the company's new spot in North Hollywood is at 
least close to many studios' costume houses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Franklin is watching for news that the economy is changing, 
and he's thumbing through trendy women's clothing catalogues for signs that the 
new season will bring a return of the tailored look he favors. In those pages 
he sees mostly loose-fitting, unstructured jackets and skirts. But he holds out 
hope that good tailoring, and good taste, will make a comeback.

DRUG FIRM'S BURST BUBBLE STUNS INVESTORS; PHARMACEUTICALS: THE FAILURE OF 
SCICLONE'S TRIAL OF A HEPATITIS MEDICINE SHOWS THE RISKS INHERENT IN 
BIOTECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without a product to market or its first dollar in sales, the small Silicon 
Valley biotechnology company counted on the allure of a promising experimental 
drug to entice investors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not disappointed. Buoyed by predictions of a drug with billion-dollar 
sales potential, investors drove up the company's stock market value to among 
the highest in biotech. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bubble burst for SciClone Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 In late April, the San Mateo biotechnology firm stunned investors by 
announcing that a potential therapy to treat chronic hepatitis B appeared to 
have flopped in an important scientific trial. Study results showed the drug, 
thymosin alpha 1, was no more effective than plain water. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone's shares, which had peaked at $27 in November, plunged 60% in a 
single day. The stock dipped below $5, a value that pegged the company's worth 
at no more than the cash on its balance sheet. The shares have rallied some 
since then, closing Friday at $7.625, up 37.5 cents in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone's problems come at a bad time for the industry. Capital-hungry 
biotech firms already face a financing crisis that has some experts predicting 
a major shakeout as weaker companies begin to run out of cash. Analysts cite 
the weak stock market, health care reform and the growth of managed-care 
companies as reasons for the money shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in the financing chill is the fact that many investors have 
soured on biotech after watching a series of drugs that looked great in the 
laboratory flop in human clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone's situation has made Wall Street even more jittery, said Dr. Charles 
B. Engelberg, an analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco who has 
been bullish on the San Mateo firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying they're not going to place their bets early in the biotech 
game," he said, explaining that investors may not put money into a company 
until a drug has passed several testing hurdles. "They will invest later and 
later based on this disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of institutions ponied up a lot of money for SciClone shares," said 
Evan Sturza, editor of New York-based Sturza's Medical Investment Letter, who 
is skeptical of SciClone's prospects. "This is an incident that will leave a 
very bad taste in investors' mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, SciClone had the appearance of a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in 1989, adopted a business strategy that is unique in 
the industry. Unlike most biotech firms, it employs no research scientists and 
has no expensive laboratories or technical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, SciClone's plan is to buy the rights to promising "late stage" drugs 
that have faltered at other companies, continue their development and bring 
them to market. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop 
a drug from scratch, the company can focus its resources on drugs with some 
record of safety and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone acquired the rights to thymosin in 1990. The drug -- originally 
developed by Hoffman-La Roche Inc. -- has been lauded as a potential cure for 
chronic hepatitis B, a disease that has 300 million carriers worldwide, most of 
them in China, India, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia and Latin America. About 
350,000 of those people are believed to have the type of chronic disease for 
which thymosin is designed. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug, a synthetic hormone, is expected to be cheaper to manufacture and 
have fewer side effects than Schering-Plough Corp.'s alpha interferon, the only 
U.S.-approved drug for chronic hepatitis B. In earlier, smaller clinical 
studies in the United States, the drug proved more effective against hepatitis 
B than did alpha interferon. The drug has been approved for use in Singapore 
for hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullish analysts have estimated that the worldwide market for the drug could 
be worth several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone's partner in thymosin's development, Bethesda, Md.-based Alpha 1 
Biomedical Inc., was also battered by news of the recent clinical findings. 
Alpha manufactures the drug and has marketing rights in the United States and 
Europe. SciClone owns the marketing rights in Asia, potentially the drug's 
biggest market. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone and Alpha have been locked in a yearlong legal fight over marketing 
and manufacturing of the drug. Last week, the companies said they are 
discussing a deal in which Alpha would relinquish full worldwide marketing 
rights to the drug in exchange for SciClone shares. 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone officials and analysts say they are puzzled over the negative data in 
the recently completed study of 99 patients at test sites in Los Angeles, Miami 
and Detroit. They note that the results show an extraordinarily high 
"remission" rate among patients who took a placebo -- or patients who got 
better without taking thymosin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is a situation where we have a trial with incomplete and 
inconsistent results," SciClone Chairman Thomas Moore said. "Now we're in a 
position of having to explain why this trial has an aberrant data set." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said SciClone and Alpha, which oversaw the clinical study, are still 
trying to analyze the data. Alpha officials had discussed the results with 
SciClone "in very sketchy fashion" the day before the data was released 
publicly, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The rocky relations between SciClone and Alpha led some observers to question 
whether results from the recent clinical tests may have been deliberately 
tampered with -- a charge both companies strongly deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say the recent tests signal that the drug is unlikely to work. 
Sturza says the prospects for thymosin have been overblown by SciClone 
officials and bullish analysts who have referred to it as a "billion-dollar 
drug." He contends that much of the interest in the company came on the basis 
of a small preliminary test. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery Securities' Engelberg continues to rate SciClone a "speculative 
buy." He predicts the stock could earn $4 a share within two years of the 
drug's launch. That would put a value on SciClone stock of more than $100 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given all the published data taken on balance, we believe that the evidence 
still supports the efficacy of (thymosin) in the treatment of hepatitis B," 
said Engelberg, a doctor of internal medicine. He said the next crucial test 
for the drug is a 150-patient clinical study taking place in Taiwan, but those 
results probably won't be known until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, which has taken a lot of heat from angry investors for its support 
of SciClone, was a co-underwriter with Smith Barney Shearson of SciClone's 
secondary stock offering in January. SciClone sold 2 million shares at $23.25 
each, raising $46.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore says the negative results have forced the company to take "an enormous 
amount of corporate energy" explaining to investors and others what went wrong. 
He says the company, which has $80 million in cash set aside, still believes 
the drug works. 
</P>
<P>
 And others say Wall Street's punishing reaction to the results show once again 
that investors still don't understand the high risks of biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important trial and it's a negative that the drug didn't do well," 
said Kenneth Lee, Ernst & Young's director of life sciences industry services. 
"But that is not an ironclad conclusion about the power of a drug candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at a drug at any point of time as the final story is also risky," he 
said. Falling Prices 
</P>
<P>
 SciClone Pharmaceuticals' stock price took a beating last month when the 
company disclosed disappointmenting results of an experimental drug to fight 
chronic hepatitis B. Monthly closes, except latest: 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: $7.625, up 37.5 cents.

WOULD-BE RIVAL PLANS CHALLENGE TO PHONE FIRMS; TELECOM: TELEPORT WANTS TO OFFER 
LOCAL SERVICE TO COMPANIES PROVIDING ACCESS TO COMPUTER RESOURCES SUCH AS THE 
INTERNET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's illegal for anybody but the local telephone monopoly -- presumably 
Pacific Bell or GTE -- to offer local telephone service in California, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Teleport Communications Group, a would-be rival of those two giants that is 
backed by the cable TV industry, has asked the state Public Utilities 
Commission for permission to introduce local phone service on a limited basis 
to companies seeking to provide access to the Internet and other computer-based 
information resources. 
</P>
<P>
 If the PUC grants Teleport's request, which was presented to the commission 
Friday, it will simply be making kosher an activity in which Teleport is 
already engaged, more or less. 
</P>
<P>
 By an interesting quirk -- one perhaps technically in violation of 
telecommunications regulations -- Teleport is providing local exchange service 
on a very small, experimental scale to a San Francisco start-up company that 
plugs its 100 customers into the Internet, the expansive network of electronic 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling Internet "gateway" company, called Hooked, sought out Teleport's 
services after a Centrex system installed by Pacific Bell in mid-March failed 
to meet its needs. 
</P>
<P>
 By not charging Hooked for the connections, Teleport maintains that it is not 
reselling local phone service and therefore not acting illegally. But company 
officials acknowledge that Pacific Bell might view things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeking to provide this service in response to consumers who have had 
so much trouble with their monopoly phone company that they are literally in 
danger of being put out of business," said Jim Washington, Teleport's western 
region vice president, based in San Francisco. "Our customers are desperate for 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, California regulators disclosed their intention to deregulate the 
state's telecommunications industry, basically opening long-distance and local 
markets to unbridled competition by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a camel insinuating its nose under the tent, fast-growing Teleport -- a 
10-year-old firm based in Staten Island, N.Y. -- hopes to position itself to 
take advantage of deregulation through the fiber-optic networks and switching 
capabilities it has in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Teleport already has a robust business linking corporate customers to 
long-distance carriers in more than 150 major markets, including Los Angeles, 
San Francisco and San Diego. Local phone service would be a natural extension, 
and Teleport officials said they expect the company will have as many as five 
customers like Hooked within a year if the PUC grants its request. 
</P>
<P>
 Teleport is owned by a bevy of telecommunications and media powerhouses, 
including Cox Enterprises Inc., Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and 
Continental Cablevision Inc. Time Warner Inc. has also agreed to buy a stake. 
</P>
<P>
 David Holub, a founder of Hooked, testified about his experience Friday at a 
hearing in Sunnyvale before state regulators and representatives of the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which is wrestling 
with deregulation, access and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, he said in a telephone interview later, Pacific Bell has offered 
to supply the connections he needs and has apologized "for all the confusion." 
However, he added, he would prefer to stick with Teleport's service, which he 
said is technically superior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a bit of an Internet poster child," he said ruefully, "a small 
company trying to get off the ground." Competition, he said, would benefit 
customers like Hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell has maintained that it favors competition but wants to ensure 
that all contenders operate under the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would appear that Teleport is trying to prematurely offer (these) 
services," said Michael Runzler, a spokesman for Pacific Telesis, the parent of 
Pacific Bell. He said the company will oppose Teleport's application. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry, meanwhile, says Pacific Bell itself is trying to sneak 
into new business lines ahead of regulatory approval. Last week, the California 
Cable Television Assn. asked the Federal Communications Commission to look into 
whether Pacific Bell has begun building a statewide video network before 
receiving the necessary federal approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone company acknowledges that it will begin laying new cable this month 
with video in mind, but it insists it will not offer video services until the 
FCC gives its OK.

 Two U.S. Citizens Sentenced in Bank Swindle: The Americans, convicted of 
trying to swindle $10 billion from a Chinese bank, lost their appeals and were 
sentenced to prison terms of 14 and 20 years.It was one of the most serious 
swindles ever attempted against a Chinese bank, and consequently the sentences 
were among the heaviest handed down in China against U.S. citizens. Francisco 
Hung Moy, 45, and Raymond Lee, 44, Chinese Americans, were being held in a 
prison in Shijiazhuang, 174 miles southwest of Beijing. The official Xinhua 
News Agency said Moy was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Lee to 14 years.

 FTC Applies Labeling Rules to Food Advertising: The Federal Trade Commission, 
as expected, said it will generally apply federal food labeling rules to food 
advertising. The FTC said advertisers should adhere to U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration definitions of such buzzwords as low and lean and that such 
phrases as packed with should meet FDA standards for high in a specific 
nutrient.However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer 
organization, said the FTC did not go far enough. The center said the FTC rules 
allow advertisers to stress the healthful aspects of a food containing 
undesirable levels of fat or sodium as long as those levels are disclosed. The 
FDA does not permit foods with high amounts of sodium or fat to make health 
claims on their labels. The FTC regulates advertising while the FDA regulates 
food labeling.

 Sizzler Plans to Raise Cash, Boost Shareholder Value: Los Angeles-based 
Sizzler International Inc. is considering selling its 89 Kentucky Fried Chicken 
restaurants or its Buffalo Ranch concept in an effort to raise cash and boost 
shareholder value. Those are only two of the options Sizzler is considering, 
Chairman James Collins told Bloomberg Business News. Collins said a KFC sale or 
Buffalo Ranch spinoff are still "ideas," not definite plans, and that Sizzler 
hadn't made any decisions on them yet.

FRANCE, BRITAIN AVOID COLLISION OVER AIR RIGHTS; TRANSPORTATION: THE 
LAST-MINUTE ACCORD GIVES BRITISH CARRIERS ACCESS TO ORLY AIRPORT IN PARIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 France and Britain on Sunday narrowly avoided a showdown over landing rights 
at Paris's Orly airport, resolving a dispute that threatened to escalate into a 
commercial air war. 
</P>
<P>
 An accord reached by the two nations will give British carriers access to 
Orly, as demanded, but will allow the French some time to adjust to the change, 
which could hurt France's already-hobbled state-owned carriers. It will also 
assure better French access to Heathrow and other London airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement halted a show of force planned for today by British airlines. 
The carriers had said they would fly to Orly despite France's refusal of 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten flights were reportedly scheduled to participate. They will now be sent to 
Charles de Gaulle airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no British planes arriving tonight or tomorrow" at Orly, French 
Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said in a Sunday radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint statement issued by Bosson and his British counterpart, John 
MacGregor, said the two agreed to open air traffic to Orly and to London 
airports as soon as possible and "at the latest by the end of June." 
</P>
<P>
 British airlines said the accord amounted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective all along was to secure our right to fly to Orly and we have 
done that," British Airways chairman Sir Colin Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 TAT European Airlines, British Airways' French subsidiary, said it was pleased 
to "note that the French government is committed to respecting the decision" by 
the European Union Commission, which ordered France to open Orly to British 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways and TAT said they are confident that daily flights to Orly 
will start well before the June deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways plans four flights a day from Heathrow to Orly. TAT is also 
planning four daily flights. Air U.K. plans six. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began April 27, when the European Union ordered France to open 
Orly to British airlines. Complaints by state-run Air France and Air Inter, 
which carries passengers within France, pushed the French government toward a 
political crisis with Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 British airlines, which land at Charles de Gaulle airport, had hoped to 
capture some of the lucrative market of passengers flying from elsewhere in 
France through Orly. 
</P>
<P>
 Those flights have traditionally been reserved for Air Inter, a subsidiary of 
Air France. 
</P>
<P>
 France announced Wednesday that it would not comply with the ruling and that 
flights by British Airways, TAT and Air U.K. between London and Orly would be 
considered illegal. Paris argued that the European Court of Justice had to rule 
on France's appeal of the European Union ruling before Orly was opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was the latest clash within the European Union over efforts to 
lower trade barriers within the 12-nation trading bloc and spur competition. 
</P>
<P>
 France has on several occasions been caught between its policy to promote 
European unity and its wish to protect certain sectors of its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition has already hobbled Air France. The carrier lost about $1.4 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosson called the air agreement balanced, saying it will allow the opening of 
Orly to British carriers "without haste," permitting the two countries to 
resolve issues of safety, environment and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The British, in return, "have agreed to work with us on a balanced opening of 
London airports, particularly Heathrow," Bosson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discord came amid newly achieved harmony between France and Britain after 
the recent opening of the Channel Tunnel.

TOP CORPORATE LEADERS ARE OPTIMISTIC; ECONOMY: MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COUNCIL 
SAY THEY'RE CHEERED BY HEALTHY U.S. GROWTH AND SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND IN EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's top corporate executives are optimistic about business prospects, 
and not even the cloud of further Federal Reserve Board interest rate hikes is 
darkening their mood. 
</P>
<P>
 During their semiannual meeting in this Colonial city, members of the Business 
Council said they are looking forward to a better-than-expected year thanks to 
healthy U.S. economic growth and unexpected signs of a pickup in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the pace of growth is constructive. It is a good pace of growth," 
Chemical Bank Chairman Walter Shipley told reporters. "Europe will provide an 
impetus to the U.S. economy, particularly this time because American industry 
is much more competitive, much more export-oriented than it was." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of executives reported an unforeseen pickup in European sales in 
recent weeks. Many said they had expected sales across the Atlantic to remain 
flat this year as Europe continued to struggle out of the economic doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last eight weeks, Europe has picked up surprisingly well," General 
Electric Co. Chairman John Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, business is very good all over the world, including Europe," 
AlliedSignal Inc. Chairman Lawrence Bossidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture with one of America's most important trading partners, Japan, 
was not so bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan, we see no sign of life," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The executives said they do not believe that recent and anticipated moves by 
the Fed to raise short-term interest rates will slow sales appreciably or 
discourage businesses from making planned investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all in favor of keeping the lid on inflation," American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co. Chairman Robert Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, the central bank has raised short-term interest rates three 
times in an effort to slow growth and reduce the likelihood of a buildup of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists believe Fed policy-makers will decide again Tuesday to raise 
rates when they meet to determine the course of monetary policy over the next 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co., said the Fed is doing the 
right thing and needs to move its credit policy to a more neutral stance after 
being accommodative for the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is more (economic) activity and there is growth, and therefore 
you don't need an accommodating monetary policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An economic outlook released by the prestigious business group predicted the 
U.S. economy will expand by a healthy 3.1% from the last three months of 1993 
to the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation has probably hit bottom for the current business cycle, the forecast 
said. But it did not call for prices spiraling out of control. Instead, the 
group predicted that prices will remain flat or increase slightly, with 
inflation of 4% or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers appear to be resisting price increases, but some industries are 
finding the ability to raise prices slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar Woolard, chairman of DuPont Co., said his chemical firm in recent weeks 
has been able to recapture some of the price erosion suffered during the last 
few years of global economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business has improved considerably since we were here six months ago," he 
said.

 Victory for Stac in Microsoft Dispute: Microsoft Corp. will have to withdraw 
from distributors thousands of copies of its DOS operating system software 
under terms of a preliminary ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in 
Los Angeles.Rafeedie also said he intends to deny a Microsoft request to halt 
further shipments of disk-compression software made by Stac Electronics. In 
February, a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay Carlsbad, Calif.-based Stac 
$120 million for infringing on patented technology used in Stacker, a software 
package that allows users to more than double the available space in their 
computer hard disks.

 U.S., Japan Make Progress on Trade: Three months after a summit standoff, the 
two governments agreed to try to end the stalemate and strike a new economic 
deal.In a 30-minute telephone call, Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor settled on the need for "preliminary 
contact" -- a small step forward in their slow dance toward a trade deal. At 
issue is Japan's $131-billion trade surplus, which President Clinton says is 
corroding relations between the world's two biggest economies. Formal talks 
broke down Feb. 11 at a White House summit, and since then all bets have been 
off as Japan's government lurched from crisis to crisis.

 Joblessness Continues to Dog European Recovery: New forecasts by the European 
Union project that unemployment -- already at a record high 10.9% -- will climb 
to 11.7% before year's end, even as the Continent's economies emerge from 
recession. Economic Affairs Commissioner Henning Christophersen said the data 
underscores the importance of such proposed reforms as deregulating labor 
markets, shrinking social security systems, slicing budget deficits across 
Europe and boosting public works spending.

 AT&T to Raise Business Long-Distance Rates: The nation's largest telephone 
company said it is boosting the price of long-distance calls for businesses by 
4%.It said the increases will apply to most domestic and overseas calls and 
800-number services. It will not apply to basic long-distance service or flat 
monthly fees. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said the higher rates, 
scheduled to take effect June 1 pending government approval, will help it cover 
the rising cost of doing business. Some services are exempted from the 
increase, such as Pro (R) WATS calls, Teleconference Service and data 
communications services.

 Intel, AMD Owners Object to Takeover Defenses: Shareholders of Intel Corp. and 
Advanced Micro Devices have asked the companies to get rid of the "poison pill" 
defenses intended to fend off hostile takeovers. The vote was taken at Intel's 
annual meeting May 4 in Albuquerque, N.M., and AMD's meeting in New York on 
April 27.Intel is the largest maker of microprocessors and AMD is Intel's 
leading competitor. Neither vote was binding. Intel's directors had opposed the 
motion but agreed to do what shareholders asked; AMD's directors haven't 
decided. Poison pills are generally issues of new stock intended to make it too 
costly for a bidder considered undesirable by management to gain control. 
Institutional investors requested the firms to drop their poison pill defenses.

 Banks Call Off Merger: GBC Bankcorp and First Public Savings Bank said they 
have terminated plans to merge because the Federal Reserve Board had 
discouraged GBC, the parent of General Bank of Los Angeles, from pursuing the 
deal. The companies said the Fed advised GBC to "focus its management and 
financial resources" on General Bank. First Public has a primarily 
Cantonese-speaking clientele, while GBC's customer base consists mainly of 
Taiwanese immigrants who speak the Fujian dialect.

 Airports May Go Private: Treasurer Ralph Willis said he expects to win Labor 
Party approval at the party's national conference in September to sell the 
nation's airports.The government wants to sell all of the Federal Airports 
Corp.'s 17 fields, which are valued at $1.5 billion, but leftists in the party 
rank and file oppose further sales of major state assets. Under the plan, 
Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport, Sydney's Mascot Airport and smaller regional 
fields would be sold off. The proposal has drawn interest from foreign 
operators. Among them is Lockheed Air Terminals, a division of Calabasas-based 
Lockheed Corp., which operates five U.S. airports.

THE PACIFIC; BIG HEADACHES FOR BREWERS WITH SMALL DREAMS; JAPAN: PUB OWNERS WHO 
WANT TO MAKE THEIR OWN SUDS BLAME BUREAUCRATS FOR KEEPING A 'LOCAL BEER' 
REVOLUTION OUT OF REACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nobuhisa Iwamoto has everything he needs to start Japan's first brew pub: 
shiny new equipment, training in the beer brewing arts and a cozy restaurant in 
a good location. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, that is, except a license to make the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 A government move April 1 to loosen rigid regulations on beer making has 
raised hopes for a jibiiru , or local beer, revolution by making it easier for 
smaller breweries to get a license. But Iwamoto's 25-seat pub -- like countless 
others -- is too small. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless they relax the rules more, it's still going to be tough to make money 
as a microbrewer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the limited change in brewing regulations reflects the reluctance 
of Japan's elite bureaucrats to loosen their grip on the economy and may bode 
ill for other areas of economic deregulation set in motion by former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still slaves to the bureaucrats," says Iwamoto's father, Mitsuo, who 
owns the pub. It is named Sankt Gallen after the ancient St. Gall monastery in 
Switzerland, where the oldest written records of beer brewing were found. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the old law requiring brewers to produce at least 2 million liters 
per year in effect limited the market to a few huge companies, which tend to 
put out similar products. 
</P>
<P>
 That limit was slashed to 60,000 liters a year, the same as for brewers of 
Japanese sake, or rice wine. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's still a lot of suds. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to make enough beer to get a license, a bar would have to sell 164 
liters of beer a day, or about 300 pint-size mugs. That's about six times more 
than Iwamoto can serve in his restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, Iwamoto confines his brewing to beer with 1% alcohol, which is 
allowed under the law. He also serves bottles of regular beer, with about 5% 
alcohol, made at his father's brew pub in San Francisco and brought in as an 
import. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of an explosion in microbrewing similar to that in the United 
States has captured popular interest here far more than the relatively mundane 
deregulation issues such as banking and trucking. 
</P>
<P>
 Microbrewing took off in the United States after the industry was liberalized 
in 1979. Today about 350 small breweries and brew pubs offer an alternative to 
mainstream labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Finance Ministry says the government's tough brewing controls are 
needed to ensure profitability for the brewers and, thus, a steady flow of beer 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 45% per bottle, tax revenues from beer amount to about $14 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But several industry experts agree with brewing consultant Yotaro Yanase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government, as usual, has been protecting large companies and doesn't 
want to let new ones in," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there are many signs of growing interest in local beers, which 
some aficionados see as a way to reject Japan's mass-market culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic," Yanase says. "There is great potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if deregulation does produce Japan's first independent breweries since 
the 1950s, it may be some time before small brew masters such as Iwamoto get 
their chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling as he serves up a sample of his latest creation -- a medium-bodied, 
fruity amber ale accented with cascade hops -- Iwamoto, 31, says he's glad he's 
still young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things take such a long time to change here," he says. "I'll just have to 
wait."

 Unemployment Rate Eases: The jobless rate in April fell to a 32-month low of 
10.1% from 10.3% in March. The number of employed people rose by 5,800, the 
government announced. The jobless rate was lower than most analysts had 
expected, but employment growth fell below predictions.

 Phone Plan Outlined: The government unveiled its $40-billion plan to speed up 
expansion of its telecommunications network so every urban Chinese family has a 
phone by the end of the century, the official China Daily reported. The 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications proposal foresees a far more ambitious 
expansion than originally planned. Telephone exchange capacity will grow from 
42 million lines now to 140 million lines by 2000, the newspaper said.

 More Foreign Cars Sold: Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in April rose 
45% from a year earlier to 24,254, the sixth consecutive monthly gain, 
according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Assn.Imported cars have reached a 
record 8.4% of the Japanese market, the Japan Automobile Importers Assn. said. 
Sales of domestic autos have posted year-on-year declines since April, 1993, 
the data shows. Import sales were boosted by demand for Honda's U.S.-made 
Accord and other new models, such as the German Mercedes-Benz C Class and the 
Swedish Volvo 850 station wagon, and by lowered prices on Range Rovers, 
Chryslers and other foreign-made vehicles.

 Foreign Insurers Will Be Allowed: The government said it will permit foreign 
insurance companies to set up units in the country in an attempt to boost its 
chances of joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The move will 
also help the country become a regional business center, the finance ministry 
said. Taiwan now allows U.S. insurance companies to operate branch offices. 
Insurers from other countries are permitted to open representative offices. 
Industry observers lauded the long-expected move to loosen investment 
restrictions, but they predicted that the impact on business will be limited.

 Sharon McManus, general manager of American Travel in Tustin, says that 
although the travel industry is constantly changing, the key to success in her 
field is consistent customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing tangible to give our clients except service," said McManus, 
who began her travel career 15 years ago. "I have a plaque on my office wall 
that says, 'Follow the Habit of Rendering More and Better Service Than You Are 
Paid to Render.' It's a great thing to remember because it will win you repeat 
customers and keep you in business." 
</P>
<P>
 McManus got her start in the travel industry while working at Emulex Corp., a 
Costa Mesa computer firm. As assistant to the president, she was responsible 
for making business travel arrangements and planning out-of-town meetings. 
Eventually she formed an in-house corporate travel department at Emulex. Two 
years ago, she became general manager of an independent travel agency in 
Tustin, handling both vacation and business travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of rewards in this field, especially if you enjoy change," 
said McManus, who likes the excitement and pace of corporate travel as much as 
the fun of planning vacations. "I get to live out my travel fantasies through 
my clients. Someone is always heading off someplace fantastic, and I get to 
help map it all out." 
</P>
<P>
 McManus said she has found that the keys to success in keeping clients are 
consistency and enthusiasm. She makes sure that corporate clients get the same 
agent when they call the agency for help planning a trip. "That way the agent 
learns the client's likes and dislikes. We build profiles on people to remind 
us where they like to sit on a plane, what kind of bed they prefer, what kind 
of car they like to rent," she said. In going the extra mile for a customer, 
"the rewards will always come back twofold in some form or another." 
OCCUPATION: Travel Agent 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Agents plan trips for individuals and groups. They make 
arrangements for lodgings, tours, meetings and transportation. Some specialize 
in vacation travel, others in business accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most complete a one-year course offered by community 
colleges or trade schools. Training includes instruction in computers, 
communication and customer service skills, and airline and cruise ship fare 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of agents is projected to increase by 15.4%, to 
1,720. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Typically $1,200-$1,800 per month plus commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Agents are eligible for reduced rates on hotel and resort lodgings, 
air fare, car rentals, and train tickets in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Must adapt to a variety of client temperaments and needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: May become travel agency or corporate travel managers. Many 
open their own agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "Service is what we are all about. I teach my staff to treat every 
client as though they were about to lose them. That way each client gets the 
best possible treatment." -- Sharon McManus, general manager, American Travel

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: ARBITRATION CAN SOLVE DISPUTES WITH 
BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have a sticky dispute with a broker that can't be settled amicably, 
there is a viable and fairly low-cost way to settle it: binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Securities arbitration, which allows an impartial third party to resolve 
broker-client disputes, is the mandatory form of settlement procedure when 
brokers and their clients get into a rift. That's because most brokerage firms 
require customers to sign arbitration agreements when they open accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of arbitration are clear: Cases are heard fairly quickly -- 
usually within a year, compared to up to five years in civil courts -- and the 
cost is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that there is little, if any, chance to appeal an adverse 
decision. Unless the arbitrator is biased or had a clear conflict of interest, 
the decision is legal and binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitration filing fees range from about $30 for a small case in which the 
amount in dispute is less than $1,000, to $1,800 for cases where the amount is 
more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs can represent themselves or be represented by anyone they choose. 
They do not need to hire a lawyer or an arbitration specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts recommend hiring a professional when the dispute involves a lot 
of money. That's because the brokerage is almost always represented by an 
attorney; big-money disputes are usually stickier and more hotly contested, and 
a General Accounting Office study found that customers were much more likely to 
win when they were professionally represented. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a fairly small claim -- anything less than $10,000 -- you can take 
it to "simplified arbitration," which is the arbitration industry's counterpart 
to small claims court. Simplified arbitration is faster, simpler, cheaper and 
more fruitful for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the average securities arbitration case takes roughly 10 months to 
complete, simplified arbitration procedures are generally finished in five. 
</P>
<P>
 In-person hearings, technical motions and attorneys are generally unnecessary. 
Frequently, the only cost to the investor is the filing fee, which varies 
depending on the size of the case and whether the investor requests an 
in-person hearing or is content to handle the matter by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 An investor is also more likely to win a simplified arbitration case than an 
ordinary securities arbitration case, says Samantha Rabin, managing editor of 
the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a New Jersey-based newsletter that 
tracks securities arbitration statistics. Investors who go through simplified 
arbitration win roughly 70% of the time, compared to about 50% of the time in 
ordinary arbitration hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you file an arbitration claim? 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is to find out which regulatory organization has jurisdiction 
and the requisite expertise to handle your dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several organizations that handle securities arbitration hearings, 
including the New York, American, Pacific, Cincinnati and Philadelphia stock 
exchanges, as well as the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board. In many cases, you can choose the forum you 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, about 80% of the securities cases are heard by the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, which can arbitrate any dispute that arises out of the 
business of a member firm. In other words, disputed trades with NASD member 
companies can be taken to the NASD, regardless of what type of security the 
broker was selling.  
</P>
<P>
 If the dispute involves municipal bonds or options, the NASD may recommend 
taking the dispute to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board or Chicago 
Board Options Exchange, where arbitrators presumably have more experience 
dealing with problems specific to these investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Your next step is to call the sponsoring organization and ask for information 
and any forms necessary to file your claim. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, if your claim is for a substantial amount, you'd want to hire an 
attorney or arbitration specialist. State bar associations can usually refer 
you to securities litigators in your area. Arbitration firms, which are usually 
staffed by former securities brokers, are listed in the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure to discuss fees and charges before you hire a professional. There is 
a wide variation in what experts charge to take your case to arbitration. Many 
attorneys work on an hourly basis, with rates ranging from $125 to $450. Some 
are also willing to charge a flat rate to prepare arbitration documents, if you 
want to represent yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitration firms, on the other hand, typically charge an up-front fee of 
about 5% of the amount you are claiming, plus filing fees. If you win, the firm 
will take between 15% and 30% of the amount you recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you filed suit to recover $100,000, the arbitration firm would 
require a $5,000 deposit, plus filing fees of roughly $1,000. If you won 
$50,000, the firm that charged the 15% contingent fee would take an additional 
$7,500 -- for a total of $13,500. The firm that charges 30% would take a 
$15,000 contingent fee, resulting in a total cost of $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also ask for references. The firm should be able to give you names and numbers 
of other individuals they have successfully represented. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a relatively small claim and opt to handle it yourself, be sure to 
carefully follow the instructions provided by the sponsoring organization. Also 
make sure you provide the arbitrator with all the documents necessary to prove 
your claim, as well as a detailed narrative -- including dates and times -- of 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitrators are less likely than judges to throw a case out on a technicality, 
but it can still happen. And, because these decisions are so difficult to 
appeal, you want to make sure to present the most complete and compelling case 
possible. Tips From the Experts 
</P>
<P>
 Want to increase your chances of winning a brokerage dispute? Here are some 
suggestions from the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Write it down: When you opened your account, you told the broker that you 
have very little tolerance for principal risk and you need access to your cash. 
He put you in an illiquid limited partnership and maintained that you told him 
you were a speculator looking for a good tax shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's your word against the broker's, your chances of winning a dispute are 
50-50. But if you confirmed your conversation in writing shortly after you 
opened the account -- and you saved a copy of the letter -- your chance of 
winning an "unsuitable recommendation" dispute are much improved, says Samantha 
Rabin, managing editor of the Securities Arbitration Commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check account statements: You say you failed to read your account 
statements, so you didn't notice that your broker bought the wrong stock until 
a year later. He says you authorized the purchase. If there was a mistake, he 
would have corrected it if you told him promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the arbitrator believes you, he may rule against you because a 
reasonable person should have discovered the error far sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Complain: If you find or suspect problems -- improper trading, 
misrepresentation, unsuitable recommendations -- ask a trusted financial 
adviser to review your account. If the suspicions are warranted, complain to 
the broker, the brokerage firm's branch manager and the firm's compliance 
department immediately. Make sure you clearly state what the problem is, how 
you discovered it and what you want the firm to do about it. Make these 
statements in writing. And be sure to keep copies for your records. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arbitrate promptly: One of the biggest mistakes investors make is not filing 
arbitration claims until years after a problem occurred, experts say. That 
presents two problems: First, there are federal and state statutes of 
limitations that could nullify your claim before it's ever heard. Second, 
arbitrators may question the credibility of investors who allow illegal or 
improper activity to continue for years before objecting, says William Levine, 
chief executive of Investors Arbitration Services in Woodland Hills.

 King of Ratings: Stephen King's four-part, eight-hour miniseries "The Stand" 
received the highest Nielsen ratings of any ABC miniseries in eight years -- 
20.3 with a 31 share -- for an average audience of 19.1-million people. The 
network, which said the ratings "exceeded expectations," is already going into 
production for next season on another King project, "The Langoliers," a 
four-hour miniseries about 11 passengers on a jet who wake from naps to find 
that everyone else on the plane has disappeared, including the pilot and crew.

 Still Rolling: They're not getting older, they're getting richer. The Rolling 
Stones sold out two shows at New Jersey's Giants Stadium in just 81 minutes, 
said band spokeswoman Fran Curtis. After selling out the Aug. 12 and 14 dates 
with a top ticket price of $50, the band added an Aug. 15 show, which did not 
immediately sell out. Tickets for the first two shows went faster than they did 
five years ago for the group's "Steel Wheels" tour, which earned the 
fiftysomething band $65 million. Tickets for the band's Oct. 19 show in 
Pasadena's Rose Bowl go on sale Saturday. STAGE

issues of cultural identity and the role Highways plays in shaping that work. 
The festival will feature more than a dozen artists who have performed at 
Highways, including Marga Gomez, Ron Athey, the Hittite Empire, Mehmet Sander 
and Tim Miller. The festival was conceived to "help Londoners understand the 
important cultural dialogues that have begun in Los Angeles," said festival 
co-curator Jordan Peimer.

'SOUTH CENTRAL' AND REAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerning "What Ever Happened to Equal Access for All?" by Robin Y. Deane 
(May 9): I really enjoy Fox Television's "South Central." In my 26 years of 
living in South-Central Los Angeles, I have encountered all kinds of 
personalities, including those of the characters on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that some of us in our slang do use the "N" word. If you are a 
young black male, growing up here, your life is in peril due to gang violence, 
the police and drugs. There are many strong black women who, after being laid 
off, have had to turn to welfare to feed their families. Many of us in general 
are suffering from companies laying off. The rebuilding of Los Angeles is a 
myth. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not an easy depiction to watch, but imagine living it! Blacks who want 
to assimilate into mainstream society have many gripes with this show. All of 
us, in one way or another, have found ourselves dealing with the myriad issues 
on "South Central." As for the people who believe that all blacks are the same, 
no television show is going to change a racist mind.

 Thanks for giving us the Claire Rydell Counterpunch, "Composers Milk a 
Dead-End Aesthetic" (May 2). I too have wished that "just once I would see a 
review of new music that expressed even slightly what I felt."Her comments may 
be as close as I will ever get. 
</P>
<P>
 I scan the concert program to see if there is a "West Coast Premiere." If so, 
I rationalize that the orchestra must enjoy a chance to make something other 
than music, to play in the mud, as it were. I can't begrudge them that. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I eagerly await the review in which the critic will rave about this 
"Premiere" and sigh about the rest of the program. I want to be responsive to 
new music, but does it always have to be the worst piece on the program?

 I am extremely puzzled by John Randolph's statement in his May 2 Counterpunch 
that his 1966 film "Seconds" was the first major film to be shot in 
black-and-white since the advent of color films ("A Few Thoughts on Rock Hudson 
and Another Man Named John . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
 The "advent" of color dates to the late '30s, with such classics as "Snow 
White," "The Wizard of Oz" and "Gone With the Wind."But I suppose 1955 is as 
good a year as any to consider the turning point when virtually all films were 
shot in color. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's give Randolph the benefit of the doubt and call 1960 the dividing 
line between monochrome and rainbow cinema. If we do that, there are such 
landmark films as "Psycho" and "The Apartment" (1960), "The Longest Day" (1962) 
and "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1963), to say nothing of 1965's "The Pawnbroker," 
all of which are more "major" than "Seconds," which I can't recall ever seeing.

COUNTERPUNCH: ALL ARTISTS CAN'T HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLTON HESTON, Charlton Heston is a stage, screen and television actor, 
producer and director. He received the Academy Award for best actor in 1959 for 
Ben-Hur and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1977. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article exploring the Artists Rights Foundation's effort to establish 
creative control over their work for all filmmakers examines a longstanding 
controversy about how films are made and who gets to make the choices 
("Fighting to Keep Movies as Their Makers Intended," Calendar, April 26). The 
foundation, though including established filmmakers, doesn't understand the 
realities involved. 
</P>
<P>
 As further reported in the trade press, the foundation cites the French 
example, hardly inspiring. The French film industry is subsidized by the French 
taxpayers and the American film companies, whose films are dominant in the 
French market and taxed with every ticket sold. 
</P>
<P>
 A film is made in three distinct time frames: pre-production, shooting and 
post-production. First comes the script and casting, then locations and 
schedule. Depending on who's more important to the project, the director and 
the lead actor have strong voices here. The studio's choice is final, but 
they're likely to accommodate the preferences of both director and star. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in my career, I was granted these approvals, though if the likes of 
Willy Wyler or George Stevens was directing, you deferred to them. With Cecil 
B. DeMille (who financed his own films), John Ford or Alfred Hitchcock, the 
question never came up. This is true today of Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese 
. . . and very few others. 
</P>
<P>
 During shooting, unless he's badly over schedule, the director has the helm. 
The inevitable script changes are resolved on the spot, largely between 
director and actor. The studio takes a hand if disaster strikes, when the 
director can be fired (this would not conceivably happen to any of the 
above-mentioned directors). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last, crucial stage is post-production, when the film is finally made. In 
the end, the studio controls this. They paid for it, they own it. The copyright 
laws prevail. As both actor and director, I've often railed against this 
reality, but I can't deny it. (Writers Guild of America president and 
foundation board member) Frank Pierson says this is like "saying the Pope 
painted the Sistine ceiling." It's an apt analogy. The Pope didn't paint it, 
but he owned it. It was his chapel, he paid for the paints, he hired 
Michelangelo (I know, I painted it for him). 
</P>
<P>
 Film is the art form of the 20th Century, the American art form, and an art so 
expensive that (especially nowadays) no filmmaker can afford to fund his own 
films. It's also an art involving many creators. We concede total creative 
control to the Wylers and Scorseses, the Spielbergs and Fords; does this extend 
to their fellow guild members? And what about the other guys? Can the editor 
impose his first rough-cut assembly on the final version of a film, or the 
cameraman insist that his favorite tracking shot be included in the release 
print? What about the production designer, the makeup artist? Are we not all 
artists? 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, guys. If you want total artistic control, if you want final say on 
what happens to your film when it appears on television, home video, airplanes 
. . . do what Chaplin did. Write the script and the music, direct it, and play 
the lead yourself. Also, pay for the movie. Then, you own it.

MUSIC; SALONEN OFFERS PLODDING MOZART, VITAL BRUCKNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen said a temporary farewell to his Los Angeles Philharmonic 
audience at the Music Center this weekend with a program that used the lyrical 
intimacies of Mozart as a prelude to the dramatic complexities of Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Bruckner fared better than Mozart. Far better. The young 
maestro once again suggested that he thinks best when he thinks big. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mozart's "Prague" Symphony stimulates Salonen's imagination -- or even 
commands much of his attention -- he kept his interest a secret on this 
occasion. He went through the proper motions diligently and intelligently. He 
kept the beat clear, and the textures lucid. But he seemed bored. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempos plodded until Salonen finally perked up for the presto finale. Nuances 
were generalized and accents blurred. Articulation remained dull. Repeats 
sounded merely repetitious. 
</P>
<P>
 Charm? Forget it. Pathos? Not a whiff. 
</P>
<P>
 One was nagged by the suspicion that Salonen regarded Mozart's lyrical miracle 
merely as a throat-clearing exercise. Bruckner's Third Symphony, which came 
after the early intermission, obviously represented the important business at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 One can recall more propulsive performances of this sprawling, ultra-Germanic 
masterpiece. One certainly can think of performances that were more successful 
in concealing the inequities of Bruckner's inspiration, not to mention the 
clumsiness of his transitions. One can imagine performances more sensitive to 
the delineation of subtle detail and the ongoing need for forward propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one had to admire the rigid authority of Salonen's approach and the 
breadth of the dynamic scale he enforced. One had to applaud his cool 
analytical acuity even when embroiled in the awesome contrapuntal thicket. 
Salonen found no terror in Bruckner's vast architectural detours, no 
embarrassment in his swollen rhetorical conundrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, perhaps, Salonen treated the massive convolutions with the 
same respect that he lavished on the mundane meanderings. Bruckner blithely 
juxtaposed the ridiculous and the sublime, as if both were sublime. He got 
carried away with a folksy Landler one moment, embarked on a multilayered 
examination of the tragic superhuman spirit the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen projected the inherent whimsy with elegant grace, and he defined the 
cataclysmic climaxes with elemental force. He never strained, however, never 
stooped to exaggeration or distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 He deserved his ovation. So, not incidentally, did the mighty Philharmonic, 
which played with the brilliance in depth reserved for special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 This concert was the first given by the orchestra since the sudden "amicable" 
departure of its stalwart, longtime concertmaster, Sidney Weiss. The 
Philharmonic management usually marks such milestones with speeches, program 
tributes, public presentations and other sentimental gestures. But all was 
quiet on the Pavilion front this time. One had to wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One also had to wonder why Weiss chose to end his Philharmonic career so 
abruptly. He could have waited, after all, for the end of the season, which lay 
just three weeks away. (Salonen's last stand of '93-94 is to be followed by two 
weeks with Roger Norrington.) 
</P>
<P>
 One also had to wonder if Weiss is still scheduled to play the Barber Violin 
Concerto with the Philharmonic at Hollywood Bowl on July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Official spokespersons mustered no useful answers. Strange things are 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 And, speaking of strange things, Ernest Fleischmann, impresario in residence, 
used a lengthy program insert this weekend to hawk the forthcoming summer of 
alfresco raptures. Most striking, perhaps, was his reference to one soloist, 
Gidon Kremer, as "probably the most interesting among the world's truly great 
violinists." 
</P>
<P>
 One had to wonder how that critical judgment will make the other truly great 
fiddlers feel when they come to town. One also had to wonder about the untruly 
great ones.

THEATER; 'MADAME MAO': JUST ONE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Madame Mao's Memories," now playing at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage, makes you appreciate the artistry of "Evita." 
</P>
<P>
 Both shows are true stories about former actresses who rose to the heights of 
power through the use of sexual favors, who inspired passionate admiration and 
abject fear. But "Evita" was far more satisfying and not just for being a 
full-blown musical with all the flashy Andrew Lloyd Webber trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
 The insertion of Che Guevera as a commentator on Eva Peron kept the story 
honest. Every time the audience fell under the sway of those outstretched arms 
and tearful entreaties, Che put the legend in her place -- mocking her, 
separating the woman from the image she so carefully cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
 But in "Madame Mao's Memories," the woman who helped lead China's violent, 
repressive Cultural Revolution of 1965-1976 gets to tell the whole story 
herself in flashback form from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a choice on the part of playwright Henry Ong, who writes in his notes 
that he wanted a one-person play because Madame Mao herself "wouldn't want to 
share the limelight." But writing from Madame Mao's point of view leaves out 
crucial questions, such as why she embraced the book and theatrical bannings, 
the executions, the persecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can infer that in eliminating the classics she was trying to obliterate 
her own unhappy past. But you have to infer quickly because Ong swiftly moves 
her past the Cultural Revolution, barely glancing at the violence. And during 
the trial that followed Mao's death in 1976, Ong barely challenges her 
insistence that she was only following her late husband's orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still Ong, who has been working on the text since its 1989 Los Angeles debut, 
is to be commended for turning the spotlight on the former Jiang Qing who died 
a scant three years ago after a lengthy incarceration in China's Qin Cheng 
Prison, a now forgotten woman whose fierce will helped her husband rise and 
stay in power. He has written a role that allows versatile actress Kim Miyori 
to shine, moving gracefully from old age to exuberant youth with no makeup 
changes and minimal costume alterations as designed by Andrew V. Yelusich -- 
prison garb to sexy red kimono to youthful shorts and top. 
</P>
<P>
 Seret Scott directs sensitively within the play's limitations. Michael 
Gilliam's lighting brilliantly suggests leaps in setting and time against the 
backdrop of Yelusich's stark, gray prison set. But an hour and six minutes of 
this intermissionless show leaves you wishing for more of something else. More 
insight into Madame Mao, more voices of people who knew her, who suffered 
because of her. Ultimately, despite Madame Mao's imagined wishes, it is unfair 
to make her the final judge of her own life. 
</P>
<P>

COUNTERPUNCH: NEW MUSIC MERITS RESPECT, NOT ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT GOLDSTEIN, Burt Goldstein, a composer and computer consultant who lives 
in Santa Monica, has composed for concert stage, film and television and is an 
editor of computer books for Prentice Hall. He received a Ph.D in music 
composition from UCLA in 1981 and is president of the Independent Composers 
Assn., a nonprofit corporation that has supported local composers by producing 
concerts for 17 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish to respond to Clare Rydell's Counterpunch article, "Composers Milk a 
Dead-End Aesthetic" (Calendar, May 2). I am president of the Independent 
Composers Assn., a nonprofit alliance with an open membership that has 
supported local composers by producing concerts of their music for the past 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rydell takes exception to a mildly favorable review in The Times of our April 
6 concert with a wide-ranging diatribe. She attacks the concert and its 
producers, the Times critic, the "unholy alliance" of all critics with all 
composers (who she amusingly claims "have almost complete say" in what the 
public hears of new music), Schoenberg, "the musical explorations of our 
century," the universities and "democracy itself, (the notion) that somehow we 
are all equal . . . and anybody who can play the piano can sign up and receive 
a crown conferring the title 'composer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Times was remiss in failing to identify Rydell as the wife of a well-known 
professor and composer at UCLA, Paul Reale, whose music was not represented on 
our concert. Because my music was on the concert, it would be unfair to your 
readers if I wrote for The Times about the concert without revealing who I am. 
Since Reale is a competitor to other composers in finding an outlet for his 
work, your readers might see Rydell's article in a different light if her 
relationship had been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in wondering why modern music, and our concert, sounded so bad to 
her, Rydell blames the university system "for awarding meaningless degrees to 
individuals with little technique and less artistic skill." And when Rydell 
complains that our concert makes her feel as if she's stepped into a "time warp 
from 20 years ago," it would have helped your readers to know that the opinions 
about the evils of 20th-Century music in Rydell's article are quite familiar to 
those of us who, like Rydell and myself, heard Reale's lectures at UCLA in the 
'70s. In fact, two of the composers on the concert, myself one of them, were 
awarded degrees under Reale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because Rydell is married to a composer, she should know better than to write: 
"Why is it the case that people with such vested interest, the composers, have 
almost complete say over what the audience is going to hear?" This reminds me 
of "Amadeus," when Mozart's patron, the Count, complains: "Too many notes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rydell is unclear whether she is complaining that composers have the right to 
write what notes they wish or whether she believes that composers typically 
control what gets played in new music concerts. In any event, most musicians 
know that composers do not have "almost complete control" over what pieces are 
programmed; this is almost always a political decision between the performing 
group and the venue manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Rydell proposes a solution to the "total waste of everyone's time" she deems 
musical explorations of our century to be: "Maybe it is time to bring back the 
patronage system in which works were created for people who expected to like 
the work they'd paid for, not to be assaulted by it."  
</P>
<P>
 The cover of the program notes for our concert says "ICA Presents Newly 
Commissioned Works Sponsored by the S. Mark Taper Foundation" in large type. 
Our patron did like the works it paid for, and as a result, some of our works 
are scheduled for performance in Europe this fall. The patronage of new music 
is alive today. The "assault" seems to have been provided by Clare Rydell 
Reale.

MUSIC REVIEWS; L.A. BAROQUE DELIVERS HIGH-ENERGY HANDEL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took L.A. Baroque, as the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra seems to be calling 
itself these days, some time to deliver the requisite polish to match its 
enthusiasm Friday in the acoustically friendly confines of First Presbyterian 
Church, Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 With the start of the third selection, a majestic Sonata in G for two violins 
and continuo, the Handel program kicked into gear, evidencing the high level of 
professionalism this brave little band has achieved during the eight years of 
its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolianne von Einem, the Southland's own world-class Baroque fiddler, ably 
seconded by L.A. Baroque founder-director Gregory Maldonado, provided elegantly 
sculpted lines and all the rhythmic vitality one could desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, soloist Edward Murray made a virtue of necessity: the necessity 
of playing the familiar Concerto in G, Opus 4, No. 1, on the harpsichord when a 
suitable organ could not be found. His imaginatively decorated, technically 
unimpeachable performance made the substitution not only easily digestible but 
a thorough delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Another work familiar in a different guise, but with the choice left to the 
soloist by the composer, is the sublime Oboe Concerto in G minor, which on this 
occasion proved no less effective on the alto recorder, played with spirited 
virtuosity and commanding stylishness by Marianne Richert Pfau. 
</P>
<P>
 The full ensemble put the finishing touch to the evening -- and to L.A. 
Baroque's current season -- with the Concerto Grosso in F, Opus 3, No. 4, which 
began in pompous gravity and ended in the airborne brightness of Handel's 
minuet at its most fetching. HERBERT GLASS

 "Strindberg on Film" continues Tuesday at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art's Bing Theater at 8 p.m. with director David Giles' splendid 1968 film of 
"The Dance of Death." This priceless record of a masterful National Theater 
Company of Great Britain production stars Laurence Olivier and Geraldine 
McEwan, very much Olivier's match in bringing to miserable life a couple who 
have been called "two of the most demonic characters in all literature."  
</P>
<P>
 Playing with it is Alf Sjoberg's astonishing "Karin Mansdotter" (1954), a 
romantic historical tragedy centering on the teen-age mistress (Ulla Jacobsson, 
in the title role) of the flighty 16th-Century King Erik XIV (Jarl Kulle). A 
straightforward adaptation of the play is bracketed by a prologue done as a 
silent melodrama and an expansive, eloquent epilogue in which Sjoberg imagines 
what Karin's ultimate fate might be like.

 The UCLA Film Archive and Visual Communications' ninth annual Los Angeles 
Asian Pacific Film & Video Festival, the largest event of its kind in the 
world, opens Thursday at 7 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz Theater with Huang Jianxin's 
terse, stunning "The Wooden Man's Bride." Also screening during the festival's 
opening weekend is Zhang Yuan's laconic "Beijing Bastards" (Saturday at 9 p.m. 
at Laemmle's Grande). The first film, set in the 1920s, is as formal as the 
second is spontaneous, but both are equally outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang's film is in the stark tradition of the modern Chinese cinema of 
depicting the utmost suffering and hardship, so often directed toward women, in 
the most beautifully composed of images. A series of confounding events forces 
a young woman (Wang Lan) to marry her recently deceased fiance in effigy, 
represented by a carved wooden bust held during the wedding ceremony by a 
virile young retainer (Ku Paoming) of the bride's family who has now become a 
member of her formidable mother-in-law's household. It's not hard to guess that 
attraction will set in between the two young people with dire consequences, but 
the surprise is the film's bravura finish, into which you may read the most 
rebellious of political sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen vibrant shoot-from-the-hip low-budget films of alienated young 
people adrift in big cities from filmmakers the world over, but "Beijing 
Bastards" is modern China's first truly independent production. It deals with 
the young proprietor of a small club, trying to get his act together once his 
girlfriend, who has announced she's pregnant, promptly cuts out, and it also 
unravels the struggles of a rock band that has never been granted official 
permission to perform publicly. Ironically, the film has an engaging immediacy, 
while its music, overly derivative of standardized Western rock, seems banal.

 Filmmaker Pratibha Parmar joined forces with author Alice Walker to make the 
sensitive, scary 54-minute documentary "Warrior Marks" (at the Nuart Saturday 
and Sunday only, at 11 a.m.), an informative, forceful protest against the 
ancient but cruel and dangerous tradition of female genital mutilation, still 
widespread in Africa, Malaysia and Indonesia. Through dance, individual 
testimony and on-camera interviews Parmar and Walker show the folly and 
oppressiveness of the often unsanitary and excruciatingly painful practices 
designed to destroy female sexuality to render women less threatening to men.

 Mary Haverstick's "Shades of Black" (Sunset 5, Saturdays and Sundays at 11 
a.m.) is an exceptionally impressive debut feature. This persuasive 
psychological drama features superior portrayals by Jennifer MacDonald as a 
virginal 23-year-old photographer pursued by Trisha McComick's seductive 
somewhat older woman, an artist whose formidable manipulative powers hide a 
dangerous mental instability. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a bit long, especially for a film with so abrupt a finish, "Shades of 
Black" -- made entirely in and around deceptively benign and bucolic Lancaster, 
Pa. -- is a powerful reminder of how vulnerable we can be to clever crazies.

MUSIC REVIEWS; SIDLIN CONDUCTS IN SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the weekend, the season-long parade of guest conductors in Santa Barbara 
came to a sighing close, and not a concert too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Murry Sidlin, currently holding a post with the San Diego Symphony 
and principal guest conductor-elect at the Oregon Symphony, was the ninth 
contender for the post of music director left vacant by the death of Varujan 
Kojian a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What the season gained in variety, it lacked in the cohesion of having a 
single figure at the helm. We were left with a rotating baton policy in which 
the candidates were always at least competent, sometimes impassioned, sometimes 
insightful. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidlin, graced with a bit of each of those qualities, delivered a cleanly 
articulated and balanced-enough program. At its best, the orchestra realized 
Handel's Concerto Grosso, Opus 6, No. 7, with fitting composure and 
reflectiveness, equipped with a sense of both momentum and delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 A scaled-down orchestra for Handel contrasted with expanded ranks for Leonard 
Bernstein's "Chichester Psalms," bolstered by the estimable presence of the 
Santa Barbara Choral Society and the luminous presence of soprano Sylvia Wen. 
Bernstein's uneven work amounts to a liturgical showpiece -- with too much 
emphasis on the show -- in idiom somewhere between Broadway-ish syntax and a 
stirring brand of modernity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting emotional-historical gears, Sidlin elicited an amiable, romantic 
sweep for Brahms' Second Symphony. Lucid phrasing, surging force and fine 
textural coherency marked the orchestra's reading of the work, treated like the 
sporting, genteel romantic vehicle that it is. It offered audience-friendly 
closure to the Saturday performance at the Arlington Theatre, and to the 
season. JOSEF WOODARD

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; GARCIA DRAWS DEADHEADS IN DROVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Fairgrounds raceway here is just a field of dirt, a place normally 
home to demolition derbies or midget car races. But when the Jerry Garcia Band 
played Saturday evening, it became the Grand Ballroom of Club Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 With the other stops on Garcia's swing through Southern California at more 
traditional venues, the colorful Deadheads turned this into a holiday-like 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Many arrived early, playing Hacky Sack and socializing on the beach just 
outside the venue, losing themselves in the scene until Garcia and his 
five-member group started playing and the throng rushed into the arena to dance 
and spin in the inimitable Deadhead way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcia Band has become a solid and consistent attraction -- perhaps even 
more so than the Dead -- in the last several years of touring. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place for Garcia to shift the focus away from his own writing and onto 
his influences, and with each show he digs deeper into the treasure trove of 
(mostly) American music: soul, gospel, country and blues providing most of the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections ranged from Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" to the Band's "The 
Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," each song rising and falling along the 
shifting dynamics of Garcia's trademark, fluid guitar soloing. 
</P>
<P>
 And with each show, it seems, the JGB becomes more truly a band in its own 
right, rather than just a side-trip for Garcia. Keyboardist Melvin Seals is an 
especially strong asset, his soulful, churchy Hammond organ solos fueling the 
excursions as much as Garcia's guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 The soul-gospel undercurrent is furthered by the background vocals of Gloria 
Jones and Jackie LeBranch, while longtime Garcia bassist John Kahn seems to 
follow the leader's instrumental flights with a sixth sense, and new drummer 
Donnie Baldwin (a former member of the Starship) gives the band a kick it often 
lacked in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with its relative focus and compactness (i.e. no "drums and space" 
free-form digressions), the JGB might even appeal to non-Deadheads. They'd 
probably still not loosen up to the point of doing the Deadheads' goofy 
air-grab dancing, but they'd be able to sing along to many of the classic songs 
and might have a good enough time to be tempted to buy the latest souvenir: 
"Grateful Fred" T-shirts being sold in the parking lot, sporting an 
illustration of Mr. Flintstone all decked out in tie-dye. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, with its grounding in American music, this is bedrock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jerry Garcia Band plays Tuesday and Wednesday at the Starlight Bowl, 
20007 Pan American Way, San Diego, 7 p.m. $25 in advance, $26.50 at the door.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; ANTHRAX MIXES STYLES WITH POWER, PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York speed metal quintet Anthrax has picked up a wide range of fans over 
the last decade, from alternative to metal. Thanks to its collaboration with 
Public Enemy, the band has even charmed the hip-hop crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Bands often come off calculated and compromised when blending such diverse 
elements, but Anthrax shows no signs of either. On Saturday at UC Irvine's 
Crawford Hall, the group -- which mixes the aggressive rush of hard-core punk 
and creative melodies with tribal beats -- played with a strong, natural 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
 A solid and confident John Bush, the band's new lead singer, topped the 
booming songs that rocked the hot campus gym. Formerly of Armored Saint, Bush 
sang in deep and controlled tones that never seemed strained or rushed, even 
over the high-speed noise. He occasionally traded lines rap-style with rhythm 
guitarist Scott Ian. The group also sang anthem-like numbers in unison, causing 
the mainly male crowd to shout the lyrics back. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which played under a basketball hoop and scoreboard, pounded out a 
bottom-heavy beat that was so powerful it seemed to come from two drummers. The 
wood floor shook until the groove broke for galloping speeds driven by thick, 
but never shrill guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 They kicked off one song with the recorded laughter of Beavis and Butt-head 
and frequently talked with the audience as if they were all old friends -- 
which made sense. Anthrax is a band to believe in. LORRAINE ALI

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; 'STUTTERING JOHN' NEEDS BETTER BACKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When movie or TV-radio stars moonlight as singers, it's usually a case of 
marginal talents trying to cash in on their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Is John Melendez, a regular on Howard Stern's radio show as "Stuttering John," 
just another hard-rock hopeful who can't sing? 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, no. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not speaking Steven Tyler, but Melendez does have some talent. Backed 
Friday night at the Roxy by a trio that played every cliche in the book, 
Melendez shrieked -- without stuttering -- some material from his debut album, 
"Stuttering John." 
</P>
<P>
 While there was passion and energy in his vocals and guitar-playing, there was 
no real grit or imagination in the music. He badly needs better material and 
stronger accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Stern had been hawking this engagement all week on his radio show, the 
Roxy was far from filled and even those on hand weren't all that enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of his set, Melendez walked off stage, obviously hoping for 
applause to bring him back for an encore. Despite just a smattering of 
clapping, he came back anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 During his between-songs chatter, he stuttered only a few times -- with the 
drummer dutifully underscoring each episode with a drum roll. On the way out, 
one fan grumbled that Melendez should have stuttered more: "I wanted him to 
stutter like he does with Howard." DENNIS HUNT

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; CARNEY FRONTS SOLID GROUP AT LUNARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slinging out one zesty hand-crafted number after another, pianist-composer 
James Carney fronted a choice quintet Friday at Lunaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the selections played in the first two sets were taken from 
Carney's new "Fables From the Aqueduct" album, a collection that uses life in 
Los Angeles as a loose thematic center. 
</P>
<P>
 These tunes revealed a composer who unabashedly employs a sweeping stylistic 
palette, from rollicking, New Orleans-Second-Line-ish to slow and moody to 
surging with a brisk tempo inferred, but never actually stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney and his band mates -- Scott Mayo and Chuck Manning (saxes), Derek 
Oleszkiewicz (bass) and Dan Morris (drums) -- played this often thorny, but 
ever-rewarding material with considerable spark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yoknapatowpha Blues" found Carney following Manning's volatile, 
stomp-your-foot lines with clean, bluesy phrases and long, swerving scales. On 
"Queen of the Tangent," Mayo segued from swirling, circular thoughts to 
stuttered moments, while Carney used chords to melodic advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Carney warrants some increased recognition in the modern jazz 
trade. ZAN STEWART

WASHINGTON INSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON and ROBIN WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RACING THE ELECTORAL CLOCK: Democratic leaders are in a sweat trying to get a 
campaign finance bill passed by early summer, before election-year pressure 
forces changes that lawmakers would find even more odious. House Speaker Thomas 
S. Foley (D-Wash.) said House and Senate leaders believe that they can wrap up 
informal talks on a compromise measure this week, clearing the way for rapid 
final approval. But a threatened GOP filibuster in the Senate could sabotage 
the plan. . . . Negotiators have had the most trouble with proposals to curb 
political action committees and to give public subsidies to congressional 
candidates who agree to spending limits. The Senate-passed bill would ban PACs; 
the House would allow PACs to continue giving candidates up to $5,000 per 
election. A compromise cap may be $4,000. . . . Foley suggested that leaders 
have agreed to slap a steep registration fee on PACs to help fund the campaign 
subsidies.

 IRONY IN YEMEN: War is often punctuated with strange footnotes. To wit: A 
group of 200 former Palestinian guerrillas were in Yemen, training for a new 
role as police officers after years of war with Israel. But when civil war 
erupted, they suddenly had no place to go. For days, as Westerners, Saudis and 
others fled the country, everyone, including the United States, refused to help 
the Palestinians get out. The new peace officers eventually escaped to Egypt 
when Saudi Arabia changed its mind and provided assistance, according to 
diplomatic sources. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 DITTO IN TUNISIA: If that weren't irony enough, consider this recent episode 
involving Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. . . . 
First, some background: Richard Nixon was the President who with his national 
security adviser, Henry Kissinger, banned all U.S. contacts with the PLO -- a 
policy that lasted two decades. Under the circumstances, Arafat might have been 
the unlikeliest person in the world to feel any grief about Nixon's death. Yet 
in the midst of all the final negotiations for a Palestinian entity in Jericho 
and the Gaza Strip, he took time out to go to the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia and 
sign the condolence book for Nixon. "With all our heartfelt condolences to 
President Clinton and the American people on the death of President Nixon," 
Arafat wrote. "From myself, personally, and the Palestinian people." . . . 
After signing the book, he went upstairs to chat with Ambassador John McCarthy. 
Many State Department officials are astonished. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 TIMES CHANGE: In the 1992 elections, no one more than Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) took advantage of -- and benefited from -- Anita Faye Hill's sexual 
harassment charges against conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. 
The liberal Boxer was strongly sympathetic to Hill's allegations, pressing for 
high-profile Senate hearings and building her campaign around the brouhaha. . . 
. Now though, with Paula Corbin Jones accusing the President of sexual 
harassment, Boxer is taking a lower profile -- a mere one-liner in which she 
says the "proper forum" for Jones' charges is the judicial system. . . . On May 
28, Boxer, a staunch Clinton ally, will attend the White House wedding of her 
daughter, Nicole, to Anthony Rodham, a brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. PAUL HOUSTON and ROBIN WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MEETING TONIGHT ON SPACE-SAVER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana Unified School District committee created to help design the 
district's proposed "space-saver" school will have its first meeting tonight at 
Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Space Saver School Neighborhood Assn.Committee will introduce and hear 
comments from its 11 community members starting at 7 p.m. The architects for 
the planned space-saver school will also attend the meeting, said Mike Vail, 
director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Space-saver schools are built vertically rather than horizontally to reduce 
the need for land in developed areas, and eliminate the need for condemning 
private property to make room for new schools. The district's planned 
space-saver school would be built at the rear of the Bristol Market Place, at 
17th and Bristol streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at Dunlop Hall, Room D210, at the Rancho Santiago campus, 
at 17th and Bristol streets.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; COSTELLO'S MAGIC MAKES THE OLD NEW AT MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It says something for the depth and character of Elvis Costello's artistry 
that his performance Saturday night at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre was 
practically his least-ambitious show in 17 years, yet it will probably tally up 
as one of the finest concerts of this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Costello has always worked best when faced with a challenge, and he usually 
gives himself a good one. In the late '70s it was that of asserting his 
pared-down, personal amalgam of punk and pub rock amid the prevailing musical 
climate of "I've got a synthesized orchestra and a big hairy chest, so pay up, 
Bub."  
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent years, he performed with a real orchestra himself and made it 
work, went to Nashville for a country album, teamed up with Paul McCartney, 
wrote songs that were performed by everyone from Roy Orbison to Chet Baker, and 
composed for a TV series, among a host of other far-flung efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The several hundred songs he has composed over the years have been literate, 
informed pieces spanning the range of pop music. Recently he took to writing 
string quartet music in collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet, and the 
resulting "The Juliet Letters" is a brilliant, emotion-laden jewel. On a spare 
weekend he cranked out an entire album's worth of songs for singer Wendy James. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly with his old band the Attractions -- with which he reunited for 
his current tour -- Costello has always pushed things onstage, at times going 
beyond the brink of musical mayhem, at other times assaying ballads with a 
disarming tenderness. Familiar songs would be recast with new arrangements, new 
songs would be introduced, obscure R&B songs or Merseybeat chestnuts would 
appear. On his memorable five-night L.A. stand on his 1986 tour, Costello 
appeared with a different band or format each night, and excelled in each. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no such overt challenges in his performance Saturday. Rather, the 
set was nearly a greatest hits assemblage of tunes from the mid-'80s and 
before, and selections from the current "Brutal Youth" album, which is in large 
part a return to the form of his early '80s work. 
</P>
<P>
 One might call that treading water, were not he and his band instead walking 
on it, with, retro or not, some of the most inventive, passionately performed 
music likely to come this way any time soon. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest challenge for Costello this time out is just that of him 
getting along with his band. After their split in 1986, bassist Bruce Thomas 
wrote a book which, while ostensibly fiction, took a number of obvious potshots 
at Costello, who responded in kind in interviews.  
</P>
<P>
 The onstage sparks produced by Costello and the Attractions -- Thomas, 
unrelated drummer Pete Thomas and keyboard demon Steve Nieve -- often seemed to 
be the result of friction between their strong musical personalities. It's not 
surprising that Costello eventually went looking for musicians who wouldn't 
ride so roughshod over his songs, and equally unsurprising that he came to miss 
their untamable excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the four of them got right down to business, bashing out the early 
tunes "No Action," "High Fidelity" and "The Beat," and plowing seamlessly into 
"Brutal Youth's opening track, "Pony St." They barely came up for air in the 
30-song, three-encore set, charging from song to song with Costello scarcely 
getting a word in edgewise. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the fifth song, "Beyond Belief" from 1982's "The Imperial Bedroom," to 
drive home what a remarkably rare musical outfit Costello and crew are. It has 
always been one of their most volatile mixtures of song-crafting and musical 
abandon, but this time out the four treated the song like it was a berserk 
drunk they were trying to wrestle to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Thomas charged the beat; bassist Thomas eschewed his usual melodicism 
and swung with a vengeance; Nieve caromed between his keyboards -- both hi-tech 
stuff and a cheesy '60s organ -- with more than his usual sanity-threatening 
mix of the baroque and the surreal; and Costello poured his lungs and spluttery 
guitar into it. Welcome back, boys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The set was heavy with popular favorites, including "Accidents Will Happen," 
"Watching the Detectives," "Alison," "Radio Radio," a burning show-closer in 
"Pump It Up" and a rearranged, pop-rock version of the 1983 hit "Everyday I 
Write the Book." 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid such proven company, the new songs shone, particularly "Clown 
Strike," "Sulky Girl," the warm, Kinks-like "London's Brilliant Parade" and "My 
Science Fiction Twin," a song made somewhat more pertinent by the presence of 
an Elvis look-alike, dressed just like him, in the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 Other standouts in the show included 1982's "A Man Out of Time" and 1989's 
"Deep Dark Truthful Mirror," on which Costello took vocal chances that were too 
rare in the evening's other songs.  
</P>
<P>
 His voice may be an acquired taste, but, when it comes to phrasing, he's 
practically the Sinatra of rock, with a great command of inflection and 
shading. On most past tours, he would probe each song, making changes both 
subtle and shouted, and sometimes reinventing a melody on the spot. In this 
ballad-shy show, though, he often seemed to forgo the finesse, making the 
performance neither quite as intimate nor as grand as it might have been. Yet, 
even falling short of his peak, Costello scaled heights few other acts even 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Crash Test Dummies might be cute in a coffeehouse, but the 
Canadian outfit was out of its depth on a concert stage. The catchy novelty of 
their Top 5 hit "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" is about as good as they get, and they pretty 
well flubbed that live, with off-key harmonies and no presence.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the traditional gospel blues tune "Samson and Delilah" -- a song in which 
the "If I had my way, I'd tear this building down" refrain once held great 
significance for Southern blacks -- was tossed off like a B-52s party favor.  
</P>
<P>
 Front-man Brad Roberts may have been born with his bass-frog of a voice, but 
his unaspiring delivery and self-satisfied attitude made it seem like a 
gimmicky affectation.

'THE CROW' TAKES OFF AT BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: THE OPENING IS THE BIGGEST EVER FOR 
MIRAMAX. IN SECOND PLACE IS 'WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN,' WITH 'CROOKLYN' THIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a story-line involving supernatural powers and undying romance, a rock 
'n' roll score and a cast headed by Brandon Lee, who was accidentally killed 
while making the film, "The Crow" emerged on Sunday as the clear leader at the 
nation's box offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's distributor, Miramax Films, and its subsidiary, Dimension Films, 
estimated that "The Crow" would do about $11.7 million at the box office in its 
first Friday-to-Sunday period. In second place was "When a Man Loves a Woman," 
the drama with Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan, at $9.5 million, and third was 
"Crooklyn," from director Spike Lee, with $4.6 million, according to industry 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly we're thrilled that the movie's Number 1," said Miramax marketing 
vice president David Dinerstein, who noted that exit surveys have found the 
film has a strong appeal to young males and females. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening is the biggest ever for Miramax, a company that has found success 
distributing such off-beat films as "The Crying Game" and "The Piano," and 
which now is a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 What's different about "The Crow" is that it has started off big. It's on 
1,573 screens, and this Friday that expands to 1,900 screens, Dinerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quickly escalating release is an expression of confidence that the film 
will have staying power at the box office in the midst of such on-coming big 
summer movies as "Maverick, " which opens Friday and heralds the big summer 
movie-going season. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie also has the support of a major TV advertising campaign that 
emphasizes the darkly romantic story. The soundtrack album of various hard-rock 
bands is No. 15 on the charts and climbing, Dinerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is at least one indication that "The Crow" may lack staying power: 
box-office receipts on Saturday night -- traditionally the week's biggest -- 
were off the pace of Friday's opening night, according to some exhibition 
sources. Situations like that are not the typical pattern for movies that have 
healthy runs of many consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Lee on March 31, 1993, focused attention on the film and, for a 
time, uncertainly about whether it would be completed. Lee, the son of the late 
martial arts star Bruce Lee, died after he was shot on the set while filming at 
Carolco Studios in Wilmington, N.C. No charges were filed as officials in 
Wilmington said an investigation had turned up no evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the curiosity factor about Lee and his final movie is one reason for 
the current popularity of "The Crow." Lee's popularity is somewhat akin to that 
of James Dean, the actor who died in a car crash with two just-completed films, 
"Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant," still to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other weekend box office results, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" came 
in fourth with $2.8 million and "With Honors" grossed $2.5 million to take 
fifth. The first weekend of "Three Ninja's Kick Back" drew $2.4 million, to 
take sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Escape" was seventh with $1.7 million, followed by "Clean Slate" with $1.5 
million and "Bad Girls" with $1 million. "Schindler's List" and "You So Crazy," 
starring Martin Lawrence, tied for 10th place with $800,000.

PUTTING A DIFFERENT STAMP ON THE ROLE OF A TRANSSEXUAL; MOVIES: ACTOR SURPRISES 
EVEN HIMSELF BY DECIDING TO 'HAVE FUN AT THIS POINT IN MY CAREER' IN 'THE 
ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When director Stephan Elliot, who likes to cast against expectation, was 
looking for a romantic male to star as a gaudy transsexual drag performer who 
treks across the Australian outback in "The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of 
the Desert," he thought first of "Some Like It Hot" and Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made his career in a dress and he could end it in a dress," Elliot 
reasoned with engaging bravado, and then reconsidered: "If we got him out to 
the desert, it'd probably kill him by the last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, trying to come up with "the most known older heterosexual icon," Elliot 
thought of Terence Stamp. "I sent his agency a script, but I thought he'd never 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising himself as well as the director, Stamp took on the part, and gives 
such a graceful, elegant and convincing performance as the acerbic Bernadette, 
a woman no longer trapped in a man's body, that the actor laughs and says, "the 
only thing left is to have the cover of Vogue in drag. If I could get away with 
that, then I'd have made some kind of transformation." 
</P>
<P>
 The good-humored "Priscilla," which is the name of the lavender bus taking 
Bernadette and two more conventional (if that is the right word) drag queens 
out to perform at a resort hotel in the middle of Australian nowhere, has added 
some needed life to the Cannes Film Festival scene. Called "Florence d' Arabie" 
by bemused French critics, and featuring posters that announce "Drag Is the 
Drug," it debuted Saturday at a raucous midnight screening and is set to open 
in the U.S. on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 When it does, attention will inevitably focus on Stamp, a major international 
star since his Oscar-nominated lead role in "Billy Budd" over 30 years ago. The 
54-year-old actor had been feeling that he needed a change, that he should be 
"having fun at this point in my career," but still the idea of playing a woman 
who had been a man filled him with "tremendous misgivings and fears." 
</P>
<P>
 "I started getting fatigued just reading the script, I was afraid I'd make a 
laughingstock of myself, that I'd be unemployable for the rest of my life, that 
my father might turn over in his grave," he says. "But an actress friend who's 
much smarter than I am said, 'If you don't start doing parts like this, all you 
can look forward to is playing villains in Hollywood movies for the rest of 
your life.' And that struck fear and loathing into my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 A charming and relaxed man whose celebrated pale eyes mesmerize under the 
jaunty Eton boating cap he's wearing, Stamp's easy manner masks an intense 
dedication to the psychological underpinnings of his craft. Though he initially 
did simple things like trying on women's shoes and getting a full body wax, of 
much more concern was preparing himself emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "For myself, if I'm secure internally, I don't worry much about the externals 
of a performance," the actor explains. He got insights from books by 
transsexuals, especially Jan Morris' "Conundrum," and when he got to the part 
about the operation in April Ashley's autobiography, "I felt myself going to 
pass out and had to put the book down." 
</P>
<P>
 Stamp decided that the key to empathizing with Bernadette was "not allowing 
myself to respond logically, which is what I usually do, but keeping myself 
open to the emotional response. Normally, when you're acting, there's a kind of 
personal center you hold onto. With this part, I allowed myself to be so open, 
so vulnerable, I felt I was in free fall. The muse demands a price." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to all of this, Stamp's role in "Priscilla" daunted the actor 
because it demanded that he be able to simultaneously lip-sync to the music and 
dance in unison with the other two performers, "much more than you'd normally 
be asking anybody to do and extremely worrying." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The film's first musical number was shot in a rough outback town called Broken 
Hill. "There I was," Stamp remembers ruefully, "in my high heels, tangerine 
fishnet stockings and satin leotard standing on a bar in Broken Hill before a 
crowd of miners who were serving as extras. When the music for 'Shake That 
Groove Thing' went on, I went through a fear barrier so dense that when I came 
out the other side I was in the stratosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his role in "Priscilla" may unsettle those who know the actor best for 
his villainous roles in "Superman," "Superman II," "Wall Street" and "Young 
Guns," Stamp's resume is in fact an extraordinarily varied one, including work 
for directors as dissimilar as Ken Loach ("Poor Cow"), Michael Cimino ("The 
Sicilian"), Stephen Frears ("The Hit") and Pier Paolo Pasolini ("Teorema"). 
</P>
<P>
 Stamp was an unknown theater actor not yet 21 when his agent told him that 
director Peter Ustinov wanted him to audition for a movie version of Herman 
Melville's "Billy Budd," a role the actor was familiar with because he knew the 
modern opera. "I felt it was stupid, Billy Budd is like an angel, and I was 
like a teddy boy, with black hair and an East End accent." 
</P>
<P>
 Stamp went anyway, but found talking difficult. "And the more speechless I 
became, the more I endeared myself to Ustinov, who was looking for an actor who 
could convey a sense of lost speech." That good feeling turned out to be 
mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like unexposed film, I had never been exposed to real intelligence, so 
everything Ustinov said to me had tremendous impact. When the filming ended, he 
told me, 'We've done something very special here, and I don't think you should 
rush into anything. If you do good things, good things will come to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Following that advice led Stamp to William Wyler and "The Collector," a film 
that won him the best actor award at Cannes in 1965, a prize whose tangible 
symbol, a pair of gold cuff links, had to be mailed to him because no one had 
thought to fly him in until it was too late to get a seat on a plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked at Wyler's career, I saw that he never repeated himself. So I 
thought, 'Maybe that's the way to make life interesting, to try and always do 
different things.' That's why my career looks so eccentric. You can't really 
assess it from its outer trajectory."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: URGING KIDS TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES

<P>
 The news tease promised "another Rodney King episode." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as George Holliday awakened in the wee hours to minicam King for the 
ages, a private citizen had now come forward with home video of another, more 
recent episode of "police brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what the anchor said in introducing a chunk of amateur footage 
from another city, pictures that got wide national exposure recently. 
</P>
<P>
 You braced for something shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 What came on the screen, though, was inconclusive -- dark, fuzzy images of 
police officers aggressively taking a suspect (apparently black) into custody. 
In the confusion, an officer appeared to strike the standing suspect on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no way of knowing from the footage whether the punch was provoked or 
unprovoked, whether it was justified by something unseen or was an uncalled-for 
act of violence against a helpless man. In other words, there was no context, 
only the memory of the police-indicting headline. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if this were a slice of police brutality, however, equating it with the 
ferocious beating of King was like comparing a small vibration to the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the story's anti-cop point of view was not supported by its pictures, 
that doesn't mean its perspective wasn't accepted by some viewers. "People 
believe what they see when it matches their own experience," notes Renee Hobbs, 
associate professor of communication at Babson College. She makes that 
statement in "Tuning In to Media," one of two 30-minute videos included in TV 
Tool Kits, being distributed by Continental Cablevision Inc. as part of the 
Boston-based firm's campaign for media literacy aimed largely at kids and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 A media giant crusading for media literacy? It triggers your skepticism. Does 
a jailer hand out escape maps? What's in it for Continental? Is it trying to 
showboat for a media-bashing Congress? Do its media-literacy materials contain 
self-promoting subliminal messages? What's the plot here, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no hidden agenda, according to Nancy Larkin, Continental's vice 
president for community relations. "We just think that if people feel good 
about cable, that's good for us," she said last week. Whatever. The point is 
that Continental, by seeking to raise our media IQs, is on the side of the 
angels here. 
</P>
<P>
 Media-literacy has expanded somewhat due to the efforts of a few visionary 
advocates such as the Center for Media Values in Los Angeles. Yet hardly any 
schools teach it, and the subject is still given scant attention in the United 
States. Continental, which serves 650 communities in California and six other 
states, is adding wattage to the spotlight by preparing to send its tapes and 
study guides not only to schools and libraries but also to other cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs, who is director of the Harvard Institute on Media Education, produced 
"Tuning In to Media" primarily with teachers in mind. It preaches media 
literacy by showing the topic being examined by elementary, middle-school and 
high-school students in a handful of Massachusetts classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially valuable, though, is the way it uses coverage of the King case and 
the subsequent Los Angeles riots to illuminate various media techniques -- and 
biases -- that are not always apparent to the casual viewer. There on the 
screen, for example, is footage of chaos in L.A. streets, with a voice 
describing the participants as mindless looters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then the identical footage is run, this time with another voice from another 
network, portraying those in the streets as part of a rebellion. One set of 
pictures, two truths. The message: Don't let media do your thinking for you. 
Draw your own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kathleen Tyner, director of Strategies for Media Literacy, notes here, the 
media "are not mirrors of society . . . but carefully manufactured products." 
</P>
<P>
 The video also uses the L.A. riots story line in an episode of ABC's "Doogie 
Houser, M.D." as an example of the "interconnection" between news and 
entertainment, charting the overlapping values. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Master of Control," the second video targets young children, using the 
language of television -- pouring on the sound bites -- to teach television. 
Seeking to elevate critical awareness almost at a toddler level, its messages 
are very general. ("Are toys always as great as they look on TV?" asks host 
Marc Summer of the Nickelodeon network's "Double Dare" series.) And the 
presentation lacks the zing of those media-education specials for kids produced 
by Zillions magazine for HBO and PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet you applaud anything that urges kids to view the broad spectrum of media 
more acutely and seek alternative sources of information. And with the 
companion "Tuning In to Media," in addition to the supporting print materials, 
this is a TV Tool Kit that deserves space in every home. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're not with Continental, cable-wired viewers can always lobby their 
own systems to acquire and run these programs in prime access, making them 
available for videotaping. Still better, of course, would be to have media 
literacy join core curricula in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some may feel media literacy is irrelevant," renowned media ecologist Neil 
Postman says in the Hobbs video. "But not if you believe education is not only 
about making a living, but making a life."

ART REVIEW; WARHOL GETS HIS DUE IN PITTSBURGH; MUSEUM IS LARGEST IN U.S. 
DEDICATED TO A SINGLE ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, Andy Warhol used the concepts and techniques of mass-media 
advertising to repackage and sell established American ideas about art. His Pop 
was heard 'round the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, three decades and a wholesale artistic revolution later, 
Warhol's remarkable achievement has been enshrined in a splendid new museum, 
billed as the most comprehensive in the nation devoted to the work of a single 
artist. Located in the Pennsylvania city of his birth (he died unexpectedly on 
Feb. 22, 1987, following routine gall-bladder surgery at New York 
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center), the museum radiates an all-American theme: 
Hometown boy makes good. 
</P>
<P>
 Warhol was born in this former urban-industrial powerhouse on Aug. 6, 1928, 
the third son of Andrej and Julia Zavacky Warhola. Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants, 
the Warholas had left the rugged foothills of Eastern Europe, along with fully 
half the region's population in the 20 years flanking the turn of the 20th 
Century, in search of the proverbial better life. Many, like Warhol's father, 
found it in the mines and mills of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, with its yet-to-be fully opened archival center, will likely 
become the primary locus for Warhol studies. Two main questions have surrounded 
its genesis. First, would the museum's art collection include enough first-rate 
examples to justify the building renovation budget ($12.3 million) and the 
establishment of a suitable endowment ($20 million)? Second, in what light 
would his 40-year career be presented? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the museum is an exquisite package for Warhol's art. The ornate 
Beaux Arts structure, built in 1911 and clad in glazed terra cotta, has been 
discretely joined by a beautiful three-story addition of concrete, black-glazed 
structural tile and standard yellow brick -- the kind commonly used in old, 
working-class Pittsburgh. Yellow brick, given its glancing associations with 
Dorothy Gale traipsing through Oz, is perfect for a Warhol shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Richard Gluckman, best known for his elegantly low-key renovation of 
loft-building galleries for the Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan, has 
followed suit here. Unabashedly modernist, the spare, clean spaces are finished 
in industrially refined materials such as concrete, aluminum, stainless steel, 
glass and ocher-colored plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand staircase backed by a seven-story wall of translucent glass that 
floods the interior with filtered light creates a passageway both beautifully 
inviting and useful: You orient yourself with ease inside the 
88,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
 Gluckman has allowed himself one grand flourish. At the entrance, visitors 
cross an enclosed bridge to the spacious public lobby, arrayed with 25 Warhol 
self-portraits in a variety of mediums. The bridge, featuring a concrete floor, 
deep indigo walls and silver-leaf ceiling, gradually narrows in a 
Brunelleschi-style forced perspective. It subtly echoes the short walk to the 
museum from the city's center, across a bridge spanning the Allegheny River. 
</P>
<P>
 A glass wall with double doors at the bridge's narrow end features structural 
aluminum mullions that create an unobtrusive (but unmistakable) cross, beneath 
which visitors pass. This processional space enacts a ritualized transition 
from a mundane urban street on Pittsburgh's north side into a modern temple to 
art, mausoleum for an artist.  
</P>
<P>
 The museum's location, its renovated building and useful didactic panels 
strikingly underscore how Warhol's Catholic, working class, first-generation 
American upbringing is critical to understanding his art. In a studio he 
pointedly called the Factory, Warhol was a modern laborer who mass-produced 
works of art that dissected -- and contributed to -- the popular culture of 
consumption that distinguishes the 20th Century from all others. 
</P>
<P>
 Smartly, director Tom Armstrong and curator Mark Francis haven't separated the 
artist's many mediums in the display: advertisements and magazine graphics of 
the 1950s, which first brought Warhol success as a commercial artist in New 
York; the brilliant silk-screened paintings, prints and sculptures that brought 
him art-world fame as a Pop avatar; the extraordinary movies that increasingly 
occupied him in the late 1960s; the rock band, the Velvet Underground, which he 
actively promoted, and his disco-decor wallpaper and floating silver pillows; 
and the fan-magazine, Interview, still published today. In the museum, 
everything intersects with everything else in a radically democratic manner. 
</P>
<P>
 If the crucial socioeconomic context for Warhol's art is wonderfully conveyed, 
however, its other defining circumstance is regrettably ignored. Sexuality is 
often a crucible in which art's character is formed, but in the Pittsburgh 
museum the artist's homosexuality is not acknowledged. Imagine the Picasso 
Museum in Paris keeping mum about the critical relation between the Spaniard's 
heterosexual appetites and his aesthetic, and you'll have some idea of the 
egregiousness of the omission. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the silk-screened paintings, sine qua non of Pop art, in which 
photographs are reproduced in paint on canvas, often highlighted with splashes 
of color. Warhol hit on a sly way to make photographs masquerade as paintings: 
They're photographs in drag, complete with makeup enabling them to pass in 
fashionable society. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Warhol, photography had been a second-class citizen in art. Camera 
images had revolutionized the modern visual environment, but they traditionally 
occupied a lower rung than painting in art's established hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Warhol turned the tables. The equivalence to his own situation as a 
homosexual, and thus an actual second-class citizen, is more than mere 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's collection numbers about 900 paintings, 70 sculptures, 1,500 
drawings, exhibition prints of all his films and videos, rolls of his 
wallpaper, and more than 500 prints and 400 black-and-white photographs. 
Together with the commercial art and sketchbooks from the 1950s, they were 
contributed by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which represents 
the artist's estate, and the Dia Center, who, with Pittsburgh's Carnegie 
Institute, have collaborated to create the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Warhol's greatest work is already in other museums and private 
collections, but the 500 works in Pittsburgh's inaugural show nonetheless offer 
a generally substantive, sometimes superb display. Evidence of weakness is 
usually one of size: Smaller examples are abundant, but they don't always 
convey the "mass-ness" of mass production that such larger canvases as the 11 
silver portraits of Elvis do effortlessly carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Five judicious loans to the inaugural installation also help: a hand-painted 
Dick Tracy, the classic "Before and After" ad for a nose job, a rare 
paint-by-numbers image, a monumental portrait of Mao and 55 of the mysterious 
pictures of shadows and light playing in the corner of an empty room. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest showings are on the sixth and fifth floors, which chronicle the 
dazzling connections among the commercial art, the early Pop works and the 
evolution of the Factory. Warhol's great films (continuously projected on 
video) are wonderfully integrated into a gallery filled with portraits of media 
stars, from Marilyn to Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
 The flimsiest display is on the second floor. Warhol's muddled, often corny 
work from the late 1970s and 1980s includes gruesome attempts at collaboration 
with Francesco Clemente and the late Jean-Michel Basquiat. Warhol's tragic 
death at age 59 voided the possibility of a convincing late period. 
</P>
<P>
 If the installation thus ends with a whimper, no matter. Warhol's own late 
work might be flimsy, but it's impossible even to imagine the 1980s at all -- 
bad and good -- without his astonishing precedent. 
</P>
<P>

Mondays and Tuesdays, except during the inaugural week.

WHICH FILMS WILL SURVIVE THE SUMMER CRUNCH TIME?; STUDIOS, CONCERNED OVER THE 
RECENT BOX-OFFICE DROUGHT, ARE WORRIED ABOUT RUMORS THAT THEATER OWNERS WILL 
PULL FILMS QUICKLY IF THEY AREN'T DOING WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This summer's plethora of films may be a moviegoer's dream, but it's a 
nightmare for the distributors who are elbowing one another for screen time. 
</P>
<P>
 This year there's extra pressure on those distributors from theater owners, 
who reportedly are threatening to pull movies that don't perform well in their 
opening weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 In this summer of so many high-profile pictures ("The Flintstones," 
"Maverick," "Wyatt Earp" and "True Lies" to name a few) that could mean early 
death and financial disaster for some big-budget studio films. And it could 
especially hurt the smaller, independent films that aren't backed by studio 
marketing campaigns and rely heavily on building word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the studios are especially worried about their films being pulled 
early is the recent box-office drought. "Look what we're coming out of," notes 
Jerry Rich, MGM marketing president. "Last weekend (May 6-8) was one of the 
worst we've had since October '92. The market has been so soft for the last six 
weeks that (the studios) have got to play catch-up this summer. And that's why 
people are worried about this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The worry, suggests Rich, who used to work for Miramax Films, is even greater 
for independents who "are really in a difficult position because they don't 
have the leverage the studios have. They can't say, 'Look, you better give this 
picture a chance or you may not be showing the next big picture we have coming 
out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-week crunch period from Memorial Day (May 30) to July 17 is a matter 
of survival of the fittest.  
</P>
<P>
 Travis Reid, senior vice president and head film buyer for Sony Theaters 
(formerly Loews Theaters), concedes: "Every film is entitled to a second-week 
run. But when it doesn't perform, there is this kind of rule of thumb that a 
picture gets pulled. I discourage theater owners from pulling a picture after 
the first week." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, quite simply: If a picture fails to open, theater owners will show no 
mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is happy about it," says Barry Reardon, head of Warner Bros. 
distribution. "You better hope you have a really great picture that will 
survive because there's little time (for audience interest) to build. The only 
hope is to push the release date back to say August (a less competitive window) 
if the film needs some momentum to build on word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "But even when you have a big film like we had last year with 'The Fugitive,' 
you don't want to be all jammed up in a crunch period like this."  
</P>
<P>
 The release on that picture was pushed back to August because it hadn't 
finished production, he says. Despite its late summer opening, the picture went 
on to gross a whopping $184 million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Reardon noted that AMC Century City theaters had overbooked 
space last summer, forcing Warners to move the picture's opening to Century 
City Cineplex theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studio distribution heads say overbooking of screen space is common 
during peak periods such as summer or the Christmas holiday season. But this 
year the competition seems tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the peak summer playing time, a number of movies will be competing for the 
same audience. Bumped against each other, for instance, are the John 
Hughes-produced "Baby's Day Out" and Disney's big summer picture "The Lion 
King." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although "The Lion King" will actually be in its second week of release, 
"Baby's Day Out," directed by "Home Alone's" Chris Columbus could suffer in the 
crunch, studio sources fear. Twelve children's movies alone are competing for 
this summer's audience. 
</P>
<P>
 John Krier, president of the box-office tracking company Exhibitor Relations, 
noted that the crunch period is very telling about how relationships between 
studios and exhibitors really come into play. 
</P>
<P>
 "An exhibitor may want to pull a studio's picture, but if he wants to get his 
hands on that studio's next picture, he may be strongly persuaded to give (the 
weaker performing) film a little more running time," he suggested. "Otherwise, 
(the exhibitor) may be the one to come up short in the long run."

PACIFIC CHAMBER PLAYERS ENLIVEN MUSEUM PIECES AT BOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A certain amount of care has been given to the presentation of the Pacific 
Symphony's Chamber Music Series at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, and it 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With the concerts held within the galleries themselves, and dinner and 
champagne beforehand, the series, dubbed "A Feast for the Senses," has the 
potential -- let's face it -- for stuffiness. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, it provides a suitable feeling of occasion for the 
performance of great music. On the other, there's the perhaps unavoidable sense 
of country-club exclusivity and museum reverence that hangs about, which can 
create the wrong frame of mind for approaching the vital art of chamber music. 
</P>
<P>
 That Friday night's concert, the first of two during the weekend, sidestepped 
these obstacles was largely due to the lively musicianship of the gathered 
players. Propriety and politeness had nothing to do with their performances; 
genuine expression and active involvement did. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the concert in the high-ceilinged, reverberant Leo Freedman Foundation 
Galleria, PSO principal flutist Louise DiTullio gave a vigorous airing to 
Bach's Partita in A minor, BWV 1013. Though one could quibble with certain 
aspects of this reading (she took the Allemande, considered a medium-tempo 
dance, too fast, and the steely sound of her modern flute overwhelmed some of 
the gentle aspects of the work), DiTullio showed technical accomplishment and a 
forward, focused musicality throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert then headed upstairs, to the Gloria & Si Fluor and Family Gallery, 
where, surely for the first time in history, a Mozart flute quartet and a Faure 
piano quartet were played in front of a glowing display of orange-crate labels. 
</P>
<P>
 DiTullio led an aggressive but detailed reading of the Flute Quartet, K. 285, 
with PSO cellist Timothy Landauer and guests Clayton Haslop, violin, and Peter 
Bucknell, viola, her attentive, spirited cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The same string players were joined by pianist Chester Swiatkowski for the 
C-minor Quartet, Opus 15, by Faure. Though slightly hampered by the close 
acoustics, they offered a big, expressive, pointed and, happily, enthusiastic 
performance. In short, it revealed in every bar the genuine affection these 
musicians had for the music at hand.

DANCE REVIEW; FLAMENCO SHOW CLICKS IN BREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some measure of success can be assumed for a Flamenco program when the 
audience in the underground parking lot afterward cannot resist clapping wildly 
in furious rhythms and looking for all the world as if by drumming their heels 
into the pavement they could bring parked cars to life. The Saturday night 
performance of "Flamenco Talavera" at Curtis Theatre had that effect, even 
though technical difficulties occasionally interfered. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary pleasure of Flamenco is the sound of its complex, fickle rhythms as 
feet contact floor. When the dance surface is cardboard-like (actually coming 
apart at the seams), and it is not miked, while the singer and guitar are, 
percussive accents are lost. Fortunately, several sections of the mixed program 
occurred in silence, allowing the dancers to recapture their power. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest dancers Linda Andrade and Antonia Lopez had spirited moments, as did 
several of the company's regular members; Marcellina de Luna and Maruja 
Belmonte in the danced drama "Amor Gitano" come to mind, with their torrid 
lunges and arched postures of suspicion and desire.  
</P>
<P>
 In general, the company is fine in footwork and the lace and steel movements 
of hands twisting on wrists, but often lacks the strong spines that support and 
coordinate Flamenco flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not apply, however, to Juan Talavera, whose riveting presence never 
failed to excite. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows how to create power with a burning focus, whether it's centered in 
the drama of his chiseled face, or somewhere in the length of his taut torso, 
or especially in the smoldering finesse with which he makes transitions, from 
cool to hot, from diminishing heel taps to rapid-fire circling of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping pace with the dancers -- and sometimes setting it with evocative 
flourishes -- were singer Jesus Montoya and guitarist Benito Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Flamenco Talavera" also presents a mixed program, Friday and Saturday at 
8:30 p.m., at Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic Center Drive, Brea. Guest guitarists are 
Antonio Triana and Rafael Aragon. Guest dancers Cintia Reyes and Gabriela Garza 
will join guests mentioned above. Tickets $19.50. Information: (714) 990-7722.

BASH BLENDS ONE-UPMANSHIP; COMPETITIVE SESSION PROVES CONTEMPORARY JAZZ 
CAPTURES THE CUT-LOOSE INDIVIDUALITY OF ITS MAINSTREAM COUSIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's annual KSBR-FM Jazz Bash found the nearly 30 participating 
musicians in a mood more competitive than cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 True, no fistfights broke out, and the musicians displayed their equanimity 
moving on and off the stage while sharing the feature spotlight, but 
one-upmanship was the order of the day. Bassists, saxophonist, keyboardists and 
drummers sought to outdo one another as they took their turns. 
</P>
<P>
 This cutting session atmosphere made for some exciting performances, as every 
tune, no matter its title became "Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better." The 
winners in all of this were those assembled to witness the showdown for more 
than four hours on the grounds of the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was set from the opening note when fluegelhornist Tony Guerrero, who 
also served as emcee for the event, brought some 10 musicians on the stage to 
play his '60s era funk number "Bumpin'." The saxophonists (Mike Gealer, Brandon 
Fields and Greg Vail) jockeyed for position as the guitarists (Gannin Arnold 
and Thom Rotella) traded accompanying licks. Only the percussionists (Stu 
Nevitt of Shadowfax and the untiring Dr. Como) were of one mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero established the take-no-prisoners approach with a hyperactive solo as 
notable for its lyrical content as for its insatiable thrust. The 
fluegelhornist brought the band slowly down to a whisper while he uttered 
smacks and kisses from his horn before the ensemble roared back into the 
danceable riff at the Bash, the fifth such event held to mark the end of the 
contemporary jazz music station's yearly fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A quintet remained on the stage for Rotella's "Bring on the Nights," a 
moderately paced heart-warmer that opened with Gealer's singing soprano lines 
and some classic, Wes Montgomery-inspired guitar chords. Gealer demonstrated 
fine ways with the melody during his improvisation, followed by the guitarist's 
cream-colored solo that spoke of desire and romance. 
</P>
<P>
 With keyboardist Sandy Owen at the grand piano, Gealer, now on tenor, showed 
some strength with a boom-boom styled improv during what Guerrero dubbed "a 
stripper tune." Saxophonist Fields, known for his fiery side, showed some heart 
during his alto solo on Alphonse Mouzon's mid-tempo ballad "On Top of the 
World." Tenor man Vail got the day's biggest ovation for his dynamics during a 
yet-to-be-titled Guerrero tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the keyboardists, Bill Brendle showed his savvy during "Things Ain't 
What They Used to Be," an exercise that Guerrero decorated with risque plunger 
mute decoration. Rob Mullins took a mainstream approach on his own "Plus 
Three," strumming inside the box of the piano for effect before delivering 
rollicking, Herbie Hancock-influenced statements. Freddie Ravel worked up both 
electric excitement on a keyboard slung guitar-style over his shoulder and 
acoustic lushness at the grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Dan Siegel's narrative style was put to good effect on "Bumpin'," and 
Tom Zink coaxed harmonica-styled sounds from his synthesizer on a number from 
saxophonist Sonya Jason.  
</P>
<P>
 But the day's keyboard highlight was from Mike Garson, whose detailed reading 
of Miles Davis' "Nardis" won a large ovation from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no contest among the battle of the basses. Brian Bromberg won the 
heavyweight title with technical wizardry and amazing harmonics during his own 
"Tunnel Vision." Max Bennett showed a more lyrical approach during Mouzon's "On 
Top of the World" while Luther Hughes claimed the prize for rhythmic astuteness 
during a salsa-fired version of "Autumn Leaves" that featured violinist Susie 
Hansen and guitarist Ricardo Silveira. 
</P>
<P>
 The drummers played to a draw. Mouzon's high-powered rolls and rattles were 
matched by smart timekeeper Clyde Davis. Mouzon showed his sensitive side 
during "Nardis," utilizing claps from his high-hat cymbal to embellish the 
moody piece. Evan Stone was particularly funky during "Tunnel Vision," playing 
with the enthusiasm that makes him one of the most exciting young timekeepers 
on the local scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Other standout guitar performances came from Arnold, who also took a couple of 
turns on congas, Randell Young with his spare, urban-flavored approach during 
"The Thrill Is Gone" and Dave Murdy, who recalls popular guitarist John 
Scofield in both style and appearance. Vocalist Lionel Cole and harmonica 
player Tollak Ollestad made unchallenged, yet valuable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's overall effect served to debunk the myth that contemporary jazz 
lacks the improvisational fire of its mainstream cousin, and that its musical 
forms demand more by-the-book playing rather than cut-loose individuality. The 
jam session atmosphere allowed the musicians to keep their own identities, even 
when playing someone else's music (as in past years, Guerrero and talent 
manager Lucille Hunt solicited originals from the participating musicians while 
keeping the number of standards to a minimum). The results, without benefit of 
rehearsal, were solidly rewarding.

WRITER PENS CRITIQUES OF COUNTY PROJECTS; COMMENTARY: ESSAYIST AND URBAN 
PLANNER WILLIAM FULTON OF VENTURA POINTS OUT THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE 
ABOMINABLE OF LOCAL LAND-USE DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For urban planner-essayist William Fulton, the road from upstate New York to 
hillside Ventura was lined with barbed commentary and, sometimes, infuriated 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington sportswriter was so offended by a 1985 Fulton column arguing 
against a major league baseball team for the nation's capital that he declared 
Fulton's assertions "the greatest compendium of flapdoodle ever accepted for 
the written page." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that if Shirley Povich was writing a column attacking me," Fulton said 
recently, "then maybe I'd finally arrived as a pundit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton, 38, a Ventura resident since 1987 but a planner and writer with a 
nationwide scope, has only recently begun to turn his planner's expertise and 
sharp pen to communities around him in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fulton's perspectives, incorporated in his statewide planning newsletter, 
California Planning & Development Report, increasingly strike home with local 
subscribers -- professional planners in Thousand Oaks, Ventura, Oxnard and the 
County Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of another individual who has his perspective on new ideas, new 
legal decisions and new ways of doing things in land-use planning," said 
Everett Millais, Ventura's top city planner. "Most planners don't write very 
well, so his ability to make sense out of some very complex issues is a unique 
talent. Whenever I see something by him, I read it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton said that after seven years in the county, he is ready to occasionally 
turn an eye to local planning decisions. "I've been here long enough now to 
have an opinion," he said. "People are going to hate me." 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of Fulton opinions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Putting a Cal State university campus among lemon groves near Camarillo is 
the worst planning decision in recent county history. "You're basically busting 
the greenbelt. The site is a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ahmanson Ranch mini-city project in the Simi Hills is not a bad deal, 
since the government could not have paid market prices for the 10,000 acres of 
parkland in the package and pressure to build on the ranch certainly would have 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weldon Canyon at the mouth of the Ojai Valley should be approved as the west 
county's principal landfill. "You can get riled up about saving one canyon, but 
if we're going to generate trash, we have to figure out how to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * A new jail in the agricultural greenbelt near Santa Paula was necessary and 
its approval responsible. "In order to be true communities, the good things and 
the bad things have to be together. And a jail is part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Here and elsewhere, Fulton -- who holds master's degrees in urban planning and 
journalism -- straddles the line between planning and commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only publishes a monthly newsletter, but analyzes development issues 
for magazines and newspapers nationwide, lectures on urban planning at UC Santa 
Barbara and recently completed a UCLA-sponsored study on growth along the 
Ventura Freeway near Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He even addressed land-use issues as a government official, serving as 
chairman of the West Hollywood Planning Commission in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Fulton sees himself as a lightning rod for topical discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of my job to bring things to people's attention," he said. "In the 
planning profession in California, there are very few people who can get up and 
speak their minds without stepping on toes. They either work for government 
agencies or are consultants for developers." 
</P>
<P>
 Millais recalled a scene at a national planning conference where Fulton, a 
featured speaker, provoked a heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put forward to a group of die-hard planning types that the only effective 
planning is being done by developers," Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by the paintings of his artist wife in his light-splashed office 
overlooking a green Ondulando-area hillside, Fulton discussed what he sees as 
the best and worst planning decisions in recent county history. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited abominable projects in Ventura and Oxnard but gave the county high 
marks for its determination to prevent leapfrog development beyond city 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "What all this adds up to, I think, is we've established a pretty good 
framework for regional planning," he said. "But when you get down to the 
projects, it's just a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Success can be measured by the continued separation of the county's 10 cities 
by farmland and by park agencies' acquisition of scenic ranches in the Santa 
Monica Mountains and the Simi Hills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county can also be proud of efforts to restore the historic downtowns of 
the west county. And, taken on its own terms as a commuter suburb, Thousand 
Oaks, especially the Westlake portion, is remarkably attractive and 
self-contained, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many key decisions at the city level have been marked by a lack of vision 
-- and by officials' refusal to take an unpopular stand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, government acquiescence to a Cal State campus near Camarillo "was 
the BANANA solution -- Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody," he 
said. He took no position on the Taylor Ranch site overlooking the ocean in 
Ventura, favoring instead a ranch next to the Ventura Freeway near Ventura 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 A core problem of Ventura County's local planning is that "we've never really 
questioned the suburban (development) model -- that any destination you might 
go to needs to be as close as possible to where your car is parked," Fulton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than auto-oriented shopping malls and sterile, segregated housing 
tracts, Fulton prefers clustering homes, stores and offices in self-contained 
communities that emphasize travel on bike or foot, not by car. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional small town -- where people could eat, work and play within 
walking distance of their homes -- is not a bad planning model, he said. In 
fact, several such neo-traditional villages have been proposed statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communities need to be self-contained on the neighborhood level, yet 
connected in an effective way to the rest of the city," Fulton said. That helps 
create a sense of place -- an essential element if people are to care about 
their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has that sense, for example. Camarillo does not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Ventura has a distinct identity. It is marked by notable buildings, 
especially the ornate City Hall. And it has a variety of shops, restaurants and 
special events that work well together, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ventura now sprawls many miles eastward, its heart clearly is its 
historical downtown, he said. And that helps people feel like they live in a 
real place, not an appendage of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People define their communities as narrowly as they can. If they can mentally 
detach even from their city, they will," he said. "But everybody can identify 
with the central part of Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of a Ventura High School senior last year demonstrated the 
emotional connection of residents throughout the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Jesse Strobel was killed in central Ventura, east Ventura didn't say, 'I 
don't care,' " Fulton said. "Part of that is a strong sense of place that helps 
us to break out of our cocoons." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, he sees Camarillo as just another suburban city, where 
Mediterranean-style color schemes are enforced by a strict design code, but 
which is indistinguishable from the blur of cities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shopping centers, parking lots, an arterial highway and walled-off 
subdivisions," he said. "It's low-rise, auto-oriented and very suburban. It's 
like 100 other communities in California. If you put me blindfolded in that 
town, I wouldn't be able to tell you where I was. And that's the test of 
whether you have a place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, Fulton has jumped into the fray in his home city of Ventura, 
trying to protect its sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
 He publicly challenged the City Council in the fall to resist expansion of 
Buenaventura Mall unless developers could offer something more creative than "a 
bunch of stores just dropped on top of a parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton insisted that developer MaceRich's plan to bulldoze several established 
neighborhood-oriented stores to bring in more large "anchor" department stores 
was "a retailing dinosaur" that failed to link the mall with nearby stores and 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 He even suggested that MaceRich build senior citizen housing atop the center's 
proposed new parking garages so that the mall's character would be more 
compatible with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have argued that they have little choice but to approve an 
expanded mall because of competition among Ventura, Oxnard and neighboring 
cities for a dominant regional shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fulton said that even if it is true that only one regional mall will 
thrive between Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara, the winner will not necessarily 
be the one built first. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the one that most successfully creates a place where people want 
to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millais said Fulton's ideas make good sense but that MaceRich holds the trump 
card, since cities are increasingly dependent on sales taxes to balance their 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Do you want us or not? And if you want us, it's going to be as 
we're used to doing business,' " Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he knew of only a handful of cities -- Santa Barbara among them -- 
that have had the political will to force developers to substantially alter 
their projects to meld with existing city design. 
</P>
<P>
 As things have progressed, MaceRich may cut the size of its expansion for 
economic reasons. That could produce an expansion that works within the broader 
fabric of the city, Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that is not because of anything we did," he said. "The planning is being 
done by the development community." 
</P>
<P>
 As Fulton has become more involved in local issues, his positions have drawn 
fire and his philosophy has been interpreted by some as pro-development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find him interesting reading, but I certainly don't agree with his 
politics," Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "He's a bit too conservative 
for my liking." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Wiesbrock, director of Agoura-based Save Open Space, chastised Fulton for 
concluding that the 3,050-dwelling Ahmanson Ranch was a reasonable compromise 
given the dearth of public money to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he getting paid by them?" Wiesbrock said. "He has his head in the sand if 
he calls himself a planner and says it's a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton said he is sometimes characterized as pro-business because he accepts 
the inevitability of some growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agenda is to try to take the growth I think is inevitable and sculpt it to 
shape a better community," he said. "Sometimes just being anti-growth is the 
easy way out. . . . The debate gets polarized into whether you are for or 
against growth, but the reality is a lot more subtle than that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Fulton considers Ventura County's future, he bucks the conventional 
wisdom: He does not think that all local cities will one day merge into another 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to remember that most of the population growth is behind us," 
he said. "I don't see a doubling of the population or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fillmore may be the exception, and Moorpark will definitely grow," he added. 
"But in Ventura, everybody was arguing (in 1989) over whether the population 
would be 102,000 or 112,000 or 122,000. And I'm thinking to myself, 'We've gone 
from 20,000 to 90,000 in 20 years, so we've already made our bed. We have to 
come to grips with the town that we've created and improve it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important decision facing this county -- the one that will 
most affect growth -- is whether officials eventually approve commercial 
airline service at Point Mugu Naval Air Station, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy announced last year that it would allow jetliners to use its 
world-class runways on a limited basis. Business leaders and some public 
officials quickly endorsed the plan. But air carriers, nearly all losing money 
in existing markets, have balked so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many county residents, Fulton is ambivalent about the prospect of an 
airport, because its approval could prompt a boom similar to Orange County's 
after the expansion of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a businessman, I can tell you that the lack of an airport is the single 
biggest impediment to doing business around here," he said. "And I think in the 
long run, this county needs air connection to the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the lack of an airport is one thing that has kept this area 
nice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Ventura County can maintain its high quality of life will be a 
pressing question over the next 20 years, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to livability is short commutes," he said. So each city must strive 
to balance jobs and population. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura and Oxnard are unique among the cities in Southern California because 
they have almost a perfect balance of homes and jobs, regional studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley and Moorpark must continue to expand their industrial base, 
and Thousand Oaks its job market, if residents are to escape commuter gridlock 
in 2010, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how Ventura County responds to growth pressure, its proximity to Los 
Angeles County is an overriding consideration, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Approval of 40 million square feet of space at Warner Center (in Woodland 
Hills) may be the single most important planning decision to affect Ventura 
County," he said. "Camarillo is only half an hour away." Fulton's List 
</P>
<P>
 Best Planning Decisions 
</P>
<P>
 * Adoption by cities and Ventura County of Guidelines for Orderly Development 
in 1969: "It created a rational regional context for land-use planning. It made 
each of the cities identifiably separate. You usually know what town you're in 
in Ventura County. It reduced the competition among the cities, so they weren't 
annexing like crazy. I don't think they suppressed that much demand for growth, 
and we've been able to channel growth pretty rationally." 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of the Santa Monica Mountains planning process: "The National 
Recreation Area and the (Santa Monica) Mountains Conservancy was one of the 
very important and good things. It created a regional framework for what should 
go where -- where stuff should be built and where it shouldn't. The Ahmanson 
Ranch would have been built long ago without the (recreation area)." 
</P>
<P>
 * City support for historic downtowns in Oxnard, Ventura, Fillmore, Ojai and 
Santa Paula: "They never did what many areas did -- use the iron mallet of 
redevelopment to tear down our downtowns. Everybody can identify with the 
central part of these towns. People say Ventura did some bad things -- the 
condos on the hills. But nobody said, 'Let's extend the redevelopment area and 
knock down the Ventura Theatre.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura's restoration of the old county courthouse and its conversion into 
City Hall: "If there is any one building that makes Ventura a place, that's it. 
It's everything a beautiful building should be. It's up a hill. It overlooks 
the ocean. It's just spectacularly beautiful, and it would have been awful to 
let something happen to it. . . . (Such buildings) go together in creating 
definable places." 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of Metrolink to the west county: "The prospect of using Metrolink 
creatively to link the county together is real. The best example of its 
creative use is when they started to run trains in reverse to the County Fair. 
And now it's to the Beach Party. The fairgrounds are a focal point for the 
whole county. And Metrolink is great for Simi Valley and Moorpark. It will help 
to make Simi and Moopark more economically connected with the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Planning Decisions 
</P>
<P>
 * Locating the Cal State university campus west of Camarillo: "The site is a 
disaster. If you think you can put Cal State on farmland away from the freeway 
and keep the rest of the greenbelt, you're nuts. If they'd picked the Lusk 
property (in Ventura), they'd knock out one farm right on the freeway adjacent 
to the city rather than taking out a whole greenbelt. You can argue (the 
Camarillo site's) central location. From Thousand Oaks, it's not as far to 
drive. But that's only one point." 
</P>
<P>
 * Johnson Drive development in Ventura: "That is my favorite bad-planning 
decision. It was a large tract of land with one property owner. It is the 
gateway to the city. You could have done anything with that to let people know, 
'You're in a place in the city of Ventura.' Instead, they built a no-brainer. 
You throw down six-lane roads, a pad for Carl's Jr., a pad for Toys R Us, then 
across the street a pad for movie theaters. I wonder how many times I have 
eaten dinner at the Chinese restaurant and then decided whether I should risk 
my life and run across to the theater. You have to get in your car. And once 
you're in your car, you can go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 * Moving county offices out of the Ventura downtown: "That removed from the 
downtown any hope of Ventura being a true office and government center. It's 
left to specialty retail. I admit there are so many physical constrictions, it 
would have been really hard to build in the downtown. They needed a tremendous 
amount of space. But they could have at least kept the courthouse downtown. I'm 
not sure in the long run what has been gained. Ultimately, it was a real bad 
decision, a real growth inducer." 
</P>
<P>
 * Oxnard Financial Plaza: "They're huge buildings in a suburban setting. They 
have the components of a skyscraper office building, a business hotel and a 
financial low-rise. But to organize it in such a poor way on the ground level 
so you can't avoid walking across a parking lot is just poor planning. I have a 
problem trying to figure out even what the front of that place is. That creates 
cognitive pain. . . . You don't know where anything is relative to anything 
else. It's an obstruction even to business. The age of throwing up buildings 
ought to be over. That place really drives me nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Radisson Suite Hotel in Oxnard: "It's a dumb location, and it was a dumb 
deal for the city. They thought, 'Oh gosh, we'll get the Radisson and we'll get 
the (Los Angeles) Raiders training camp. We'll do the deal as a redevelopment 
project and we'll be fine.' They thought the team would be a tourist draw. They 
forgot they were dealing with Al Davis, who immediately put up a wall all 
around the practice field. Then the city guaranteed payments on the (site 
improvement) bonds and was hung out to dry to the tune of $1 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sales Tax Canyon" (near Rose Avenue): "That is not entirely Oxnard's fault 
because, in part, they responded to state tax law. Look how tempting that was. 
You have a needy population, and you're able to annex a lot of property 
adjacent to the freeway, so you just load it up with any retail you can get. 
Then you have these off-ramps designed for lemon trucks. Oxnard sees itself as 
getting a leg up on other cities with the auto dealerships, but look what's 
happened to Oxnard Boulevard. . . . Then the business culture has come to 
expect tributes in tax breaks. Sales Tax Canyon is a manifestation of that, and 
it's going to turn out to be a mess forever. There's no way (for traffic) to 
get through that bend right now." Profile of William Fulton

ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 180; CALPAW COULD EXPAND COUNTY PARKLAND; RESOURCES: 
SUPPORTERS CALL IT A WAY TO PRESERVE FARM PROPERTY AND BEACHES. OPPONENTS SAY 
THE STATE CAN'T AFFORD SUCH A LARGE BOND AND THE LOSS OF TAX REVENUE. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County could expand its parks, restore or purchase portions of its 
rivers and beaches, preserve farmland, and build a new bike path and mountain 
trails if voters in June approve a bond measure dubbed CALPAW. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Parks and Wildlife Initiative -- Proposition 180 on the 
statewide ballot June 7 -- would provide more than $50 million for Ventura 
County projects out of nearly $2 billion to be spent statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative has both supporters and detractors in the county. A county 
taxpayer advocate group calls it too expensive during tough economic times. But 
supporters say it would provide money for valuable parks and other outdoor 
programs without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bond is approved, the state would sell bonds to be paid off by the 
state's general fund. Based on the state's population, supporters say it would 
cost each Californian about 50 cents per month. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond money, which would represent one of the largest windfalls ever 
received by Ventura County from a statewide initiative, would buy open space 
and protect habitat from Point Mugu State Park to the Santa Susana Mountains 
and from Oxnard's coastline to Ojai's meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Horseback and bicycle riders around Thousand Oaks would have more property for 
trails and paths through the nearby hills. Woodlands in Santa Clarita would be 
connected to Rocky Peak Park in the Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Private property that separates chunks of existing parkland in the Santa 
Monica Mountains would be purchased and Point Mugu State Park would be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rights to 40 acres of Ventura County farmland could be purchased as part of a 
pilot program to prevent future development. A pair of scenic meadows in the 
Ojai Valley could be kept green and open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And wildlife habitat along the Santa Clara River would be preserved and part 
of the Ventura River estuary would be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a bike trail linking the beach to the Ojai Valley Trail could be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bond provides money for habitat restoration for a whole host of flora 
and fauna, including endangered species," said Everett Millais, director of 
community development for the city of Ventura. "It provides real long-term 
benefits for the area, not just for the city of Ventura, but for the entire 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 Millais said that the Ventura City Council has not yet taken a position on the 
initiative, but that the city administration had worked to help develop 
portions of the initiative and urges voters to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council has already supported it, and the Board of Supervisors, 
at Supervisor Susan K. Lacey's urging, will consider endorsing it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But support for the measure hasn't been unanimous in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a general obligation bond that the state cannot afford at this time," 
said Mike Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. 
"This is one of the largest state bonds in history and does not address more 
pressing problems in the state, such as crime prevention and public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Saliba said it would also reduce tax revenue to the state and county. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Bohannon, the county's lobbyist, agreed that taking vast tracts of land 
out of private hands and therefore off the tax rolls would reduce revenue, 
although she could not say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
 "A loss in property taxes ultimately means a reduction in services with time, 
and maybe that's what the public is willing to have in exchange for parks, open 
space and habitat in our community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bohannon said she would ask the board to support the measure, she 
said the public historically has approved very few bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "In good times, voters don't approve a lot of bonds and in tough fiscal times, 
they approve a lot fewer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a statewide poll taken three weeks ago by the California Planning and 
Conservation League, which is sponsoring the measure, showed the measure ahead 
57% to 34%, said Lynn Sadler, natural resources director for the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other bond measures that simply create a pool of money for a general 
purpose, CALPAW identifies the specific projects it would fund. The list of 
projects was compiled over two years with cooperation from all those 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the voters like to know where the money is going," Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the funding is outlined for specific projects, all funds would be 
administered through state or local agencies to control the quality of the 
projects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy would administer the largest sum of 
money in Ventura County. Rory Skei, assistant executive officer of the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, said $42.5 million is 
designated for the authority in CALPAW. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those funds, $7 million would be designated specifically for Ventura 
County, but much more would be spent within the county's boundaries, Skei said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would set aside $5 million for the Eastern Ventura County 
Conservation Authority for projects between Happy Camp Canyon Park near 
Moorpark and Rocky Peak Park east of Simi Valley, including the Big Sky Ranch 
and Hidden Creek Ranch areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservation authority would like to buy blocks of land to link the parks, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's about 12,000 acres of land there, but of course $5 million won't buy 
all that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skei also hopes that the conservancy could acquire land for trails linking 
woodlands in Santa Clarita to Rocky Peak Park, which is an essential element in 
a plan to link open space across Ventura County into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get Rocky Peak linking to Santa Clarita woodlands, we would have a 
pretty spectacular recreational trail area," Skei said. "But far more 
important, we would be able to preserve some truly significant habitat for 
everything from mule deer to salamanders." 
</P>
<P>
 Another $2 million would help the Conejo Valley Open Space group acquire land 
to build trails for horse riders, bikers and hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can stand in the middle of this town and see hillsides that will never be 
developed," said Jeff Alexander, a member of the group and owner of the T. O. 
Corral, a tack store on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether voters believe that empty space is good. We think it 
is, and we have seen the financial and lifestyle benefits of that in this 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would carry $2 million to be used by the California Department of 
Parks and Recreation to expand Point Mugu State Park and public holdings along 
Boney Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ormond Beach, where developers once planned a 5,000-home community with 
marinas and hotels, area activists who helped draft the proposal for CALPAW 
have several ideas for the $3 million that would be allocated there. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma Armbrust, who has headed a drive by the nonprofit Ormond Beach Observers 
to preserve Ormond Beach, said the group would like to buy land at the beach, 
which is home to endangered nesting least terns, among other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Baldwin Co. (the developer) paid $23 million for 341 acres, so how 
much do you think we can get for $3 million?" she asked. Still, she said, the 
group is excited at the many prospects for the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The group may be able to use the funds to enhance the land held by the Baldwin 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust envisions the possibility of a visitors center, a laboratory or other 
facility for use by Cal State University once the Ventura County campus opens 
after the turn of the century. Its plans also include protected trails with 
limited access. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $2 million would be set aside to buy development rights to a 40-acre 
plot of farmland, probably on the Oxnard Plain. The Ventura County Agricultural 
Land Trust and Conservancy, which was formed in 1992, would purchase 
development rights while leaving the land in the hands of farmers, said Larry 
Rose, a member of the board. In short, the conservancy would compensate farmers 
for not selling their land to developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would ideally want to acquire development rights through donation, but 
this would be valuable as a good demonstration project of how it could work." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the benefits are twofold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would put the land under a deed restriction to tie up the land for 
perpetuity in agriculture production, and the influx of cash to the land owners 
would avail them of the benefits of development without having to sell the 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ojai Valley, $3 million would be available to the Ojai Valley Land 
Conservancy to buy land or development rights to Besant Meadow, a wetland and 
eucalyptus grove where a 150-unit senior housing project was once proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crucial piece of land because it is the gateway to the city," said 
Patricia Weinberger, director of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were coming into the city, would you rather see a line of condos or 
trailer parks, or open space? Open space is the prime use for that land." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds could also help preserve other property known as the Krishnamurti / 
Krotona meadow near Nordhoff High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Clara River Valley, CALPAW would have $1 million set aside to buy 
land to preserve habitat along the 100-mile-long Santa Clara River, which 
supports many endangered species and is the subject of a large study to 
determine how to preserve its integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "CALPAW is absolutely critical to the work that needs to be done to protect 
these valuable wetlands areas," said Ron Bottorff, chairman of the Friends of 
the Santa Clara River. "It's also critical to support the California Coastal 
Conservancy and the efforts on the Santa Clara River Management Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Ventura River, the initiative would provide $1.5 million to help 
restore the estuary and $2 million for nearby Seaside Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Millais, at the city of Ventura, said restoration funds would help remove the 
giant reed Arundo Donax, which has invaded the river's 16-mile length. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also help acquire more land for the public domain and establish the 
Seaside Wilderness Park on the western bank of the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, another $2 million would be set aside to buy land to build a 
bicycle trail linking the Omer Rains trail at the beach to the Ojai Valley 
Trail that begins at Foster Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have bike trail linkage from the ocean to the Ojai Valley," he said. 
"It would be a tremendous asset to everyone in the west county."

HILLY HAVEN; CAMARILLO HEIGHTS OFFERS MIX OF LIFESTYLES IN A COUNTRY SETTING

<P>
 When Bob and Annie Laurie Jochum moved to Camarillo Heights in 1963, they knew 
immediately that they had found the place they wanted to live for the rest of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three decades later, with their three children grown and moved out, the 
Jochums say they are still just as happy with the community as they were the 
day they signed the title to their one-third-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really marvelous," said Bob Jochum, 69. "It still has the kind of rural 
feel that attracted us in the first place. There's a feeling here that you can 
stretch out and not run into someone doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Heights takes its name from the territory originally held by the 
Spanish ranch-owning family. Development of the county-held community began in 
the early 1950s, predating Camarillo's 1964 incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched above the city, Camarillo Heights is home to about 3,400 residents who 
live in a small, hilly enclave roughly 670 acres in size. The main road through 
the community, North Loop Drive, is one of a handful of cramped, curvy streets 
lacing the area. To its north is a mixture of hilly, undeveloped land and 
farming parcels that stretch to California 118. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of the neatly planned, uniform tracts beneath it, Camarillo 
Heights is an eclectic place, said Nancy Francis, manager of residential 
land-use for the Ventura County Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different than what you see in the city because when the area was being 
developed, it wasn't subject to the same kind of zoning standards that there 
are today," Francis said. "I think that some of residents still today think 
that the rules up there are less strict than they would be in the city or 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 1,200 dwellings within the loose confines of Camarillo Heights 
-- an area generally bordered by Loop Drive to the north, Altamont Way to the 
west, Alosta Drive to the east and the city limits to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Most new construction in the neighborhood has slowed in favor of renovation or 
add-on projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been developed and settled for a while now," Francis said. "We're not 
seeing a lot of new, from-the-ground-up construction starts there." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the cookie-cutter sameness of many houses in the tracts below them, the 
homes in Camarillo Heights are a wide-ranging mix of styles and price ranges -- 
a key part of the neighborhood's attraction, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrow two-lane streets and the dense brush and trees found in the area add to 
its distinctly country-like environment, they add. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely country and we like it that way," said Della Abernathy, 70, 
who with her husband, Robert, has lived in the neighborhood since 1954. "When 
we got here, you could tell that the flatlands were going to be subdivided and 
we wanted to avoid that." 
</P>
<P>
 As taken as the Jochums were with Camarillo Heights' attractions, the family 
at one point in the early 1970s flirted with the idea of moving to Napa County, 
and even bought a piece of property there. But they abandoned the plan after 
realizing how close their ties were to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always kidded my wife, Annie Laurie, that she had put roots down that ran 
clear to China," Jochum said. "We both realized that we just had too many good 
friends here and we opted to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Early residents recall having to clear lemon groves from their parcels before 
building could start. Such was the case with the Jochums, who, with a family 
named Reedy, spent long hours after work and on weekends clearing a grove and 
then building on a parcel that later became known as Jody Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cleared the land, then subdivided it," Jochum said. "A neighbor of mine 
named Reedy and I then built several homes on the block. We even named it -- 
partially after his last name and partly after ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the tree-shrouded streets where Volkswagens can be found along with 
Lincolns, homes range from modest stucco ranch houses to custom-designed 
residences worth more than $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 At Camarillo Heights School on Catalina Drive, children of affluent parents 
mix well with those families whose children are middle-class or lower, 
Principal Gerry Hamor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamor said the elementary school, the second oldest in the Pleasant Valley 
School District, educates the neighborhood's children but also acts as a 
community center of sorts. During evenings and weekends, the school's athletic 
field is often abuzz with a hotly contested Little League game or soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the Heights like to come by just to take walks. This is a place 
well-supported by the local community," Hamor said. "It's pretty rare when you 
find that many of your parents attended this place when they were young. We're 
now seeing, with some families, a second generation come through." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Rao, 39, president of the Camarillo Heights PTA, said that while the 
community has its share of older, more established families, younger families 
are also attracted to the special environment that the neighborhood offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao's husband, Kris, also 39, who works as a camera operator in the motion 
picture industry in Los Angeles, willingly makes the long commute several times 
a week because of the family's satisfaction with Camarillo Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, Camarillo Heights seemed to be the longest commutable distance that 
we could stand," said Sandy Rao, who along with the couple's three daughters 
lived in a small house in Venice before moving to Ventura County two years ago. 
"It's got a rural feeling, yet it has all the suburban conveniences. We're 
happy here." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose said the city has occasionally annexed parcels of 
Camarillo Heights but has done so only at the request of the individual 
property owner -- a policy made evident by the neighborhood's jagged southern 
borderline with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot involved in the process of annexation. It's our policy not to 
annex property unless we're asked to," Gose said. "Increasingly, it's more and 
more expensive to do so because of the costs of running sewer and water lines 
up there." 
</P>
<P>
 But when applications for new buildings in Camarillo Heights are submitted, 
county planning officials often ask city planning staff to approve the projects 
because of their proximity to the city, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said city planners occasionally request developers of larger 
properties in the area to install sewer lines in anticipation that one day the 
area will be hooked up to the city's sewer system. Currently, most of the 
area's residences use septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 For Peggy Smaby and her husband, Richard, who run a children's art class 
studio out of their home, Camarillo Heights has been home for 20 years. Smaby, 
60, said she can remember the days when her children, who were in the local 4-H 
Club, regularly took their 1,100-pound pet steer for walks on Mesa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you'd see that now, but that was the kind of place it was," 
Peggy Smaby said. "I think we all like it up here just because it's not the 
city. There's a feeling of country independence here that you don't find in 
many other places."

STREET SMART: DIRECTIONAL SIGNS ARE READY AND WAITING FOR THEIR TURN 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm concerned about the lack of street signs at a confusing intersection in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection of Main Street, Thompson Boulevard and Telegraph Road is 
complicated, but there are no street signs to help guide drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 I know of a woman who was so confused, she turned from westbound Main into the 
oncoming traffic on Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible to install overhead street signs with arrows to help 
clear up the confusion? 
</P>
<P>
 Sarath Abeyweera, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The signs you ask for are sitting at Ventura City Hall, waiting to be 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs for several intersections, including Main-Thompson-Telegraph, arrived at 
the city several months ago. But a backlog of traffic improvement projects has 
kept city workers from installing them, Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had difficulty getting to it because we're short on staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed up the process, the city will put the sign installation work out to 
bid. Even so, it may still be another six months to a year before the signs go 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has to wait its turn," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Right in front of Ventura City Hall, there's a stop sign that is regularly 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, I head west on Poli Street to California Street and turn left. And 
just about every day, cars coming east down Poli ignore the stop sign in front 
of them and barrel ahead, just as I'm trying to make my turn. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had many close calls here, and if something isn't done to clarify who has 
the right of way, someone is going to get hit. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign could be posted warning drivers to watch out for cars turning left. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this be done? 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stammen, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 No such sign exists in the state code of traffic signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a special sign for that intersection would require permission from 
the state's Traffic Control Devices Committee, says Nazir Lalani, Ventura's 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of gaining approval would be slim, Lalani says, because the 
accident level at California and Poli is relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're trying to get permission to do something different, you have to 
have a really good reason," he said. "Without a high accident rate, it would be 
difficult to make a case for a special sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalani says he will ask Ventura police to step up patrols of the area, to 
watch for drivers who go through the intersection without stopping. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling out of the parking lot at the Thousand Oaks post office onto 
Duesenberg Drive is always a nerve-racking experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant flow of oncoming traffic makes it difficult and dangerous to turn 
left onto Duesenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 During post office hours, the roadway is jammed, and there is no signal or 
stop sign to make turning easier. So you end up taking your chances in trying 
to get across the busy roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Could a traffic signal or stop sign be installed? 
</P>
<P>
 Charleen Cramer, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Putting a stop sign or stop light at the post office exit would only make 
things worse, says Jeff Knowles, assistant city traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too close to the intersection of Duesenberg and Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard," Knowles said. "A signal or stop sign there would cause traffic 
backups and accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's traffic department has studied the impact of widening the roadway 
to help move traffic along. But such a project would be costly and require 
chopping down several old trees -- not a popular proposition in a city 
concerned with scenic beautification, Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is focusing its traffic improvement efforts on several more 
accident-prone intersections, Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are problems here," Knowles said. "It's just not a top priority 
right now." STOP SIGN UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Ventura reader wrote to complain about a new stop sign at 
Henderson Road and Emerald Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The reader said the sign was too high, too far from the roadway and partly 
obscured by foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani checked out the intersection and says 
the sign is clearly visible and he could find nothing wrong with its placement. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign is posted a bit farther back from the road than drivers might be used 
to so it complies with regulations in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those regulations, there must be at least four feet of clear 
walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the height of the sign, Lalani says it meets state traffic 
regulations that require signs to be posted seven feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're satisfied that the job was done correctly," he said.

WOODPECKERS INFLICT COSTLY DAMAGE UPON POWER POLES; UTILITIES: EDISON OFFICIALS 
COMPLAIN THAT THE BIRDS CAN DRAMATICALLY CARVE UP THE LIFE SPAN OF THE WOODEN 
POSTS. BUT AVIAN ENTHUSIASTS QUESTION THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. 
</P>

<P>
 All across Ventura County, they are drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 For some residents, the sound of a woodpecker rat-a-tatting into a tree is a 
mere annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
 To Southern California Edison, however, it is a growing expense that the 
company has tried to control. 
</P>
<P>
 One anti-woodpecker tactic is to spray chemicals on the power poles to harden 
the wood so that the birds go elsewhere to do their pecking. 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach is to wrap the poles in wire mesh, so that the birds can't 
get their beaks up to the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodpeckers cause a lot of damage to utility poles," said David Himmel, 
spokesman for Edison. "They use the poles to store food." 
</P>
<P>
 In certain areas of Ventura County, such as Ojai and Thousand Oaks, where 
there are high concentrations of woodpeckers, poles are so heavily carved that 
they need to be replaced every five years, Himmel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, a utility pole can last up to 20 years, Himmel said. 
</P>
<P>
 To slow the damage, Edison fends off the woodpeckers with its wood-hardening 
chemicals and wire mesh defenses. But those are only stop-gap measures, Himmel 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sure-fire way to keep woodpeckers from hacking away power poles, 
however, is to make the poles less appealing by switching to Fiberglas poles. 
But for now, they are considered too expensive, Himmel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Morris, an Edison maintenance employee, said he is appalled by the 
damage on some poles he sees in wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's like a Swiss-cheese pole, full of holes that are filled with 
acorns," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But bird experts said they question the extent of such damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda O'Neil, a bird-watcher from Ventura, said she has not seen the damage 
firsthand, but doubts if it is really necessary for Edison to replace utility 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
 And Edison officials say residents sometimes complain that the power company 
is making life too tough on the woodpeckers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people get upset because we are taking the birds' home away," 
Morris said. "But we need to do that for our own safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said a pole can be so damaged that workers cannot make needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we let it go too long, the pole will either fall down or be so 
deteriorated that it would be impossible for us to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Poles damaged by woodpeckers can also cause power failures, creating blackouts 
that last for hours, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But utility poles are not the only target for woodpeckers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not common, woodpeckers also attack houses, said Robert Mesta, 
an ornithologist with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a handful of calls a year by residents asking what to do about 
woodpeckers which have a nest or store food in a home," Mesta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodpeckers can cause serious damage to homes by carving holes into the wood, 
allowing small insects and mice to come in through the roof, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesta said he usually refers callers to Fish and Wildlife law enforcement 
officials, who can advise residents how to get rid of woodpeckers without 
violating the law, protects woodpeckers from being shot or from having their 
nests destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things that you cannot do to a woodpecker," he said. "I 
usually recommend that people contact a law enforcement branch or a wildlife 
group, which can do everything from patch up a hole or relocate the woodpecker 
and the nest to another area." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil said one of the most common ways to scare away woodpeckers is to hang 
flashy dangling items around the target area. 
</P>
<P>
 As the current spring nesting season ends, Edison's workers and residents 
should watch out. Woodpeckers will be out teaching their newborns how to make 
holes, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all feeding birds right now," O'Neil said. "Early June, July, they 
will be out with their family showing them how to build holes."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL MAY BE PRIVATIZED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council will consider a proposal Tuesday to privatize the 
annual California Strawberry Festival, one of the city's largest events. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would allow the city's festival committee, which has organized 
the two-day event for several years, to form a private nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members have recommended that the council approve the measure and 
appropriate $600,000 for production and operation of the festival, a staff 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the past five years, the festival has generated more than $500,000 
for the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the council will decide whether to authorize a management 
services contract with Bill Garlock to manage the city's Special Events and 
Festivals Program, including the 1995 and 1996 festivals. If approved, Garlock 
would receive $146,350 plus incentives, a staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlock has managed the festival for eight years. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PROPOSAL WOULD HIKE WATER, SEWAGE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residential water and sewage rates in Ventura would rise 7% under a proposal 
the City Council will vote on tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 A median household in Ventura spends about $75.25 on water and sewage every 
two months.The ordinance under consideration would raise that bill by $4.91 
bimonthly. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 last week in preliminarily approving the increase, 
which also raises rates for commercial customers by 10% and industrial 
customers by 12% to 18%. Councilmen Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan voted 
against the increase because they said it was not good for business. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the increases would be effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee hikes would pay for increased operating costs, and future water and 
sewer projects. A limited amount would pay for a low-interest loan program to 
help businesses invest in sanitation pre-treatment facilities that would lower 
their overall sanitation costs. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SATICOY; LIBRARY WILL GET NEW, LARGER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than three years after its former site was demolished, the tiny Saticoy 
Library is getting a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $238,000 in federal and county grants, along with donations from 
local businesses, will cover the cost of a portable building measuring 2,400 
square feet -- six times the size of the library's temporary quarters, said 
Dixie Adeniran, director of the Ventura County Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just thrilled that we're going to be able to make this happen," she 
said. "We've been trying for three years and it's finally going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to take about a year, Adeniran said. A grand opening 
is tentatively scheduled for June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The new library, which will be on the south side of Violeta Street west of 
Campanula Avenue, will be equipped with a computerized catalogue system and 
ample seating. Thousands of books will be brought out of storage to fill the 
shelves, which will hold up to 18,000 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The library project is being funded with $150,000 in federal Community 
Development Block Grant funds and $88,000 from the county and local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials sought the federal funds after a $1.7-million cut in their 
budget last year forced them to lay off employees and cut operating hours at 16 
libraries throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being squeezed from every direction, so this funding is a big help," 
Adeniran said. "We would have been very stymied without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the new building opens, the library will continue to operate at its 
current site, the meeting room of the Saticoy Community Center at 11168 Violeta 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents interested in volunteering to help set up the new library should 
call 652-7517. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SEWER PROJECT WILL FORCE STREET CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two blocks of the downtown portion of Ojai Avenue will be closed this week 
while a 67-year-old sewer line is replaced, officials with the Ojai Valley 
Sanitation District said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic will be detoured around the Ojai Arcade and nearby shopping areas 
along Matilija Street starting today.Ojai Avenue will be closed between 
Montgomery and Ventura streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is probably the most heavily traveled intersection in town," said Eric 
Oltmann, general manager of the district. "We've known that this has been 
coming for several years and have talked to the Chamber (of Commerce) several 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 The project's contractor, Dorfman Construction, has notified downtown 
merchants by mail of the road closure, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong construction project is part of the district's sewer replacement 
program, which started in August and is expected to be completed by June 30. 
The district is uprooting 55,000 feet of sewer line that has served Ojai since 
1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the project is 75% complete," Oltmann said. "Virtually all the 
remaining work is in the residential areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The sewer line runs through the center of town along Ojai Avenue from Foothill 
Road to Bryant Street, and in several directions to the north and south like 
"octopus tentacles," Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sewer is costing the district $6.5 million. Ojai sewer users will pay 
an additional $5.96 per month for the next 20 years to pay for the system, 
while users in the unincorporated areas around Ojai will pay an extra $3.73 a 
month, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sewers in our infrastructure have been neglected," he said. "It's a terribly 
expensive project." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; QUAYLE TO HEADLINE HUMOR CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conservatives on Tuesday will get to show not so much that they can take 
jokes, but that they can dish them out. 
</P>
<P>
 At a conference titled "Do Conservatives Have a Sense of Humor?" three 
prominent conservatives will take a look at the role of humor in politics 
today.The conference will be held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who was the butt of late-night talk-show 
jokes during his years in Washington, will be on hand to discuss his new book, 
"Standing Firm." 
</P>
<P>
 In a chapter titled "Baked, Mashed and Fried" -- which alludes to the ridicule 
Quayle suffered after misspelling the word potato in front of a elementary 
school class -- Quayle discusses what many have characterized as the gaffes of 
his vice presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the chapter is a recounting of his criticism of television 
character Murphy Brown for her decision to have a baby without a husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle, who has said he may run for President in 1996, will also discuss his 
views on the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 P. J. O'Rourke, author of "Give War a Chance" and "Parliament of Whores," and 
former Reagan assistant Lyn Nofziger will speak at the conference. A Washington 
group called "The Capitol Steps" will round out the day with comedic songs 
about topical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference begins at 10 a.m. After the conference, Quayle is scheduled to 
sign copies of his book at the Reagan library gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are available for $45 per person, which will include lunch. For 
reservations, call 522-2977. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FINAL APPROVAL FOR ZONE CHANGE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A massive housing and business development on the site of the Simi Valley Days 
fair is set to go before the Simi Valley City Council tonight for final 
approval of zoning changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's approval would allow three developers to proceed with plans for 
building about 560 houses and apartments and a variety of businesses on more 
than 60 acres at Los Angeles Avenue and Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also vote on whether to extend a $700,000, five-year loan to 
Griffin Industries to help it build a 280-unit condominium project on 26.7 
acres of the site. The measure would defer $50,000 in city and special district 
development fees until the loan comes due, said Diane Jones, director of the 
city's Department of Environmental Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer expects to designate 70 three-bedroom units in the project as 
affordable housing, selling them for slightly more than $90,000 to lower income 
families. Jones said Griffin Industries is expected to apply soon for a permit 
to draw up development plans, which would then be reviewed by the Planning 
Commission and the council. MACK REED

MAN BARRICADES HIMSELF IN VENTURA HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police converged on a house on the 1200 block of East Main Street late 
Sunday, responding to a call of shots fired, and discovered an armed man 
barricaded inside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving officers were told by witnesses that a man inside the home possessed 
a shotgun and a 9-millimeter handgun and may have barricaded himself following 
a dispute with his girlfriend that ended with him taking a shot at one of his 
girlfriend's female friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's identity was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers got the first emergency call around 9:05 p.m. when a neighbor 
arriving home heard one gunshot followed by the sound of a shotgun being 
cocked. The neighbor, who refused to be identified, said the man was a 
commercial painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Officer Juan Reynoso said the incident apparently started as a 
domestic dispute between the man, his girlfriend and two of her female friends. 
Reynoso said the man is believed to have fired one round at one of his 
girlfriend's friends, but apparently missed. No injuries were reported. Reynoso 
said the man is believed to possess more weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The girlfriend and her friends escaped from the house unharmed.

2 INJURED IN SEPARATE SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman bystander was shot and wounded during a family dispute and was rushed 
to an Oxnard emergency room, and a man with a bullet hole through his neck was 
in fair condition at a Ventura hospital after separate weekend shootings, 
police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Sosa, 35, was shot once in the leg behind an apartment complex in the 
1100 block of North H Street in Oxnard about 4 p.m. Sunday, Oxnard Police 
Officer Clifford Waer said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa, who was not the intended victim, was shot when an argument between two 
men erupted into gunfire. Waer said one of the men produced a handgun during 
the argument and began firing, hitting Sosa, who was standing nearby, but 
missing the other man. The gunman is believed to have fired at least three 
shots. Police would not say why they are classifying the argument as a family 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. At her 
family's request, no information on her condition was available Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said late Sunday that they were still looking for the 
gunman, described as a man in his 20s, who fled in a blue-colored sedan. As of 
late Sunday, police had not made any arrests in connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the incident was another example of what they called increasing 
violence in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, this place is getting as bad as Chicago," said Joseph Pena, 32. "It's 
really getting out of hand around here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura shooting, Adalberto Ramirez, 18, of Ventura, was shot through 
the neck by a lone driver in another vehicle as both drivers waited at a red 
light at Center Street and Ventura Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in fair condition late Sunday at Ventura County Medical Center, where 
he was treated for a bullet wound to his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a lucky young man because the bullet went in and then out again," said 
Sgt. Carl Handy, who is investigating the shooting. "We never recovered the 
bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Ramirez and four passengers were traveling north on Ventura Avenue 
about 9:15 p.m. Saturday when they stopped at a traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
 When the suspect pulled alongside Ramirez, the drivers exchanged hand gestures 
before the suspect fired two shots from a large-caliber handgun at Ramirez's 
car, Handy said.

DEATHS PROMPT SHIFTS IN POLICE USE OF HOGTYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement policies on hogtying combative suspects are being challenged 
and in many cases revamped across Los Angeles County after a series of recent 
deaths partly linked to the tactic and mounting medical evidence of its 
potentially lethal effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since controversy erupted over the death of a Pasadena barber who 
had been hogtied by police, records show that three additional, little-noticed 
deaths in police custody have been partially attributed to the effects of 
hogtying -- or hobbling, in police parlance. The cases have fueled potentially 
costly wrongful death claims and a flurry of policy changes by police and 
paramedics, ranging from minor tinkering to an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically used when officers confront violent or drug-intoxicated suspects 
acting bizarrely, hogtying immobilizes an arrestee by attaching the ankles to 
cuffed hands behind the back using a cord or strap. Some agencies, such as the 
LAPD, see it as an effective tool on the streets. But others, including the New 
York Police Department, banned it years ago and use padded Velcro strips to 
restrain suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 By some accounts, hogtying gained favor in Los Angeles in the 1980s when 
officers found themselves increasingly confronting PCP users exhibiting 
superhuman strength. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hubert Williams, a former New Jersey police chief and now president of the 
Washington, D.C.-based Police Foundation, said "most departments don't use 
hogtying." It appears to be more common in the West, he said. Still, the tactic 
has largely escaped serious study as researchers have focused on what they 
considered more lethal police practices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an area that really cries out for more serious attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the newly heightened scrutiny locally is that medical 
examiners, influenced by recent West Coast studies, are increasingly citing 
hogtying and its effects as a contributing cause of death in police custody 
cases. Researchers have found that hogtying, particularly when excited or obese 
suspects are placed on their stomachs, can interfere with their ability to 
breathe and can be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the growing awareness . . . our doctors are looking at this very 
critically," said Scott Carrier, spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of five years of police custody deaths in the county by The Times in 
early 1993, after the death of the Pasadena barber, Michael James Bryant, found 
that restraint tactics were cited as a contributing cause in just five cases. 
By contrast, in just nine months since that period, hogtying or its effects 
have been cited as a contributing factor in at least four deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The first direct links between hogtying and sudden deaths in police custody 
were made in a 1992 study co-authored by Seattle area coroner Donald Reay. A 
broader study by Ventura County coroner Ronald O'Halloran, published in 
December, further documented the risk and suggested that it would be "both 
humane and prudent to develop some safer means of control and protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials stress, circumstances vary widely in such cases, and it is 
often near impossible to say conclusively that a person would not have died 
without the hogtying. "It's not black and white," said Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 With understanding of the dangers still evolving -- and some police officials 
saying alternatives for dealing with violent, often drug-intoxicated suspects 
are limited -- city representatives maintain that they are addressing the issue 
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we are learning," said attorney Bruce Praet, whose law firm 
represents dozens of police agencies in Southern California. "(But) it's not 
like the bad guys are taking a break while we test these things. There 
obviously is a need to prevent people from kicking officers, nurses, 
(paramedics) and kicking the windows out of patrol cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths are providing ammunition to watchdog groups for a full assault on 
the practice, reminiscent of earlier controversies over use of chokeholds, 
which eventually were banned by the LAPD and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really intend to go after the use of the hogtying," said John Burton, a 
board member of a group called Police Watch and an attorney representing the 
family of a 30-year-old man who died in September after being hogtied by Bell 
Gardens police. Burton says law enforcement is "acting completely irresponsibly 
to allow these death cases to mount. Hogtying someone is barbaric. It really 
has no place in a society that gets sanctimonious about someone getting caned 
in Singapore." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent modifications of hobbling policies may raise additional safety 
questions, records and interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the LAPD revised its policy in late 1992, after medical studies 
first pointed to the potential dangers and a jury awarded $1.1 million to the 
parents of a man who died after being hogtied. The new policy requires hogtied 
suspects to be kept on their side, which is considered safer, although they 
still may be transported while hobbled in the back seat of patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you should transport them in that mode," said Reay, the Seattle 
coroner who did pioneering research on the issue. "I think that's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD also appears to allow tighter cinching of the behind-the-back 
restraint during transport than some other agencies, including the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department, which also has revamped its policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not designed to be torture," said LAPD Lt. John Dunkin. "(But) if they 
still are able to flex and unflex their knees, then you wouldn't have obtained 
the desired result . . . preventing them from kicking about." Dunkin added that 
the procedure is under continuing review. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department policy, amended after the Bryant case, requires 
arrestees to be transported sitting upright in a patrol car. Legs are secured 
by a strap, which can be held in place by closing the patrol car door on it. 
Those who must be transported lying down are required to travel by ambulance, 
strapped to a gurney on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 But questions now are arising about the modified versions of the restraint. 
The Sheriff's Department is examining what role the revised hobble may have 
played in the January death of an Azusa man. The coroner's office ruled the 
death a homicide caused by the combined effects of drug intoxication and 
various restraint procedures used by deputies, including the hobble. According 
to the department's account of the incident, deputies followed the new 
procedures and kept the man on his side. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing review is looking "at different (arrestee) positions using the 
hobble (and whether) we need to change the position of the hobble itself," said 
Sgt. Gilbert Aguilar, who works on training issues involving field deputies. 
"We have to reduce the risks being experienced out there with sudden death." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena recently banned hogtying altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 As practices and policies shift, there are potentially large financial stakes 
for taxpayers. "Once we identify something as a hazard . . . there are great 
risks (in) terms of the amount of money hanging out there in liability," Reay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, wrongful death claims and lawsuits have been filed by relatives of 
Bryant, the Pasadena barber, and three other men who died in the recent cases 
linked to hobbling. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, Bryant led police on a multi-city chase that ended in Highland 
Park. He died after being hogtied by LAPD officers and placed on his stomach in 
the back seat of a San Marino patrol car. The cause of death was ruled to be 
cocaine intoxication and asphyxia related to the restraint procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months and two days later, after considerable publicity about the effects 
of hogtying in the Bryant case, records show that 35-year-old Richard Coleman 
died near Hollywood after being hobbled by LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman had been acting bizarrely in the middle of Sunset Boulevard, banging 
his head on the pavement, according to official accounts. Officers struggled 
with and hogtied him, but kept him on his side, a district attorney's 
investigation found. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Coleman later was hoisted onto a gurney and strapped face-down when 
paramedics arrived. He went into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital, 
investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman's death was ruled a homicide because of the combined effects of 
methamphetamine intoxication and the restraint maneuvers used. 
</P>
<P>
 While investigations by the LAPD, the Fire Department and the district 
attorney's office found no wrongdoing on the part of officers or paramedics, 
Coleman's father is not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very uncomfortable with it," said Robert Coleman, 64. "I think they 
just mishandled him after they hogtied him. . . . That's what we feel cost him 
his life." 
</P>
<P>
 His son, a once successful salesman and father of two children, had struggled 
with drug problems off and on, said Coleman, an Army retiree. "I'm not 
disputing that; not trying to make excuses for him. (But) I don't care what his 
problems were. Misuse (of force) by authorities under any conditions is not 
appropriate." The family has filed a multimillion-dollar wrongful death claim 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A remarkably similar scenario unfolded four months later in Bell Gardens, 
where Phillip Vogel was hogtied by police and strapped face-down on an 
ambulance gurney. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel, a house painter and aspiring musician, was found riding his bicycle in 
and out of traffic on Gage Avenue one afternoon last September, according to 
police accounts. After struggling and spitting blood at police, Vogel was 
hogtied and continued struggling, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedics were summoned, checked Vogel and 
approved him for transport to County-USC Medical Center, police reports show. 
Officers and ambulance attendants strapped Vogel face-down on a gurney. 
Officers questioned maintaining the restraints, according to police reports, 
but deferred to the ambulance attendants, who requested that Vogel remain 
hogtied and strapped down. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel went into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and was pronounced 
dead a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials refused to discuss details of the arrest, particularly how 
Vogel was positioned by police, citing pending litigation by Vogel's relatives. 
A district attorney's office investigation is continuing, but Bell Gardens 
officials said no officers violated policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office ruled Vogel's death a homicide, with the immediate cause 
asphyxiation related to the effects of hogtying. Multiple drug intoxication was 
a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they had him in the hogtie too damn long," said Vogel's sister, 
Suanne Garcia. Vogel had been arrested in drug-related incidents before and 
"had drugs in his body that day," she said. "But he did not deserve to die for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a job. He had hopes and dreams," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent case, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies answered a 911 
call in Azusa in January and confronted 25-year-old Daniel Gizowski. A parolee 
just out of prison after serving time for narcotics sales, Gizowski was causing 
a disturbance at a female friend's house and yelling incoherently when deputies 
arrived, the department says. Deputies used pepper spray and a Taser gun with 
no effect, said Deputy Patrick Hauser, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Several deputies, some of whom were bitten and injured, swarmed Gizowski and 
applied a hobble restraint. "He was specifically placed on his side" and was 
only on his stomach "during the time he was being placed in restraint," Hauser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being moved to the back porch, Gizowski began showing signs of shortness 
of breath. Deputies performed CPR while awaiting arrival of paramedics, but he 
was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner ruled the case a homicide, saying Gizowski died of a combination 
of methamphetamine intoxication and asphyxia related to forcible restraint 
procedures, including a neck hold and hobble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department says the deputies followed a revised, presumably 
safer hobbling policy that had been adopted in June, 1993, after the Bryant 
death. It requires looser hobble binding, keeping suspects on their side and 
constant monitoring for breathing difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Diamond, the attorney for the Gizowski family, said he is investigating 
the sheriff's hobbling and restraint procedures. "It's amazing . . . the L.A. 
County coroner is willing to go this far," he said, referring to the autopsy 
findings. He said it raises the prospect that the department "might be 
utilizing a procedure that itself is defective. If it is flawed, the county 
should recognize that right away so it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, the sheriff's training specialist, said the department believes it 
has selected the best option currently available, and is continuing to examine 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only deal with what . . . we have right now," he said. "I do not 
believe that (we) want to take anything away that would put deputies at risk . 
. . and not give them something in its place." 
</P>
<P>
 The string of cases has highlighted the widely varying, sometimes loosely 
coordinated changes in policy that have emerged in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1992, when the LAPD amended its hobble restraint policy, it 
spelled out the risks. "Recent medical evidence suggests that use of the 
cord-cuff leg restrainer (on certain arrestees) can result in serious injury or 
death," the policy noted. Officers were instructed to ensure that hogtied 
suspects remained on their side and were monitored closely. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was unclear in the Bryant case how many LAPD officers at the scene 
actually knew of the department's revised policy. Three months after Bryant's 
death, the LAPD reissued a departmentwide bulletin on the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions apparently were not immediately communicated to Los Angeles 
paramedics, who frequently work with LAPD officers in transporting hogtied 
suspects. It was not until a month after Coleman's death -- and nearly seven 
months after the city Police Department modified its policy -- that the 
paramedics were prohibited from strapping hogtied patients face-down on 
gurneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Dave Thompson, assistant bureau commander of medical services, said 
he could not account for the delay, although he said that the LAPD apparently 
had not advised the Fire Department of its concerns and that the medical risks 
had not been noted in paramedic literature. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until December -- three months after Vogel's death -- that Bell 
Gardens police adopted a new policy that requires hobbled suspects to be kept 
on their side and transported only in a seated position in patrol cars, a 
department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was only in the past few weeks -- nearly a year after the Sheriff's 
Department revised its policy to reduce risks -- that the county Fire 
Department issued guidelines to paramedics to ensure that hobbled patients are 
not allowed to rest on their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we're just moving into," said Battalion Chief Ed Thacher. "I 
don't know if they have that much medical information out there that says 
conclusively this is better than that. I don't think there's been enough study 
yet to show if (someone) comes in on his side, he won't come in dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that the issue simply hasn't been a high priority for police 
and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is they don't understand they're doing this to people, or they don't 
care," said attorney Burton. "It just seems impossible to me there's no way of 
restraining these people without killing them." Hogtying Controversy 
</P>
<P>
 A controversy over hogtying of violent suspects by law enforcement officers is 
heating up amid growing medical evidence that the practice can interfere with 
breathing and contribute to sudden deaths. Here is a look at the Los Angeles 
County coroner's office findings in four recent cases that were ruled 
homicides, partly because of the effects of hogtying restraint procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Michael James Bryant 
</P>
<P>
 Case: In March, 1993, the Pasadena barber died from a combination of cocaine 
intoxication and asphyxia after being hogtied by LAPD officers and placed 
face-down in the rear seat of a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Richard Coleman 
</P>
<P>
 Case: In May, 1993, the salesman died of a combination of methamphetamine 
intoxication and asphyxia after being hogtied by LAPD officers and later 
strapped face-down on a city paramedic gurney. 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Phillip Vogel 
</P>
<P>
 Case: In September, 1993, the house painter and musician died of asphyxiation 
after being hogtied by Bell Gardens police and then strapped face-down on an 
ambulance gurney. Multiple drug intoxication was a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Daniel Gizowski 
</P>
<P>
 Case: In January, the newly released prison parolee died of a combination of 
methamphetamine intoxication and asphyxia related to restraint procedures, 
including hobbling, used by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.

HANDGUN CRIME SOARING IN U.S., REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL McALLISTER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handgun crime soared dramatically in 1992, setting records both in the number 
of violent crimes committed by individuals armed with handguns and in the 
number of nonfatal crimes, the Justice Department reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures, the latest available, support police statements about the growing 
use of handguns in a wide variety of crimes. "It certainly shows that we are 
living in a more dangerous society" and reinforces the Administration's 
argument for keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, said Justice 
Department spokesman Carl Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department report says individuals armed with handguns committed a 
record 930,700 violent crimes in 1992 and also set a record of 917,500 nonfatal 
crimes in which handguns were used, almost 50% higher than the average for the 
previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
 No group was more vulnerable to the trend than young black males, the 
department said. Black males between the ages of 16 and 19 were four times as 
likely to be the victims of handgun crime as white males their age. Black men 
age 20 to 24 were three times as likely as white men to be victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the record level of nonfatal crimes committed by individuals 
with handguns, the department said FBI statistics indicate that handgun 
homicides reached 13,200 in 1992, a 24% increase over the five-year average. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Metaksa, executive director of the National Rifle Assn.'s legislative 
arm, called the survey "somewhat flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 She accused the Justice Department of inflating the gun statistics by lumping 
together crimes in which a handgun may have been involved -- for example, used 
in a pistol-whipping but not discharged -- with those instances in which a gun 
was used "as a firearm." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just take a look at the city of Washington, D.C., as a microcosm," she said, 
citing the city's 400 murders last year. "It isn't the guns (causing the 
crimes). It is the recidivist criminals not being taken care of by our 
criminal-justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of Congress' leading gun-control 
advocates, said the survey "gives the lie to the NRA's arguments." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it shows that the problem with handguns is escalating. . . . You know 
that more has to be done to get them off the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics was based on a 
survey of approximately 100,000 crime victims conducted by the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said the annual survey is regarded as a highly reliable indicator of 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the statistics released Sunday were ominous. While overall crimes 
were up and the use of handguns reached record levels, the report also says an 
individual's chances of being a victim of a rape, robbery or an assault in 1992 
remained below record high rates set in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the department's figures, the rate for those crimes fell to 35 
per 1,000 people from 39 per 1,000 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this month, the FBI said that in 1993, serious reported crimes 
dropped 3% and that violent offenses decreased by 1% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, about 13% of violent crimes -- one in eight rapes, robberies and 
assaults -- were committed by individuals with handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 That trend, reflecting growing use of handguns by criminals, was shown in the 
sharp rise in the rates of nonfatal handgun crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 These rose to 4.5 crimes per 1,000 people age 12 or older, considerably higher 
than the record of four per 1,000 set in 1982, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that individuals armed with handguns fired their weapons in about 17% 
of all nonfatal crimes, wounding the victim about 3% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that 38% of the victims who were armed attacked the 
individuals seeking to harm them. One fifth of those attempting to protect 
themselves with a firearm were injured, compared to almost half who used other 
weapons or had no weapon at all, the department said.

50 YEARS LATER, NORMANDY GETS SET FOR 2ND WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Allied invasion of Normandy, the 
largest amphibious assault in the history of modern warfare, his decision 
ultimately came down to a single factor: the weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, 50 years later, as the people of Normandy prepare for the biggest 
peacetime assault on their narrow roads, picturesque villages and tiny cafes, 
they too are thinking about the weather. Once again, it may mean the difference 
between shining success and soggy disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the sun is here, that will be the most important thing," said Henri-Jean 
Renaud, 59, a pharmacist in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, where gray-haired American 
paratroopers will reprise their jump of half a century ago. Outside, as he 
spoke, the sky was overcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "A French mess under the sun is great," he said. "But with rain, it's just a 
terrible mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Rain or sunshine, though, (and one can usually count on the former) tens of 
thousands of World War II veterans, joined by President Clinton, Queen 
Elizabeth II and other heads of state and government, will converge on the 
bluffs, the villages, the homes and the cemeteries of northern France on June 6 
to remember D-day -- the bloody beginning of the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Normandy is waiting with open arms. American, Canadian and British flags are 
pasted to the windows of butcher shops, bread stores, cheese shops, tea salons 
and cafes. Rows of foreign flags are flying from the cobblestone streets of 
Bayeux, where a new sculpture of Eisenhower is being put up on the edge of 
town. Signs everywhere, in French and English, read, "Welcome to the 
Liberators." 
</P>
<P>
 D-day memorabilia are arriving at curio shops by the truckload. At the small 
food shops, of which France is justly proud, painted scenes of D-day soldiers 
on the beach stare out from the wrappers of Camembert cheese, Normandy's 
favorite sons. The wine merchants are touting a nice little red from Buzet with 
the label, "Debarquement 1944" (Landing 1944). 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are busily repaving roads, repainting the white lines and building 
traffic circles. They are polishing monuments, cleaning the landing beaches, 
clipping the graveside grass, installing extra telephone lines and erecting 
towers for the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels, some of which have been booked solid for the day for the past 10 
years, are adding porters and waiters for the onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone expects the region to be utterly overwhelmed by the traffic and the 
crush of visitors. But no one seems too worried. Many see it as the last 
opportunity to show their gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is the 50th, the last big one," said Renaud, who is helping prepare 
his town's welcome for the American paratroopers who rained from the sky on 
D-day and freed Sainte-Mere-Eglise from German occupation at 4:30 a.m. "These 
veterans are old now. Many of them will never come back. And they are all 
heroes to us."  
</P>
<P>
 The official D-day extravaganza is June 6, and the national leaders, 
journalists and, of course, veterans will be moving from cliffs to beaches to 
towns and back again throughout the day for national and international 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight will be an afternoon gathering here on Omaha Beach, attended by 
30,000 veterans and the leaders of the United States, France, Canada, Britain, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Clinton, who will be staying on a U.S. military ship offshore, will head 
for the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach, where 9,835 marble crosses 
and Stars of David mark the final resting place of some of the soldiers who 
helped take that soil. That night, Clinton will join 60,000 people for the 
closing ceremonies in Caen, the region's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive surge of visitors to Normandy is expected on June 5 and 6, 
but French officials have estimated that more than 2 million Americans will 
come to France this year, many to see the D-day sites. And the commemorations, 
which already have begun, will continue until September as each French village 
stages a celebration to mark its own day of liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities come amid an unprecedented period of soul-searching in France. 
The trial and conviction earlier this year of Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier, 
the first Frenchman so convicted, sparked a renewed debate over the extent of 
French collaboration with the Germans. And many French people are even 
beginning to say that the French Resistance, though undeniably heroic and a 
source of great pride, played a smaller role in the liberation of France than 
was once thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of Normandy, though, there never have been any illusions about the 
identity of the liberators. A few cities farther inland, such as Caen, where 
the Germans hunkered down after the D-day invasion, suffered greatly during the 
Allied shelling. Some people there have mixed feelings about the liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Omaha Beach, the facts are irrefutable: 3,000 American soldiers died in 
the first hours of D-day on that four-mile stretch of brown sand. Nearby, 225 
U.S. Army Rangers braved heavy German fire to climb 100-foot rock cliffs with 
ropes and take the summit. A hundred and thirty-five of them were killed or 
wounded. And by the time Paris was liberated at the end of August, 1944, 37,000 
Allied troops had lost their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, in Paris, you hear people say, 'U.S., go home,' " Renaud said. 
"But you never hear that here. I know many French people were killed, and we 
are proud of them. But the Americans and the English didn't need the French 
Resistance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans' objective was Berlin," Renaud added. "We know it was not just 
for us, that we were just on the way. But even though you call it an 
'invasion,' we still call it 'liberation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the anniversary of D-day has always been a special 
occasion. Renaud's father was the mayor of the city of 1,500 at the time of the 
invasion. For years afterward, Renaud's mother, Simone, in fluent English, 
answered thousands of letters from families of American servicemen and tended 
their graves. When she died in 1988, it was front-page news in the newsletter 
of the U.S. 82nd Airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing this for 50 years," Renaud said of the planned welcome. 
"Each year since D-day, the American flag has been raised here." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Peschet, who runs the Tom and Jerry Army Navy Store in downtown 
Sainte-Mere-Eglise, says business already is booming. He added the Normandy 
branch to his Marseilles store two years ago and hasn't regretted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been crazy around here," Peschet said, smoking a pipe as he watched 
browsers studying everything from U.S. military uniforms to Lucky Strike 
lighters to the tiny metal "clickers" that paratroopers used on D-day to locate 
each other in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some merchants clearly hope to profit from the influx of visitors, 
the sense of welcome seems genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about the younger generation, but the people who lived here are 
really, deeply grateful," Renaud said. "It's not just to make money. The 
veterans of this war can be proud." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there are some who take advantage for tourism," said Jean 
Skrzyniarsz, 54, who runs a cafe near the cemetery where 21,322 Germans are 
buried in a field of black crosses. "But people around here are really 
anti-German." 
</P>
<P>
 Skrzyniarsz plans to host an American family he met during the 45th 
anniversary of D-day. But he worries that he won't be able to get to his house, 
which is on Omaha Beach, during the festivities because of all the security 
surrounding the foreign heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a problem, but I don't mind," he said. "We all like these 
Americans. What can we do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the older French residents of the region, who have welcomed veterans 
for years, are worried that on the 50th anniversary, the real stars of the show 
will be lost amid all the dignitaries. And the French government, meeting 
strong local resistance, was forced to back down a few weeks ago on a plan to 
cancel the hotel reservations of several hundred American and Canadian veterans 
to make room for visiting VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live for the people who were here, not for President Clinton or any other 
visitors," Renaud said, pausing from work in his busy pharmacy downtown. "It 
would be a shame if all these VIPs leave a shadow on the real heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 The American paratroopers, now in their late 60s and older, are the heroes of 
Sainte-Mere-Eglise. On the 13th-Century church that gives the town its name, a 
life-size model of an American paratrooper, complete with parachute, hangs from 
the steeple. It commemorates Pvt. John Steele, one of the 15,000 American 
paratroopers, who became snared on the church steeple on D-day morning and 
pretended to be dead to avoid German fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 5, 37 of those veterans, ages 67 to 82, will jump again. At first, the 
French were reluctant to allow the old men to jump, and town residents admit 
they are worried that someone will be hurt. But the government relented when 
the U.S. military agreed to provide medical and logistics support. 
</P>
<P>
 At the American cemetery, now technically U.S. soil and run by the American 
government, preparations are well under way for the big day. About 1.5 million 
people visit the cemetery every year, and the caretaker expects an additional 
500,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days ago, one French visitor, Monique Gauchet, scrawled a succinct 
message in the visitors book at the exit. "Thank you," she wrote, "for all your 
sacrifices."

TELECOMMUTING BOOMLET HAS FEW FOLLOW-UP CALLS; LABOR: INTEREST WAS HIGH AFTER 
NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. BUT A HOST OF FACTORS HOLD BACK WIDE ADOPTION OF THE 
PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Telecommuting, an idea that excited the imaginations of many traffic-weary 
Southern Californians after January's earthquake, is looking more and more like 
a nifty notion whose time hasn't quite come. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no rush of employees trading Southland freeways for the information 
superhighway, partly because of quick road repairs and resistance from 
traditional managers who like keeping an eye on their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one tracks exactly how many people telecommute, the slow growth -- 
a surprise for many boosters -- is readily apparent. One key indicator: Leasing 
is sluggish at the handful of telecommuting centers that have opened or 
expanded in earthquake-affected areas since the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a newish concept, and all change and new concepts take some 
getting used to," said Connie Worden-Roberts, director of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Telecenter, a telecommuting facility in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest gains in the ranks of Southern California telecommuters are a 
disappointment to government officials, technology executives and other 
proponents. Many were hopeful that telecommuting centers -- also known as 
"telework" or "telebusiness" centers -- would get a big boost after the quake, 
along with home-based telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest was extraordinary for the first week after the earthquake, but 
it's definitely dropped off since then," said Karen Wilson, project manager of 
the Antelope Valley Telebusiness Center in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 With working at home still impractical for many, centers such as Wilson's and 
Worden-Roberts' let people work in offices typically equipped with computers 
and fax machines. Some even have "video-conferencing" gear to help workers 
participate in meetings without leaving their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there are few such facilities; all of the existing centers combined 
contain fewer than 200 spaces for workers in quake-affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the centers are riddled with vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, only about half of the 25 to 30 work spaces are occupied at 
Worden-Roberts' center in Valencia. At a center opened by AT & T at Santa 
Monica College in March, 13 of the 19 spots go unused on a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
 The response also has been underwhelming to a program offered at the Lancaster 
center that encourages home-based telecommuting by loaning laptop computers and 
providing fax and photocopying services. 
</P>
<P>
 While innovative, the program "hasn't taken off like I thought it would," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say the idea of telecommuting lacks appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Beth Parks, a marketing manager for Hilton Hotels Corp. in Beverly Hills, 
says she would be interested in telecommuting a few days a week from her home 
in Valencia. Telecommuting would let her be with her 3 1/2-year-old son 
immediately if an emergency occurred. And Parks would get a welcome break from 
the daily trek to work in Beverly Hills -- a drive that, since the quake, takes 
her 60 to 80 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks still hasn't taken the leap. The cost of setting up a home office 
with a computer and fax machine -- particularly when she and her husband are 
trying to scrape up money for earthquake repairs -- is a big obstacle. And as 
"a beginner at best" with computer equipment, Parks worries that it would take 
a long time to learn to work efficiently from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would set me back a while," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hilton, six or so of Parks' co-workers tried telecommuting after the 
earthquake. Today, a company spokeswoman said, "almost none" still do it with 
any regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Employees found that "by not being physically at your 
workplace, you miss out on the corporate culture, the creative brainstorming 
and interaction that leads to new policies and ideas," the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Bank, whose corporate campus in the Chatsworth-Northridge area 
was pounded by the Jan. 17 quake, is leasing space at a telecommuting center 
next door to Worden-Roberts' in Valencia. But some bank employees who live near 
the facility rarely, if ever, use it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Sharon Lemieux, a systems and data processing supervisor from 
Newhall, found it comforting to have a satellite office near home after the 
quake; she used it three or four times. Now, however, Lemieux says she would 
much rather be at her regular Northridge office -- in case her bosses call an 
impromptu meeting, or if problems crop up with, say, the installation of a 
computer at a bank branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to solve (problems) on the spot," Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
 For self-starters who don't need much face-to-face contact with customers or 
co-workers -- such as computer specialists, claims processors, writers, 
researchers and designers -- telecommuting is an easier adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services, many social 
workers telecommuted one day a week or more even before the earthquake. Others 
were forced into the practice when county offices, particularly a building in 
Panorama City, were damaged by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, once new office space is available, most of the new, post-quake 
telecommuters probably will return to their previous habits, said Brian Berger, 
director of special services for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real need for socialization and reinforcement among the (social 
workers) and their supervisors," Berger said. "They make difficult decisions 
and difficult recommendations, and it's important to talk these things out 
among peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if telecommuting has made only modest gains after the earthquake, many 
experts remain convinced it is the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 They just aren't sure when the future will arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultant Gil Gordon says the era of telecommuting is drawing closer because 
a new generation of corporate managers is emerging. These people, he said, are 
more comfortable with flexible work situations and more willing to restructure 
to accommodate such changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say companies that never even talked about telecommuting before are 
now at least thinking about it. And, Gordon noted, the technology that helps 
people telecommute keeps getting better.

NEWS ANALYSIS; GOP ACTIVISTS DISILLUSIONED WITH RIORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans celebrated when Mayor Richard Riordan arrived in Los Angeles City 
Hall last summer, the first member of the GOP to fill the mayor's suite in a 
generation. Close to a year into his first term, however, the same activists 
are beginning to grumble about Riordan's party loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mayor spoke at a recent luncheon held by a Republican women's group, 
a smattering of disgruntled party members wore "RINO" protest buttons -- which 
jeered Riordan for being "Republican in Name Only." 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you are a Republican or a Democrat, but you can't be in between," said 
the creator of the buttons, Celeste Grieg, who is vice president of the 
conservative California Republican Assembly. "I supported Riordan. I campaigned 
for him. I walked precincts for him. Now I don't know what party he's in." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, Republicans note that the mayor's top aides are almost 
exclusively Democrats. The latest addition to the staff is Doug Boxer, 
Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer's son, who will handle intergovernmental affairs. 
There is only one Republican among Riordan's six deputy mayors and Riordan's 
closest confidant, William Wardlaw, is a Democrat who is actively involved in 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the mayor's liaison to the Republican Party, Cindy Kinney, 
submitted her resignation in March to become a consultant to Republican Matt 
Fong's campaign for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney, a former aide to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, said she left to pursue 
the challenges of a statewide campaign. But others close to her say she was 
frustrated with her solitary role. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Republicans worked very hard to get Riordan elected and they are 
very frustrated," said Keith McCarthy, chairman of the Los Angeles County 
Republican Party. "Our solitary comfort is that he's a whole lot better than 
Mike Woo," whom Riordan beat in the mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern among Republicans is particularly acute as several important 
statewide races heat up. Republicans are wondering where Riordan's allegiances 
will fall in the races for governor and Senate. Some of the Republicans 
appointed by Riordan to city commissions have been criticizing the mayor 
privately for not already endorsing Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts say Riordan has the popularity and fund-raising clout to 
lend considerable support to a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor says he may endorse some candidates, but that it is too early to 
disclose his choices. Some insiders speculate that he will sit out the 
primaries and then go right down the middle by endorsing both incumbents in the 
general elections -- Wilson and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's first endorsement as mayor went to Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a 
liberal Democrat who is running for Ed Edelman's seat on the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Riordan said that he never made party affiliation his 
selling point and that he considers himself a pragmatist and problem-solver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an ideologue," was a frequent refrain during Riordan's campaign, his 
first for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Riordan's campaign staff was headed by Democrats and his political 
contributions over the years have gone to Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, he and his law firm gave $110,000 to state and national 
Republican Party committees and $25,000 to state and national Democratic Party 
committees. As for candidates, he loaned Democrat Tom Bradley $300,000 in his 
1982 campaign for governor and donated $5,000 to Republican George Bush's 
presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 As for staffing, Riordan said he attempts to surround himself with competent 
professionals regardless of their party allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never asked anyone (on the staff) what their party affiliation is," 
Riordan said. "I have some idea but I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Riordan said he was uncertain whether Deputy Mayor Mike Keeley, 
a longtime colleague at his law firm, is a Democrat or Republican. To find out, 
Riordan had an aide call Keeley's office and check. Riordan shrugged when he 
learned the news: Keeley is a Democrat who contributed money to Riordan and his 
opponent, Woo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School, 
argued that Riordan is treating the nonpartisan mayor's office exactly as he 
should, without regard to political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans began boasting early and often after the campaign that they 
controlled the country's second-largest city," Jeffe said. "They were wrong. If 
Dick Riordan is anything, he is a pragmatist." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when it comes to Riordan's performance in office, Republicans say 
they have no major squabbles. They generally support his budget plan, which 
calls for a dramatic buildup in the Police Department, a consolidation of city 
departments and a cut in business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Riordan was organizing his run for mayor, he realized he needed the 
support of Republicans and Democrats. Surrounded by Democratic campaign 
workers, he consolidated Republican support during the April primary and then 
used the general election in June to win over the city's Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had the Republicans," said one Riordan campaign strategist. "They 
had nowhere else to go. We didn't ignore the Republicans, but we knew we had to 
win over Democrats to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, mayoral aides acknowledge that Republicans were an essential part of 
Riordan's campaign base that he does not intend to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, Riordan is considered one of the Republican National Committee's 
"big seven," the top seven Republican officials elected across the nation. He 
will attend a Washington fund-raiser in June for the Republican National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A public relations executive, Steve Sugarman, was chosen to replace Kinney as 
an assistant deputy mayor. A former Republican, Sugarman recently joined the 
Democratic Party. And mayoral aides say Republicans have a greater presence in 
the Administration, through volunteer city commission posts, than they did in 
the Tom Bradley years. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Republicans still complain that commissioners' ability to shape 
policy is limited compared to the top Riordan advisers who have easy access to 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are frustrated, Republican activists say they continue to 
support the city's 39th mayor -- the first Republican elected since Norris 
Poulson, who served from 1953 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does concern me that Democrats have such influence over him," said Tirso 
del Junco, chairman of the California Republican Party. "But I have great hopes 
that he won't forget his base."

CHRISTOPHER PLANS VISIT TO JERICHO; MIDEAST: HIS TRIP TO THE AUTONOMOUS WEST 
BANK TOWN AIMS TO TRUMPET THE PEACE PROCESS. IT WILL HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF A 
FORM OF RECOGNITION OF A FUTURE PALESTINIAN STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a move that will bolster Palestinian 
hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, said Sunday that he will 
travel to Jericho this week to meet with the newly established Palestinian 
self-governing authority there. 
</P>
<P>
 By making the unusual visit, only days after veterans of the Palestine 
Liberation Army took over policing of the West Bank's Jericho from the Israeli 
forces that had occupied the area since 1967, Christopher said he hopes to 
boost the Palestinians' confidence and trumpet the first concrete results of 
their long-running peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He also intends to urge them to organize their administration quickly, without 
waiting for Yasser Arafat and other Palestine Liberation Organization 
chieftains to arrive, aides said. Indeed, the visit appears aimed partly at 
boosting the prestige of moderate West Bank members of the Palestinian 
Authority, such as Faisal Husseini, whom Christopher praised for joining the 
new governing group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll be very significant for the Palestinian leadership," 
Christopher told reporters traveling with him to Damascus, where he was meeting 
with Syrian President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the Clinton Administration still holds to a longstanding U.S. 
policy of opposing an independent Palestinian state. But the symbolism of 
Christopher's visit -- an official call with Palestinian flags flying and 
security provided by PLO police -- will inescapably look like a form of early 
recognition for a future republic of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials said their one-day visit to Jericho will probably 
take place Tuesday. Asked why Christopher will rely on the Palestinians for 
security, a senior official replied that there is little choice: "The Israelis 
are already out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Christopher wants "to dramatize the kind of changes that are happening 
on the ground -- the promise of the agreement being translated into reality." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in Palestinian history, you're seeing the Palestinians 
assuming responsibility for self-government," he said. "We think that's a very 
important development." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, Christopher hopes to rally both Palestinian and 
Israeli support for further implementing the self-government agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palestinians need to see that the realities have in fact changed on the 
ground," he said. "Israelis need to see the Palestinians live up to the 
commitments that they made, that they do all that they can to stop violence, 
that the Palestinians can in fact deliver, and that Israeli security doesn't 
suffer for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also wants to encourage the Palestinian Authority to take the 
reins of government quickly and build a bureaucracy that can handle the more 
than $2 billion in foreign aid that has been promised for the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be asking, 'How well structured are you to deal with donors and donor 
concerns?' " he said. "What matters is implementation." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Palestinians and the World Bank are "fairly close" to an agreement 
that would release $120 million in reconstruction funds and $35 million to 
support the start-up costs of the new authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and other aid donors have been visibly impatient 
with Arafat's balky, personalized leadership of the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is formally chairman of the governing group, but he has said that he 
will not arrive in Jericho until mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 In the PLO leader's absence, Christopher appeared pleased at a chance to 
bolster the authority of Husseini and other leaders from the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip who have been doing business with the United States longer than Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had waited a long time," the official said, it could have pushed 
implementation "down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan being implemented is the May 4 agreement signed in Cairo for Israel's 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. That was intended as an initial 
step, after which Israel and the Palestinians will agree on terms for the 
transfer of other parts of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall withdrawal is occurring under last September's peace agreement 
between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 On previous visits, Christopher met with Palestinian leaders in the eastern, 
predominantly Arab half of Jerusalem -- the city both Palestinians and Israelis 
claim as their capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher consulted with the Israeli government before deciding to visit 
Jericho, an aide said, and the Israelis did not object. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher may also meet with Arafat in Cairo later in the week, the aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher held a round of talks Sunday evening with Syria's Assad on his 
tentative peace negotiations with Israel but reported no immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of a process with slow going ahead," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Syria showed an unexpected sign of possible flexibility in an editorial in 
the government-run newspaper Tishrin (October), diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the customary truculent tone of Syrian diplomacy, the newspaper said, 
"Syria is not ready to deal with any proposals that do not include a clear 
commitment for withdrawal from all of the Golan within a reasonable and 
acceptable time." 
</P>
<P>
 Syria has long demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
captured in 1967, as the price of peace. But never before, one diplomat said, 
has Damascus said publicly that it is willing to settle for withdrawal in "a 
reasonable and acceptable time." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has offered to withdraw from the Golan over a period of five to eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian statement appeared to signal that while that is too long, Damascus 
is ready and willing to haggle.

HOUSING PROJECT A COSTLY LESSON FOR TAXPAYERS; POLICY: L.A.'S CASA GLORIA WAS 
BUILT FOR $233,000 A UNIT. QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS, INEFFICIENCIES OF FINANCING 
FAULTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Hector Huezo and his family, Los Angeles' new Casa Gloria apartment house 
has been a godsend. Where else could they find a sparkling three-bedroom, 
two-bath apartment for $353 a month? 
</P>
<P>
 But for taxpayers, Casa Gloria has been a lesson in the high cost of low-cost 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of its 46 apartments came with a $233,000 price tag, making the 
earth-toned building on a gritty stretch of Temple Street near Echo Park the 
most expensive affordable-housing project in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 For that kind of money, taxpayers could have bought the Huezos a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Gloria became the costliest project because of a series of questionable 
decisions by city officials, such as requiring underground parking for tenants 
too poor to own cars and demanding a redesign to reduce a shadow on some 
dilapidated apartments next door. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of its cost was the result of inefficiencies built into the method of 
financing most low-income housing projects, which average about $165,000 per 
family unit in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's primary method of creating affordable housing is by 
issuing U.S. income tax credits to developers, who then sell them to investors 
to raise money -- a method so wasteful that only half the federal money 
earmarked for a project actually goes into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers, mostly nonprofit groups, make up the difference by cobbling 
together loans from a dizzying array of banks and government agencies in a 
duplicative, time-consuming process that also adds to costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person came down from Mars or even from Europe and looked at how we 
provide low-income housing, they wouldn't believe their eyes," said Peter 
Dreier, professor of public policy at Occidental College and former director of 
housing for the city of Boston. "It's extremely inefficient . . . the most 
ineffective and unfair way you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier and other critics of the tax credit system argue that it is unfair 
because it helps so few people when the need is so great. Each year tax credits 
help produce about 100,000 apartments at an annual cost to the Treasury of $2 
billion to $3 billion. About 2,400 of these apartments will be built or 
rehabilitated in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the government estimates that 10 million of the 13.5 million 
low-income families who qualify for housing aid don't get any. 
</P>
<P>
 When Casa Gloria was planned four years ago, there was no question but to use 
tax credits. "They may not be the best, but they are the only game in town," 
said Carmelo Lacaya, a former Roman Catholic nun who heads the nonprofit 
organization behind the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacaya developed Casa Gloria at the urging of Gloria Molina, then the 
councilwoman for the area and now a county supervisor. She named the project 
for Molina, who had become a leading advocate for affordable housing on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood where it was to be built was a graffiti-scarred jumble of 
apartments, single-family homes and vacant lots just west of Downtown on the 
border of Temple Beaudry and Echo Park. The area was seen as the likely site of 
a boom in office and apartment construction, but then the recession hit and the 
jackhammers being used to build Casa Gloria were the only ones making any 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacaya's organization, an offshoot of the National Assn. for the Hispanic 
Elderly, won a government competition for tax credits, allowing it to take one 
dollar off its tax bill for each dollar it invested in low-income housing. 
Since the nonprofit group had no tax bill, it followed standard practice by 
selling the credits to investors on an open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacaya's group, El Pueblo Community Development Corp., sold the credits to 
Chevron U.S.A., receiving 58 cents for each dollar of credits. Market prices 
for credits have varied from about 40 cents to, currently, 60 cents on the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 After El Pueblo paid a finder's fee of nearly $300,000 to the person who lined 
up Chevron, and paid assorted other related expenses, more of the credit 
evaporated, leaving only 46 cents on the dollar. In the end, Lacaya's 
organization was left with $4.4 million of the $9.7 million in taxes that the 
Treasury gave up so Casa Gloria could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement this sum, El Pueblo arranged to borrow money from a bank and 
various government agencies: the city Community Redevelopment Agency, the 
Century Freeway Housing Program and the state Rental Housing Construction 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Each required its own loan application, its own title insurance and its own 
audit, said Perla Eston, a former high-ranking city housing official who was 
hired by El Pueblo to help it negotiate the maze. 
</P>
<P>
 Such duplication is "stupid," Eston said. "It wastes a lot of money and a lot 
of time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One study estimated that the costs of arranging financing through so many 
agencies adds about $7,000 to the price of an average low-income housing unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts are under way to eliminate some duplication. Leslie Lambert, the 
Community Redevelopment Agency's housing policy director, said the Legislature 
has begun debating whether to combine state and local sources of funds into a 
one-stop loan center for developers in tax credit deals. But she said 
bureaucrats oppose the move -- preferring the current system in which many 
government agencies can claim credit for funding the same housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the bureaucratic spirit in which Casa Gloria was built. 
</P>
<P>
 "By committee," said a frustrated Lacaya, who frets that, within the housing 
community, she is being tarred unfairly as a spendthrift because of the 
project's record costs. 
</P>
<P>
 She blames city officials for the cost overruns because, as records show, they 
insisted on adding extras to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacaya said she saw Casa Gloria as a simple, four-story, wood-frame structure 
consisting only of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Molina insisted that it include space for stores, because there are few in 
the neighborhood, according to Lacaya and members of Molina's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning officials weighed in with demands that enough parking be 
provided to accommodate two cars for most apartments, even though most of the 
tenants would likely be too poor to have two cars. 
</P>
<P>
 And CRA officials insisted that the building be scaled down in the rear 
because it would cast too big a shadow on a row of run-down one-story 
apartments behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate all these demands, Casa Gloria had to be repeatedly redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect lowered its height in back from four stories to three to lessen 
the shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised its height in front from four stories to five so that the same 
number of apartments could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the front to five stories required that steel, rather than wood, be 
used for the frame to comply with the building code. Reducing the back to three 
stories meant that parking planned for ground level had to be shifted 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacaya said city officials seemed blind to the rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city does not have a streamlined approach to the development of 
affordable housing," she fumed. "Its entire system is just encumbered with 
bureaucracy and inability to see that all these things that you throw onto a 
project cost money." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lacaya, there was only one way around the higher costs: build fewer 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was contractually bound to each of her many lenders to build 46 units. 
</P>
<P>
 So she went ahead with changes that added as much as $70,000 to the cost of 
each, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly six months after Casa Gloria opened, some results of these expenditures 
can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants seem happy with their new digs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thankful for this situation," said Huezo, a Salvadoran immigrant who won 
the chance to rent his apartment in a lottery that was held after more than 500 
people applied in a week. Huezo, who earns about $1,000 a month as a clerk in a 
health food store, had been paying more to house his family of four in a 
South-Central studio apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron officials seem happy. 
</P>
<P>
 They would not say how much money they will make from their purchase of Casa 
Gloria tax credits. But attorneys who structure tax credit deals say investors 
commonly earn annual returns of anywhere from 15% to 25%. This year, as part of 
Casa Gloria's continuing financing, Chevron will pump about $700,000 into the 
project in return for about $1 million in tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the wisdom of the city decisions, the commercial space remains 
unrented. It turned out there was no market for it. The parking garage is 
nearly empty. The tenants do not have enough cars to fill it up. And the 
three-story rear casts a slightly smaller shadow over the building next door 
than the four-story rear would have. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina declined to be interviewed about Casa Gloria. Her planning director, 
Carrie Sutkin, said neither Molina nor her staff realized that adding 
commercial space to the project would contribute to such high costs. "We were 
all surprised," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 How to best address low-income housing needs continues to be the subject of 
debate among policy-makers. Should the federal government continue to use the 
tax code to stimulate low-income housing construction? Or would it be more 
efficient to directly subsidize developers or the poor? 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress last considered the issue in 1992, Casa Gloria was brought up by 
a handful of tax credit opponents as an example of runaway costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office, in a separate study, concluded that the tax 
credit helps less than half as many poor people as direct subsidies would. The 
poor could use vouchers -- like those given out to families displaced by 
January's earthquake -- to help pay market rents. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 400 members of Congress sponsored a bill to make the tax credit 
permanent. It began as a temporary measure in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing policy analysts say one reason it is popular is that it does not 
require politicians to appropriate funds. 
</P>
<P>
 To hope for Congress to include $2 billion to $3 billion in the federal budget 
for low-income housing would be a pipe dream, said Anita Landecker, regional 
vice president of Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit organization 
that raises money from major corporations to invest in tax credit deals. 
"Politically, you're not going to get it in these times." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she said, tax credits have some advantages over direct subsidies. 
They involve major corporations in partnerships with many nonprofit developers, 
thereby interesting influential business executives in the welfare of the poor. 
And nonprofit organizations that rely on tax credits tend to produce 
high-quality homes that provide not only shelter but also "symbols" of hope for 
the revitalization of poor neighborhoods.

A BUDDING INDUSTRY MAY TAKE ROOT IN CANADA: HEMP; AGRICULTURE: OFFICIALS 
CONSIDER LEGALIZING MARIJUANA CROP FOR PROCESSING INTO PAPER, ROPE, BUILDING 
MATERIALS. 
</P>

 Joe Strobel dreams marijuana dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, it's not what you think. 
</P>
<P>
 In Strobel's dream, the tobacco fields sloping up from the north shore of Lake 
Erie -- his fields and those of his neighbors -- are patched with dense stands 
of Cannabis sativa ruffling in the wind. And it's all legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian government is poised to make Strobel's dream come true, perhaps 
as early as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For Strobel's marijuana -- or hemp, as he prefers to call it -- would be so 
low in THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in pot, that no one 
could get high smoking it. Instead, Strobel and the 11 other Ontario farmers in 
his consortium plan to sell their hemp fiber for processing into paper, rope, 
building materials and maybe even shirts and caps. 
</P>
<P>
 These would-be hemp growers, and others like them from the Great Lakes to the 
Canadian Rockies, are beneficiaries of a surging international movement on 
behalf of low-THC hemp, powered by an unlikely coalition of environmentalists, 
entrepreneurs, farmers and, yes, advocates of legalized pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian officials are listening. The ruling Liberal Party is sponsoring 
legislation that would license hemp growing throughout Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farmers in Canada are very interested in it. It's an excellent commercial and 
industrial type of crop. It's high in fiber, it's an excellent alternative to 
(growing) tobacco. . . . It has a great deal of potential," Health Minister 
Diane Marleau said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the bill, which would closely regulate hemp growers, could get final 
approval in the House of Commons this year and then would go to the Canadian 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada would follow a number of European and Asian countries, most recently 
Britain, in legalizing cultivation of low-THC hemp. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the plant, often sporting "Hemp Can Save the Planet" buttons, get 
rapturous about its attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is it the environmentally correct alternative to lumber and wood 
pulp, they say, but you can cook with hemp oil, fabricate it into particle 
board, combine it with old plastic milk containers and mold it into 
two-by-fours, burn it as fuel, feed the seeds to your pet and even make it 
into, ahem, cigarette paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will grow anywhere, all the way from Canada down to most of the U.S., if 
not all of the U.S. This is the finest thing we could be growing to replace 
forest," enthused George Tyson, general manager of Xymax 2001, a Montrose, 
Kan., company that has contracted with Strobel's farmers to convert hemp fiber 
into building material. "It's the environmental answer, and it's the 
agriculture answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Those on the business end of the budding hemp industry are more circumspect. 
While acknowledging the attractions of low-THC hemp, they say the economics of 
growing and processing it on a large scale in North America today remain 
unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading hemp processor in Britain still sells it mainly to stables as 
horse bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no shortage of interest among Canada's recession-pummeled 
farmers. Fiona Briody, director of an Alberta crop development association that 
has a hemp license request pending, has been astonished by the number of 
growers in Western Canada seemingly ready to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the backers of legalizing hemp here are the Sierra Club of Eastern 
Canada, other environmental organizations, a handful of enthusiastic 
grass-roots organizations and a few adventuresome business people. 
</P>
<P>
 But Strobel, a lively, 65-year-old retired physical education teacher, has 
become the hemp movement's top salesman. He brings to the crusade the kind of 
bouncy enthusiasm that once led him to develop a fitness program called the 
Health Hustle, which has been adopted by schools throughout Canada and in parts 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, we farmers have an economic problem, and this might be an out, 
so people are pretty receptive," he said, sitting in the dining room of the 
spacious Tillsonburg, Ontario, home that serves as Hemp Headquarters, Canada. 
"We know it can be grown here because it's been grown here before, (and) . . . 
the potential is about unlimited. Somewhere it will pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Strobel retired from teaching seven years ago and began devoting all his time 
to the family tobacco farm, about 85 miles southwest of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco remains profitable, he said, but needs to be grown in rotation with 
other crops. Strobel and his wife, Judith, tried a variety of alternatives, but 
"nothing really paid off. It pays the taxes and nothing else, so we were 
looking for something." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, that something turned out to be hemp. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Strobel's quest has taken him around Canada and into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 He has rummaged through abandoned warehouses in Kentucky where hemp was grown 
legally in the 1940s as a wartime measure, compiled back issues of High Times 
magazine, collected hemp paper with marijuana leaf watermarks and picked 
through records and photos of early 20th-Century Canadian hemp cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he speaks with confidence about potential crop yields, prices per acre and 
transit costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bill before Parliament will not pass in time for planting season 
this year, Strobel's consortium, using existing law, has asked for an 
experimental license to grow 18 acres of hemp in scattered locations near 
Tillsonburg. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to harvest 80 tons and have reached agreement with processors in 
Canada and the United States for production of a variety of products. Other, 
similar proposals are pending from elsewhere in Canada, including Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
 They await final approval by the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs of Health Canada, 
which grants a handful of licenses annually, mainly for academic and law 
enforcement research. 
</P>
<P>
 While Strobel acknowledged the debt he owes to the pro-pot crowd, who turned 
him on to the potential of hemp in the first place, he stressed that the kind 
of cannabis that he wants to grow should not be confused with what he calls 
"the happy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is of the same species, cannabis grown for hemp has been specially 
developed in Europe through selective breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The main difference is the low-THC factor of commercial stocks. The pending 
law in Canada would call for testing seeds and plants to ensure a THC content 
no higher than 0.3%. THC concentrations in marijuana generally range from about 
3% to more than 5%, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Stuart Carpenter, director of Hemcore Ltd. in Essex, England, 
Britain's major processor, said hemp farmers there have occasional problems 
with night raiders snipping cuttings from low-THC plants and presumably 
peddling them as marijuana seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to legalize the drug say they back the hemp movement out of 
environmental concerns and the assumption that acceptance of legalized, low-THC 
hemp eventually will erode the ban on the high-THC variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The law that would authorize growth of low-THC hemp would also toughen 
penalties for marijuana use. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation of the pro-pot crowd has caused some political obstacles and 
awkward moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Masse, 44, who farms 1,800 acres of peas, wheat, barley and oats in 
central Alberta, and is applying for a license to grow an experimental hemp 
plot, said, "What we really need is a name change, because as soon as you say 
hemp, people think of marijuana and half the population gets up in arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemp originated in Asia and is known to have grown in China as early as 2800 
BC. For most of history it mainly has been used as a source for rope, twine and 
canvas; a 1943 U.S. government film, now gleefully exhibited by marijuana 
advocates, notes that the rope, sails and rigging of "our beloved Old 
Ironsides" were made from hemp. 
</P>
<P>
 The crop was legally grown in the United States and Canada until the 1930s, 
when it was banned in both countries as an illicit drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemp was briefly grown under license in the United States during World War II 
when the Japanese overran most hemp-growing countries, interrupting the U.S. 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian environmentalists were first attracted to hemp as an alternative to 
lumbering, a considerable lure in a country that still permits clear cutting of 
old-growth forest. But the Establishment patina of agriculture and business 
have lent invaluable credibility to a movement that still carries a lingering 
whiff of counterculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Duprey, president of a 23-year-old Montreal-based fashion accessory 
distribution firm, is importing hemp fabric and making caps, shirts and other 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, the British hemp processor, began contracting with English growers 
mainly for horse bedding, but his company is moving into hemp paper and 
textiles. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that "it's an extremely difficult crop to process. We've had to 
develop our own specialty machinery." 
</P>
<P>
 Briody, the Alberta farm official, said that after studying the crop in the 
Netherlands, Romania and Russia, "the yields definitely aren't what some people 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 But Briody said farmers in the association are undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gar Knutson, a Liberal member of Parliament from Ontario who supports 
legalization and licensing of low-THC hemp, put it: "Agriculture has been so 
bad anyway, what do we have to lose by trying out hemp for a while?"

<P>
 Lin Jianhua's short, spectacular career as a stock market player ended 
tragically, when he jumped to his death from the 11th floor of the Second Light 
Industrial Corp. building last November in his native Hangzhou. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few months, the 37-year-old electrician at the giant Zhejiang Jute Mill, 
husband of another millworker and the father of a 9-year-old son, had traded as 
much as $100,000 a day on the Shanghai Stock Exchange through a local brokerage 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Other workers at the mill, a rusting relic of the dying state-owned industrial 
system, gave Lin their savings, which he used as collateral to borrow money to 
play the market. He was their designated capitalist, sent like a working-class 
knight into the mysterious world of investment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the brief, sweet ride was over and Lin's crushed body was found in the 
tiled courtyard at the base of the office building, only $200 remained in the 
account that once contained tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost all my money in stocks, as well as all the money of my friends," 
Lin wrote in his suicide note. "I've no way out but this." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutifully, Lin paid his respects to his parents, urged his son to study hard 
in school and encouraged his wife to remarry "a good husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin was not the first to take his life since the country's two major stock 
markets opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen in 1990. He was not even the first to 
jump from that building; a handful of others had already done so. 
</P>
<P>
 But his suicide, brought to light because of a precedent-setting lawsuit filed 
by Lin's widow against the brokerage house that gave him the easy credit, 
focused attention on a nation coming to grips with the risky side of its 
emerging market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are vast sums to be made investing in China. Everyone knows the story of 
Yang Huaiding -- "Millions Yang" -- the former Red Guard who made a fortune in 
the Shanghai stock market and is a real estate mogul in Shanghai, China's 
business hub. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also vast sums to be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be old hat in the capitalist West, comfortable with its legends 
of fortunes made and squandered, devastating financial loss is something new to 
the socialist welfare state founded by Chairman Mao Tse-tung. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid economic growth has produced stark inequities between state and private 
businesses, between farmers and city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The high rollers in Shanghai and other major cities are a conspicuous 
presence, talking on their cellular phones, in karaoke bars and five-star hotel 
lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the per capita income for most farmers is less than $100 a year. Lin and 
his wife, an inspector in the textile department, had monthly salaries of less 
than $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with an economic system in which the rules changed overnight, 
millions of Chinese feel abandoned by the "to get rich is glorious" era ushered 
in by leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1980s. Desperate to catch up but totally 
unprepared for the risks involved, many have plunged head-first into the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market is still new in China," said Shao Daosheng, a psychologist 
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. "That in itself is not 
bad. But few people have any knowledge of how the stock market works. It is not 
a mature market. Knowledge of the stock market in the West is no help here. 
Naturally, people get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 An extremely active market existed in Shanghai before the Communist victory 
over the Nationalists in 1949. But only a handful of people are old enough to 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 After only four years, trading on the new Shanghai market on some days 
surpasses the volume of the long-established Hong Kong market. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 4 million Chinese bought and sold stock. The average daily volume 
exceeds 500,000 transactions. Trading now averages more than $1 billion a day. 
For the first time in modern Chinese history, companies are concerned about 
profit and stockholder contentment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the large volumes traded, the markets remain largely unregulated. In 
1993, the weak securities regulatory commission lodged a complaint of insider 
trading for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In China, stock trading is a new sport that more resembles Las Vegas than Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock trading outlets that look like racetrack betting windows are scattered 
across China, from Tibet to Inner Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hangzhou, stock market mogul Li Xun, a former executive with the Bank of 
China, operates four trading centers, including one in a lakeside park named 
"Orioles Singing in the Willows." 
</P>
<P>
 Public park officials gladly rented Li, general manager of the nationwide 
Zhejiang Securities Co., space in a park pavilion. There he installed an 
elaborate computer system and an outdoor, all-weather electronic tote board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 6,000 people who come here each day," Li said proudly. He ignored the 
complaint of one customer in the trading center who griped loudly that the 
outdoor board showing stock price quotations was too low, making it difficult 
to see over other people's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20, a day in which the wildly fluctuating Shanghai market hit a 
record low, Li opened the country's largest stock trading center in a converted 
movie theater in Beijing. Li and others in the brokerage business are betting 
that the Chinese are permanently hooked on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that the market is down," he said as attendants released several 
hundred celebratory pigeons into the air, and 15 silk-draped women hefted a 
giant red ribbon. "It means that people who buy stock now will make lots of 
money when the prices go back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Zeng Xingchu, professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai and 
editor of Popular Psychology magazine, reports on the phenomenon of stock 
market absenteeism caused by those who desert their jobs for a while to stand 
mesmerized before trading center computer screens glowing with listings. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeng estimates that about half of the university's 4,000-member staff is 
infected with the stock market bug. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my graduate students go to the stock market before they come to my 
class," Zeng said. 
</P>
<P>
 China's passion for the stock market has inspired several recent plays and 
movies dealing with families and communities torn apart by market dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the dramas, a popular play titled "Gu Piao OK" ("OK Stock"), had 
its debut in Shanghai in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock market speculation is also the subject of a new television series and 
two recent movies, including the comedy "Gu Feng" ("Stock Craze"). 
</P>
<P>
 Although it ends on a happy note, the plot of "Gu Feng" in many ways resembles 
the real-life saga of Lin Jianhua, the millworker. In the film, a hard-working 
man, jealous of his wife's success in the market, takes money from a friend and 
loses it in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlorn, fearful of bringing shame to his family, he threatens suicide from 
the roof of the new Holiday Inn Crown Plaza in Shanghai. The film's director 
was trying to deal with the country's changing values in which get-rich-quick 
speculators are often held in higher esteem than the heroic worker of old. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a decade ago, for example, Lin and his colleagues at the mill were the 
working-class heroes of egalitarian China. 
</P>
<P>
 They never made much money -- not more than $25 a month in most cases. But 
their needs were met by a protective centralized state economy that guaranteed 
housing, food and schooling for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But in today's changing China, the once-favored factory jobs are no longer 
considered plums. 
</P>
<P>
 Xu Jianyao, the manager at the textile division of the Zhejiang Jute Mill, 
which sits on the banks of China's grand canal, said it now has to send 
recruiting teams into rural areas to find workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to like to work here because of the welfare society," Xu said, 
who represents the second generation in his family at the mill, "but today 
young city people no longer want the jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden lowering in their status, not to mention their relative incomes, 
produces a kind of desperation among those holding traditional jobs. Many 
workers at the mill had faith that Lin, whom Xu described as "well-liked and 
responsible," would guide them with his investments back into an economy they 
felt had abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit against the Zhejiang International Trust & Investment Corp., 
the brokerage house where Lin traded, widow Xu Lanfang alleged that the company 
broke Chinese law by allowing him to buy the stock on margin, putting up only a 
small percentage of the stock value. 
</P>
<P>
 The case went before the Hangzhou District Court in March and was settled with 
a 50,000-yuan ($6,000) "humanitarian" payment to the widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, however, the court did not rule on charges of illegal dealings 
by the brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
 So the several dozen millworkers who trusted Lin with their savings will not 
get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson to be learned from this episode, mill manager Xu said in an 
interview, is that stock buying is a risky prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must be psychologically prepared to lose," Xu said, gazing toward the 
floor as he talked. "Lin was not prepared. He failed to bear the burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he discovered that he had lost all his money and the money of his 
co-workers, Lin went to see the only man in Hangzhou he believed could save 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Li Xun, founder of the lakeside trading center and the Beijing theater center, 
has his headquarters on the 11th floor of the Second Light Industrial Corp. 
building in Hangzhou's downtown business district. Li's prominence in the 
Hangzhou securities business drew law firms to the same building, as well as 
the other dejected stock traders who took the fatal plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Li said that he is often approached by distraught investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had many cases in which people wanted to kill themselves. I've even had 
whole families that threatened to kill themselves, but I managed to talk them 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But each of the three or more times the distraught Lin came to see him, Li was 
not in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Lin just gave up and hurled himself from the window only a few paces 
from Li's door. 
</P>
<P>
 His suicide note ended with a stark admonition to his wife that several 
newspapers have since reprinted as one of the object lessons popular in the 
press here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't do any stock business!" Lin warned his wife. "Remember! Remember!"

CAPITOL JOURNAL: CLAIM OF 'BEST TREASURER' IS TOPS IN CHEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hyperbole, of course, isn't confined to politics. You find it in car ads and 
comic strips; on sitcoms and shopping channels; among soap salesmen and 
carnival barkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody blinks an eye -- or believes it -- when a car dealer claims to give the 
best deal in town. 
</P>
<P>
 If a politician claims to be the best at serving the public interest, people 
usually just yawn, if they pay any attention at all. Like car dealers, 
politicians have a license to engage in hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kathleen Brown may have overused her license when she claimed to be 
"America's Best Treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 "To Revive America's Worst Economy," the theme continues. 
</P>
<P>
 One might even quibble over whether California's economy is the worst. But 
leaving that aside, claiming to be "America's Best Treasurer" -- better than 
any treasurer in 49 other states -- smacks of being a bit presumptuous and/or 
pretentious. And that's putting it gently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Times story by reporter Paul Jacobs, who spent several weeks 
examining Brown's three-plus years as treasurer, "her record is decidedly 
mixed. . . . There continues to be a backlog of approved but un-issued state 
bonds. . . . Earnings on investments have plummeted . . ." and she named her 
top political aide as assistant treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has explanations. Interest rates fell during her tenure, reducing 
earnings. And victorious candidates routinely bring political advisers into 
government. But it all fits into the "turnabout is fair play" category. She 
hammered her 1990 opponent, incumbent Tom Hayes, for similar so-called sins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' story also cites Brown's "accomplishments and innovations": investing 
idle funds in home mortgages and small businesses, shifting more bond sales to 
firms headed by minorities, women and disabled veterans. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But America's best? There are no playoffs to determine champion treasurer -- 
no Final Four, no Super Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claims the crown based on an award from City & State newspaper, a 
now-defunct bimonthly. It named Brown the "most valuable public official" at 
the state level for 1993. The newspaper annually gave six such awards for 
various levels of government. Readers nominated contestants and the newspaper 
staff selected the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point was to honor people who are innovative, visionary and had 
leadership ability," says the former editor, Ellen Shubart. "And certainly she 
was doing things above and beyond what most treasurers in the country were 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody ever said, 'You're the best.' I was taken aback to hear she was 
using it as 'best.' Everybody we gave that award to used it to say, 'I'm doing 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Good , however, doesn't have the same punch as best . 
</P>
<P>
 The slogan was the creation of new campaign manager Clinton Reilly, who has 
stamped it on lapel buttons and run it in TV commercials. The strategy is to 
adorn Brown with credibility, to credential her as capable of leading 
California back to the economic good life, despite only a brief exposure to 
state issues. She's the best; Gov. Pete Wilson's the worst . 
</P>
<P>
 "Why isn't she the best treasurer in America? Prove that she isn't," says 
Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Brown, referring to a 1986 campaign slogan: "Was (George) Deukmejian a 
great governor? 'A great governor for a great state'?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown could have called herself "a great treasurer" -- although perhaps that 
is an oxymoron -- and drawn less flak. But claiming to be No. 1 is risky 
because it invites serious scrutiny and scoffing, especially when running in a 
high-stakes race for California governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is Kathleen Brown not America's best treasurer, she's not even 
California's," asserts Wilson's lead attack dog, spokesman Dan Schnur, 
referring to her predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign slogans have been known to backfire. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' 
"Massachusetts miracle" turned to "the Massachusetts mess" when the recession 
hit. Hubert H. Humphrey's "politics of joy" didn't fit the riotous era of his 
presidential campaign. President Herbert Hoover's promise of "a chicken in 
every pot" was jeered by voters who complained they couldn't afford a pot. Gov. 
Jerry Brown's "era of limits" didn't play well in California boom times. 
</P>
<P>
 As for sister Kathleen, veteran Republican strategist Stu Spencer says: "I 
don't think it's a major thing. People expect these clowns to say 'I'm the 
best' this or that." 
</P>
<P>
 But pollster Mervin Field says, "Slogans, in order to be effective, should not 
require any explanation. And being the 'best treasurer' makes the eyes glaze 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters may not understand credit ratings, bond sales and revenue anticipation 
notes. But they usually know political hyperbole when they hear it. And the 
more hyperbole, the less credibility.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; INLAND EMPIRE; BONO HOPES TO SUCCEED IN FRIENDLIER 
TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainer-cum-campaigner Sonny Bono is trolling a politically attractive 
neighborhood for votes, hoping he can finesse his celebrity stature more 
successfully than he did two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Mr. Bono!" a man bellows as the candidate for Congress walks up his 
driveway. The two have never met but clearly no introduction is necessary. Even 
at 59, with those deep smile wrinkles around the eyes, the thin, mustachioed 
Bono is still easily recognized. "You've got my vote -- don't worry!" 
volunteers Luke Schenkken. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono hands him campaign literature, including a tri-fold handout with Bono 
pictured on its cover, looking Palm Springs-chic, and emblazoned with the 
campaign motto: "Let's do things differently in Congress and better!" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bono can work a small political rally like a cozy Vegas lounge, he 
appears uncomfortable with the one-on-one chitchat. He is escorted away by his 
father-in-law, who shepherds him to the next Republican house. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono is pleased by the reception he typically receives. "People don't see me 
as unapproachable," he said. "Because of my TV personality, I think people saw 
me as part of the family. I wasn't like, oh, what's his name, the guy who 
played God all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton Heston? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Heston. I'm just a guy who joked all the time, someone people could 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 But liking Sonny Bono and voting for him have proven to be two different 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Bono was badly thumped in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. 
He got 17% of the action, a half-million votes behind conservative television 
commentator Bruce Herschensohn, who in turn lost to Democrat Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Bono -- who won mixed reviews after four years as mayor of Palm 
Springs -- was poorly prepped for serious national politics, pummeled by 
reporters and discarded by the voters as a political oddity. But he said the 
experience was necessary so voters would come to consider him as a bona fide 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks his sacrificial run two years ago will now pay off. Still wearing 
his inexperience as a campaign button and still promising to be the 
bureaucracy-buster in Washington, Bono this time is running for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of six Republican candidates salivating for the open seat in the 44th 
District, which is being vacated by the retiring GOP Rep. Al McCandless of La 
Quinta. The district encompasses eastern Riverside County, including the 
sprawling suburb of Moreno Valley, the agricultural fields of the Coachella 
Valley and such cloistered country club communities as Palm Springs and Rancho 
Mirage. Residents in those environs include a former President, Gerald Ford; a 
former vice president, Spiro Agnew; and a long list of other political, 
industrial and celebrity constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional race is perhaps the most interesting primary election in 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. A more typical cat fight is being waged 
in the 36th state Senate District -- western Riverside County and northern San 
Diego County -- where the seat is being vacated by Democrat Robert Presley and 
which now weighs in as a Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in the Republican primary will choose between a conservative legislator 
and a county lawman: freshman Assemblyman Ray Haynes, who is counting on strong 
support from fundamental Christian corners, and Riverside County Sheriff Cois 
Byrd, who is banking on his law enforcement credentials and his more moderate 
Republican stance. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise in Inland Empire politics came when McCandless announced 
his retirement from Congress, offering an open seat in a district that figures 
to go Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Bono had figured on running for lieutenant governor. Gov. Pete 
Wilson was neutral on his candidacy, Bono said. When McCandless opted to 
retire, Washington looked more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign press secretary, Dan Schnur, said Bono wasn't discouraged 
from seeking the state office, but was simply shown the light -- "polling that 
we thought would help him come to a decision on his own." The Republican poll 
suggested Bono would fare "much better" in a congressional race than for the 
state office, Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a congressional candidate, Bono offers this conservative spiel: The federal 
government meddles too much and government over-complicates life. He proposes 
the elimination of unproductive federal departments or ones that duplicate 
state efforts. He says income taxes should be paid only to the states, which in 
turn should bankroll the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono said his own polling shows him easily leading the five other Republican 
candidates in next month's primary; he's the only one with widespread name 
recognition. More importantly, he said, the poll suggests that voters are now 
willing to take him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks he has finally shed co-identity with Cher; he's found life after 
"The Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Bono says he'll spend nearly as much on the congressional race as he did for 
his Senate run two years ago -- $300,000. Most of the money is his own: 
royalties from his songs with Cher and income from his occasional television 
cameos and for being the front man for the Palm Springs restaurant that bears 
his name, but which he sold three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he's a draw in Palm Springs, Bono is sure his celebrity will play well 
in Washington; he says he'll be a novelty item there, a media star who will 
attract the requisite media attention to the issues he'll carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono's most challenging opponent is Patricia (Corky) Larson, a Riverside 
County supervisor. Larson, 66, was elected to the Palm Springs school board in 
1973. In 1982, when McCandless moved from the Riverside County Board of 
Supervisors to Congress, she was elected to replace him on the county board. 
She was reelected easily in 1986 and even more handily in 1990 when, she 
boasts, she didn't spend a nickel campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bono-Larson tussle sounds a predictable theme: 
</P>
<P>
 Larson said that given her familiarity with politics, she'd be able to hit the 
ground running in Congress; Bono characterizes Larson as a career politician, 
something to be disdained, the reason for all things wrong in Washington. 
Larson says Bono would be a laughingstock in Washington -- and says that the 
possibility that he could be elected, based on his name recognition alone, 
"scares the bejabbers out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty-five percent of the people in this congressional district have never 
voted for me because they're not in my (supervisorial) district -- and those 
people are susceptible to packaging," Larson said. "Bono is like Disneyland -- 
you go on those rides and you think that's a rock next to you, but you touch it 
and it's cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bono can't put three sentences together," Larson said. "It's not that he's 
dumb. He's smarter than people give him credit for. He's a street fighter. And 
he's got the money. But if he wins the primary, he won't hold up in the 
November general election, because the Democrats won't be as nice as me. They 
won't play, 'Don't cannibalize a fellow Republican.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats running in the district are Steve Clute of Palm Desert, a former 
assemblyman who most recently has rallied opposition to the proposed Eagle 
Mountain trash dump; Clark McCartney, a Cathedral City real estate salesman 
long active in local Democratic Party activities, and Hans Schroeder of Desert 
Hot Springs, an art dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Republicans seeking the nomination in the 44th District are Phil 
Bretz, a physician; Kent Delong, a physician, author and businessman; Bud 
Mathewson, a businessman, and Lewis A. Silva, an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 In other primary races in the Inland Empire, Republicans may have to resort to 
cannibalism before their campaigns are finished. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 43rd Congressional District race in western Riverside County, 
freshman Republican Ken Calvert is fighting for reelection after publicly 
admitting he had sex in his parked car with a prostitute in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert faces conservative challenger Joe Khoury, who has promised the sex 
scandal will be a campaign issue. Licking their chops on the Democratic side 
are contenders Mark Takano, who barely lost to Calvert in the general election 
two years ago, and Raven Lopez Workman. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 65th Assembly District, incumbent Republican Paul A. Woodruff is 
bailing from elected office, prompting eight Republicans tripping over one 
another for his open seat. The generally conceded front-runners are Mark 
Bringhurst of Moreno Valley, an Air Force Reserve pilot; Jim Bagley, a 
Twentynine Palms City Council member, and Brett Granlund, a councilman from 
Yucaipa. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 66th Assembly District being vacated by Haynes, four Republicans -- 
none of whom have districtwide name identity -- are seeking their party's 
primary go-ahead.

 Is it a battle royal between the irresistible Lego and the immovable NIMBY? A 
case study of how bad things happen to good towns? 
</P>
<P>
 And why is the business-friendly reputation of the governor of California 
resting on what happens in a tomato field just east of the Pea Soup Andersen 
restaurant and motel? 
</P>
<P>
 Read on for answers -- partial, conflicted and political -- about this 
building-block drama with statewide, national -- nay, even international -- 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 7, voters in this upscale seaside community 35 miles north of San 
Diego will vote on Proposition D, an advisory referendum that asks whether the 
Carlsbad City Council should approve plans for a Lego Family Park USA. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 40-acre, $100-million park, planned for a hilltop just off 
Interstate 5, would be the first American theme park built by the Danish makers 
of those tiny plastic blocks that litter the floors of 70% of American 
households with children. Projections are that the park would draw 1.8 million 
visitors a year -- a large percentage of them coming from Los Angeles and 
Orange counties -- after it opens in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, the Carlsbad debate is another round in Southern California's 
seemingly never-ending fight over suburban growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lego backers say Carlsbad has to either grow or wither, but opponents say an 
amusement park is the wrong kind of growth and could scare away the light and 
clean industry that fills the city's lushly landscaped, campus-like business 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a slug-it-out campaign waged in the local newspapers and public-access 
television channel and through a proliferation of signs on the partisans' 
lawns, the opposing combatants seem to be talking about two different parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-D, pro-Lego crowd speaks of the proposed park in terms of fun, 
wholesomeness, family togetherness, the laughter of small children and 
increased tax revenue to keep the Carlsbad municipal coffers flush and 
recession-proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an absolute asset in terms of education and culture," said Peder 
Norby, president of the Carlsbad Rotary Club and leader of Carlsbad Cares, the 
Lego park support group. "It would be a small, passive, education-oriented park 
for children." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-D movement warns darkly of traffic, strip development, cheap motels, 
fast-food restaurants, increased crime and hormonally-charged teen-agers 
ruining the tranquillity of this city of 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 John Linehan, a business consultant, thinks a Lego park would metastasize into 
something awful, begetting cheap motels, fast-food eateries and trinket shops, 
like Katella Avenue in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Linehan is a member of Neighbors Involved in Carlsbad's Future, which was 
originally Neighbors Against the Invasion of Lego (NAIL) until that acronym was 
deemed too negative. The group eschews the better-known label NIMBY (Not In My 
Back Yard). 
</P>
<P>
 Linehan and other opponents are sending brochures to every home in Carlsbad 
with photos of Buena Park before and after the arrival of Knott's Berry Farm 
and Anaheim before and after Disneyland. The unsubtle message is that theme 
parks, however modest their beginnings, tend to devour their host cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every child wants to go to a theme park, but no adult wants to live near 
one," said Linehan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lego chose Carlsbad for its first American park after a year of assiduous 
courting by rival suitors: California Gov. Pete Wilson and Virginia Gov. 
Douglas Wilder. Wilson was nearly bubbling last November when he joined Lego 
executives at the La Costa Resort & Spa to announce Carlsbad's triumph over 
Prince William County, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lego execs, speaking Danish and English, lauded Wilson's success at moving 
heaven, earth and the state Legislature to put together a package of economic 
incentives and amend the state tax code. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor arrived with bureaucrats, publicists and oversized charts to 
herald the Lego decision as proof that California is rebuilding its economy 
"block by block by block," even when the blocks are miniature. "California is 
back in business," Wilson enthused. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition D is only advisory, but Lego has said it will take its blocks and 
go home if the proposition loses. Which explains why Wilson took time from his 
uphill reelection fight to come to Carlsbad one recent Friday night to keynote 
a $75-a-plate fund-raiser for the Pro-Prop. D forces. 
</P>
<P>
 A no vote on Proposition D could send a chilly message that California is not 
receptive to the tourist industry, said John Poimiroo, state director of 
tourism. Poimiroo was part of a squad of state and local officials who formed 
"TeamCalifornia" to lure Lego with promises of infrastructure, political 
support and marketing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 So eager was Wilson to get Lego for Carlsbad that he took time from directing 
the California National Guard during the Los Angeles riots to call Lego 
officials and assure them that not all of California was in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Carlsbad does not want this project, we will be very frustrated," said 
Poimiroo. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Lyttleton, past president of the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce, said she 
understands that when the words theme park or amusement park are heard, the 
average American conjures up images of the hurly-burly of Disneyland, Six Flags 
Magic Mountain and Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the reality is that Lego is more like the Quail Botanical Gardens" in 
nearby Encinitas, Lyttleton said. "Amusement park is not even the right 
adjective to use to describe what Lego plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Lego promises that the park will be filled with flower gardens, a miniature 
lake, kiddie rides, a "driving school" for tots, "hands-on" playrooms, and 
replicas of the U.S. Capitol, the Parthenon, Mt. Rushmore, the Statue of 
Liberty, Chief Sitting Bull and other cultural icons made from millions of Lego 
blocks. The target audience is children from 2 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-D leaders retort that Lego will soon find that its low-key European 
formula does not fit the more lusty, action-packed American idea of 
entertainment. They foresee Lego being forced to chase the lucrative teen-age 
market by installing rides with thrills and spills, attractions that glow and 
bump in the night, and maybe even rock 'n' roll concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the camel's head is in the tent, the tent starts to move," said Linehan. 
"We'll become Amusement Park Central." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to live in Carlsbad, not Anaheim," said Geoff Bell, a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the group of fanaticals that some of the papers have described us 
as," said Jim Young, a commercial real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters say claims of creeping Anaheimism and increased crime are scare 
tactics unworthy of civilized political debate. "The lesson has been learned 
from Anaheim and Disneyland," Poimiroo said. "Other parks have learned how to 
lessen the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly says he does not mind that his city is being used as 
the bogey man by the anti-Lego campaigners. He just wishes they would tell the 
whole story about what Disneyland hath wrought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim is the leader in terms of job creation in Orange County," Daly said. 
"If Carlsbad voters want to create jobs, they should think about that when they 
vote on Lego." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are fuming that Lego has attempted to co-opt Carlsbad's children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oceanside Blade-Citizen, whose editorial page is foursquare for Lego, 
sponsored a contest asking students to write essays about the virtues of Lego, 
with first prize being a trip to England and Denmark. It followed up with an 
editorial cartoon suggesting that without Lego, Carlsbad youth will be tempted 
to join gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the word has gone out that teachers may find summer jobs at Lego. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying the schools," said Pat Knox, a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's communistic," said Scott Jones, a landscape designer, referring to the 
boosters' attempts to sway adults' votes by influencing their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "No theme park can educate our children," said Cecilia Sawyer, a fourth-grade 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby, the leader of the pro-D team, is leading a pre-election trip to Denmark 
so that 40 Carlsbaders and local newspaper and television reporters can see the 
Lego park in Billund. 
</P>
<P>
 His enthusiasm for Lego is ancestral. He is Danish-American, the owner of a 
Danish bakery in Carlsbad and travels twice a year to Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby said he doesn't believe that just because there has never been a park 
like Lego in this country, its smaller-is-better formula cannot succeed.

BONN OFFERS PACKAGE OF BILLS AIMED AT COMBATTING RIGHT-WING VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The German government on Sunday presented a broad package of bills to combat 
rightist violence, including harsher jail terms for right-wing thugs and 
punishment for those who deny the Holocaust happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on outrage over police handling of a six-hour rampage against 
foreigners in the eastern city of Magdeburg on Thursday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
pressed the opposition to pass the legislation this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riots in Magdeburg must be the incentive to boost our anti-crime package 
into law," said Kohl's chief of staff, Friedrich Bohl. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws would increase the penalty for assault from three to five years; 
allow judges to detain right-wingers temporarily without warrants; increase 
penalties for racist or anti-Semitic taunts, and ban symbols or gestures that 
imitate the already-banned swastika and Hitler salute. 
</P>
<P>
 The package includes a proposal to make it flatly illegal to say the Holocaust 
is fictitious. Right-wing extremists make this claim to spread the impression 
that Jews and foreigners are smearing Germany's good name. 
</P>
<P>
 The package is assured passage in the lower house of Parliament but faces 
trouble in the upper house, which is controlled by the opposition Social 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Social Democrats feel harsher penalties would hamper programs to 
rehabilitate right-leaning minors. They feel some of the measures in the 
government's anti-crime package will curtail civil liberties in the population 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Sunday arrested the 19-year-old alleged ringleader of Thursday's 
hunt-and-bash campaign by rightists, said Magdeburg prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish and Turkish community spokesmen were outraged by the quick release of 
35 right-wingers arrested during the clashes Thursday night, which left seven 
people injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday's arrest, the only charges stemming from the Magdeburg clashes 
were against a Turkish waiter who stabbed a neo-Nazi after about 30 rightists 
chased five African men into a Turkish-run cafe and began trashing it.

RICH NOTEBOOKS OF POET PUSHKIN BROUGHT TO LIFE; RUSSIA: BRITAIN'S PRINCE 
CHARLES SPONSORS PUBLISHING. MANUSCRIPTS ARE WINDOW ON WRITER'S MIND, SCHOLARS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Notebooks in which Alexander Pushkin doodled, daydreamed and scratched out 
epic poems with a goose-feather quill will be published for the first time this 
year in a charitable venture sponsored by Britain's Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars say the rarely seen manuscripts will provide a glimpse into the mind 
behind the myth of Pushkin, the poet revered as the richest in the Russian 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than all others, he has pushed back the boundaries of the Russian 
language and shown all its spaciousness," fellow writer Nikolai Gogol said of 
Pushkin in 1834. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen large notebooks, about 2,000 pages in all, will be photographically 
reproduced and published in London in an eight-volume set, with financial 
backing from the Prince of Wales' charity, the Business Leaders Forum. Private 
philanthropists have pledged $450,000 in contributions for the project, which 
will be announced when Prince Charles visits Pushkin House on Wednesday as part 
of a two-day visit to St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles will be the first Prince of Wales to visit Russia since 1894. Queen 
Elizabeth II never set foot in the Soviet Union, whose founding Bolsheviks 
murdered her relatives, Czar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra, but President 
Boris N. Yeltsin has invited her to visit Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' visit to St. Petersburg is intended to promote foreign investment and 
aid to the arts, health care and tourism in the elegant but somewhat neglected 
former capital. Pushkin's papers are stored in St. Petersburg, where he died 
after a duel in 1837. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushkin's verses can be found on most Russian bookshelves -- 35 million copies 
of his works were printed from 1917 to 1947 alone -- but only a handful of 
scholars with access to the Institute of Russian Literature have set eyes on 
the raw stuff those books are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute stores nearly all of his original writings: 12,000 pages, 
letters and scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about another 10 pages of Pushkin manuscripts in museums and 
libraries around the world," said Sergei Fomichev, a scholar at the Pushkin 
House, as the St. Petersburg institute is known. "The rest is here." 
</P>
<P>
 The papers are largely intact because of a 1930s decree by Josef Stalin that 
all Pushkin manuscripts be kept at the institute -- a decree that sent Pushkin 
House scholars scurrying about the Soviet Union and even abroad to round up the 
works. Many had made their way into private hands despite a similar ukase 
issued by Czar Nicholas I immediately after Pushkin's death impounding the 
poet's papers as state property. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-volume set will be published with an initial print run of 500 
copies, each set selling for $3,000. Volumes one and eight -- with an index and 
commentary -- will be available by December, 1994; volumes two, three and four 
by December, 1995; and volumes five, six and seven by June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the price tag, Fomichev said, interest is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Washington's National Symphony Orchestra Conductor Mstislav) Rostropovich 
was here to look the notebooks over. He said they were charming and promised 
he'd be the first to buy one," he said. "There are several excellent American 
Pushkin scholars who are interested, and we've had feelers from the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We even got a letter from a woman in Bermuda whom none of us had ever heard 
of," Fomichev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the profits will go toward fixing up the decrepit Institute of Russian 
Literature, a 160-year-old building that houses letters of Napoleon and 
manuscripts of Feodor Dostoevsky, Mark Twain and Honore de Balzac, in addition 
to the Pushkin notebooks. Roof leaks threaten these literary treasures, and the 
book-choked building is such a firetrap that off-duty firefighters have been 
hired to wander the halls and sniff for smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The notebooks, which contain such beloved Pushkin works as the fairy tale 
"Ruslan and Lyudmila" and the poet's seminal epic, "Yevgeny Onegin," are stored 
in cardboard folders in a red wooden filing cabinet -- in a room where humidity 
is controlled by placing wet rags on the radiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushkin crossed out as much as he wrote, and the notebooks reveal the 
mind-bending toil that produced his ethereal lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what labor he wrote his light, flying verses," poet Vasily Zhukovsky 
remarked after seeing some of the agonized-over drafts. "There is no line that 
has not been scribbled several times over." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 19th Century -- the golden age of Russian literature that Pushkin 
himself ushered in -- artists customarily tried their hands at various media. 
Painters dabbled in poetry, and Pushkin wove sketches both dreamy and 
draftsman-like around the text of his notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some verses take on new meaning in the light of accompanying illustrations. 
One poem-drawing, for example, begins, "I could (also) have . . ." A sketch 
shows young men hanging from gallows, and then the line resumes, "like a fool." 
The reference is to the Decembrists, a group of radicals who tried to overthrow 
the czar in 1825. They failed and were executed or exiled to Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pushkin was a sympathizer, the revolutionaries deemed him too 
volatile to be trusted with their secret plot and too valuable a literary 
figure to endanger. The passionate Pushkin died in a duel 12 years later, at 
the age of 37. Lionized in his lifetime, the writer was elevated to a national 
hero after his romantic death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hungry 1920s, the cash-starved Soviet government allowed publication of 
Pushkin letters revealing details of the dispute that led to the fatal duel, 
sparking lively interest in the century-old scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They provided a great deal of entertainment in a very bleak time," said Paul 
Debreczeny, a co-founder of the North American Pushkin Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushkin remains the undisputed father of Russian literature, but his works 
recently have been replaced on sidewalk and subway booksellers' tables by 
pornography and pulp novels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pushkin is not popular; 'Santa Barbara' is popular," said Valentin 
Nepomnyashchy, chairman of the Pushkin Commission at the Institute of World 
Literature in Moscow, referring to the defunct U.S. soap opera now shown on 
Russian TV. "But Pushkin is the poet of the Russian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is unclear whether this edition will make Pushkin's notebooks any more 
accessible to the average Russian -- or even to scholars in the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure universities in cities like Saratov, Rostov and Tver would dearly 
love to have them," Debreczeny said of the $3,000 tomes. "Unfortunately, 
Russian universities are in a very dire financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Byrne, a spokesman for the Business Leaders Forum, said he hoped some of 
the proceeds could be used to donate editions to Russian universities and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main goal of the project is to show Russian cultural institutions how 
to use their treasures to support themselves as Soviet-era state subsidies dry 
up, Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitry S. Likhachev, the Pushkin House director, said that what matters most 
is that "in case of a disaster, a copy -- at the very least a copy -- will be 
left in the world."

AMERICAN ALBUM: 500-FOOT MOVE FOR HISTORIC HOME IGNITES BATTLE; ROTTING 
ALEXANDER HAMILTON GRANGE WOULD BE RESTORED IN PARK, BUT N.Y. NEIGHBORS ARE 
FURIOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Park Service plan to restore the 192-year-old home once inhabited 
by Alexander Hamilton -- known as the Hamilton Grange -- seemed so practical to 
many of its backers that they still cannot believe the controversy the proposal 
has generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Hamilton's two-story, Federal-style house has been closed to the 
public because of structural rot, its 70,000 annual visitors an increasingly 
dim memory. The Park Service proposal: move the Grange from its cramped 
quarters in the Hamilton Heights section of West Harlem to St. Nicholas Park, 
500 feet from where it now rests, in order to allow for the best possible 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 But what no one had counted on was a fierce two-year battle that pitted 
community residents against one another as the question was debated: Is it 
better to commemorate in a proper style Hamilton's place in U.S. history or 
preserve the history of a contemporary American neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really sort of shocked, not at the opposition but at the amount of 
opposition and the really horrifically nasty and bitter dimensions that it took 
on," said area resident Michael Henry Adams, president of the Upper Manhattan 
Society for Progress Through Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service, with the support of Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), hopes 
to spend an estimated $11 million to restore Hamilton's summer home. A 
Revolutionary War patriot, the first secretary of the Treasury and creator of 
the nation's monetary system, Hamilton died in an 1804 duel with then-Vice 
President Aaron Burr. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the proposal to move the Grange and restore as many of its original 
features as possible encountered strong opposition from a neighborhood that 
views itself as increasingly threatened by crime, drugs and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a promise to build a new community center on the current site of the 
Grange changed few minds. "To take away this building would destabilize the 
neighborhood," said Bernice Cummings-Ubiles, a member of the Community Task 
Force to Prevent Removal of the Grange. "In New York City, buildings go up next 
to each other, they grow with the area, they mark the passing of time. In 1802, 
this area was suburban and it's no longer that. . . . We live in an urban area, 
and to move this building to a rustic setting makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1802, the Grange served as the centerpiece of a 32-acre summer estate 
designed by noted architect John McComb Jr., who also created New York City 
Hall. It survived intact until 1889 when, threatened with destruction as a 
result of the development of Hamilton Heights, it was moved 350 feet from its 
original location to a site adjacent to St. Luke's Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process the house lost many original features. The new front entrance 
originally served the Hamilton family as a side portal. Porches were destroyed 
and the interior of the house altered. In 1910, an apartment building was built 
on its north side, further encroaching on the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's squeezed, and I mean tightly squeezed, between these two buildings," 
said Park Service spokesman Steve Laise. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the Park Service plan say the home can be restored to much of its 
original grandeur at its current location. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighborhood activists are concerned about the agency's somewhat sketchy 
record with regard to historic sites, such as its caretaking of the Grange and 
nearby Grant's Tomb. The final resting place of America's 18th President is 
frequently vandalized and marked with graffiti, and even the Park Service 
admits that homeless people sleep inside the structure almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many area residents doubt that the promised community center will 
be built on the site of the Grange, leaving them with a vacant lot. In 
addition, they question the wisdom of moving the Grange to an infrequently 
tended and often garbage-strewn area of New York City-owned St. Nicholas Park. 
Park Service assurances that the site will be guarded 24 hours a day receive a 
cynical reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a community that doesn't believe in promises and realizes they will 
have to stay on the case till the last nail is banged in," said Ted Kovaleff, 
the chairman of Community Board 9, the area's governing body. "We're living in 
a time of budgetary stringency and cutbacks in state, city and federal budgets. 
Everyone out there is looking for a place to cut, and unfortunately our 
community is viewed as ripe for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Momentum seems to be with the National Park Service plan. After several months 
of postponed votes, Community Board 9 decided in March to throw its support 
behind moving the Grange. The Park Service hopes to begin construction sometime 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents aren't throwing in the towel just yet. One possible plan of 
attack: fighting the appropriation of public space in St. Nicholas Park, which 
also has a claim on history. The park was designed at the turn of the century 
by noted architect Samuel Parsons Jr.

JEWS, PALESTINIANS TEST BOUNDARIES UNDER NEW REGIME; MIDEAST: SETTLERS TAKE 
WEAPONS INTO JERICHO SYNAGOGUE. IN THE GAZA STRIP, GUNMEN FIRE AT ISRAELI 
TROOPS.

<P>
 Jewish settlers defied PLO authority Sunday by carrying automatic rifles into 
a Jericho synagogue guarded by Palestinian police officers. In the Gaza Strip, 
Palestinian gunmen fired on Israeli troops, and four Palestinians were wounded 
in the ensuing cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a time of testing in the newly established autonomy zones of the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank region of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds of cooperation between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization are fragile but appeared to be holding, despite incitement by 
opponents on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish settlers carrying Uzi submachine guns and pistols were escorted by 
Israeli soldiers to the Peace Upon Israel synagogue, where they jostled past 
PLO police with Kalashnikov rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, both sides avoided eye contact, but each had complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not against them coming and praying here, but I know they are not here 
today to pray," said Mohammed abu Ayesh, 33. "They are here for provocations." 
</P>
<P>
 He stood guard outside the two-story synagogue with flaking ochre paint and 
crumbling plaster, a reconstruction of a 6th-Century synagogue just north of 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanan Porat, a West Bank settler leader and right-wing member of the Israeli 
Knesset, or Parliament, said settlers would not show PLO police identification 
or obey any of their orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, these soldiers of Palestine are like the air. I don't see them. They 
don't have identity," Porat said, adding that he believed the autonomy 
agreement was "temporary" and that Israel was the "landlord of the Land of 
Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Settlement leader Aharon Domb said settlers planned "to come every day and at 
all hours" to show "that we are not leaving Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rhetoric and concealed tensions, the dozen or so PLO police made 
no move to challenge the 60 Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlers left before sunset, the start of the Shavuot holiday marking the 
day Moses received the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 Another test of the new order came in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, where PLO 
police now control the Palestinian town and Israeli soldiers still protect 
Jewish settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO police and Israeli soldiers jointly investigated a shooting in which five 
gunmen in a van opened fire on soldiers guarding the Morag settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Palestinians in a car nearby were wounded, but it was not clear whether 
the bullets were fired by the gunmen or Israeli troops who returned fire on 
their assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall slogans claimed responsibility for the drive-by shooting in the name of 
Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist group opposed to the autonomy agreement.

FIGHTING FLARES IN RWANDA AS U.N. NEARS VOTE

 Fierce fighting in Rwanda's capital shattered a four-day lull on Sunday, and 
rebels were reported advancing on the temporary seat of the interim government. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said they expected Rwanda's rebels to launch fresh onslaughts 
against government forces ahead of an expected vote by the U.N. Security 
Council this week on sending in peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel artillery and mortar shells pounded areas near the airport, the Defense 
Ministry and other government offices, said Abdul Kabia, a U.N. spokesman in 
Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Government artillery barrages failed to dislodge guerrillas of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front from their positions east of the city around the airport and in 
the surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels had crossed 
the Akanyaru River just east of Gitarama and threatened to overrun the city, 
about 20 miles southwest of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials fled to Gitarama after an orgy of ethnic killing by Hutu 
militias began in Kigali on April 7, the day after Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprian Ntayamira, both Hutus, died in a 
mysterious plane crash near the capital's airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known whether the officials were still in Gitarama. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainly Tutsi rebel forces have been unable to stop the massacre of 
minority Tutsis and allies from Hutu-based opposition parties at the hands of 
extremist Hutu death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers estimate up to half a million people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on Tuesday on a proposal to send 
a force of up to 5,500 African troops to try to curb the bloodshed. But the 
United States wants the U.N. soldiers to be deployed along Rwanda's borders to 
create havens for refugees. The United Nations wants them to secure Kigali 
airport first.

HONORING SLAIN OFFICERS, CLINTON PUSHES CRIME BILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Presiding over an emotional ceremony for slain police officers, President 
Clinton promoted his anti-crime package Sunday and said the greatest tribute to 
fallen officers would be safer streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to rededicate ourselves to becoming a country worthy of the heroes 
we come here to honor," Clinton told about 4,000 people attending an annual 
memorial for officers who died in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Capitol grounds covered by blue uniforms, Clinton told friends, 
children and widows of slain officers that he and Congress were working to get 
more police and fewer guns on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned the crime bill winding its way through Congress, which earmarks 
money for 100,000 new officers, and heaped praise on the 216 House members who 
voted for a ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met with the families of two slain officers before his speech. He 
stopped afterward to chat with Devin Cutugno, 11, and Trina Cutugno, 9, of 
Staten Island, N.Y., grandchildren of an officer killed in 1964. Turning from 
the children, who were in wheelchairs, Clinton wiped a tear from his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also commended living officers "who still go to work every day 
not knowing for sure if that day they will be required to make the ultimate 
sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that there should be capital punishment for people who kill law 
enforcement officials in the line of duty," Clinton said to applause from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, the United States also had to "use law enforcement officials in 
the work of prevention," such as in programs where they visit schools and try 
to "keep young people away from crime in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 "We must determine that we are going to become a less violent, less dangerous, 
less crime-ridden, more hopeful, more unified society," the President said. "We 
owe that to the people who we will honor today."

 A soldier was shot and killed in the black township of Thokoza, where 12 
people died in a sudden resurgence of political violence two days earlier. 
Another five people were killed in the volatile KwaZulu-Natal province, the 
Zulu heartland where 10,000 people died in a decade of factional fighting. The 
soldier's killing appeared to be politically motivated, further raising fears 
that violence will rise again after a lull during elections and the 
inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the country's first black president.

Guatemala City after a group of enraged Guatemalans accused her of stealing a 
baby she recently adopted.The woman, identified as Janice Wogel, was traveling 
with her 6-month-old Guatemalan child on a bus when passengers began to accuse 
her of stealing the baby, a police spokesman said. When Wogel got off the bus 
the hostile passengers chased her. She called the U.S. Embassy, which sent 
security guards to escort her to safety.

NEW FEARS CITED OVER MARGARINE, OTHER FOODS; HEALTH: PROCESSED ITEMS COULD BE 
LINKED TO 30,000 HEART DISEASE DEATHS, NUTRITIONIST SAYS. SOME IN INDUSTRY 
CRITICIZE REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An article being published today raises the possibility that margarine and 
other processed foods could be the cause of 30,000 of the nation's heart 
disease deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that margarine may be a major factor in heart problems is not new. A 
year ago, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health announced findings 
that margarine can increase the risk for heart disease in women by as much as 
70%. But the numbers in today's American Journal of Public Health article were 
seen as alarming and came under immediate attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was written by Harvard nutritionist Walter Willett, renowned 
worldwide as one of the leading researchers on diet and health disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will people be shocked? I suspect so," Willett told the Associated Press. 
"Many people who are trying to make good nutritional decisions for themselves 
and their kids are being grossly misled." 
</P>
<P>
 But others in the food industry were critical of the report, saying it was, in 
fact, an editorial and contained no new scientific data. 
</P>
<P>
 "This information has been worked on for quite a while," said Susan Borra, a 
registered dietitian with the International Food Information Council. "There's 
nothing new there." 
</P>
<P>
 The article, done at the request of the journal, is labeled as "commentary." 
In it, Willett posed the danger of what scientists have come to call "trans 
fats" which are produced during the hydrogenation process. That process is used 
to make such items as margarine, shortening, cookies, crackers and chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have long advised their patients to avoid saturated fat, found in both 
meat and butter. Instead, they have recommended polyunsaturated vegetable oil, 
for which there is no known risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers, in turn, have used hydrogenation to solidify the 
polyunsaturated oils, making them easier to use in various products. 
Hydrogenation, in turn, produces the trans fats. 
</P>
<P>
 While many foods are marketed as healthy because they contain no 
polyunsaturates, they do contain the trans fats that tend to increase so-called 
bad cholesterol, whose technical name is low-density lipoprotein. It has also 
been shown to decrease "good cholesterol," or high-density lipoprotein. 
</P>
<P>
 Willett said a number of foods carry "egregiously deceptive" labels such as 
"fat free" and "cholesterol free" and "cooked in vegetable oil" when in fact 
they contained harmful trans fats. He recommended that there be warning labels 
on food containing trans fats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such warning labels are, indeed, more justifiable than those on cigarettes 
and alcoholic beverages because the nature of the product is invisible to the 
consumer," Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Scarbrough of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency is 
considering the labeling issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story about trans fat is still emerging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his article, Willett said he determined that the median U.S. intake of 
trans fats is 2% of the daily number of calories consumed. He used that figure 
to calculate the number of people who would be subject to heart disease because 
of trans fats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the percentage of coronary heart disease deaths in the United States 
attributable to intake of trans fatty acids is uncertain, even the lower 
estimates . . . would suggest that more than 30,000 deaths per year may be due 
to the intake of partially hydrogenated vegetable fat," the article said. 
"Furthermore, the number of attributable cases of nonfatal coronary heart 
disease will be even larger." 
</P>
<P>
 Willett also said that, like the tobacco industry, the oil-processing industry 
claims the cause-effect relationship cannot be established without a randomized 
trial. He called such a trial "ethically and logistically impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed, in this country, further epidemiological studies will be difficult 
because the food sources of trans fatty acids have changed so dramatically over 
the last several years, such that even persons with stable diets will not have 
had stable trans fatty acid intakes," Willett wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, industry dietitian Borra said the article has an alarming sound, 
while problems could be avoided altogether by sticking to a diet in which the 
total fat intake is only 30% of the daily diet. According to health experts, 
the average fat intake is 46% of the average American's diet. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she believes the article should have undergone peer review 
before it was published. Journal editor Mervyn Susser told the AP that the 
article did undergo internal peer review. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's respectable scientific opinion," he said.

 A 29-year-old man will spend the rest of his life in prison because he robbed 
an espresso stand operator in Seattle.Paul Rivers was convicted of 
second-degree robbery for snatching a bag filled with $337 from the operator, 
who was on his way to the bank. The felony conviction places Rivers under 
Washington's new "three strikes, you're out" law, which mandates life 
imprisonment without parole for criminals who have committed three or more 
certain types of felonies. Rivers also has convictions for attempted robbery in 
1985, second-degree robbery in 1987 and second-degree assault in 1990, 
prosecutors said.

 A Death Row inmate who weighs more than 400 pounds is too heavy to be hanged, 
his lawyer said.Todd Maybrown said a hanging would likely decapitate Mitchell 
Rupe, who is sentenced to die for the 1981 murders of two bank tellers during a 
robbery. "Beheading was a punishment used in barbaric times," Maybrown said. 
"We don't accept bodily mutilation as a form of punishment now." No execution 
date has been set. State attorneys argue that the chance of decapitation is 
slight and, even if it does occur, won't necessarily inflict undue pain.

PLAN FOR OCEAN SOUND BLASTS PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to use underwater sound waves to study global warming is on hold 
while it is determined whether the noise will disturb sea life. 
</P>
<P>
 The research project had been assailed by environmental groups and others who 
believed the 195-decibel sound blasts would hurt animals that need to hear to 
survive, such as dolphins and whales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to get this thing settled," said Walter Munk, a Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography physicist in charge of the experiment. "The 
disadvantage now is that we lost time. The advantage is that, hopefully, it 
will lead to an agreement that is acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision for further study was announced Saturday as the research team 
readied for a public hearing here on its request for a permit for the 
experiment. The National Marine Fisheries Service ultimately will make the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The $35-million experiment is being funded by the Department of Defense. Two 
sound transmitters would be placed in waters off Point Sur in the Monterey Bay 
Marine Sanctuary and off Kauai's north shore in the Hawaiian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The transmitters would emit sounds for 20 minutes every four hours to 18 
receivers in the Pacific Ocean. Because sound moves faster in warmer water, 
evidence of global warming could be found if the sounds hit the receivers at an 
increasing pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the project cautiously praised the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time they started thinking along those lines," said Vicki Nichols, 
executive director of Save Our Shores in Santa Cruz.

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; DIVERSITY MAKES BOTH DOLLARS AND SENSE; MARKET FORCES ARE 
LIKELY TO PUSH FIRMS TO HIRE A WIDE RANGE OF EMPLOYEES TO BRING IN THE VIGOR 
THEY NEED TO COMPETE.

 In "The Dirty Dozen," Lee Marvin takes a motley bunch of criminals and turns 
them into a crack undercover team that accomplishes a mission everyone said was 
impossible. The characters -- Hollywood's version of diversity, circa 1967 -- 
include an Italian, a Latino, a Pole, a psychotic, a Native American, a really 
slow kid and Jim Brown, a black man no one will sit with at the movie's 
beginning but who ends up being so critical to the mission's success that his 
skin color is overlooked.  
</P>
<P>
 "A Few Good Men," the 1990s version of this all-for-one, one-for-all teamwork, 
adds a woman -- Demi Moore -- to the mix. As a military investigator at a 
court-martial, Moore at first is ostracized -- it's her gender -- but she later 
manages to win a spot on the team by proving she's just as tough as the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, not much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the considerable pressures, both legal and social, over the last 20 
years, the golden standard of success in most American corporations remains the 
heterosexual white male in a charcoal-gray suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Women and minorities who don't remake themselves in that image often find 
themselves permanent outsiders in the corporate club -- their ideas dismissed, 
their contributions unrewarded. Their choice is simple: Conform or fail. 
</P>
<P>
 However painful this pressure is for individuals, it is far worse for American 
business. Changing domestic demographics and new global markets demand diverse 
language skills and workers who can function in different cultures. People with 
such attributes, though, often won't take a job or stay with a company that 
hasn't thoroughly rooted out racial, sexual and cultural barriers to 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, companies that stop short of a fully integrated work force -- 
in fact and spirit -- will be the big losers in the scramble for customers and 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 As catalysts to change, today's market forces are likely to prove more potent 
than the women's movement, anti-discrimination laws or the Golden Rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "No company is going to do this because it is a nice thing to do," says Andrea 
Cisco, a diversity consultant with Towers Perrin in New York. "They are only 
going to do it because it improves the bottom line and gives them a competitive 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, doing the right thing can be its own reward. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it take to land a deal in Asia? It usually takes an Asian, or 
someone steeped in the language and culture of the country in question. If it's 
an ethnic clothing business owned by women in Albuquerque, you'd be foolish to 
send an entirely white-male consulting team. In Saudi Arabia, on the other 
hand, that might be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity, however, lies not only in the way a company's representatives look 
to a client. It also involves their message and the sophistication of their 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Building a work force that is diverse and skillful is a lengthy process. 
Experts say it takes at least 10 years for most companies, and failure can 
often be traced to quick-fix approaches that rely on quotas and window-dressing 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you promote people of gender and color just to get them to a higher level, 
you pay the piper down the road," said Dana Ellis, chairman of the Southern 
California diversity task force of the international accounting firm Arthur 
Andersen. "If they haven't developed their business and technical skills 
sufficiently, they fail in a very public way that reflects badly on all of 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a strategy that is blatantly transparent to other employees and 
often leads to low morale, costly turnover and warring interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Stephenson, a professor of human resources at UCLA's Anderson Graduate 
School of Management, has seen her share of failed diversity efforts. In most 
cases, the companies went only as far as the Hollywood version. They ignored 
the potential of their atypical hires to invigorate the company with new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson cited one company in which every working group was at least half 
women, but the leader designated by top management was always a man. So, while 
women were represented in the company in large numbers, they had no real chance 
to grow into positions of greater responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasiveness of this problem is borne out statistically: Women and 
minorities make up 65% of the work force today, but they occupy only about 5% 
of the top jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company Stevenson studied considered itself a model of diversity. It 
was "50% women, racially diverse and multiethnic," she recalls, but there was 
little meaningful communication between members of different interest groups, 
even when they were supposed to be working on the same project. The company had 
done a good job at the hiring end, but it had put almost no effort into 
creating a framework to allow the employees to work as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fact that people naturally gravitate toward others like themselves. 
When the work force was more homogeneous, social identification and teamwork on 
the job were almost synonymous. The person with whom you worked all day was 
very likely the person with whom you had a drink after hours or played golf on 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is not a given today. Besides race and gender differences, lifestyles 
vary greatly. Employees who have children may not have time to stop for a 
drink; weekend golf is not everyone's idea of a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a corporate culture that fosters productive teamwork is the toughest 
part of the "diversity" job. It means getting past the smug comfort of quotas 
to recognize Jim Brown and Demi Moore as individuals. It means wanting them not 
just because they can conform superficially to a time-worn standard, but for 
their ideas, values and points of view. It means recognizing their 
contributions as essential to a creative workplace and a robust bottom line.

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; BIAS: IT'S STILL A FACT OF BUSINESS LIFE; DESPITE ALL THE 
CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING, VIOLATIONS ARE COMMONPLACE, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT 
INVESTIGATORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Special to the Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A black male employee was under frequent attack by his white supervisor at 
work. He had been pushed, shoved and verbally thrashed. Many people at the 
company knew about it and did little to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a black female investigator from the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission visited the company, a prominent Southern California firm that 
government officials say must remain anonymous because the case is still under 
investigation, senior managers were openly hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most shocking aspect of the case is how commonplace it is 
considered by EEOC investigators. Despite a purportedly raised consciousness 
about the importance of breaking down old prejudices and developing a diverse 
work force, bias against women and minorities remains a fact of life in the 
office and on the factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finding gross sexual and racial and national-origin harassment," said 
Dorothy J. Porter, who supervises the Los Angeles EEOC office. "We think we're 
dealing with a more sensitive and informed community now, but we still find 
some pretty extreme and repulsive things happening that are in complete 
violation of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 According to diversity consultants and employment lawyers, many employers 
remain uncertain, ignorant or outright bigoted when it comes to hiring and 
promoting women, minorities and other workers who do not fit "the white male 
mold." 
</P>
<P>
 How is this uncertainty, ignorance and bigotry manifested? Here are some of 
the most common offenses employers commit, according to the lawyers and experts 
who make a living prosecuting the excesses or defending the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sexual harassment. Attorney Paul Grossman, general counsel for the 
California Employment Law Council, a group of 65 of the largest employers in 
the state, said there is a flood of sexual harassment cases in the courts and 
that "a high percentage have some merit." Employers are still learning that 
they can be held liable for harassment even if top management had no idea it 
was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 At one local company, men had been exchanging a joke whose punch line involved 
grabbing each other's crotches. Then a mid-level male supervisor told it to a 
female employee. She sued and won a six-figure award, said Lester G. Ostrov, 
her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inquiring about an applicant's disability. Porter said many employers don't 
know that under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which went into effect in 
July, 1992, they may not ask if a potential employee has a disability. They may 
ask only whether the applicant can perform the "essential functions" of the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, said Porter, is for employers to refrain from prejudging what someone 
with a disability can do. With reasonable accommodations, she said -- also 
required under the law -- someone without hands, for instance, can still be a 
computer programmer. Someone with a psychiatric problem could control it with 
medication and prove to be an outstanding employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Trilce Delgado, a Los Angeles diversity consultant, said she finds many 
employers trying to sneak around proper conduct by telling job applicants, "I 
know I'm not supposed to ask this, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * Relying on stereotypes and assumptions. Ann M. Morrison, a Del Mar, 
Calif.-based consultant and author of several books on diversity in the 
workplace, said employers can unwittingly hold women back by assuming they will 
not make the family sacrifices necessary for advancement, Morrison said. In one 
case, she said, the president of a school in the East was evaluating candidates 
for a job in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name of a highly qualified woman came up and he dismissed it, saying: 
'She wouldn't take it. Her husband has his business here,' " Morrison recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was well-intended; he didn't want to create trouble in her family 
by bringing it up. But the thing is, she was never offered that job." 
</P>
<P>
 * Seeing difference as a deficiency. Morrison said employers are slow to value 
experience from outside the mainstream as equally valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 In one company, she said, two managers were talking about a talented black 
professional who had just been hired. One asked where he went to school and the 
other said Howard University. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the first guy says, 'Gosh, he's so bright. Why did he go to a black 
school?' The assumption is that since it's predominantly black, it's inferior." 
</P>
<P>
 * Prejudice based on appearance. Lewis Maltby, director of the workplace 
rights office of the national American Civil Liberties Union in New York, said 
the workplace has yet to accept people whose appearance departs from the 
mainstream, which denies job success to many non-traditional employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "God forbid you should walk in wearing cornrows," he said. "The employer will 
think you're some sort of Rastafarian." 
</P>
<P>
 On a list of the most common unfair hiring practices, Maltby said, 
discrimination against over weight people is "at the top, and there isn't even 
a close second." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance and confusion also hamper progress. Many employers do not know, for 
instance, that they may not ask job applicants about their plans to have a 
family, child care arrangements or other things pertaining to gender. They may 
not ask an applicant's national origin (they may ask what languages he or she 
speaks or writes). 
</P>
<P>
 They may not ask about religion (but may outline what hours and days he or she 
will be asked to work). 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrov, the employment lawyer, also said many employers are confused about 
these legal guidelines. For instance, he said, it's hard to know where 
affirmative action crosses the line into reverse discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely not clear what employers can and can't do," he said. 
"Everything depends on the peculiar facts of each situation. The courts have 
said affirmative action is OK, reverse discrimination isn't. Where one ends and 
the other begins is a very gray area."

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; EEOC: THE MILL GRINDS SLOWLY; AT UNDERSTAFFED AND 
UNDERBUDGETED AGENCIES, THE BACKLOG OF CASES CONTINUES TO GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a real-life episode that invites comparisons to the Michael Crichton 
bestseller "Disclosure," Sabino Gutierrez alleged that his boss at a Pomona spa 
company regularly embraced him, kissed him, fondled him and told him of her 
desire to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gutierrez announced his engagement to another woman, the supervisor, 
Maria Martinez, had his office demolished, demoted him and eventually tried to 
get him fired, Gutierrez later said in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained to the company's owner, then to the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission. All to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "By that time, there was not much I could do. I could leave the job . . . or I 
had to confront the problem," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Gutierrez, 34, took his case to a private lawyer, Carla Barboza, 
now a partner with Walker & Barboza in Los Angeles. In 1992, he filed a 
sex-discrimination lawsuit against Martinez and California Acrylic Industries 
Inc., or Cal-Spas. Last May, a jury awarded him more than $1 million in what 
was believed to be the first verdict of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 That verdict is being appealed; a judge has already reduced the award to 
$350,000 in response to a defense motion. Martinez, who is chief financial 
officer of Cal-Spas, denies there was any sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 However the case turns out, it highlights the limited options available to 
someone who feels discriminated against but doesn't have a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Barboza's willingness to take his case without a retainer -- 
unusual for an attorney in private practice -- Gutierrez may have had no other 
recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the federal EEOC and its state counterparts help anyone who 
believes he or she has been the victim of illegal discrimination in the 
workplace. Plaintiffs are required to pursue their complaints through these 
agencies before seeking legal remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, however, the agencies are overworked, underbudgeted and 
understaffed, and few of the cases brought to them result in corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
 After a worker first contacts the EEOC, it can be months before an 
investigator is assigned, and months longer before the investigation begins. In 
an internal analysis, the EEOC found that the average processing time for a 
case in 1993 was 294 days -- two days longer than the year before. And the 
backlog is growing with complaints covered by the new Americans With 
Disabilities Law. 
</P>
<P>
 If discrimination is found, the agency can issue a letter stating the offense 
and seeking negotiation of a settlement or, ultimately, court action. The 
likelihood of legal action is small, however. In 1993, the EEOC dismissed or 
found no discrimination in 84.2% of the charges brought to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the process runs its course, however, most complainants may 
request a letter authorizing them to pursue a lawsuit on their own -- in effect 
freeing the agency from further responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 Most lawyers who handle discrimination cases urge workers to pursue internal 
remedies first: talk with their supervisors, personnel officer or other company 
officials, or go through mediation. That's particularly important if a worker 
wishes to remain on good terms with the employer. 
</P>
<P>
 If talks don't resolve the situation, the employee can turn to a public 
interest law firm or legal aid. But the case must be a strong one or one that 
will have meaning for a large group of workers, such lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
 To hire a lawyer, a worker must have money up front or expect an award that 
would cover the $15,000 to $30,000 cost of litigating a routine discrimination 
case, Barboza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have someone who is experiencing discrimination in the workplace, but 
not at a level that will command six-figure damages in court . . . or if you 
have a $10,000 case, then you have no access to the private legal system," said 
Douglas J. Farmer, a former trial attorney with the EEOC in San Francisco who 
now represents employers in discrimination cases for the law firm Corbett & 
Kane in Emeryville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wilton, 40, an African American who has worked 19 years as a gardener 
for the city and county of San Francisco, found that out. Wilton says he has 
been a victim of racial discrimination on the job since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He filed several complaints with the EEOC and sought help from at least six 
private lawyers. None would take his case. He eventually ended up at the city's 
nonprofit Employment Law Center. Staff attorney William McNeill listened to 
Wilton's complaints and helped him file a federal lawsuit, but chose not to 
represent him in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Wilton's case would have required too much factual investigation and 
didn't have broad enough application to others, McNeill said. Wilton's 1991 
lawsuit was thrown out of court when the city sought and won a summary 
judgment. He has appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Consulting a private lawyer can sometimes pay off handsomely. Take the case of 
Pamela Farrington, a worker at the Albertsons supermarket in Napa. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1984, when she began working as a grocery bagger, Farrington had been 
denied promotions to the night crew or the retail floor -- jobs considered 
stepping stones to management. Her qualifications and seniority were 
disregarded and men were given the jobs, she said in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 She and colleagues approached their union, the United Food & Commercial 
Workers. They were referred to Saperstein, Mayeda & Goldstein, an Oakland law 
firm that was handling class-action discrimination suits against other grocery 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm saw an opportunity to mount another class action and took the case. 
Months later, Albertson's Inc. agreed to settle. Under the terms of last 
November's pact, Farrington and 20,000 female and Latino employees at 144 
Albertsons stores in California will get $29.5 million. The chain agreed to 
modify its employment practices without admitting any violation.

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; OUT OF THE 'IN' CROWD; WORKPLACE CLIQUES BASED ON 
ANYTHING FROM GENDER TO RACE ARE A FACT OF LIFE -- BUT THEY NEEDN'T HOLD YOU 
BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leslie Meltzer Aronzon recalls her moment of embarrassment -- and annoyance -- 
well. It was right after she and four colleagues had been in an intense 
negotiating session with an important client. As they were walking along 
discussing their potential responses, the conversation came to a dead halt. 
Aronzon's co-workers had all veered off and disappeared into the men's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood there and talked to the plant," said Aronzon, 31, an investment 
banker with Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin Inc. in West Los Angeles. "And when 
the guys came out of the restroom, they had decided what we should do." 
</P>
<P>
 For Aronzon, a woman in a mostly male profession, surviving on the periphery 
of the boys' club is a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys in my office hang out together on weekends and share 
information. They even call each other with tips," she said. "They don't 
discriminate against me consciously, but they do discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
 Workplace cliques are perfectly natural and usually understandable, but 
inherently exclusive. And despite today's emphasis on diversity awareness, they 
are phenomena that corporate America cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be like high school all over again, except that at work, people break 
into cliques according to age, marital status, gender, race and position rather 
than looks, athletic ability and popularity with the opposite sex.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, cliques can affect you as deeply at the workplace as they did in high 
school, determining not only your lunch crowd and your access to gossip, but 
such critical matters as your assignments, promotions and salary. And unlike 
high school cliques, which mercifully disintegrate at graduation, office crowds 
don't meet such neat and convenient ends. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as an adult, you should have the advantage of a more mature 
perspective, says Eric Christensen, vice president of operations for Employee 
Support Systems Co. in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 "You should develop a strong self-esteem based on your own achievements and 
qualifications rather than worrying about why you haven't been invited to join 
a certain clique," Christensen said. However, if you feel a clique is holding 
you back, you should present your concerns to its most senior member -- and 
then, as a last resort, complain to the human resources department. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Schneider, an assistant editor for the in-house magazine of a Los 
Angeles film company, never dreamed she'd "still be dealing with feeling left 
out of the 'in' clique at age 41." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm still looking over my shoulder, wondering why those people over there 
are always going out to lunch and not including me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider is on the outskirts of the social scene at work because she doesn't 
have time for it after hours. "I'm married with children, and a lot of the 
younger people in my office don't have those responsibilities yet," she said. 
That realization helps Schneider take cliques less seriously than she might 
have 25 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "People," she said, "feel most comfortable with people like themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 However, problems occur when one person's comfort zone interferes with another 
person's right to equitable treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, women and minorities may experience difficulty finding a mentor 
to foster their careers if upper management is composed largely of white men 
who prefer the company of other white men. On the flip side, because cliques 
often spring from common interests and backgrounds, ethnic groups can also be 
perceived as discriminating against outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best friends at work tend to be other people from Mexico," said Paul 
Muniz, 24, a claims processor for a Los Angeles insurance firm. "You see 
Latinos clustering together, Vietnamese people together, black people 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Muniz and his friends often speak Spanish to one another because "we feel we 
can express ourselves better in Spanish," he said. "But I try to be careful not 
to overdo it, because sometimes people who don't speak Spanish think we're 
saying something important that they should be in on." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Winfree-Lydon, staff consultant for Los Angeles-based Employers 
Group, a consulting firm for human resources departments, said she is often 
contacted after employees complain that they feel left out by co-workers who 
hold private conversations in a foreign language. At one company she has 
consulted for, 15 languages are spoken by employees. The English-speaking 
"employees sometimes think others are talking about them behind their back," 
she said. "It's a sensitive issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Another common workplace situation that can create insecurity among employees 
occurs when a manager joins a clique of subordinates -- leaving those on the 
outside to suspect favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Burlant, now a broker for Cushman Realty Corp. in Century City, 
witnessed such bias while an attorney at a New York law firm. "It was very 
important to maintain a close relationship with the partners handing out the 
assignments because they dictated the quality of your professional life," said 
Burlant, 32. "It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's difficult to hone 
your skills if you're not given the type of work that will enable you to rise 
to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts advise that, though it may mean loneliness at the top, supervisors 
avoid becoming too chummy with subordinates. "We encourage employers to create 
a level playing field at the workplace," said Christensen, the Orange 
consultant. "Socializing with subordinates might not be the best idea."

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; FOND FAREWELLS; COMPANIES AND COLLEAGUES ARE HELPING THE 
SERIOUSLY ILL WORK AND DIE WITH DIGNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in the time of AIDS, cancer and other diseases has created a new reality 
in the office: workers who are very ill, perhaps life-threateningly so, but who 
want to work as long as possible, both for the money and a sense of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, an increasing number of employers, as well as their employees, 
are developing ways to help their colleagues work and die with dignity. In some 
places, workers are donating vacation time for their seriously ill co-workers 
to use for medical leave. In others, employers are providing additional 
benefits for the seriously ill, including early access to life insurance, 
AIDS-specific health services that employees can tap anonymously, streamlined 
access to 401(k) retirement programs and, perhaps most basic, some simple 
understanding and job flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood studios, whose work forces have been hit hard by AIDS, have been at 
the forefront of this benefits examination, said Mike Powers, an associate with 
the Los Angeles office of William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm. 
But the steady supply of life-threatening illnesses in the population means no 
industry is immune. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Bill Tassi was a prosecutor in the Los Angeles city attorney's 
office, battling crime and cancer at the same time. The 38-year-old lawyer had 
exhausted his vacation and sick leave, and he faced long-term disability 
without city-paid medical benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tassi wanted to work and feel involved at the office, so his fellow 
lawyers made that possible. They formed a "vacation bank" by donating vacation 
days to a pool administered by a committee of lawyers within the office. Tassi, 
and others after him, drew from the pool as needed. Similar vacation banks have 
since been established for other city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a relief," said Susanna Iritani Tassi, whose husband died in October, 
1991. "He didn't have to worry about what would happen next." But perhaps more 
important, she added, was what the vacation bank -- which immediately swelled 
to more than 750 donated hours, or roughly 94 days' worth of vacation time -- 
said about Tassi's value to his co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the biggest present, the most tangible way of showing that they 
supported Bill," Tassi said. "It was so life-affirming." 
</P>
<P>
 Such heartwarming stories are hardly universal. Horror stories of workplace 
hysteria and hardheartedness can be heard at any hospice. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing is clear: Employers who fire or discriminate against workers 
with terminal illnesses violate the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, a 
1992 law that bars discrimination against the disabled -- and terminal illness 
is considered a disability -- in employment, public services and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "ADA is making employers look at disabilities differently than they have in 
the past," Powers said. "I'm seeing more companies in a exploratory stage right 
now . . . examining what happens to employees in life-threatening situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal law, he said, is certainly part of the motivation, but many 
companies see death-related issues as new territory for their human resource 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a study last year by Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, a 
management consulting firm, time-off pools were in place at only 13 of 162, or 
9%, of major employers surveyed. Another five were considering starting one. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, flexible time-off policies, including the use of sick days for the care 
of sick dependents, werehighly valued by employees, even if only a small 
fraction used them, the study showed. Further, most companies reported that 
starting these programs costs little. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies are moving toward creating a "living benefit" that allows sick 
employees to receive a portion of their life insurance while they are alive to 
help with medical and living expenses, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Inc., the entertainment company, has been credited with being innovative 
in its benefits for seriously ill employees, including providing a separate 
employee assistance program for workers with AIDS. The employee calls a 
toll-free number and can receive anonymously a variety of services from 
counseling to hospice care, said Lynn Franzoi, Fox vice president of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Other benefits provided by Fox include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Full medical coverage for five years after full-time disability begins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Access to a portion of the employee's life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing employees to borrow from their 401(k) retirement plans, thereby 
avoiding income taxes. (The IRS allows disabled taxpayers to make early 
withdrawals without penalty from their 401(k) accounts, but income taxes are 
still due on any withdrawn amounts.)  
</P>
<P>
 * Six months of sick leave at full salary and benefits after only one year of 
service. Illness at Work: First Step Is Education 
</P>
<P>
 How should employers handle fatal illnesses, including AIDS, in the office? 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is educating your employees to create a non-discriminatory 
atmosphere in the workplace, said Richard Jennings, executive director of 
Hollywood Supports, an AIDS education group that is tackling workplace issues 
in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many companies think, 'We haven't had a case of it yet and we don't have to 
worry about it,' " Jennings said. But when rumors begin circulating that an 
employee is HIV-positive, "what often happens in the workplace is people panic. 
. . . An educated workplace is the first line of defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Other suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Companies should adopt a "life-threatening illness" policy that lets 
employees know the company is aware of its obligations under the federal 
Americans With Disabilities Act and will allow an employee to work as long as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Managers should keep in regular touch with the employee to clamp down on 
subtle discrimination by co-workers such as coffee cups that are washed 
separately and equipment that suddenly becomes unavailable because someone is 
unwilling to share it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Managers and co-workers should treat the person as they do everyone else in 
the office, maintaining the same relationship they had before they learned of 
the illness; don't avoid him or her, or be overly solicitous.  
</P>
<P>
 Jennings said he has also found himself in the odd position of advising an 
employer not to go too far in helping a particularly cherished or senior 
employee who has become sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know employers who have let employees take substantial time off at full 
pay without putting them on full-time disability," he said. "While that's very 
generous, . . . they have to treat all employees equally under the ADA."

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; HOW TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES TO DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 So what can employers do to make their way toward diversity? Here are some 
tips from the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Education. Employers must make certain their employees clearly understand 
what kinds of conduct will not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exposure. Ann M. Morrison, a Del Mar, Calif.-based consultant and author of 
several books on diversity in the workplace, suggests structuring work teams or 
task forces so they are ethnically, racially and sexually diverse. This helps 
employees break down stereotypes and assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accountability. Efforts to diversify often go unrewarded, Morrison says. 
Managers who recruit and develop women, minorities and other less traditional 
workers should be recognized for their achievements, and employees who work 
well with people of varying backgrounds should be rewarded in their job 
performance evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assess the trouble. Don't assume you understand the problem. At one company, 
Morrison says, managers saw women leaving and assumed it was due to work-family 
conflicts. They installed a new family benefits package, but it didn't help. 
They learned later that women left because they saw no future for themselves 
due to lack of promotion and development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recruit from new venues. When seeking candidates for promotion, managers 
should re-examine their assumptions, Morrison says. For instance, there is no 
reason someone from the manufacturing line couldn't be developed into a great 
human resources manager if the person has the right personality traits. 
</P>
<P>
 * See each employee as an individual. Avoid attributing traits to workers 
based on a group to which they belong, Morrison says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intervention by top management. Commitment to diversity must be demonstrated 
clearly at the highest levels of the company. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; THE YOUNG AND THE DIVERSE; THE NEXT GENERATION MAY BE 
BETTER EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH CULTURAL COMPLEXITIES AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Is that your real hair?" asked Patrick Navarez, trying to start a 
conversation with his African American co-worker. Sure, Navarez was genuinely 
curious about her braided extensions, but his line wasn't exactly an 
icebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 And he found that another colleague didn't take it very well when he pointed 
to her nose ring and wondered aloud, "Doesn't that hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
 But for Navarez, a fresh-faced 22-year-old recent immigrant from the 
Philippines, these encounters were part of his workplace education in American 
culture. His primary tutors were his fellow male stock clerks at the Target 
store in Pasadena, who gently suggested that he be less direct in his personal 
questions to women. 
</P>
<P>
 For young workers such as Navarez, diversity in the workplace is not a slogan 
but a daily reality. Young workers, especially teens in entry-level and 
part-time positions, are a far more colorful group than the older work force. 
</P>
<P>
 According to government data, almost half of the 40-year-old population in Los 
Angeles County is non-Hispanic white -- the category used by the Census -- 
while just 27% of the 18-year-olds are. Among teen-agers entering the job 
market in Los Angeles today, 51% are Latino, 12% are Asian, and 11% are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the collisions of culture such as those Navarez encountered are 
inevitable, the experiences of many young workers suggest that they may be far 
better equipped to deal with the differences, clashes and uncertainties of a 
highly diverse work force than their elders are.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, companies that rely on relatively young workers, such as 
retailers and fast-food chains, have dealt with diversity issues earlier and 
more intensively than have firms with mostly older employees. That may give 
them a competitive advantage in entering the next century, when 80% of new 
workers are expected to be women and other than non-Hispanic whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurturing a diverse workplace "gives us more talent to pick from," says Bob 
Beavers, senior vice president of McDonald's in Oakbrook, Ill. "Those companies 
that have addressed that diversity (will) be better prepared, with people of 
color and women in key management positions to lead them into the next century. 
Those without people in the pipeline now will perish."  
</P>
<P>
 Some strategies? "You need a sense of humor to work in a multicultural place," 
says Navarez, who was glad his co-workers were eventually able to laugh off his 
faux pas.  
</P>
<P>
 And Navarez said being welcomed as the only Asian by his black and Latino 
co-workers quickly changed some of the stereotypes he had of them. Before 
joining Target, his only images of those groups were negative ones from 
television.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was intimidated. I thought that because I'm different they might 
gang up on me," he said. But instead they joked with him and invited him to 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 They even learned from him. When a Vietnamese employee joined the team, they 
brought him over to Navarez, thinking the two would hit it off as fellow "Asian 
homeboys." Navarez later explained to them that their languages and cultures 
are different.  
</P>
<P>
 But while Navarez says ways of socializing are different among groups, there 
aren't any differences when it comes to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're loud," he says of his co-workers. "You can clearly hear them joking 
from across the room. But they work fast, and they work hard . . . . Race 
doesn't have anything to do with work."  
</P>
<P>
 Not all young, diverse workplaces are as collegial as Navarez's graveyard 
shift at Target. But Sondra Thiederman, president of a San Diego-based training 
firm, that diversity can be easier to manage among young workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems young people do a little better with cross-cultural communication 
than older people -- they're less set in their ways," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The workplace can be a powerful educator. Although many young people go to 
schools with a diverse population, they often break down into ethnically based 
cliques. That's not possible in many workplaces. The necessity of simply 
getting the job done is, for many young people, the most effective motivator to 
communicate across cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn a lot working here," says James Goodrich, 20, who handles shopping 
carts at Target. He says that growing up as an African American in 
South-Central Los Angeles, he felt he didn't have much contact with other 
races. Now his supervisor is Filipina and another co-worker immigrated from the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "Target wouldn't run smoothly if everybody didn't work together," Goodrich 
says. "It just comes naturally. In doing your job, it's forcing you to get 
along with different races and just people in general." 
</P>
<P>
 If workers at this Target seem upbeat, it may be because they feel they have 
chances for promotion regardless of their ethnicity. Navarez notes that his 
immediate supervisor, Rafael Rodriguez, is Latino, and his boss is African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 26, says that when he visited Target's Minneapolis headquarters, he 
saw many Latino, African American and Asian faces in the executive offices. 
That made him feel that he too had a chance to get ahead. Target's diversity 
training programs help people get along, he says -- but perhaps even more 
important are twice-yearly evaluation sessions that contribute to a sense of 
fair play in promotions by giving each employee feedback on his or her 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 At McDonald's, where nearly half of the restaurant managers nationwide are 
women -- and half of both male and female managers are minorities -- the 
corporation encourages mixing among various ethnic groups. It has networking 
groups for African American, Latino, Asian and Middle Eastern employees, 
through which people can share notes on career advancement. About a quarter of 
all McDonald's franchise owners are people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's has no formal programs to train its workers about cultural 
differences. Instead, the emphasis is on joining a culture that's the same 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a strong corporate culture -- from Tokyo to Paris to Inglewood -- 
encourages workers to get along as they pledge allegiance to crisp french fries 
and fast service rather than a single nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ofelia Melendrez, an assistant manager at a McDonald's in Torrance, says that 
because of the standardization of procedures throughout the company, among 
employees "you can go anywhere, and you can relate to each other."

<P>
 It's your first day at the new job, and you've noticed something different. 
It's you. Your co-workers and your boss are not of your gender or background. 
You're a white male. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin O'Gorman, one of the few white employees -- and the only white reporter 
-- at the Voice & Viewpoint, a San Diego newspaper that covers the African 
American community, has some advice for someone caught in the process of 
reverse integration: Just relax -- it worked for me, it can work for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have to worry," O'Gorman said. "Maybe I'm just lucky, but 
I've never been made to feel I'm especially white." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Gorman joined the Voice & Viewpoint to broaden his view of the world beyond 
what he picked up in Catholic schools and the New York borough of Queens. And 
O'Gorman figures he's getting a jump on learning about the multiracial 
workplace, where everyone has to work together to stay afloat in an 
increasingly tough business world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn to deal with it for the simple reason (that) it's the future," 
O'Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pat Lawlor, the future is now. Lawlor is the lone white lawyer at the 
black-owned firm of Harrison, Taylor & Bazile, which has a dozen attorneys in 
general civil law practice at offices in Oakland and San Diego. He was 
introduced to the firm when he and a black classmate in law school conducted a 
study to show that women and minority-owned businesses were not getting a fair 
share of government work. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is the law, black or white, Lawlor said, but the real differences are 
in style and language. Black attorneys, he found, dress more stylishly than 
white attorneys. And when talking to each other, black attorneys engage in what 
basketball players call "trash talking" or "puffing," good-natured joking with 
a slight put-down edge. 
</P>
<P>
 To fit in, Lawlor has learned to adapt. "If I have to, I can speak black," 
Lawlor said. "I can do street talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Sondra Thiederman, a San Diego consultant in cross-cultural communications, 
said the issues and potential conflicts are the same whether it's a white-owned 
business learning to accommodate people of color or a minority-owned firm 
coping with white employees. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are language differences, the chances for things going afoul 
multiply, Thiederman said, but often people speak different languages even when 
they ostensibly use the same one. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiederman said workers who make cultural blunders are "innocently inept." She 
advises co-workers to look for common ground, be aware of different perceptions 
about the relationship between the individual and the group and, yes, don't 
sweat the small stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Korean business owner and that white male worker from Ohio," she said, 
"all want the same things: human dignity, social support and physical comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, differences in background can cause more than a few unsettling moments 
in otherwise stable relationships. For example, Lawlor was once asked what kind 
of cake he preferred, and he answered -- with no intention of double meaning -- 
"Chocolate." After a moment of uneasiness, people started laughing. Another 
time, one of Lawlor's colleagues made a sarcastic crack about an attorney of 
Irish descent before he realized that Lawlor is also Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawlor's view of such slips: No harm, no foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawlor said he is considering writing something about his experiences as a 
white man in a black business. The trick, he said, is to neither pretend race 
differences do not exist nor dwell on them. "Color is superficial," he said. 
"If everybody is working together, race doesn't have to be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some organizations, both private and public, are taking steps to help white 
workers not feel left out in a world of diversity, the scorned losers of a 
cultural revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a diversity effort begun in 1991 for its work force of 10,000, the 
San Diego municipal government is trying to teach a new brand of teamwork and 
consensus management, rather than the old "one up, one down" style, diversity 
project manager Danelle Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just changing the power structure," Scarborough said, "we're 
changing the power paradigm." 
</P>
<P>
 White men, she said, are being told they will still be able to get promotions 
under diversity. And women and people of color are being assured that what is 
oppressive in the American workplace is not skin color or gender, but the 
heavy-handed "me boss, you worker" attitude, regardless of who is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them that if we took all the white males out of the organization, 
there would still be oppression," Scarborough said.

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; IT CUTS BOTH WAYS; MINORITY EMPLOYERS ARE ALSO EXPECTED 
TO SHOW DIVERSITY IN THEIR HIRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 EAWES Inc., launched five years ago as an all-Korean architectural firm in Los 
Angeles, is expanding beyond the Asian niche market, hiring non-Koreans to 
better compete for large government and private construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Partners Chris Pak and Steve Kim have already hired a white woman and are 
interviewing other non-Asians to bring aboard specialists in transportation 
projects, construction engineering and project management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's smart business to have a diverse working place and a diverse portfolio," 
said Pak, 32, a member of the Metropolitan Water District's board who emigrated 
from Seoul with his dentist parents in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 While anti-discrimination labor laws and efforts to increase ethnic and gender 
diversity in the workplace have been around for years, their focus has 
historically been on creating equality at white-owned or -dominated businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But as more African Americans, Asians, Latinos, Native Americans and women 
launch their own enterprises, how do business owners who have themselves been 
considered "minorities," and who have traditionally been the beneficiaries of 
diversity and anti-discrimination efforts, handle these same issues now that 
they are the employers? Are they more sensitive to the need for diversity? Or 
do they prefer to hire exclusively within their own ethnic or gender groups? 
</P>
<P>
 There is scant data on the ethnicity of workers in the nation's 1.2 million 
minority-owned businesses. However, experts who study such companies say that 
as a rule, they are more sensitive to the need to hire minority applicants. 
However, at the same time, they do tend to hire from their own ethnic or gender 
groups -- at least in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most new entrepreneurs, they usually start small, often hiring relatives 
and friends of the same ethnic background to save money and ensure loyalty. As 
their business grows, new hires often are chosen for needed skills, perhaps in 
sales, language or accounting. At EAWES, for example, hiring practices changed 
when the partners began to feel that growth depended on reaching beyond 
Southern California's Korean business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most minority business owners are sole proprietors, mom-and-pop shops, so 
you're going to have a lot of families working together," said George Autobee, 
head of World Demographic Research in Denver, which tracks minority-owned 
businesses for the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they are more sensitive to diversity, but how much diversity can you 
have if it's a small establishment?" he said. "After that, as they grow, hiring 
is probably based on the need for special talents -- say, if they need legal or 
financial help." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that the first priority of the minority business owner has 
to be survival, said Muhammad Nassardeen, founder of Recycling Black Dollars, a 
6-year-old Los Angeles-based organization aimed at helping African 
American-owned businesses thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes that strategy is at odds with community desires. For example, in 
post-riot Los Angeles, some African Americans eager to spend their dollars 
within their communities have criticized black business owners who hire 
non-blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just not realistic anymore," Nassardeen said. "You can't hire only 
blacks today, because of the diversity in the consumer base. Because of the 
demographics of Los Angeles today, if you run a retail outlet, you need to have 
someone who speaks Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 As minority-owned companies expand to two dozen employees and more, they, like 
any business, fall under rigorous state and federal rules barring 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Davidson believes he owes his success as one of the top African Ameri 
can business owners in Southern California to the pioneers of the civil rights 
movement, whose sacrifices led to the passage of anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While he is painfully aware of the high unemployment rate among African 
Americans, Davidson said, he won't tolerate discrimination at Surface 
Protection Industries Inc., a $46-million-a-year paint and specialty coatings 
enterprise just east of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when there are openings among the 200 or so positions at SPI, he said, "We 
make a very bold statement when we advertise for employees: 'We strongly 
suggest that both women and minorities apply.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Roman presides over Film Roman Inc., one of the country's largest 
independent animation studios and producer of such popular TV shows as "The 
Simpsons" and "Garfield and Friends," as well as theatrical releases such as 
"Tom and Jerry -- The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 A former grape picker from Fresno, the Latino animator worried more about 
artistic talent than gender or ethnicity as he built his 10-year-old North 
Hollywood-based company into a $30-million-a-year business. 
</P>
<P>
 He realizes that drawing ability knows no ethnic or gender boundaries, and how 
Film Roman has become a sort of rainbow coalition of animators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have African Americans, we have Latinos, women managers and directors -- 
it breaks out all different ways," Roman said. "The only way we can judge 
people is by their talent and ability, nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he does espouse a different sort of affirmative action in his choice of 
summer interns. Talent being relatively equal, Roman says, he'll select a 
person who comes from a small school or town, someone who has "less of a chance 
to be exposed to opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen years ago, Roman used that criteria to select Jim Schuman, a 
talented white artist from a small Pennsylvania town. Today, Schuman is Roman's 
storyboard supervisor on "Bobby's World," a popular TV series on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Roman took on three Los Angeles-area youths as interns. While 
they were "very rough around the edges," they were hard-working and eager to 
learn, he said. All three have been kept on, including a Latino man and a white 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel rewarded just by their progress," Roman said. "Believe me, it's a 
feel-good situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like their white counterparts, minority business owners face all manner of 
pressures that make it tough to succeed in the best of times. But experts say 
the companies that quickly realize that a diverse work force is good for 
business are in the best position to compete in changing marketplaces at home 
and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Mack, president of the 72-year-old Los Angeles Urban League: "It's 
not just a matter of doing black kids a favor or Latino kids a favor or poor 
kids a favor. It's in our best collective economic interest to make sure that 
diversity becomes a given in the workplace."

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; TEST YOUR DIVERSITY IQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a chance to test your diversity-etiquette IQ by matching your answers 
against those of our experts in this multiple-choice test. Not everyone will 
agree with the answers our experts have provided. Clearly, there often is no 
right or wrong answer. Still, we offer this tentative road map to the evolving 
new manners of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 1. A woman in your office is very private about her personal life. You suspect 
she's a lesbian, but you want her to know that's OK with you. So you: 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Tell a few lesbian jokes to provoke comment 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Invite her out for a drink to talk about it 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Mind your own business 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. She has every right to keep her personal life as private as 
she wants to, and many lesbian and gay men in the workplace have reason to be 
fearful of their sexual orientation becoming known. However, if you are 
supportive and she's ready to talk about it, she will. You cannot force the 
issue. As for the other two choices, the first option could be construed as 
harassment, and inviting her out for a drink might also be construed as sexual 
harassment, whether you're a man or a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Your male boss has taped a photo of a scantily clad woman from a lingerie 
catalogue on the wall of his office cubicle. Each time you confer with him, you 
are forced to see this photo, which you find inappropriate for the workplace. 
What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Put up a Chippendale's male dancer poster 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Talk to him about it 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Talk to his supervisor about it 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is B. Our experts recommend using the most informal method 
initially. You might say, "That photo makes me uncomfortable, and I'd 
appreciate it if you took it down." If talking individually to him doesn't 
work, you could ask him to meet with a group of women co-workers to show that 
you are not the only one who finds the picture offensive. Do not post your own 
poster; you do not want to escalate the situation by stooping to his level. 
</P>
<P>
 3. You are an executive in a medium-sized company. Lately you have been 
hearing a lot of grumbling and complaints about Susan, a mid-level manager. 
After some investigation, it becomes apparent that Susan is not doing her job, 
although there's no smoking gun that would allow you to fire her immediately. 
Plus, you have another problem: Your company needs to show that its management 
ranks include a certain percentage of women and minorities, and Susan is both. 
Still, you are increasingly worried about flagging morale. What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Fire Susan 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Ignore the situation; eventually it will go away 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Explain to the staff why firing Susan would cause a problem 
</P>
<P>
 * D. Talk with Susan 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is D. In fact, our experts say not talking with Susan on a regular 
basis could have caused the problem in the first place. Part of your job 
includes providing employees with feedback about how to improve their 
performance. As a boss, you have a responsibility to develop her talents and 
communicate with her regularly so things don't degenerate to the point where 
you have to fire her. However, if after talking and coaching Susan, you 
conclude that she is still not performing up to company standards, fire her and 
document it. Otherwise, you would be supporting an incompetent person to the 
detriment of everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 4. You are a white male. Several new positions have been created at your 
company, but the informal buzz is that they are being reserved for "a certain 
type of person." You want to apply but fear that you are not the right color or 
gender. How do you handle the situation? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. You ask your boss whether you should apply 
</P>
<P>
 * B. You let it slide and complain to your colleagues in private that white 
men just don't stand a chance at this place 
</P>
<P>
 * C. You apply 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is A. Our experts advise being as direct and upfront as possible in 
this situation. Tell your boss you are interested in the position but that you 
have heard the job may be reserved. Then ask whether it's appropriate for you 
to apply. If you have a good boss, he or she will be honest in answering. The 
boss has a responsibility to tell you whether the job is reserved and why. The 
boss may tell you, "We need a person of that gender or race in this company 
because we realize we need different points of view and voices as we make our 
business decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 5. You are a woman working in a mostly male office. You feel shut out of 
social interactions with your colleagues and bosses because the men cluster 
together at every opportunity to discuss sports. You couldn't be more bored by 
the topic, but you realize you are missing important opportunities to schmooze 
and bond socially with higher-ups. You also have a nagging feeling they are 
doing this to exclude you. You should: 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Seethe silently 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Bone up on sports so you can take part in this important ritual 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Say something 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. You don't want to stop men from enjoying their sports 
confabs, but you also want to feel included and to reap the benefits of these 
informal relationships. You might say, "Hey, I'm really not interested in 
sports, but I'd like to be included in conversations, so can we find some other 
topic in common that we can discuss?" The trick is not to imply that the men 
are behaving badly, which will only alienate them, but to make it clear what 
your needs are and that you want to feel included. 
</P>
<P>
 6. You work with a person of color. You like this person and want to become 
more friendly but feel awkward in conversation. You're not sure how to refer to 
him or her. As a black? African American? Nor are you sure how to refer to 
Mexican Americans. By that term or Hispanic? Chicano? Latino? What is the 
appropriate and sensitive way to proceed? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. You play it safe and avoid the topic 
</P>
<P>
 * B. You float a term like a trial balloon and wait for the person's reaction 
</P>
<P>
 * C. You ask the person what he or she would like to be called 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. The reason you feel uncomfortable is because in our society 
we think it's inappropriate to introduce and discuss such topics. You might 
tell your colleague that while you feel awkward about being so blunt, you are 
bringing up the subject so you can learn. This sets the tone for further 
communication and dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 7. You are Japanese American. Your boss and some of her colleagues are 
discussing where to go for lunch. They want Chinese food. Your boss sees you 
and exclaims happily, "Let's ask May! She'll know." You: 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Say, "Why don't we ask a Chinese American person; I'm Japanese American." 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Make an ethnic joke 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Say, "How would I know?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is A. Don't assume your boss is a racist, but don't let it pass 
unregarded. Take the middle ground. Try to engage your boss in a conversation 
that will educate her.  
</P>
<P>
 8. You're walking into your office building when you see someone who is 
apparently partially paralyzed struggling to open the door. You: 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Rush up and hold the door open 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Stand back and wait for the person or go to another door to avoid the 
situation 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Ask if the person would like help 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. Don't make any assumptions -- ask instead. When people see 
someone with a disability, they often assume they don't have to ask for 
permission to help. But that is condescending. However uncomfortable it may be, 
ask first.  
</P>
<P>
 9. You are a black female manager. Yesterday you were having lunch in a 
restaurant with a colleague when you overheard a conversation between Brad, one 
of your young, white, male employees, and his lunch companion. Brad was 
complaining vehemently about the lack of opportunity for white men in your 
group. He said all the recent promotions have gone either to women or people of 
color, and he threatened to see an attorney because he believes he is a victim 
of reverse discrimination. What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Stop by Brad's table on the way out to say hello 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Ignore what you heard because Brad was on his own time 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Enroll Brad in the company's next diversity training workshop 
</P>
<P>
 * D. Talk to Brad about what you heard 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is D and possibly C. Although it might be easier to ignore what you 
heard, the situation should be handled in a more direct way. Talk to Brad and 
explain that you inadvertently overheard his conversation and ask him to share 
more of his thoughts and opinions with you. 
</P>
<P>
 Many white men today feel "out of the loop" and passed over for promotions. 
Some also fail to see women and people of color as individuals, instead 
focusing on them as representatives of groups that are taking something away 
from them because of affirmative action programs or government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In your talk, try to help Brad explore why he's not being promoted and others 
are. Also try to help him realize that he is still valued as a member of your 
staff. It is your job to help Brad see that diversity is a workplace reality 
that will not go away. You could send Brad to a diversity training course, but 
this should not be seen as a punishment, and it must be reinforced by 
discussions before, during and after the training. 
</P>
<P>
 10. You're a male employee who's receiving love notes from a female co-worker. 
She wears low cut blouses, leans over your desk, brushes up against you 
whenever she gets a chance. Everyone in the office thinks it's a joke, 
including your boss, but you're not laughing. You've already told her to stop, 
but she won't. What should you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Complain to a co-worker and find a way to retaliate 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Go to your boss, even though he thinks the whole thing is a joke 
</P>
<P>
 * C. File an EEOC complaint 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is B. You need to go through your direct supervisor first, even if 
he thinks it's a joke. You should also put your complaints in writing so there 
will be a paper trail. Your complaint will then have to make its way up the 
ladder through the company. It is necessary to follow the chain of command and 
exhaust in-house remedies before seeking outside action.  
</P>
<P>
 11. Maria is a Latina being interviewed for a corporate position. She feels 
the interview is going well. As it winds down, Maria's prospective boss says: 
"Gee, I really admire your ambition. It must have been tough for you to leave 
your roots behind in order to succeed in the business world." How should Maria 
respond? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Let it pass, fearing that if she calls him on his racist comment, she 
won't get the job 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Make a snide comment back 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Regardless of whether Maria gets the job, she should remind him of what 
he said and explain why she found it upsetting 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. Whether Maria gets the job or not, she should tell her 
interviewer afterward that she was offended. Of course, this is a measured 
risk. Sometimes, when unpleasant comments are made, one has to ask: "Is this a 
battle I want to fight?" You can win the war, but you can't win every battle. 
On the other hand, Maria may decide she doesn't want to work at a company where 
people feel free to make such comments. 
</P>
<P>
 12. You are a woman who regularly attends management meetings that are 
dominated by men. One of the men has a penchant for telling sexist jokes. He 
thinks they're funny; you find them offensive. What should you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Say nothing and hope it doesn't happen again, but secretly prepare your 
own sexist jokes aimed at men 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Boycott the meetings 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Challenge the man and his joke. Say, "I don't believe this is happening 
in this room and I find it offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * D. Go to the boss 
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways to handle this common office problem. One choice is C, 
challenging the joke teller. However, our experts say that if the man persists 
in telling such jokes, complaining to the boss is the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 13. You supervise a group that is composed of three-person teams. Today, one 
of your white employees came in to talk to you about two other team members. 
She says they frequently speak Spanish when the three of them are working 
together and she feels left out. She also thinks they are talking about her. 
She wants you to stop them from speaking Spanish during working hours. You: 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Tell her you think she's overreacting 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Have a group meeting and talk to all of your employees about the issue 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Agree to the employee's request and issue a written memo saying that only 
English will be spoken in the workplace 
</P>
<P>
 * D. Talk to the three people involved 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is D and possibly B. Although you cannot stop the two employees 
from speaking their native language, you can talk about the impact of speaking 
in a language that other team members don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also be helpful to determine if there's a valid reason for their 
choosing to speak Spanish on the job. Often, employees find it more convenient 
to communicate work problems in the language they are most comfortable with. If 
these employees are not fluent in English, perhaps you should provide language 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 The white employee's complaint is not unusual. She feels left out and assumes 
that the other two people are talking about her. You should make it clear that 
you are not forbidding the employees to speak in their native language, but 
rather asking them to include her and be sensitive to her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 14. John is a 30-year-old black man who has worked in your group for three 
years. He has an MBA from one of the best business schools in the country and 
is one of your top performers. An opportunity for a promotion just came up in 
the corporate office, and you recommended John for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague in the corporate office has other thoughts. Although he is 
complimentary of John's work, he doesn't feel John is "right for the job." The 
problem is that John is viewed as arrogant and cocky. Further, John ruffled a 
few feathers when he challenged the company president about his commitment to 
diversity during an open forum meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Your colleague said he would interview John but offered little hope that John 
would get the job. He even hinted that you'd be jeopardizing your own career by 
sponsoring John. What should you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Sponsor John for the position and let him take his chances during the 
interview 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Heed your colleague's warning. After all, you don't want to put your 
career in jeopardy 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Sponsor John but give him some coaching before the interview 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. You should give John as much help as possible in assessing 
whether this is the right job for him, as well as in preparing for the 
interview. It would probably be inappropriate for you to share what your 
colleague said, but it might be useful to give John feedback on how some people 
perceive him. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of a manager's job is to support their employees and act as sponsors or 
mentors, which often involves giving feedback based on subjective information. 
You should be prepared to talk to John about your own view of his work and his 
behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Assessment of someone's self-confidence is often based on other feelings we 
have about the person. Minority men have complained that their self-confidence 
is perceived as arrogance, while the same trait is viewed more positively in 
their white colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
 If you feel John's self-confidence is unnecessarily inflated and unseemly, he 
needs to hear this and have the opportunity to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 15. You are a corporate manager interviewing applicants for a marketing job 
that would include some travel and putting on seminars. One of the applicants, 
Mel, uses a wheelchair. You have concerns about whether his disability would 
interfere with the job requirements. You want to bring up the subject but 
aren't sure how to handle it. You: 
</P>
<P>
 * A. Level with Mel, telling him that despite his qualifications, you worry 
that his disability will affect his ability to do the job 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Ignore the issue, thank Mel and put his application in the circular file 
</P>
<P>
 * C. Ask Mel to describe how he would handle the job on a daily basis 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is C. With reasonable accommodation, 90% of all jobs can be done by 
90% of all working-age people with disabilities. Chances are that if Mel is 
qualified, his disability will pose no problem.  
</P>
<P>
 You should focus on Mel's experience, qualifications and ability to do the 
job, not his disability. But don't be afraid to discuss in an open, 
straightforward manner how he would approach his job duties and what 
accommodations, if any, might be necessary. Under the federal Americans With 
Disabilities Act, answer B would constitute discrimination. Answer A could be 
discriminatory. The Diversity IQ Experts

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; A MODEST MEMO TO MANAGEMENT; DO ME NO FAVORS, TELL ME NO 
LIES

 TO: Management 
</P>
<P>
 FROM: An Employee of Color 
</P>
<P>
 RE: Workplace Diversity 
</P>
<P>
 One of the enduring -- and erroneous -- assumptions I've encountered as a 
racial minority in the corporate workplace is the smug certitude that I exist 
in my position for some reason other than the most obvious -- that is to say, 
my job performance. It was true in the early 1970s, when I entered the work 
force, and it remains true today. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an absurd Catch-22. Because if I am not competent, but you hire me anyway 
(solely to satisfy someone's need for a more diverse-appearing staff), you're 
doing yourself no favor. And if I am competent and you hire me only because I'm 
a minority, you are not doing me one, either. Because in that case, I probably 
already deserved the job more than some of the non-ethnic people who were also 
in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Most African Americans who have integrated American workplaces (and I dare say 
this is true of Latinos, Asians, Native Americans and other racial minorities 
as well) have had this drummed into us since childhood: "If you want to succeed 
Out There, you will have to be five (10, 15 . . . pick your ratio) times more 
prepared than the whites." Our parents knew that the playing field in the 
integrated world was not level, and they weren't holding their breath for 
anyone to even out the corporate parquet before we got there, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But being competent doesn't prevent us from being exposed to management's 
patronizing suppositions that we need more help, guidance or supervision than 
our white peers (some of whom have less experience). 
</P>
<P>
 In one of my first jobs with a household-name publisher of book series, a prim 
research chief blithely pointed to a seat directly outside her door when I 
asked where my desk would be. "Right next to me," she chirped, full of faux 
cheer. "That way I can keep an eye on you." (Why, I wondered? Was she worried 
that I would pilfer the pencils if I weren't in her direct line of sight?) 
</P>
<P>
 Such offhanded offenses are still committed daily. Those of us who struggle to 
perform in the integrated marketplace often do so in the face of subtle racism 
that drains one's energy and enthusiasm for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Some of us self-destruct. (What company doesn't have its 
apocryphal story of a minority staffer who loses it -- seemingly suddenly and 
without reason -- and accuses the corporation of trying to do him in, sometimes 
via a kamikaze memo or public utterance?) 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us burn out. (I know a brilliant woman with an Ivy League degree who 
spent a year as a secretary "because I wanted a job where I knew why they were 
going to treat me like crap -- because I'm a typist -- instead of wondering all 
the time if they're being condescending because I'm not one of them.") 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us turn inward or become schizophrenic. ("Hey, I put on my white-boy 
suit before I leave for work and become a black man when I cross my front door 
at night.") And some of us, many of us, actually, perform our jobs with 
competence and even distinction despite the slings and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright Lorraine Hansberry ("A Raisin in the Sun") once confided to her 
friend James Baldwin, "I love being black, Jimmy, but it can be terribly 
inconvenient." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who is black and has spent time toiling in the integrated workplace 
knows exactly what Hansberry meant. And anyone who knows what she meant will 
also know that, judging from the past, it will still be inconvenient to be 
black or Asian or Latino or Native American in the predominantly white 
workplace for the predictable future.

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; SEPARATING HYPE FROM REALITY; A RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOK 
CAN SERVE AS A GUIDEPOST TO AMERICA'S BEST MINORITY HIRERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Andrew Boisseau, a black graduate of the University of New Orleans, was 
recruited in the early 1970s to work for South Central Bell Telephone Co., he 
had to accept on faith that the company would provide a hospitable environment. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, in those days, minorities who were invited into previously 
restricted workplaces by companies pursuing new affirmative action goals were 
definitely entering the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, corporate America has a track record -- a paper trail of 
reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, statistics kept for 
various government procurement programs and even court records -- that 
job-seekers can consult when weighing offers. Such public records provide much 
of the basis for "The Best Companies for Minorities," a recently published book 
touted as a guide for minority job-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 The book singles out 86 U.S. firms -- fewer than 15% of the more than 600 that 
the author said he reviewed -- as offering a friendly, nurturing, 
career-enhancing environment for minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by New York lawyer and business consultant Lawrence Otis Graham, the 
book analyzes some of the same factors -- including minority hiring, retention 
and advancement -- used by Black Enterprise magazine in a 1992 rating of the 
best companies for blacks. Still, it is the first guide to offer a 
comprehensive review of the complete corporate environment -- from entry-level 
and blue-collar jobs to the corporate suite -- for all minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, who gained notoriety after he penned a first-person expose in New York 
magazine of racism at a Connecticut country club, said he wrote the book to 
help minority job-seekers separate affirmative action hype from performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, he said in a recent interview, is for minorities who want a 
satisfying career, not just a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of minorities graduating from college or changing jobs simply need to 
know this information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A guide such as Graham's might be useful, said Wesley Poriotis, a principal in 
Wesley Brown & Bartle, a New York-based executive search firm specializing in 
helping corporations achieve diversity in high-level jobs. But such reviews can 
also be superficial, said Poriotis, who recommends that minority job-seekers be 
prepared to do their own extensive research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't just look at the annual report. (Companies) will always include a 
variety of minority workers for PR," he said. "The first criterion a 
non-majority candidate should look at and ask about is whether the glass 
ceiling has been broken. Are there non-majority people in operations and 
finance? Are they near the power and the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 If a company has no minority members in such positions, any presentation of 
so-called high-ranking minorities is "just public relations pablum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority candidates should also seek information about the company's supplier 
network, to see if the company is serious about doing business with minorities, 
and should especially examine retention rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of companies have a great (minority) recruiting effort," Poriotis said. 
"But the new people coming in never meet the people leaving out of frustration 
and lack of mobility." 
</P>
<P>
 Retention and opportunities granted to minorities to run some of its operating 
units were among the reasons Graham included Boisseau's current employer, AT&T, 
on his "best" list. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based telecommunications giant, whose work force is about 23% 
minorities, was also cited in the Black Enterprise magazine survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, the Bell System has done a better job than most companies" in 
recruiting, promoting and retaining minority workers, said Boisseau, an 
Atlanta-based public relations manager for AT&T who describes himself as 
multiracial and multiethnic, a blend of Haitian, Native American and French 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to hiring and promotion, Graham said he also examined corporate 
diversity training programs and scholarships and contributions to benefit 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he cited San Francisco-based Chevron Corp. for its "Hispanic 
Initiative" to network with Latinos and for including a significant number of 
Asian, black, Latino and other minority students in its work-study and summer 
internship programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the eight California firms cited in Graham's book are based in San 
Francisco. Only two Los Angeles companies -- the O'Melveny & Myers law firm and 
Atlantic Richfield Co. -- met Graham's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Melveny, the firm of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, was cited 
because the firm had three black and four Asian partners among its 178 
partners, and 13 blacks, 12 Latinos and 19 Asians among its 360 associate 
attorneys at the time of Graham's study. Graham said Arco, whose work force is 
about 20% minority, has appointed minorities to "several high-ranking 
management positions. 
</P>
<P>
 (The Black Enterprise magazine list included no California-based firms.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably absent from Graham's list were Los Angeles-based defense firms -- 
which have significant employment in Southern California as well as substantial 
ties to the federal government through their aerospace contracts -- and the 
region's high-profile entertainment concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The only defense firm on the list is Cleveland-based TRW Inc., which has 
operations in the Southland. Sony Corp.'s New York-based Sony Music 
Entertainment made the list, but its Hollywood motion picture studios, Columbia 
and TriStar, did not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he did not exclude any industry group in his review. But despite 
being federal contractors under affirmative action mandates, Graham said that 
when he looked at defense firms, most "just did not have the numbers" of 
minorities.  
</P>
<P>
 He said his list includes a number of consumer product companies -- including 
San Francisco-based Levi Strauss and Clorox -- because they tend to be "most 
responsible" due to the fact that minority customers are more aware of their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's book covers the years up to 1992 for most companies. Thus, Los 
Angeles companies, which were spurred to implement minority initiatives after 
the 1992 riots, may look better in subsequent reviews. Graham said he plans 
periodic revisions of the book.

WORK FORCE DIVERSITY; ARE THERE WORDS THAT NEITHER OFFEND NOR BORE?; IN THE 
BATTLE TO DO RIGHT, WE MUST CHOOSE OUR WORDS WISELY. BUT LET'S NOT JUNK UP THE 
LANGUAGE IN THE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The question the Reno Gazette-Journal's diversity committee put to a group of 
that city's leading gay and lesbian activists was fairly simple and innocuous: 
What do you want to be called? The answer was emotionally, politically and 
culturally charged -- and as diverse as the people in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyke and queer , both insults reclaimed from the lips of the jeering, were 
favorites among the young. Homosexual was shunned by most; it sounded too 
clinical, they said, like something transported via forceps and surgical 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, take that hypercharged question out of the diversity committee and into 
the workplace -- out of our latest laboratory for modern behavior and into the 
real world -- and finding appropriate, sensitive, mutually acceptable answers 
becomes even more difficult and fraught with danger, confusion and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you call the woman who sits beside you if her skin is a different 
color than yours? What words do you use when addressing a customer if his 
sexual orientation is not your own? How do you communicate with a brand-new 
client who is not like you? 
</P>
<P>
 The right answers can mean the difference between losing a market, a client, 
an employee, a lawsuit, a harassment claim or a job and navigating safely in 
the New Business Order, a place where words are weapons and their owners 
misfire on a regular basis. A place where it's often hard to be understood, no 
matter what your language is. "It is very clear that the traditional dominance 
of white males in the work force will continue to decline," says David Lewin, 
director of the UCLA Institute of Industrial Relations. "The demographics are 
too strong to reach any other conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1983 and 1993 alone, the percentage of white men in management 
declined from 63.5% to 53.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 
number of white women in the management ranks -- the greatest winners so far -- 
grew from 29.5% to 37.2%. Minority women and men rose more slowly in 
management, although their numbers did increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The results are far more sweeping than the numbers alone would indicate. As 
the "traditional dominance" of the old homogeneous order declines, the age-old 
set of rules governing language and behavior in the workplace splinters into a 
myriad of new and often conflicting ways of interacting with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity training, corporate America's hoped-for silver bullet, has done some 
good in bringing us face to face with each other, but it has caused some damage 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Washington State Ferry System, for example, where terms as innocuous as 
lady , yuppie and geriatric have been banned, "it's gotten so bad around here 
that we refer to black garbage bags as bags of color," one white quartermaster 
told the New York Times in one of those now-ubiquitous articles on how we do 
and do not get along -- with an emphasis on the do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Whom do you take as a role model in the fight not to offend? That's just as 
hard as picking the right word these days. On one end of the spectrum is a guy 
like rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, proud producer of a "gangsta rap" CD whose title 
mainly consists of one insult to African Americans and another to women of all 
colors.  
</P>
<P>
 At the other end, are institutions, such as Marquette University, that are 
pushing the blandness envelope too far. Marquette is the latest school to 
change the name of its sports teams so as not to offend Native Americans. A 
fine goal. The only problem is that their teams were called the Warriors -- a 
pretty generic term for guys with non-automatic weapons and frowns. 
</P>
<P>
 You could go for help to the raft of new dictionaries, books like "The 
Bias-Free Word Finder -- A Dictionary of Nondiscriminatory Language," or "The 
Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook." 
</P>
<P>
 In the former, you get such offerings as half a dozen gender-free alternatives 
to the word mailman . Mail carrier is there; femailman is not. In the latter, 
you get words like ambigenic , an alternative to non-sexist , and Animalcatraz 
, another word for zoo . 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where I personally draw the line. Yes, sensitivity is of the utmost 
importance. No, you don't have to junk up the language to do it. His/hers? 
Forget it. Poetess? Stick to poet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why is this all so hard anyway? Why are we still even having this 
discussion? In my darker moments, I think that we are all making this 
transition to basic human decency harder than it has to be. Is it really that 
difficult to treat our colleagues and customers with the respect that they 
deserve?  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, when global trade offered promises of riches for all, we spent 
big bucks learning to understand people who live a hemisphere away. There were 
classes on when to give gifts and hand out business cards, when to belch after 
a meal and how much food to leave on your plate. And we learned all that stuff 
to get along with people we would never see more than once or twice. Why, we 
could barely recognize the language then, and we still sold goods and made new 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow, this battle is much more difficult, perhaps because we face it 
every day, possibly because these are far more precarious times. So to those 
companies big and small making an effort, now struggling with the language of 
the New Social Climate, congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who have yet to begin such discussions, you have my sympathy, for 
they are very painful things. Still, it is better to have them under way; no 
matter how good we get at this, the talking will never be over.

ACTION'S OFF CAMERA IN GOP BATTLE FOR 69TH ASSEMBLY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no obvious winner or loser in the cable television debate taped late 
last week among the four Republican candidates running for the nomination in 
the 69th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 A few shots were fired, but compared to the sparks that have been flying among 
the Democratic candidates in the 69th District race, the television forum could 
have left the impression that the Republicans have been pretty low key. 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes is a classic local GOP struggle to win the nomination on 
June 7 and the right to challenge the Democrats in November for the only 
legislative seat they hold in Orange County, the one being vacated by 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who has opted to run for state 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes among the Republican candidates span the spectrum: party insiders 
versus the outsiders, conservatives versus moderates, well-financed campaign 
machines versus grass-roots organizations, a woman versus three men. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first Republicans in the race was Anaheim manufacturer Jim 
Morrissey, 64, who is considered by his rivals to be the "anointed" candidate 
because he is backed by party conservatives, particularly state Sen. Rob Hurtt 
(R-Garden Grove) and Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange). He labels himself 
the non-politician who can represent the interests of small businesses in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Martin Ageson, 40, whose one-man law firm represents small 
businesses, is a moderate Republican and former president of the Orange County 
Young Republicans. He was living four blocks south of the district when he 
decided to move to Santa Ana to enter the race because he felt the other 
candidates did not have leadership qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Buffin-Edge, 49, another moderate Republican and party volunteer, worked 
as a bank branch manager in the district for 18 years before retiring. After 
licking stamps and doing other chores as a party volunteer for other campaigns, 
she decided to begin what she calls her "bare roots" effort to take on the 
"good ol' boys" in the local party and in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth candidate, Virgel L. Nickell, 51, ran for the Assembly seat two 
years ago and lost in a bitter battle with conservative Republican Party leader 
Jo Ellen Allen. But his grass-roots campaign and tenacity have won him some 
respect, as well as the endorsement of the conservative California Republican 
Assembly and the Gun Owners Action Committee of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 If the political guns are pointed in any single direction, it is toward 
Morrissey, who started his run by lending his campaign $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's rivals accuse him of being hypocritical in a recent campaign 
letter to voters, which claimed, "I am not a career politician." 
</P>
<P>
 "He says it himself (in the letter) that he's backed by 23 Republican 
legislators. How is he going to stand up independently and vote independently?" 
Buffin-Edge said in an interview last week. "I can stand alone because I'm not 
backed by any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell also criticized the letter. "If he's not a politician, then how come 
all the politicians are endorsing him?" he wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ageson said Morrissey became the "pre-selected" candidate by Conroy and Hurtt 
before the field of candidates was complete and while the legislators thought 
the contest would only be between Morrissey and Nickell. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Morrissey has tied himself so closely to Conroy, the Orange 
assemblyman also has become an issue in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 When a state commission recently voted to increase the annual salaries for 
Assembly members from $52,500 to $72,000, Conroy said the raise was justified. 
Morrissey said that if elected, he would donate the pay increase to charity 
until the state's unemployment rate drops from 9.6% to 5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the taped debate, which is to be shown at various times on Comcast 
Cablevision of Orange County until the primary election, Ageson said Morrissey 
was copying a prior tactic used by Conroy. The problem with that pledge, Ageson 
argued, is that "this kind of promise is never enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 Ageson referred to Conroy's first Assembly campaign during a 1991 special 
election, in which Conroy said he would not accept an $11,000 pay raise given 
to legislators that year but instead pledged to donate it to charity. A 
spokesman for Conroy said the assemblyman donated the pay raise the first year 
he was in office, then began receiving it thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey defended his position during the television taping, noting that any 
pay raise that is rejected by a member is automatically returned to the 
Legislature's leadership.

<P>
 "To say that I would not accept it . . . would give this money to (the 
Democrat Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown to spend, because this money comes out 
of the budget for the Assembly," Morrissey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later interview, Morrissey said "sour grapes" was driving the criticism 
about the endorsements he has received from outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The legislators) are endorsing me because of my business background and 
because, of all four of us (candidates), I am the only one that can win in 
November," Morrissey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffin-Edge said Morrissey is not the only candidate with business experience. 
As a bank branch manager, she argued, she dealt daily with people trying to 
cope during recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people ask me, 'Do you really think you can make a change?' I am at 
least smart enough to keep my hand off of the Yes button on new taxes and on 
new regulations," Buffin-Edge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ageson, who has won endorsements from local officials in the district, said 
that while business retention is a top issue for the district, the problems 
facing the state require a cohesive strategy that includes finding solutions to 
crime and improving the education system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only one who's ever talked about the need for leadership," Ageson 
said during a separate interview. "(Morrissey) just wants to talk about being a 
businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell touts the grass-roots support he is receiving in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only going to be about 12,000 voters who vote in the primary," he 
said. "You go out and count my 1,000 yard signs and see where the voters are." 
</P>
<P>
 He also pledged that if elected, he would not change his telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have worked on Republican campaigns, and the day after the election, they 
change their phone number so that I can never get ahold of them."

KITTY CARE; WHEN A FELINE NEEDS A FRIEND, DANA POINT HARBOR GROUP STEPS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lazily stretching on a sun-drenched rock at Dana Point Harbor, Sally looks too 
pampered and contented to be an abandoned cat. 
</P>
<P>
 The cream-and orange-colored tabby loves being petted and scratched behind the 
ears. But try to pick her up, and she's all teeth and claws. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other members of the harbor's large colony of cats, Sally was once 
somebody's house pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they dumped her," said Joelle Bailey, one of about 10 local residents who 
voluntarily watch over discarded cats at the harbor. "These cats out here live 
such hard lives -- they pick up parasites and get killed by cars. . . . I don't 
know how people who dump their cats sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 10 years, this collection of compassionate housewives, business 
professionals and retirees has assumed the role of unofficial cat caretakers in 
the scenic harbor. Every day, rain or shine, one of them can be found feeding 
20 to 30 felines that live wild here. 
</P>
<P>
 But this group does far more than simply provide food. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the cats have been neutered by the caretakers, who pool their own 
money for the surgery. To provide shelter for the cats, group members knocked 
together several small wooden hutches and hid them among the rocks in the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 And most important, they spend many hours seeking adoptive homes for the 
harbor cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is that there are no cats down here," Bailey said. "My dream is that 
they all get adopted." 
</P>
<P>
 All the felines are given names -- Chelsea, White Legs, Saddle, Dirty Face, 
Lacey and Gray Mother, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of them doesn't show up for a feeding, the caretakers worry. When a 
harbor cat is found dead, usually crushed by a car, they grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cry and cry," Bailey said. "But when it's my turn to feed them, I'm back 
out there. The others still need to be fed." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hamil, a Laguna Beach veterinarian who is a past president of the 
California Veterinarians Assn., says that feeding stray cats is usually a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're deadly to songbirds," he said. "They can wipe out a songbird 
population rather quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 But he agrees with the methods being used by the cat caretakers to control the 
harbor's feline population. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are really making quite a commitment," Hamil said. "Feral cats 
live rather short lives and they don't die well. These folks are doing a pretty 
good job keeping up the quality of life for these cats." 
</P>
<P>
 But many animal groups, such as the Humane Society, are conflicted on what to 
do about the cat predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double-edged sword," said Jennifer Shaw, head of volunteers for the 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the South Bay. "These cats 
should not be on the street and some human societies feel you should trap and 
euthanize them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see both sides myself because the life of a cat on the street is incredibly 
hard," Shaw said. "But I'm a cat person and I understand why these people are 
feeding cats." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay society ran a feral cat colony program for two months in 1992 
that donated money for neutering. But they were forced to stop because of the 
overwhelming volume of requests: 1,400 cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers in charge of Dana Point Harbor say they have no problems with the 
cat caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen animals dumped in every public facility I've ever worked in," said 
Mark Carlson, supervising ranger for the harbor beaches area. "My personal 
opinion is that these people are doing a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other places in Orange County where people have banded together to 
protect abandoned cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamil is in contact with a group in Laguna Beach that works with felines in 
Heisler Park. Another consortium of caretakers operates near Corona del Mar 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although everyone pitches in to feed, members often have their areas of 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are feeders, trappers, health caretakers," Hamil said. "These people 
need to cooperate with each other and they do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point group is independent of the city's Animal Rescue Foundation, a 
private organization dedicated to finding homes for stray animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a common goal, caring for animals, ARF recently agreed to help the 
harbor caretakers with medical expenses for cats that are sick or need to be 
neutered. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are doing a job for which they not only should be recognized, 
but paid for," said Glenda Rosen, president of ARF. "They make a difference in 
the lives of those cats." 
</P>
<P>
 The harsh reality of existence for a domestic cat that is dumped by its owners 
is this: "There are no exact statistics available, but they only live a few 
years," Hamil said. "They are susceptible to fight wounds, parasites and 
illness that are not treated. Most will die from being hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Household pets are also not prepared to battle for existence alongside wild 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the end result of a throwaway mentality," Hamil said. "I think cats 
deserve a better life than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey has horror stories galore about cat dumping. Three declawed Siamese 
cats were recently left in the harbor, completely unable to defend themselves 
against other cats or some of the other wild creatures, such as coyotes, who 
roam the fringes of the harbor. One of the Siamese soon died under the wheels 
of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Simon, a 14-year-old tabby slowly dying of kidney disease 
when he was abandoned by his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Simon survive, with the help of a veterinarian paid by the harbor 
caretakers, but Bailey found an 11-year-old boy named Matthew to adopt the 
aging cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have Simon's picture in a frame at home," she said. "On the frame is the 
phrase, 'Can rescuing one animal out of thousands really make a difference? It 
did to this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in adopting a harbor cat can contact Bailey at (714) 
498-2650.

CYCLE MURAL SWITCHES GEARS ON GRAFFITI-SCARRED BIKE TRAIL WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA and LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paint-splashed teen-agers Glynn Ritterbusch and Maya Trianbuck spent their 
Sunday morning with a group of people making their mark on a bridge support 
along the Santa Ana River. But this was art, not graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the taggers will respect this because it's someone's work of art," 
said Ritterbusch, 18, nodding toward the brightly colored mural of five 
bicyclists on the gray, once graffiti-scarred wall that's within eyeshot of 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts quickly earned accolades from riders passing by on the Santa Ana 
River bike trail, who let out appreciative shouts of "all right!" and saluted 
the artists with the thumbs-up sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here feels like we've made a commitment to this," said Trianbuck, 
17, who along with Ritterbusch, had flecks of pink, turquoise, black and purple 
paint scattered about the hands and clothes. "I think it's good, especially for 
teen-agers, to do something positive for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The twosome from S.E.L.F. Alternative High School in Irvine are among a group 
of high school students -- some previously in trouble for tagging -- who are 
turning their talents to creating mural art. Their efforts are part of a 
growing program known as Operation Clean Slate, which includes graffiti cleanup 
as well as the new creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Howard, a math teacher at Orange County Juvenile Hall who started 
Operation Clean State about a year ago, described his goal is to "get kids into 
some positive, creative ways of using their talents." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got fed up with all the graffiti," he said. "I didn't think there was 
enough going on to prevent it."  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project last summer, students at the private Claremont High 
School in Huntington Beach created two colorful panels with anti-graffiti 
messages: "Stop Tagging, Get a Life" and "Don't Tag on Me," a play on the 
historic American theme "Don't Tread on Me." Other students in Huntington Beach 
and Costa Mesa have also joined the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said he's spent at least $3,000 out of his own pocket to get the 
project moving, and hopes to expand the effort by attracting more sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike trail mural is the biggest so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing about 15 feet tall and spanning 40 feet, the mural features cyclists 
hunched forward, seemingly moving from the wall toward the bike trail. Fifteen 
students from the Irvine continuation school have spent their weekends in the 
past month working on the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 Art students at S.E.L.F. Alternative usually do an on-campus mural at the end 
of each year. This was something different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really fun," said Gayle Beard of Irvine, an art teacher at S.E.L.F. who 
is co-coordinating the project. "All the bikers going by yell out, 'Right on, 
that's cool.' It's been a good experience for my students." 
</P>
<P>
 Biker Oscar Quinonez of Santa Ana stopped near the mural on his first time by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice. I hope people leave it alone," Quinonez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaz Ferguson, the county's graffiti-abatement coordinator, is helping the 
group through the complicated bureaucratic hurdles necessary to complete the 
mural. While the bike trail is in county jurisdiction, the bridge is part of 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also chipped in the paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought a nominal amount of paint to help them get it done and do a quality 
job on it," Ferguson said. "In the long run, it should cost a whole lot less 
than what it would cost us to paint over graffiti on this spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a county crew goes out to paint over even the smallest amount of 
graffiti, it costs a minimum of $106, primarily in labor costs, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A project like Operation Clean Slate has other value as well, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're showing young people there are worthwhile things to do and that public 
agencies are going to give them support and encouragement," he said. "They are 
doing something that is a contribution to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa High School senior Ngoc Nguyen said she became involved "because I 
believed in what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard credits some of his own students at Juvenile Hall, some convicted 
taggers themselves, for sparking the idea for Operation Clean Slate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked them, 'What are the better ways to use your talents,' " he said. 
"They came up with murals." 
</P>
<P>
 He's since joined other county-sponsored anti-graffiti projects, and travels 
around the county talking to schoolchildren about the costs and consequences of 
tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Some get the message, others don't. 
</P>
<P>
 One former tagger, for example, took it upon himself to protect and maintain 
one mural, while another student involved in one of the projects was arrested 
for graffiti vandalism, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, taggers have kept their spray cans away from the bike trail mural, 
which is nearly done. The students will be putting on a graffiti-protection 
finish at the end, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Tran and Chris Huilochea are among a group of Cal State Long Beach 
students collecting response and documenting the project on videotape as part 
of a film class project. 
</P>
<P>
 They say response has been overwhelmingly positive. Passersby say the area 
already looks a lot better, and they are happy to see young people helping the 
community, Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, she said, have been saying, "Every little bit helps."

CARJACKERS SLAY FATHER OF 3 TO STEAL GLITZY AUTO; CRIME: DEPUTIES, NEIGHBORS 
VOW TO IDENTIFY THE TWO ASSAILANTS WHO SHOT A MAN IN WILLOWBROOK AND TOOK HIS 
ORNATELY DECORATED 1970 LOW-RIDER CHEVROLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old pharmacy worker, the father of three small children, was shot to 
death Sunday in Willowbrook by two men who carjacked his ornately decorated 
1970 classic automobile, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was first-degree murder," said Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Rodriguez. "If we find 
these guys, this will be a death-penalty case." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was identified as Terence Booker of Gardena. His relatives 
speculated that his car attracted the attention of the two carjackers because 
of its fresh paint, fancy tires and other elaborate decor. The two had 
evidently lain in wait and shot Booker after he delivered groceries to a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies released a photograph of the stolen automobile, a low-rider silver 
Chevrolet Impala, license number 160 UYU, and said they were looking for two 
young men who accosted Booker outside the apartment building on East El Segundo 
Boulevard at midmorning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society is so evil now," said Brooke Demmons, a cousin of Booker's. "Things 
happen so fast. It's the economy. People are scared to death, and they'll do 
anything for a nickel. They don't care if it's a murder. They'll take a life 
for a bowl of beans." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Demmons added, "If they do find out who did this, it will be (by) word of 
mouth in the community. They'll be caught by next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives said Booker was married, with children ages 4, 6 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker was alone when he was shot. "We've been talking to a few people," 
Rodriguez said, "but no one witnessed the actual shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it appeared that the victim was shot once just outside the gate to the 
apartment house as he returned to his car. He tried to run, and got almost all 
the way across the street before he collapsed and died. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators that one assailant jumped into Booker's car, and, 
followed by the other man in a blue 1980s Chevrolet Camaro, fled east on El 
Segundo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman called for the public's help in finding the suspects and 
described them as armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly three hours, Booker's body lay in the street, which was cordoned 
off to traffic, while investigators carefully went over the scene. Meanwhile, 
the friend to whom he had been taking groceries summoned Booker's relatives. 
Many of them arrived weeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sheriff's deputies, investigators and coroner's personnel tried to 
shield the body from view with sheets as they put it into a van, relatives 
wailed as they caught brief glimpses. Deputies warned them to stay on the curb 
as they pressed to get closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker's sister, Valoria, remarked in bitter tones as she watched 
investigators at work, "If you can't drive what you want to drive, all I can 
say is that we'll all end up driving buckets." 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby who had gathered denounced the crime. "If the cops can't find out 
who did this, I'm going to return here myself and talk to people," said one man 
who was watching but did not give his name. "I think someone will know who 
these guys were."

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: THE BEST SAFETY DEVICE -- AN ALERT DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most motorists, the morning commute is a half-hour of mental cruise 
control. About the only time they think about highway safety is in the frantic 
minutes before a license renewal test or during the monotonous hours of traffic 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Anderson thinks about it all the time -- and wants the rest of us to as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the state Office of Traffic Safety, Anderson is charged with 
making the highways and byways of California safer for motorists. He does this 
by making the motorists safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the California Highway Patrol officer he once was, Anderson travels the 
state dispensing simple advice on how to drive safely and, more recently, how 
to avoid driving altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first chaotic weeks after the Northridge earthquake, Southern 
Californians seemed to listen. CHP officers noticed that people paid a little 
more attention to their driving, were a little more courteous, a little more 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as the detours grow familiar and damaged roadways bounce back to life, 
many angels of the road are slipping back into their bedeviling habits. 
</P>
<P>
 They swerve. 
</P>
<P>
 They weave. 
</P>
<P>
 They apply eyeliner using the rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 They eat. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Anderson, they do just about everything except what they should: 
Pay attention to where they are going and what is going on around them. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Southern Californian who now lives in Sacramento, Anderson admires 
the skill with which millions of motorists maneuver the region's labyrinth of 
freeways. While he acknowledges that "Southern Californians are some of the 
best drivers in the world," they can still do a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 Just under 300 people died in car accidents last year on the streets of Los 
Angeles alone. And that doesn't count the freeways. Or roadways in smaller 
cities such as Burbank, Santa Monica or Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car is a means of travel and of pleasure," Anderson said, "but it can be 
a lethal weapon if used improperly." 
</P>
<P>
 While car companies tout their latest safety features -- from automatic seat 
belts to air bags to anti-lock brakes -- Anderson devotes energy to something 
less technical and less tangible, what he calls the "human dynamics" of 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 All the technology in the world cannot replace an attentive, careful and 
defensive driver, Anderson said. It sounds simplistic, like something straight 
out of a high schooler's driver training manual. 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers bear Anderson out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roughly 90% of traffic fatalities are the result of human error. "People 
doing things other than driving contribute to an awful number of crashes," 
Anderson said. He prefers "crash" to accident because, as he sees it, accidents 
cannot be avoided. Crashes can. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rubbernecking is the single greatest cause of unnecessary traffic 
congestion. Put another way, most Californians spend more time in traffic than 
they do on vacation. Anderson acknowledges that there is no way to change 
people's morbid fascination with wrecks at the side of the road. But for 
everybody's sake, they should just keep driving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tailgating is the leading cause of auto accidents -- injuring about 11,000 
Californians each year. Anderson suggests leaving a couple of car lengths 
between vehicles. It may not always be easy on a crowded freeway, but Anderson 
said it is always a wise policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drivers who change lanes frequently have more accidents than other drivers. 
And they don't generally pick up any extra time. "I always end up passing 
them," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral to Anderson's story is to think -- not only about the road ahead, 
but also about how to leave the road behind. The safest -- and cheapest -- way 
to work is to stay at home and commute on the electronic highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It reduces stress, increases productivity and helps clean up the air. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Anderson: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommuters reduce their car travel by about 20%. Just a 10% decrease in 
car travel can substantially reduce freeway congestion. Commuter traffic alone 
accounts for nearly 30% of all the vehicle emissions belched into the air each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 * If 5% of Los Angeles commuters worked from home one day a week, they would 
save 9.5 million gallons of gasoline each year and dump 94 million fewer tons 
of pollutants into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 * By telecommuting two days a week, the average Californian would save $165 
each month. As it is, the typical Californian spends about $450 a month 
commuting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommuters are more productive than their office-bound colleagues. In Los 
Angeles County, overall productivity ratings of telecommuters increased 34% and 
absenteeism dropped 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the electronic highway, there is no risk of getting pulled over.

A DREAM IS DRY-DOCKED; DEJECTED MERCHANT MARINERS RETURN TO L.A. AS D-DAY 
VOYAGE IS SCRAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A restored World War II cargo ship and its crew of gray-haired former merchant 
marine seamen made a somber return to Los Angeles Harbor on Sunday, a week 
after their planned 9,000-mile voyage to France was scrapped because of engine 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the triumphant return many expected when the Lane Victory and its 
crew -- almost all of them in their 60s and 70s -- steamed out of Los Angeles 
Harbor on April 29 bound for celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the 
D-day landing on the Normandy coast of France. 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of friends and family members gathered under cloudy skies at Berth 
53 in San Pedro to welcome the returning merchant marines, many of the Lane 
Victory's dejected crew members moped about the deck or leaned gloomily against 
the ship's railings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel horrible," said 3rd Mate Allen Thronson, 71, who hugged his daughter, 
Jennifer Underwood, after she marched up the ship's gangway to greet him Sunday 
morning. "That ship runs beautifully, and I don't see why we couldn't continue 
the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lane Victory developed engine trouble five days after leaving Los Angeles 
and limped into port in Acapulco, Mexico, on May 4. Several days later, the 
board of directors of the U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II, which 
owns the 455-foot ship, voted 4-1 to scuttle the trip and order the crew to 
return home to San Pedro. The ship returned under its own power. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays caused by mechanical problems would have made it nearly impossible for 
the crew to arrive in France in time for the June 6 ceremonies, said Joe 
Vernick, president of the veterans group. Also, the ship needed a custom-made 
part for the evaporator that converts salt water into fresh water, said chief 
engineer Pete Jacobelly, who flew back to Los Angeles from Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prudence demanded that it come back," said John O. Smith, 83, a member of the 
merchant marine veterans board who stood at the berth to welcome the crew back 
to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the ship's volunteer crew, including Capt. Bill Tilgh m an, 
disagreed. Last week, 34 of the 54 crew members signed a petition stating they 
wanted to continue the trip. In addition, two of the veterans group's board 
members who were aboard the Lane Victory said they were excluded from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt let down," said former merchant marine John Struyk, 72. He and his 
wife, Maryanne, both were aboard the Lane Victory when the trip was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Had all gone as planned, the Lane Victory would have steamed south through the 
Panama Canal to rendezvous near Bermuda with the Liberty ship Jeremiah O'Brien 
out of San Francisco. The Coast Guard required that the Lane Victory cross the 
Atlantic with another ship. 
</P>
<P>
 But oil leaked into one of the Lane Victory's two boilers as the ship neared 
Acapulco, and the trip was delayed. Although the leak was repaired at sea, the 
boiler needed to be cleaned with chemicals that were available only in port. By 
the time the work was completed, the rendezvous with the Jeremiah O'Brien would 
have been impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Tuesday, crew members were hoping that the Lane Victory could be 
escorted across the Atlantic by one of 14 Navy ships expected to make the 
voyage, said Clint Johnson, a member of the merchant marine veterans board. But 
those hopes were dashed when the Lane Victory -- following the board's orders 
-- left port in Acapulco on Wednesday to steam back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad they've returned," said Tina Richardson, 27, of Buena Park, who 
worried about the safety of her grandfather, Lee Chamberlain, and the rest of 
the ship's crew. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the trip to France has been scrapped, the merchant marines might yet 
make a voyage to celebrate the D-day anniversary. The ship has been invited to 
take part in a re-enactment of the Normandy invasion on the beaches of Santa 
Monica on June 1 with three other ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship will see other action, as well. The Lane Victory will be transformed 
into a Hollywood movie set for three days of filming later this month, said 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plans are small solace for the grizzled merchant mariners who began 
dreaming of making the voyage to Normandy back in 1992 after they restored the 
Lane Victory, and it took about 700 passengers on a daylong cruise to Santa 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the ship's crew members needed more than $1 million in fuel, 
equipment, supplies and cash to make the Normandy trip. After numerous delays, 
a $250,000 contribution by the Norris Foundation of Long Beach put the crew 
over the top.

D-DAY LANDING IN SANTA MONICA IS FRANCE'S WAY OF SAYING 'MERCI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troops are preparing to storm ashore at Santa Monica on June 1, but the 
invading force will be friendly and acting for a good cause -- history. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned landing on Santa Monica beach, to involve a World War II-vintage 
landing craft and veterans of the Normandy invasion, will be part of an 
elaborate commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-day called "Merci 
l'Amerique." Organized by the local French consulate with help from American 
veterans groups, the event is intended to thank America for helping to liberate 
France from the Nazis during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good occasion to say, 'Thank you' and 'I love you,' words the French 
don't use very often," said French Consul General Jean-Maurice Ripert. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphibious landing will be for real, albeit not on the scale of the 
original. About 40 soldiers will hit the beaches after disembarking from the 
landing craft, which was used on D-day. Half of those participating are 
expected to be actual D-day veterans -- now in their 70s -- who may or may not 
be able to squeeze into their old uniforms. Others will be active-duty 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to the realism, Ripert has asked the city of Santa Monica to declare 
the beach French territory for a day. City officials are mulling this one over. 
</P>
<P>
 The "invaders" won't encounter much resistance. The only firing will come at 
the start of the ceremony, when three blanks will be shot from the USS 
Copeland, a Navy frigate participating in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 At the real D-day invasion, about 160,000 Allied soldiers landed along a 
50-mile stretch of rugged Normandy coastline at dawn on June 6, 1944. 
Casualties were high, as the vulnerable soldiers wading ashore through the 
frigid Northern Atlantic waters were cut down by German fire. 
</P>
<P>
 As former Army Staff Sgt. Thomas McGowan recalls it, landing at Utah Beach was 
a nightmare. McGowan, now a Cheviot Hills resident, said all he could think of 
was getting to safer ground. "I immediately forgot everything I'd learned in 
school," he recalled in a recent interview. "I was so afraid, you can't 
imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McGowan fought his way through France with thousands of other Allied soldiers 
in what was called "Operation Overlord," liberating village after village as 
townspeople responded with bread and wine and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily decorated McGowan, left for dead after being shot and beaten by 
Germans, said he wouldn't miss the June 1 remembrance ceremony, which is set to 
start about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica is the only place outside of Normandy itself that will host an 
actual beach landing to commemorate D-day, Ripert said. California, he added, 
has all the right ingredients for a successful D-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the movie industry, crazy people and a beach looking west," he said, 
adding that he was undeterred by the fact that the Allies actually landed on 
north-facing beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripert has pushed forward with his plan even though his own government's 
support for the event -- expected to cost in the tens of thousands of dollars 
-- has been mostly symbolic. "We don't have a cent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For funds, he has turned for help to companies with a French connection, such 
as MGM Studios and Guess jeans. Another sponsor, Hotel Sofitel, is offering a 
free dinner for 250 D-day vets. The hotel's president, John Lehodey, was a 
young boy when his hometown of Avranches, France, was liberated by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the amphibious landing north of the Santa Monica Pier, the 
commemoration ceremony will feature a flotilla of ships offshore and vintage 
tanks and other military equipment and memorabilia on the sand. World War 
II-era planes will fly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The flotilla will include the Copeland, the French Navy frigate Prairial, the 
U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Bridge -- and perhaps the Lane Victory, a 
restored World War II Liberty ship that had been headed to Normandy but had to 
turn back because of engine trouble and arrived Sunday in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred D-day veterans will be honored at the Remembrance Ceremony. And 
French children wearing "Merci L'Amerique" T-shirts and carrying flowers will 
greet soldiers as they come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, Ripert said, the beach ceremony will be emotional and 
patriotic -- the kind of thing that will leave people misty-eyed and proud, no 
matter what their national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Though details of the program are still being worked out, Ripert promises 
national anthems, testimonies of D-day survivors and high-ranking military and 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary, "Victory at Sea," will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 If all that doesn't tug at the heartstrings, a lone bugler will close the 
ceremony at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony is being held five days before the actual D-day anniversary so 
participants can fly to France in time for the D-day ceremonies there. For 
retired Marine Capt. Joseph Smith, the far smaller scale of the Santa Monica 
event in no way diminishes its importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity to salute those individuals who kept the Free World 
free," Smith said. "If they had not been successful, we would not have the 
world we have today."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; REPORT ANALYZES RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials will unveil a report later this month that outlines ways of 
improving Seal Beach's recycling program, which debuted four months ago to 
mixed reviews from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is aimed at addressing some of the most frequent criticisms of the 
program: that extra containers cost too much and that the system does not 
adequately provide for the disposal of grass clippings and other forms of green 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the households in Seal Beach currently participate in the 
recycling program, including residents of Marina Hill and College Park East. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Town district was originally slated to join the program in July. But 
City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said the start-up date has been pushed back 
until the fall so that officials can further study how best to implement the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing recycling to Old Town could be tricky because the area includes 
apartment houses, small duplexes and larger homes. Some residents share their 
trash cans with neighbors, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who already participate in the recycling program have complained about 
the $8 fee charged to households that require more than two trash containers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials discussed the issue with Briggeman Disposal Service, which runs 
the program, and Bankston said the fee could be reduced to $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also fielded complaints from residents who said the program does 
not offer an effective way of discarding green waste from their back yards and 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve this problem, the city might offer a curbside pickup for green waste 
several times a year or designate days when residents can drop off clippings to 
the Seal Beach corporation yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is required by state laws to create a recycling program that reduces 
its waste deposits to landfills by 25% by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months into the program, the city has reduced its landfill deposits by 
about 19%. Bankston said he expects landfill use to decrease further as more of 
the city join the program. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; SAND TRANSFER SET TO BE MADE IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials said last week that a sand replenishment project on a beach 
south of the Seal Beach Pier is likely to begin in June, about a month later 
than originally scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed the delay in part on numerous approvals the project must 
receive from various state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the California Coastal Commission and several other state agencies 
approved the plan to dump more than 100,000 cubic yards of sand from a Santa 
Ana River flood control project onto Seal Beach's eroded coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project still requires the OK of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The 
city also needs to work with Caltrans to devise the route that trucks will 
follow when delivering sand from the river to Seal Beach, said City Manager 
Jerry L. Bankston. 
</P>
<P>
 The city originally expected to used about 150,000 cubic yards of sand. Now 
officials expect that only 120,000 cubic yards will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said the contractor should be ready to begin moving the sand by June. 
If the Corps of Engineers still hasn't approved the project by then, the city 
might have some of the sand brought to the beach and stored in mounds. The sand 
would then be spread onto the beach when the Corps grants approval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will cost the city about $500,000. It is aimed at replenishing a 
beach that has been slowly eroding for decades. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LOS AMIGOS URGING MORE LATINOS TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to get more Latinos who are registered to vote to cast their 
ballots, Los Amigos of Orange County has launched Proyecto Sufragio Efectivo 
(Effective Suffrage Project). 
</P>
<P>
 The project involves the publication of a bilingual application for an 
absentee voter ballot in Orange County-based Spanish-language newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope is to get more of the registered Latino citizens to cast their 
votes," said Galal Kernahan, a Los Amigos spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernahan said many Latinos do not vote because they have no time to go to the 
polls. So "voting by mail is a blessing for households in which hard-working 
adults cannot" cut their jobs to go to their polling places, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Hispana, a weekly Spanish language newspaper, last week devoted a third 
of a page to print the absentee voter application. The application, boxed in 
broken lines as an easy cut-out guide, explains in Spanish and English how to 
vote by mail, where to send ballots and who is eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Azteca News and MINIONDAS will print the same application this week, Kernahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 May 31 is the last day people can request to vote by mail to cast their 
ballots in the June 7 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernahan said Los Amigos will again urge Spanish language newspapers to print 
the applications before the Nov. 8 general election. "This is a way to be 
proactive." 
</P>
<P>
 He said members of Los Amigos, a group of Latino community leaders who address 
concerns facing Latinos, also are handing out absentee ballot applications to 
encourage more people to vote by mail.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DISNEY OBJECTS TO PLAN FOR 3 NEW HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. has expressed its objections to a hotel project near 
Disneyland, leading the project's representative to charge that the 
entertainment giant is trying to wipe out smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has sent a 16-page response to the city Planning Commission regarding 
plans by Tarsadia Inc., a Costa Mesa-based development firm, to build three 
hotels with a total of up to 834 rooms across Harbor Boulevard from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hotels already has received approval, but its one-year permit will 
lapse over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is scheduled to review Tarsadia's proposal today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Disney does not control the parcels involved, the hotels would be 
situated next to one of two massive parking garages planned for the $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort theme park and hotel project that Disney is thinking of 
building in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarsadia's plans are "seriously flawed" and the developers should be forced to 
include an environmental impact report, states the response from a San 
Diego-based lawyer for Disney, Marian Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would also allow more density than Disney is allowed for the new 
hotels it is proposing as part of the resort, which would be centered on an 
internationally themed Westcot park, Disney Development Director Doug Moreland 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank Elfend, Tarsadia's planning consultant, said Disney's "real concern 
is their desire to eliminate competition from small business." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Disney's call for a thorough environmental review is simply an 
attempt to slow the process, and that "their interests have always been 
economic in trying to stifle other development." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Disney's environmental report on its own project takes into 
account the proposed new hotels that Tarsadia would build. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreland, however, said Disney is not trying to stop development by others but 
only asking that it conform to the grand vision laid out for the Disneyland 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he said, he is concerned that Tarsadia is asking for zoning 
variances that would allow more signs than are currently permitted and smaller 
spaces between the buildings and the street, which would limit landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in favor of new development in the commercial area. New development is 
important for revitalization," he said, adding, "we are concerned about 
variances that would undermine all work that (the city) has been doing in the 
past five years." CHRIS WOODYARD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS TATTOO PARLOR ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight is scheduled to debate whether Huntington Beach 
should join a growing list of Orange County cities that use zoning and health 
codes to regulate tattoo parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach currently only has one commercial tattoo outlet, but the city 
expects more."With interest in tattooing on the increase, city officials have 
had numerous inquiries relating to operating tattoo establishments in 
Huntington Beach," Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said in a memo to the City 
Council last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg urged the council to adopt an ordinance regulating how and where 
tattoo parlors may operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, Dana Point, Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, Fullerton and Newport Beach 
already have zoning requirements or other types of restrictions on tattoo 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the memo, the City Council in August ordered an extensive staff 
study of tattoo regulations in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, city staff recommends that Huntington Beach create zoning 
regulations that would keep tattoo parlors from within 200 feet of any 
residential area, 500 feet from any church or educational institution, and 
1,000 feet from any site operated as an "adult business." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulations would also require that tattoo parlors only be 
allowed in areas zoned C2 (community business district) or C4 (highway 
commercial district). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the location-zoning regulations, the city is considering an 
ordinance that would govern health and operating standards in tattoo 
businesses. The proposal is based on a "model ordinance" suggested by the 
Orange County Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed health ordinance, among other things, would require sterilization 
of all tattooing equipment. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; UCI ULCER STUDY FOCUSES ON BACTERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recognition that many stomach ulcers are caused by bacteria, rather than 
stress or diet, a UC Irvine physician is launching a new study to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a combination of bacteria-destroying medications in treating 
ulcer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hooshang Meshkinpour, a UCI gastroenterologist, said the aim of the 
research project is to find the most effective method for healing ulcers and 
eradicating the bacteria, called H. pylori, which in recent years has been 
discovered to be responsible for 80% of gastric ulcers and 98% of duodenal 
ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 The research is being funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment, including medications, diagnosis and blood tests, is free to 
participating patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical research coordinator Cheryl Dutton said researchers are trying to 
recruit patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or symptoms of ulcers, 
such as unexplained upper abdominal pain that gets worse at night or when the 
stomach is empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more data we have, the better the study," Dutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, she said, ulcer sufferers take several kinds of medications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope is that out of this research will come a single pill that is easier 
for the patient to take and will work more quickly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to volunteer for the study should call (714) 456-5071. LESLIE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; IDEAS SOUGHT FOR DOWNTOWN AREA

<P>
 Local residents and business owners are being urged to be a part of a city 
study of the south side of downtown, which would help determine the area's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners will meet Saturday at the Fullerton Senior Center to hear residents 
voice their concerns and ideas for the area, which is south of Commonwealth 
Avenue and north of Truslow Avenue between Lemon Street and Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will tour the site on foot at 9 a.m. and return to the senior 
center to discuss goals and visions for the section of downtown, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area includes the city's transportation center, some residential 
neighborhoods and several commercial and industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 It has the potential to become a regional destination because of its proximity 
to large educational and cultural institutions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is being developed by city planners and urban designers who are 
asking the community to participate, said Gary A. Chalupsky, executive director 
of the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Public comments are "critical because there's no right or wrong. The question 
is, 'What do you want to see done there?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers could range from doing nothing to drastically redeveloping the 
area. Three other workshops will be scheduled later this year, Chalupsky said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; STUDENTS PAL AROUND WITH THEIR PEN PALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Their letters brought a smile to her lips, but their hugs brought her tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Hendry, 91, let the tears flow Thursday as she met for the first 
time the three Webber School pen pals whose letters have brightened her days at 
the Beverly Manor nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't they beautiful," said Hendry, seated on a wheelchair, a shawl draped 
over her shoulders, as she hugged each of the girls during a morning barbecue 
at the patio of the nursing home on Hospital Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendry and about a dozen other nursing home residents met 80 sixth-grade 
students from Webber School who are participating in a program to develop the 
students' writing skills while bringing cheer to nursing home residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the "Adopt a Grandparent" program, a student sends a letter at least 
once a week to a Beverly Manor pen pal. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of the nursing home's 92 residents, mostly in their late 70s or 
80s, participate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders from Webber School are 
participating in the program, said Richard Guinn, principal of Webber School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give the kids a reason to write," Guinn said. "This is one of 
the best reasons -- writing to people. The best thing is the students get to 
know how much joy they can bring to people they write to." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the pen pal program, the school held essay writing contests with 
Beverly Manor providing cash prizes to the three best essays from each grade. 
The essays were titled, "What My Grandparents Mean to Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the winners were Hendry's pen pals -- Lihn Le and Luz Heredia, both 
12-year-old sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really fun to have grandparents," Le said. "You learn a lot from them." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her own grandparents, who are Vietnamese immigrants, have taught her 
good manners, respect for elders and hard work. She began writing Hendry in 
December, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing her has helped me express my feelings," she said. "It makes you feel 
good that you're helping someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Heredia said she started writing to Hendry when she was in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has showed me pictures of her and her family," Heredia said. "She told me 
of places she has gone to. It's like having your own grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Hendry pen pal, 11-year-old, Elizabeth Strokhecker, said "I kind of 
feel sorry for her. No one visits her. She is so lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 Hendry, who came from Scotland more than 60 years ago, has no relatives in the 
United States. Her husband, Walter, died more than 10 years ago and an only 
child, a daughter, died as an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 In her younger days, Hendry sang in churches, and her husband was a 
professional Scottish dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she has an eye disease and uses a wheelchair, but Mary Campbell, Beverly 
Manor's activities director, said that Hendry still performs during social 
events at the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Hill, 77, said a boy has been sending her letters for the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get a letter from him, it always makes my day," said Hill, who has two 
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 But one student came away from the Thursday visit feeling sad. Carlos Mathus, 
11, learned that the elderly man he has been writing to since last year died 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He did find another grandparent to adopt, Mable Smith, 95, whom he found sweet 
and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be fun to write to her," Mathus said. BERT ELJERA

 A team of fourth-grade students from Valencia Elementary School took several 
awards during a recent countywide mathematics competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing against 23 other fourth-grade classes at the Orange County 
Mathematics Field Day held in Fountain Valley, the Valencia students won first 
place in mental math computation, along with second and third places in other 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia team, composed of Matthew Henry, Michelle Lee, Joanna Oster, Erik 
Sun and Jeffrey Kempler, studied for several months to prepare for the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids can go on to be the nucleus of the Laguna Hills High School 
academic decathlon team in a few years," said Councilman Randy Bressette, 
referring to the local academic team that has won state and national honors in 
recent year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the projects that won an award for the team was a statistical survey of 
upper-grade students, which was turned into a report that was judged at the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very proud of our fourth-grade math team," said Janice Mecham, a 
Valencia teacher who coached the fourth-graders. "They spent many hours 
preparing for the tournament." FRANK MESSINA

CURBSIDE L.A.: 'YOUS PICK 'EM' ORCHARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a sweet taste of Old California, there are still "you pick 'em" orchards 
across Los Angeles County where weekend harvesters can pluck from the choicest 
of fruit trees, fresh cherries or peaches and apricots, or the more exotic 
persimmons or Asian pears. Don't forget to pack a picnic lunch and bring your 
own boxes or bags. 1. PJK CHERRY FARM 
</P>
<P>
 * 45674 Copco Ave., Gorman 
</P>
<P>
 In a small valley among rolling hills -- only 15 minutes from Magic Mountain 
-- is a 20-acre peach and cherry orchard. Here, cherry season begins June 4, 
with 700 trees bearing Bing and black tartarian cherries, which are sweeter and 
smaller than Bings. Peach season starts about Sept. 20, according to ranch 
owner Paul Kish. Once you've picked your fill, at about $1 per pound, you can 
hike or fish at nearby Quail Lake. Orchard hours are from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Golden State Freeway north from Los Angeles and exit at Quail Lake 
Road. Turn right, go under the bridge, then turn right again at Copco Avenue. 
At the end of the road continue a little farther to the entrance and head 
toward the big barn. Call (818) 337-6498 or (805) 248-1177 after June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 2. MILLER'S CHERRY FARM 
</P>
<P>
 * 18540 Pine Canyon Road, Lake Hughes 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Miller, a retired makeup artist for the movie industry, and his wife, 
Sandy, a retired schoolteacher, tend to a variety of 250 cherry trees on their 
three-acre orchard. Tom prefers to sell his cherries to "people not in a hurry; 
and children and people in wheelchairs" are especially welcome because many of 
his trees' branches hang low. Customers are implored not to climb the trees or 
break the branches because the trees become susceptible to infection when 
scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Golden State Freeway north from Los Angeles to Lake Hughes Road, and 
turn right. Drive 22 miles to where the road ends at Elizabeth Lake Road. Turn 
left: Miller's Ranch is around the corner, about a quarter of a mile. Opens 
June 11, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Costs about $1.25 per pound. (805) 724-1728.  
</P>
<P>
 3. NESSA RANCH 
</P>
<P>
 * 38820 Bouquet Canyon, Leona Valley  
</P>
<P>
 A parade on June 4 inaugurates the cherry season in Leona Valley, where 15 
pick-your-own orchards can be found. Pick up a map at the general store or just 
follow the signs to find the orchards. Ranch owner Ken Striplin, like most 
other ranchers, provides ladders and buckets. Cherry season has begun at the 
60-acre Nessa Ranch. Juicy, ripe peaches and Asian pears will be ready to 
harvest in mid-August. Prices average $1 per pound. Open weekdays from 9 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call (805) 270-1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leona Valley cherry-picking hot line is (805) 266-7116.  
</P>
<P>
 Go north on I-5 from Los Angeles and take the Valencia Boulevard exit. Turn 
right (northeast) and go about four miles, then go left (north) to Bouquet 
Canyon, about 23 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 4. ZINK'S RANCH 
</P>
<P>
 * 35609 80th St., Littlerock 
</P>
<P>
 The aroma of the ripe apricot orchard on the Zink family's 12-acre ranch is 
delicious at the end of June. Apricots and peaches sell for 45 cents a pound. 
Asian and Bartlett pears begin to ripen the first week in August, and picking 
goes on for about a month. Bartletts sell for 25 cents a pound and Asian pears 
are about 65 cents a pound. Call (805) 944-1239. 
</P>
<P>
 Take California 138 (Pearblossom Highway) from the Antelope Valley Freeway and 
exit at 80th Street. Turn left (north) from Pearblossom Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 5. HERITAGE PARK 
</P>
<P>
 * 5001 Via de Mansion Ave., La Verne 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the park's 100-year-old Weber House are about 300 citrus trees. The 
self-serve harvest is meant to remind people of when the San Gabriel Valley 
boasted 40,000 acres of citrus groves and small farm crops, as well as to raise 
money for the park. Harvesters at the 1 1/2-acre park are assessed $4 for a 
10-pound bag. Navel oranges can be picked between December and April. Valencia 
oranges are ready in April, but this year's crop is small. Lemons are available 
year-round and a small pumpkin patch will be full of tricks and treats in 
October. Call for an appointment, (909) 593-2862. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Foothill Boulevard east from Los Angeles, turn left (north) on Wheeler 
Avenue, then turn right (east) on Via de Mansion Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 6. BETSY YOUNG ORCHARD 
</P>

 Betsy Young, an orchid hobbyist and member of the California Rare Fruit 
Growers' Assn., grows many unusual organic fruits, including sapote -- a light 
green fruit that tastes like pudding and sells for about 50 cents a pound -- 
and Persian mulberries, selling for about $1 a basket. Every Friday, Young 
opens a fruit stand in front of her house. Customers are also welcome to pick 
from the fruit trees, on Fridays only. Other seasonal produce: avocados, 
lemons, oranges, apples, persimmons, pineapple guavas, pomegranates and 
apricots. (818) 352-1366.

Boulevard. Go east to Wheatland Avenue and turn right. 
</P>
<P>
 7. ORCUTT RANCH 
</P>
<P>
 * 23600 Roscoe Blvd., West Hills 
</P>
<P>
 This 25-acre orange and grapefruit orchard is run by the Los Angeles 
Department of Parks and Recreation. You can pick your own fruit from 8 a.m. to 
4 p.m. July 9 and 10. The fruit will be about $2 a grocery bag. Call (818) 
883-6641 or (818) 883-8531.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY LINES UP BEHIND PLAN FOR LINEAR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to move ahead with plans to convert a 1.3-mile 
railroad right of way into a linear park complete with a bike and walking path. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote last week caps more than a decade of debate over what to do with the 
65-foot-wide sliver of land, located roughly between Culver Drive and Jeffrey 
Road in Northwood village. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's design was conceived with residents' help during a one-day seminar 
in January moderated by San Francisco landscape architect Lawrence Halprin. 
</P>
<P>
 With the council's approval of the preliminary plans, city officials will hire 
a consultant to draw more specific construction plans. Once those plans are 
completed, the City Council will decide how much money to allocate to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the park is expected to cost about $1.5 million. The council 
could order that the park be built right away or be developed in phases over 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently planned, the park would include a path down its center along with 
lamps, benches and trash cans. The path would be lined on each side by trees, 
grass and drought-resistant plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The land has been a contentious issue in Northwood for years. Residents 
successfully fought a proposal several years ago to turn the right of way into 
a regional bike path. 
</P>
<P>
 "After years of wrangling, we've come up with a plan that meets most of the 
concerns expressed by residents," said Councilwoman Paula Werner. "I think it's 
great that we've come this far." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCIL TO WEIGH FATE OF COMMUNITY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will decide next month whether to close a community center 
that houses a popular program for young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents pleaded with council members at a study session last week to keep open 
the Balearic Community Center, a former school rented by the city for $1 
yearly. The Newport-Mesa Unified School District, which owns the building, is 
seeking to raise the rent to market rate -- estimated by the district at 
$66,000 yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis said she is concerned the city would be spending too 
much for the community center with the rent increase. Programs at Balearic 
attracted about 350 people this winter, according to community services manager 
Keith Van Holt. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise and child-care programs are offered at the center, which the city has 
rented since 1977. City Manager Allan L. Roeder said the city is negotiating 
with the district over the lease, and the council is set to vote on the lease 
at the June 6 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women who said their children attend day-care classes at the center urged 
the council last week to continue to rent the center at 1975 Balearic Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hopeful that the city and the school district can find some ground in 
the middle to keep the early childhood program and to keep it at Balearic," 
said Christine Ludlow, whose son, Joe, 4, goes to the center twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludlow said she and other mothers have gathered more than 170 signatures from 
people who want to keep the early childhood program at the center. About 30 
people attended a recent council meeting to show support for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludlow said her son spends eight hours a week at the center learning social 
skills, games, and arts and crafts. About 80 children are enrolled in the 
program, Van Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council today will discuss the progress of lease negotiations in a closed 
session.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; DISTRICT GETS MORE THAN VOCAL SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private foundation has given the Fountain Valley School District $14,000 to 
bring back a vocal music program eliminated eight years ago because of budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really exciting. It's something we've lost and haven't had for some 
time," said Marc Ecker, assistant superintendent of administration-business. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant by the Fountain Valley Educational Foundation, a nonprofit group 
aimed at enhancing local education, will fund a choir program for students in 
fifth through eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Schneider, foundation executive director, said that while arts programs 
have been the first to be cut because of district budget constraints, "we feel 
the arts should be included for a well-rounded education." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak said the program will boost 
community pride and offer students a positive activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will give the community a chance to see the talent of our 
students," Sedlak said. "We've had to cut so many things, it's great to be able 
to add programs like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money will be used to hire Ted Reid, Fountain Valley High School's 
vocal music teacher, to direct the program. Reid, who has taught at the high 
school for eight years, recently took a group of his choir students to New York 
to perform at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since the district cut the vocal music program, Reid said, he has 
noticed that his first-year students don't have a background in music and must 
work harder to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we're going to have the chance to get kids interested in the 
activity, and they're going to be better prepared, and it'll make for 
better-quality work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The music program will begin in September and will be held after school. Reid 
said a districtwide chorale group will be formed that will meet at different 
schools during the year to give all students a chance to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker agreed that the program will "give kids an opportunity to perform and 
make the kids feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker said that when children are involved in arts programs, they tend to 
excel in academics as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong correlation that a person who plays the violin will also do 
well in math," he said.DEBRA CANO

HAWTHORNE MAN HELD IN SHOOTING AT LOT IN STANTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old Hawthorne resident was arrested in the fatal shooting of a Los 
Angeles man in a restaurant parking lot here early Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loc Ung Ho was booked in the Orange County Jail in connection with the death, 
said Lt. Jay Mendez of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to release the name of the victim pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said the victim died at West Anaheim Medical Center shortly after the 
1:50 a.m. shooting. Two security guards who witnessed the shooting, which took 
place in the parking lot of New Hong Kong Restaurant at 12177 Beach Blvd., 
chased the suspect and held him until sheriff's deputies arrived, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies recovered a handgun that they believe was used in the shooting, 
Mendez said.

<P>
 An East Los Angeles woman who rushed to help her dying son was wounded by the 
teen-agers suspected of killing him, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Rayas, 20, was stabbed to death on the sidewalk outside his home in 
the 100 block of South Record Street late Saturday. He was pronounced dead at 
East Los Angeles Doctors Hospital, sheriff's Deputy Britta Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rayas' mother, Maria Ramirez, 42, left the house to go to her son's side, 
she was stabbed twice by the attackers, who fled, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was treated at Santa Marta Hospital and released Sunday. Deputies were 
investigating the incident as gang-related.

HOTEL SPRINKLER SYSTEM SET OFF; BOY, 12, ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old boy was arrested Sunday for allegedly causing $25,000 damage to 
a high-rise hotel here when he held a match to a sprinkler head in one of the 
rooms, triggering the building's automatic sprinkler system, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, was detained by 
arson investigators shortly after the 10:22 a.m. incident at the Waterfront 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the boy was also responsible for starting small trash fires 
in the room he shared with his parents, who are out-of-town visitors. No damage 
was caused by those fires. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Huntington Beach Fire Department said smoke detectors on 
the hotel's sixth and seventh floors were activated at 10:22 a.m, causing about 
45 firefighters to rush to the hotel at 21000 Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Several rooms on the fifth, sixth and seven floors sustained water damage, but 
no one was injured. A hotel manager said no one was evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 An arson investigator later detained the boy after he noticed that water was 
gushing from a sprinkler in his room, a fire spokeswoman said.

SPEED ADDICTS AT HOME IN 'THE ROCK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police call it The Rock because of its relative isolation. Residents call it 
home because of its relaxed pace and affordable housing. And methamphetamine 
addicts from all over call it an easy place to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting District 1688, a semirural neighborhood at the base of the Verdugo 
Hills with a mix of modest single-family houses, new and old apartment 
buildings and a commercial strip along Foothill Boulevard, is the speed capital 
of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction is nothing new for Sunland-Tujunga, but recently the Los 
Angeles Police Department singled out RD 1688 in a series of violent-crime 
reports for its high level of narcotics activity as well as the numerous thefts 
addicts commit to support their habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no recent statistics were available to bolster the report's 
assessment of the region, it has also been identified by narcotics officers as 
one of the Valley's hot spots for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who patrol the area maintain that speed freaks are only a small 
percentage of Sunland-Tujunga's population, but they acknowledge that RD 1688's 
tranquillity is shattered by the users and sellers of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to look very hard; they're everywhere around here," said 
Officer John Smith, who walks a beat there. "And when you (arrest) a user, you 
are probably getting a burglar, too" because hard-core methamphetamine users 
need money for drugs but are usually too strung out to work. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost any day, speed users -- commonly called "tweakers" because of their 
trademark nervousness and paranoia -- troll the narrow streets off Tujunga 
Canyon Boulevard, between Commerce and Marcus avenues, for a fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Most snort or smoke the relatively inexpensive drug, which comes in powder or 
rock form, but some inject it after heating it into a liquid. Shooting it is 
particularly self-destructive, police say, because even in its liquid form 
methamphetamine has gobs that can pass through a syringe and into the 
bloodstream, rupturing veins. 
</P>
<P>
 In a mini-mall parking lot on Foothill Boulevard, a thin man with a nervous 
twitch attested to the drug's lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad," he said, claiming to have kicked his four-year habit the previous 
day. "But it's hard to stop. It's like, when you're high on it, you don't worry 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," he said, "I'm worrying." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents say Sunland-Tujunga once was the center of a thriving 
methamphetamine manufacturing industry that earned it the nickname of 
"Speedland." But police say the current drug problem is almost entirely based 
on sales and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only dealing with the small-time dealers and users out here," said 
Smith. "The labs are up in Palmdale or Temecula now." 
</P>
<P>
 The move, police say, was precipitated by a rash of housing and commercial 
developments that began to encroach on the previous seclusion of back-yard and 
kitchen drug-manufacturing operations. But ironically, it was some of the 
residents of those new apartment complexes who became the drug's clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the area with the most severe narcotics problem is centered around a 
cluster of apartment buildings along Commerce, Samoa and Pinewood avenues, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 At an abandoned house between two apartment complexes, Officer Jay Philips, 
the LAPD's senior lead officer in the area, points to signs that indicate the 
place has recently been an addict's hovel. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, its white paint cracked and peeling, is nearly empty, but dirty. On 
the floors of the front room and a bedroom are beer cans that have been cut at 
the bottom to serve as makeshift stoves for cooking speed or heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Calculators left on a kitchen counter have probably been stolen in a 
residential robbery, Philips deduces. A stained mattress on a dirty floor is 
likely where the occupants slept when their highs wore off. The non-working 
toilet is backed up, full of excrement and stinking. 
</P>
<P>
 At an apartment building next door, a man sits on a wall -- a drug dealer's 
lookout, Philips said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several minutes, the man watches, shifting his eyes from the cop to a 
window in an upstairs apartment. Finally, when Philips is interrupted by a 
passerby, the man disappears inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do," Philips said later. "We can't stop someone without 
suspicious cause. And just sitting there is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Philips, a 17-year law-enforcement veteran, has patrolled the area for about 
two years but has been the senior lead officer for only a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical dealers are not easy to catch, he explains, because they sell only to 
those they know. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers say The Rock's remoteness, plus the fact that a high percentage of 
people grow up there and never leave, has made Tujunga an insular place. For 
speed dealers and their customers, the isolation translates into full-blown 
paranoia about outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to move from here," Philips said. "There is a joke about 
tweakers . . . that none of them have ever gone south of the (Foothill Freeway) 
or east of Lowell Avenue," the border with Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers, Smith added, "have got lifelong customers. Their customers live 
here. They went to school together. They live next door to each other. The 
brother is married to the guy down the street's sister. . . . When a stranger 
comes around, they are automatically suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 But while dealers are hard to catch, users are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Although speed has gone mainstream -- even becoming popular with suburban 
teen-age girls seeking a diet aid -- in Sunland-Tujunga, the drug's users fit 
more closely with the drug's old stereotype as "blue-collar cocaine." They tend 
to be white men, often thin, who sport tattoos and drive motorcycles or fast 
cars with big engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on a street of single-family houses one afternoon, three police 
officers compared notes about how to spot a speed addict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look for the guy who is jittery, sweating a lot," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And whose face is covered with sores from scratching, and their teeth are bad 
because the drug eats the enamel off," said Eric Jones, his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they are very nervous, always looking around," said Philips. "And 
notorious for guns and being violent." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Smith: "And they have to have marijuana on them. . . . It's like a 
security blanket for them. They are so paranoid, they figure, 'If I leave it at 
home, someone's going to steal it, but if I take it with me, they can't."' 
</P>
<P>
 Philips said he is certain that speed is sold out of many of the area's 
businesses as well as apartment buildings and houses. He and his officers know 
the names and locations of these enterprises -- the problem is catching the 
sellers in the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment owners and managers say they, too, feel powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we can check out a person's character before they move in," 
said Rita Damwijk, manager of the 32-unit Samoan Apartments on Samoa Avenue. 
The complex had long been plagued with drug problems, she said, but both the 
building and the neighborhood have changed for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have never taken the job if the apartment had been run down and with 
drugs," she said. "I don't want people to think this is some kind of a raunchy 
place and not want to move in. It's just certain streets." Said Herbert Blinn, 
the building's owner: "The trouble is holding on to the good ones and getting 
rid of the bad ones. There's no way you can get rid of a drug dealer if he pays 
his rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when police officers approach an apartment building on Tujunga Canyon, 
two men who are sitting outside begin to whistle. Immediately, three or four 
open doors slam shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Philips said, most of the area is cooperative with law enforcement. 
There is an active neighborhood watch, and a recent community meeting with 
police attracted about 70 people, he said. "This community, these people up 
here are real pro-police." 
</P>
<P>
 The community's cooperation has dropped RD 1688 from being the Foothill 
Division's leader in burglaries of motor vehicles last year -- with hundreds of 
thefts -- to the scene of fewer than a dozen since the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves "would hit all the vehicles in an apartment parking garage," 
Philips said. "There's a problem when you have a lot of people living closer 
together . . . and 98% of the crime, not only here, but almost everywhere, 
revolves around drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Philips said Linda Nelson has been one of the most active members of the 
community since moving there about five months ago. When he drove to her house 
recently, she pointed out an apartment building across the street where she 
said there was a drug sale the night before. Next to it, she identified two 
young men in a red car as gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to Nelson's place, the tenants of half a dozen cottages have been 
evicted and the buildings are being remodeled. The location was so bad, police 
said, that a garage there served as a disassembly plant for stolen vehicles, 
whose parts were sold for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I moved up here, I had no sympathy for South-Central," Nelson said. 
"But now my heart bleeds for them. This is like living in South-Central L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Others disagree, saying that at least the drug dealing is not obvious. "They 
just do it among themselves, so no one really knows until the police show up," 
said a woman at the Hillhaven Apartments who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 She, like many others, said that despite the problems, most people like the 
area and want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of good things about this place," she said. "It's a good place, 
it has its moments. You see the police walking around and it makes you feel 
good."

BIG MONEY, BUT NO WEALTH OF CLUES ABOUT THE OWNERS; FINANCES: THE STATE IS 
HOLDING $1.4 BILLION IN UNCLAIMED ASSETS. O.C. RESIDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO $30 
MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 You know how it is: Things get hectic and pretty soon you've forgotten about 
that $50,000 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who lose your keys or forget where you park, take solace: 
About 100,000 Orange Countians have forgotten or abandoned savings accounts and 
property worth a combined $30 million, according to the State Controller's 
Office. In their owners' absence, every nickel has been turned over to State 
Controller Gray Davis for safekeeping. Or so the controller swears.  
</P>
<P>
 "A good deal of money is awaiting a phone call in Sacramento," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Marcus, if you're out there, there's $42,431 waiting for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Rachmat, there's $113,233 with your name on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Renshaw had a tidy $33,803 the state was holding until recently, when 
a reporter contacted her. "Oh dear," said the 67-year-old Fullerton widow, who 
has lived comfortably off of her late husband's insurance policy. "Who do I see 
about getting it? I'm not starving, but I'd like to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Renshaw is not alone: About 2.6 million people and businesses in California 
have, collectively, abandoned or forgotten $1.4 billion in unclaimed loot, 
nearly the equivalent of the annual budget of North Dakota. That includes 
dormant bank accounts, stock, utility refunds, unused gift certificates, and 
uncashed paychecks and cashier's checks. Only the state of New York has a 
bigger kitty of unclaimed booty. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials believe California has the highest number of abandoned 
accounts containing five- and six-figure sums. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest unclaimed account in the state, a bank account worth $160,973, 
belongs to Lu Rong, whose last known address was in Monterey Park in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to wonder what happened there," said Eddward Fong of the State 
Controller's Office. "How does a guy forget about $160,000?" 
</P>
<P>
 All of which underscores why California passed unclaimed property laws in the 
first place: to prevent banks and financial institutions from quietly pocketing 
such forgotten funds -- a practice state officials say was common 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, banks and other financial institutions must turn over to the state 
accounts that have been inactive for at least three years. The time limit used 
to be seven years, but state officials changed the statute a few years ago, 
they say, because in today's transient society the trail to rightful owners can 
grow cold quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who are owed money have small sums coming to them -- as little as 
$25 -- but several hundred people are owed more than $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the property includes the contents of abandoned safe-deposit 
boxes. Among the loot: a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth, a signed Beatles 
picture and a Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reasons why the property and money go unclaimed are better than 
others, but all would likely seem implausible to many who cannot afford to lose 
track of 50 bucks, let alone 50 grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the owner has simply forgotten about the account and moved without 
leaving a forwarding address. Sometimes, the owner has died and the heirs do 
not know about the property. In other cases, the person has not moved at all, 
but is the victim of senility or dottiness or the sheer bustle of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get busy, I guess," Fong said. "It is somewhat of a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the state is able to return only a fifth of what it takes in each 
year in unclaimed property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the controller's office used to search for owners by taking out 
newspaper advertisements and cross-checking public records, that effort has 
been the victim of the state's budget crunch. Today, only a single letter is 
dispatched to the owner's last known address, explaining where the money is and 
how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often, though, the state does hit pay dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, a 93-year-old widow who had forgotten about her holdings for more 
than 20 years received $127,000 in cash and bonds after she was found living in 
an Oakland residential hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a former prisoner of war who had more than $100,000 coming to her 
from a savings account was located in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the unclaimed assets are kept in perpetuity for the missing owners. 
In practice, the money flows into the state general fund and helps bankroll 
government activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are constantly reminding the Legislature, this is not tax revenue, this is 
not oil revenue, this is people's money," Davis said. "If they claim it, we 
have to give it back to them, plus interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Even names of the wealthy and well-known have appeared on the unclaimed assets 
list. In 1988, former President Ronald Reagan had $3,492 left over from an old 
campaign account. Onetime U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III had $9,095 from a 
bank account left by his late father. Entertainer Bob Hope had $16,000 in an 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all of them proved easier to locate. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Orange Countians Dahlen Martin and Renshaw, the Fullerton 
widow, were easy enough to find: Both still live at their last known addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Renshaw said her account -- $33,803 in stock -- dates back to the 1960s when 
her husband, a doctor, purchased partial ownership in a hospital. After he died 
in a plane crash in 1973, she simply lost track of the stock. He had a sizable 
life insurance policy, she said, and "besides, I had two little kids to raise. 
I didn't really have time to deal with it. I just kind of put it aside and 
thought, well, I can take care of it later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed it would be turned over to the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Controller's Office took possession of the unclaimed stock in 1987 
after the hospital was sold. Over the years, Renshaw had misplaced the 
paperwork on the stock deal and eventually forgot about it. In a recent 
interview, she recalled being contacted about the stock's status three years 
ago, but said she was never able to follow up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been desperate for it. But the way things are going up," the 
retired schoolteacher said, referring to the cost of living, "I could use it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Martin, a Santa Ana businessman, his unclaimed account of 
$26,101 also dates back to a business transaction in the 1960s. He said he 
bought 1,700 shares of stock at $12 a share in a fledgling electronics company. 
Several years later, when the company was dissolved, he shrugged it off as a 
loss and carried on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought, well, maybe someday it'll show up and maybe it won't," he 
said, "although $26,000 was pretty important to me back in the time it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds were turned over to the State Controller's Office in 1988. Martin 
vaguely recalled being contacted a few years ago by someone who offered to get 
the money back for him for a 10% cut -- likely, someone from an heir-finder 
firm, which attempts to locate people on unclaimed property lists. But Martin 
did not take up the offer, nor did he follow up on it. "I didn't know what it 
was worth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being told how much he had coming to him and where it was, Martin said 
he would make sure the funds were returned to him right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure my wife and nine kids can figure out something to do with it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Fong said both Martin and Renshaw had recently contacted the State 
Controller's Office and that it would take only a few weeks to get them their 
money -- "as soon as we determine that is in fact them." 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the catch," Fong said, "you've got to prove that you're the person 
we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the odds may be higher than presumed. For those older than 30 
who have lived in California for any length of time, the state says the chances 
are one in 10 that it has money for them -- odds, the controller's office 
points out, that are considerably better than the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds improbable -- or so this reporter thought -- until the state 
searched its unclaimed property list and found under his name a four-figure sum 
from an old bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount: $27.83. Unclaimed Riches 
</P>
<P>
 About $30 million in unclaimed accounts and property awaits Orange County 
residents. All the money has been turned over to the state controller for 
safekeeping. If you think the state is holding any property that belongs to 
you, call (800) 992-4647 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. How

OFFICER KILLED IN TRAINING REMINISCENT OF O.C. FATALITY

<P>
 A police reserve officer was killed Sunday when a gun accidentally discharged 
during a training exercise, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the Palo Alto officer was not immediately released in the 
case, which was similar to the fatal Christmas Day shooting of an Orange County 
sheriff's deputy in a Lake Forest shopping center parking lot last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Torin Fischer said the Palo Alto officer was participating in a 
role-playing exercise and apparently was accidentally shot by another team 
member. The victim was playing a "bad guy," Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 3 p.m. at an Amtrak Station where the training 
exercise took place, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was pronounced dead at a Gilroy hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers from the Mountain View, Palo Alto and Los Altos police 
departments were training in preparation for this summer's World Cup soccer 
games at Stanford, police said. An investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was 33 years old and had been with the Palo Alto Police Department 
since Jan. 13, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County incident, Deputy Brian P. Scanlan fatally shot colleague 
Darryn Leroy Robins, 30, as the two deputies ran through a mock car-stop, with 
Robins playing the suspect and Scanlan the arresting officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan told investigators he fired accidentally after he was startled to see 
Robins pull a handgun from the visor of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County grand jury refused to issue a criminal indictment in the 
shooting. U.S. Justice Department investigators are reviewing the case to 
determine whether grounds exist to indict Scanlan under criminal civil rights 
law.

REWARDS ARE A LURE, BUT FEW COME FORWARD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: MOST CASH OFFERINGS 
ARE NEVER CLAIMED. FEAR OF REPRISAL, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MAY PLAY A ROLE.

<P>
 The brutal slayings of Hee Wan Yoo, his wife and two children in their Granada 
Hills home over two years ago left investigators struggling to solve a crime 
without suspects, witnesses or motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to generate leads, the Los Angeles City Council offered a $25,000 
reward for information that would help solve the slayings. Although the reward 
was doubled by Yoo family relatives and then renewed last month after it 
expired, it has remained unclaimed. Concrete leads have yet to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 But unclaimed rewards are not unique. About 80% of the rewards offered by Los 
Angeles city and county officials over the past two years expired without being 
claimed, according to city and county records, begging the question: Why don't 
rewards work more often? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low success rate, most law enforcement officials still believe in 
the concept, saying rewards provide a valuable incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We often have someone who is wavering about whether they want to share their 
information, and (rewards) are just an added incentive," said Los Angeles 
Police Lt. Al Moen, head of the department's major crimes division. 
</P>
<P>
 But some police and government officials say privately that rewards are not a 
reliable crime-fighting tool. Instead, they are seen as a tool of the 
politicians and a way for the grieving families to feel they are helping to 
solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times it means something to the family," said one local homicide 
investigator. "They feel more is being done if a reward is being offered." 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards have been a staple of the American justice system as far back as the 
1800s, when posters pinned to saloon doors offered rewards for the capture of 
train robbers and cattle rustlers -- dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Today most rewards are offered by government agencies or relatives of the 
victims for particularly heinous crimes. Television has even gotten into the 
act with a slew of programs that re-enact crimes and offer rewards for callers 
with information. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reward programs, such as the city of Los Angeles' graffiti reward 
program, are highly successful. Since 1991, the city's program has paid out 
$85,500 in rewards to more than 100 people who have helped capture graffiti 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 But because such rewards are offered on an ongoing basis, it is difficult to 
compare their success rate with programs that offer rewards for a particular 
crime and for a limited time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 24 months, the Los Angeles City Council paid out 10 rewards, 
totaling $190,000, according to city records. But during the same period, 63 
rewards, totaling $1.5 million, expired without being claimed, the records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered by the county Board of Supervisors don't fare much better. 
Five rewards, totaling $55,000, have been paid out by the county in the past 
two years, while 20 rewards, totaling about $206,000, expired without being 
collected, according to county records. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, they are never claimed," said Georgette Dame, a supervisor 
of the county reward program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered by the city normally expire 60 days after they are offered; 
county rewards expire after 90 days. But the rewards can be extended or renewed 
at the request of a county supervisor or City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say there are many explanations for the low 
collection rate of such rewards. The main reason, they say, may be that 
witnesses or other sources of information are afraid of reprisals if they call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the best sources of information are often accomplices in a crime or 
friends and family of the criminals -- people who have much to lose by 
providing police with information. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman said rewards often don't work 
because "you are trying to entice the shady person, the associate of the 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason may be that rewards are often only offered for the most 
difficult crimes to solve, such as murders. According to the most recent 
statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the percentage of 
homicides solved throughout the nation dropped from 90% in 1960 to 65% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, head of the FBI's office in Ventura County, said no amount of 
reward will help if no one has information about the crime except for the 
criminals themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be that a crime is committed by one or two people and they have kept 
their mouths shut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, Auer said, law-abiding citizens with information do call police, 
regardless of whether a reward is offered. He said the FBI gets dozens of tips 
daily on bank robberies but "not more than one in 20 asks if there is a 
reward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, we have not seen that rewards have been a significant motivating 
concern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the low success rate, law enforcement officials say, is 
that the news of the rewards may never get to the people most likely to have 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the people with information on crimes seldom read newspapers or watch 
television news to learn about the rewards, said Hubert Williams, president of 
the Police Foundation, a research and support agency for law enforcement 
officials in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to go from bar to bar, for example, and passed around 
information, you would get better results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Board of Supervisors or the City Council offers a reward, a small, 
standardized ad is placed in at least one local newspaper, but usually for only 
one day. One county official described the ads as "tiny . . . very small." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, an elected official will issue a news release about the reward or 
will hold a press conference to generate more interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent rewards that were successful include $10,000 given last month by the 
county Board of Supervisors to a teen-age boy who helped authorities identify a 
woman who set a blaze during the April, 1992, riots. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the supervisors paid out $12,500 each to two men who helped police 
identify the man who shot and killed Deputy Sheriff Nelson Yamamoto during a 
gun battle in Walnut Park. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, police cracked a 2-year-old murder case of a Taft High School 
student who was attacked by a group of youths as he waited for a bus. A suspect 
was arrested after he began bragging that he committed the crime and that he 
had a $25,000 price on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25,000 was a reward posted by the Los Angeles City Council shortly after 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the Los Angeles City Council handed out a $25,000 reward to a person 
who provided information that resulted in a successful prosecution in the 
murder of 7-year-old Kanita Haily, who was gunned down in a drive-by shooting 
while playing baseball in the Imperial Courts housing project in Watts in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, rewards go unclaimed. The list of crimes for which 
rewards are offered reads like an obituary listing for mothers, fathers, 
children, police officers and civic leaders whose lives ended in violence and 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, county supervisors voted three times to renew a $10,000 reward 
for information on the slaying of Sheriff's Sgt. George Arthur, who was shot 
and killed in 1985 as he left work at the Men's Central Jail. The crime is 
still unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, City Councilman Hal Bernson asked the council to renew a $25,000 
reward for information to help identify the killer of Laurie Myles, who was 
slain in September, 1993, as she headed to a Bible study class in Northridge to 
pick up her teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite extensive publicity and an additional $7,500 in private contributions 
to the reward offer, Myles' killer has yet to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders of the Yoo family -- Hee Wan Yoo, his wife, Gyung Jin, and their 
children Pauline, 6, and Kenneth, 4 -- generated a great deal of fear and 
puzzlement in the residential community of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as this month, investigators on the case held a news conference to 
urge the public for information to help solve the crime. Cash for Information 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city and county governments regularly offer cash rewards for 
information that can solve particularly troubling crimes. But the offers 
usually expire within two to three months. The following data for the past 24 
months shows how many rewards were offered, how many were collected and how 
many expired without being collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Council: 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered: 77; total: $1.7 million 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards collected: 10; total: $190,000 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards that have expired: 63; total: $1.5 million 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors: 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered: 28; total: $236,000 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards collected: 5; total: $55,000 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards that have expired (including some offered prior to May, 1991): 20; 
total: $206,000

A HISTORY DENIED; STUDENTS MEET TO ILLUMINATE THE BLACK EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Their classroom assignment took them back to Egypt, AD 1324, when West African 
ruler Mansa Musa traveled through North Africa leading thousands on a 
pilgrimage to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were to imagine themselves as modern-day reporters transported to 
ancient Cairo and write a story about the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had 500 slaves with him, and each one carried golden staffs weighing six 
pounds," said a student who summarized the pilgrimage for her group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" another student asked about Musa's extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he wanted to travel in class! He was the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was another exuberant meeting of a group of seventh- and eighth-graders 
at the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies, where students have been 
gathering for two hours after school once a week since mid-March. Their goal: 
to learn black history -- a subject they say they're not sufficiently taught in 
their regular history classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a little bit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, but 
basically, African-American history really isn't focused on," said Niamah 
Adams, an eighth-grader and member of the study group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the magnet school has a diverse student population composed of 
Latinos, whites, African Americans and immigrant students from countries 
throughout the world, the school continues, like most others, to teach both 
American and world history from a Eurocentric perspective, said students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators maintain that such teaching perpetuates lies and half-truths. 
</P>
<P>
 "History, warts and flowers and all, needs to be told truthfully," said James 
E. Turner, professor of African American studies and political sociology at 
Cornell University. "A national denial about critical parts of history is 
constantly being passed on to children." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an old complaint among minority students and teachers. But at the Center 
for Enriched Studies, students and teachers have resolved to do something about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time the students began meeting, a group of eight teachers 
formed the Multicultural Awareness Coalition. Their first project is to create 
a resource center made up of clothing, books, pictures, flags and any item 
donated by students that represent their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition chairman and history teacher Greg Delahoussaye hopes that teachers 
will borrow the items and display them in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make all the students feel that they're represented and they're 
important," Delahoussaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Delahoussaye has received a shirt from Nigeria, books about Africa, a 
sombrero and one particularly unlikely exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "One young man brought me pupusas from El Salvador. He said, 'I want to bring 
this for you so you can know me a little better,' " Delahoussaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a recent faculty training session where attempts were made to present a 
multicultural approach to teaching, some teachers reacted negatively to the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a few who, from my perspective, weren't pleased with what was 
going on," Delahoussaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Delahoussaye said, he ended up challenging a lecturer invited 
by the school. The Middle Eastern woman remarked that Egypt was in the Middle 
East, not Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the meeting was over, I quietly told her that there is a different 
perspective," Delahoussaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District mandates that history be taught from a 
multicultural perspective, but district officials say they lack the funds to 
retrain teachers and buy textbooks and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in the after-school group say they aren't waiting on the 
district. Many are members of the African American Student Union who last year 
asked their faculty adviser, Lisa Lewis, if they could have a study group 
during their lunch hour. After a few sessions, Lewis challenged them to meet 
for two hours after school, where real learning could take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching from textbooks and workbooks seldom used in public schools -- books 
like "1999 Facts About Blacks: A Sourcebook of African American Accomplishment" 
-- Lewis assigns homework and quizzes the students during each session. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said that the school's student body, made up of fourth- through 
12th-graders, provides her with a unique opportunity to work with various age 
groups. Though composed of seventh- and eighth-graders now, the group has 
included older students, and Lewis is planning to start another group for 
younger grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I have the advantage where I can work with the young ones and bring them 
up," said Lewis, a science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The study sessions are a mixture of African American history lessons and 
sharing about what it means to be black. One afternoon, students expressed 
their anger at racial stereotypes hurled at them from people of other races and 
even from other African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't act like her, she doesn't accept me," 13-year-old Elan Magana said 
about another black student. "If you don't walk with an attitude, talk with an 
attitude, you are not considered black." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is acting black, what is dressing black and what is talking black?" 
asked another student in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions also have a refreshing energy. In that same session, the students 
flung their arms skyward and flailed their hands from side to side, vying to be 
called on to give the name of the man who published the first African American 
periodical (David Ruggles) or the first man (Thomas Cox Allen) to pilot a plane 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, they shouted each other down, the seventh- and eighth-graders 
dividing into competing camps. In a friendly display of victory over her 
competition, eighth-grader Taneya Gethers rose from her seat, stomped across 
the room, got in her rival's face and proclaimed herself the queen of 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Taneya correctly answered the most questions and was rewarded with 
a yellow, black and green bumper sticker emblazoned with the words "Nelson 
Mandela A Freedom Fighter." She proudly accepted her prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Though all but one of the students who regularly attend Lewis' study group are 
African Americans, other students and teachers recognize that black history is 
not just for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, during Black History Month, students at the school celebrated 
African American Dress-Up Day, implemented three years ago by the district. 
Students and teachers wore traditional African clothing or the colors red, 
black and green -- colors proclaimed by Marcus Garvey, Pan-Africanist leader 
from the early part of the century -- to symbolize black nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 As approximately 15 African-American students gathered on the school lawn to 
commemorate the day, several students stood and watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the clustered white students said they know little about 
African-American history. A few said they feel that history is taught from a 
Eurocentric perspective. None had dressed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time we learn about (black history) is during Black History Month," 
said Nicholas Levendosky, a 15-year-old 10th-grader. "During the European 
Renaissance, we learned about what they ate and how they dressed, but we never 
learned about how blacks ate and dressed. If we learn black history, we learn 
it from TV and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators believe that teaching an accurate account of history beginning 
in elementary school would lessen racial tensions that erupt later on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If children learn from the very beginning that all people played a critical 
role, that ordinary things -- like ink and sugar refining and the traffic light 
and the gas mask and blood plasma -- were made a part of our world by people 
who were black -- they might possibly look at each other in a more 
de-racialized way," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning historical truths later in life might be upsetting for both whites 
and blacks, Turner said, but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "If whites wait to learn later on, they become more resentful because they 
perceive it as undermining the truth as they know it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks who are disturbed by some historical facts, he said, wonder angrily why 
they were never taught such information before, particularly the motivation 
behind such deception. If you've been taught, for example, that Abraham Lincoln 
always wanted to free slaves, it's eye-opening or even disheartening to learn 
that he said he would allow slavery to continue if it meant he could preserve 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cleveland High School in Reseda, where American history is taught from a 
multicultural perspective and in conjunction with a unit on race in America, 
some white students said they experienced a double dose of resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that learning (the truth) this late -- it came as more of a shock, 
and I think if I was introduced to it early, it might not have been so hard to 
deal with," said 18-year-old senior Tasha Wedeen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't know how much power white people really had and how good of a 
position I'm in because I'm white," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasha said that students of other races sometimes directed their anger toward 
whites when painful episodes in history were discussed. When studying the civil 
rights and Black Power movements of the '50s and '60s, Tasha and her classmates 
related those struggles to the trauma of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Although 
tensions flared during the discussions, Tasha said the conflict stayed in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She credits her teacher, Chris Miller, with skillful handling of the 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racial conflict at some level is going to happen anyway," Miller said. 
"Unless there's a pre-established basis of communication where there's trust, 
there will be polarization and people won't listen to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my class, they begin to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers like those in the Multicultural Awareness Coalition at the Center for 
Enriched Studies are working toward the same kind of environment for their 
students. Delahoussaye said he is hopeful that the students will soon have the 
opportunity to study American history from diverse perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, however, don't share his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U. S. educational system never was, nor is it ever, going to try to 
institute programs on the mass scale to define what African-American culture 
is," said Stuart Shine, a senior and president of the African American Student 
Union at the school. "African-American students are going to have to start 
that."

DOG DAY AFTERNOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARKES, For The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Up in Laurel Canyon, just below Mulholland Drive and above Studio City, is a 
little piece of dog heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-acre Laurel Canyon Park, located west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, is 
the only public park in Los Angeles where dogs are exempt from the city's leash 
laws from 7 to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to sundown daily.Dogs are welcome at 
other times but must be leashed. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday afternoon, 50 or so dogs had free rein at the park. Some 
chased balls or Frisbees and others played together, running in packs while 
their owners stood around socializing in their own right. On a sunny day, as 
many as 100 dogs can be found romping around unrestrained. 
</P>
<P>
 A doggie drinking fountain is available, as are key pieces of equipment in a 
dog park -- pooper scoopers. They stand against numerous trash cans posted with 
signs that read, "Please pick up after your dog."

FESTIVAL HONORS OUTSTANDING RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 300 people turned out Sunday to watch line dancers and hear 
country-Western music during a quake-delayed festival to honor outstanding 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Chamber of Commerce had scheduled a black-tie-optional banquet 
for Feb. 25 at the Marriott Hotel. But the ceremony had to be delayed because 
of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was in the mood to celebrate then," said Marge Russo, chairwoman of 
the event and president of Russo Realty in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many residents acted heroically during the earthquake, the chamber 
felt compelled to also honor them at the hoedown-style festival, held on the 
Cal State Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Joe Jordan of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire 
Division was one of several officers recognized. Jordan, a 24-year veteran, was 
asleep at his Northridge Meadows apartment when the temblor hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife tells me I pulled stucco off the walls trying to get to her, but I 
don't remember it," said Jordan, whom the chamber named Detective of the Year. 
Although Jordan said he doesn't remember much about that night, he has a vague 
memory of helping out an elderly man at the apartment complex, where 16 people 
died in collapsed units. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to honoring outstanding citizens, money raised from "Celebration 
Northridge on the Rebound" will benefit the Chamber of Commerce, the Northridge 
Hospital Foundation, Devonshire Division PALS and the CSUN Memorial Scholarship 
Fund in memory of two students who died during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson contacted the chamber about holding the 
celebration at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, CSUN has been a major resource in the community, but there 
haven't been the kind of joint activities between the community and the 
university," Wilson said. "This is a symbolic example of that partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 Under rain-swollen skies, line dancers, the ACME All-West Gunfighters and the 
Chad Watson Band entertained afternoon festival-goers.

 An elderly Palmdale man was killed Sunday after he drove his car in front of a 
teen-age boy's oncoming car at an intersection, according to Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Richman, 72, died at the scene of the 8:20 a.m. collision at the 
intersection of 40th Street East and Avenue S, said Lt. Daniel Castillo of the 
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo said Richman halted his 1973 Mercury at a stop sign on 40th Street 
East. But he then drove in front of an oncoming Ford Mustang driven by a 
17-year-old boy on Avenue S, which did not have a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mustang struck the Mercury in the driver's door, killing Mr. Richman 
instantly," Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the speed of the vehicles was unknown and the accident remains under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was treated at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center for minor injuries 
and released, Castillo added. He was not cited because he had the right of way 
at the intersection.

DEPUTIES DETONATE 3 FLARES IN BOMB SCARE

 Sheriff's deputies briefly evacuated a fast-food restaurant and stopped 
traffic near a shopping center Sunday morning after finding what they thought 
were dynamite sticks in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected explosives turned out to be railroad flares. 
</P>
<P>
 Three flares wrapped in electrical tape and a three-foot fuse were discovered 
at about 6:30 a.m. in the parking lot west of a McDonald's restaurant at the 
intersection of Soledad Canyon and Bouquet Canyon roads, said Sgt. Mike Becker 
of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. The parking lot also services a 
Kmart and several other businesses in a separate shopping complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said they have no motive or suspects in the incident, but 
they believe the flares were intended to scare people. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the restaurant said they inspected the flares and called the 
sheriff's station after a customer found them lying next to a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of nudged it with my foot," said Brian Cappelletty, assistant manager 
of the restaurant. "I didn't know what it was. Nothing happened, so we went 
back in and waited for the police to arrive." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies closed the drive-through lane of the restaurant and cleared the 
parking lot for about 50 yards around the flares, but allowed customers into 
the restaurant through the north entrance until arson and explosives deputies 
arrived at about 8:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Howard Rechtschaffen placed six 50-pound bags of compost around the 
flares to minimize possible blast damage. The restaurant and an area 100 yards 
around the bags were then evacuated while deputies halted traffic on Soledad 
Canyon and Bouquet Canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The flares were detonated at about 9:15 a.m. without incident, using an 
explosive device set off from a distance by remote control.

 Two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies remained hospitalized Sunday night 
after their patrol car collided with a power pole while they were responding to 
an emergency call the night before, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday on northbound Bouquet 
Canyon Road just before Centurion Way, said Lt. Robert Elson of the Santa 
Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station.Deputies closed the road for about four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the closure was due to the investigation of the accident," Elson 
said. "There was also some damage to the pole and electrical lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Richard Phares was driving at high speed on Bouquet Canyon Road with 
his partner, Max Godinez, when he lost control of the patrol car for unknown 
reasons and crashed into the center divider, according to sheriff's officials. 
The vehicle traveled across the road and over the right shoulder, hitting the 
power pole. 
</P>
<P>
 David Dill stopped and helped Phares radio for help. Firefighters used the 
jaws of life device to remove Phares before transporting both deputies to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia.

HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT ON ROAD TO FISCAL RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two years under the watchful eye of the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education, the once-bankrupt Antelope Valley Union High School District will 
soon regain its independence. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this month, the school district expects to make its final 
payment on an $8-million loan from the county that has allowed it to stay 
afloat the last 24 months. And at the end of June, the fiscal adviser the 
county superintendent assigned to the school district will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no less than a miracle that we're out of this thing in two years," said 
Billy Pricer, school board president. 
</P>
<P>
 But county education officials warned that the jubilation should be tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 The district needs to move slowly in restoring the teaching, staff and 
administrative jobs and programs that were eliminated or scaled back during the 
fiscal crisis. Otherwise, the budget could again be overburdened, said Deborah 
Simons, business advisory services director for the education office. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Miller, the fiscal adviser assigned by the county superintendent in 
February, 1992, to oversee the district's day-to-day operations, said one of 
the greatest problems the district will face as it completes its financial 
recovery is psychological. There will be "a lot of pressures." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Hedgecock, president of the union representing the district's maintenance 
workers, security officers, secretaries and other support staff, is among those 
putting on the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedgecock and his counterpart from the teachers union have monitored the 
district's spending and say they are anxious to see the district begin to 
restore the 140 or so jobs that were cut or not filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long road and a hard road," Hedgecock said. "I think we're on the 
road to better and brighter things." 
</P>
<P>
 Simons told the board last week that once the loan is repaid, the board must 
decide on some priorities. Among the things that need to be considered: 
reducing class sizes, improving campus security and restoring staff positions 
as funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Con Oamek, the district's assistant superintendent of business services, said 
that in developing the 1994-95 budget, "we're trying to be very conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial problems were first discovered in the 12,400-student district more 
than two years ago and blossomed into a $14-million shortfall, the result of 
poor spending and revenue projections, overly optimistic enrollment growth 
estimates and substantial deficit spending for several years in a row, 
according to the county education office. 
</P>
<P>
 A major factor in the district's financial recovery, according to the county, 
were the salary and benefit reductions, which included a 7% salary cut 
negotiated with employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county education office will relinquish its close oversight of 
the high school district, it will still pay attention to the district's 
finances, Simons said. The district will have to provide periodic status 
reports to the county education office, which also will make regular visits to 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Kenneth Shelton, assistant superintendent of business services for the 
county education office, applauded district officials for what they have done 
to ensure the financial recovery of the district.

MOTORIST'S TIP LEADS TO 3 ARRESTS AFTER SHOOTOUT OVER POKER GAME 
</P>

 Three Canyon Country men suspected of being involved in an incident in which 
shots were fired into an occupied house where they had been playing poker 
earlier were arrested after a motorist with a cellular phone tipped off 
sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberto Garcia, 21, and his brother, Ramon, 25, were arrested at their home 
without incident for allegedly shooting at a rural home in the 16100 block of 
Sierra Highway at about 7:10 p.m., resulting in a shootout with a man inside, 
said Lt. Robert Elson of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. A third 
man who authorities said drove the suspects to the house, Martin Rico 
Hernandez, 30, also of Canyon Country, was arrested at about 7:30 p.m. Saturday 
after deputies spotted his bullet-ridden car near Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries occurred during the shooting, which took place 10 minutes after 
the three men got into an argument with their hosts about winnings during a 
poker game and left the house, said Sgt. Bruce Sonnenblick. 
</P>
<P>
 A man inside the house began shooting at the two suspects with a rifle "with 
the intent to protect his friends and family," Sonnenblick said. The Garcia 
brothers fled for Hernandez's Ford Thunderbird after an exchange of gunfire and 
the trio drove away. 
</P>
<P>
 A motorist called the sheriff's station a short time later on his cellular 
phone asking if deputies were searching for a car with a window shot out, 
according to sheriff's officials. The motorist stayed on the phone, providing 
deputies with directions until they spotted the car near the intersection of 
Soledad and Bouquet canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies stopped the car about half a mile later at Saugus Speedway and 
arrested Hernandez, the sole occupant of the vehicle. A 9-millimeter handgun 
believed to have been used in the shooting was found in the car, Sonnenblick 
said. The Garcia brothers were arrested a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men are in custody on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and 
shooting at an inhabited dwelling. Hernandez is being held in lieu of $70,000 
bail; the Garcia brothers are being held on $250,000 bail each.

FOR THE RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clarification -- In a May 9 article on the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
trombonist Ralph Sauer said that he was leaving the orchestra at the end of the 
season "to pursue other interests." Ernest Fleischmann, the orchestra's 
executive vice president and managing director, has said that his subsequent 
quote did not apply to Sauer or any other specific individual.
